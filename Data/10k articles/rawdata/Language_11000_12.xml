An '''all-points bulletin''' ('''APB''') is a [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] issued from any  [[List of United States state and local law enforcement agencies|American]] or [[List of law enforcement agencies in Canada|Canadian]] law enforcement agency to its personnel, or to other law enforcement agencies. It typically contains information about a wanted [[suspect]] who is to be arrested or a [[person of interest]], for whom law enforcement officers are to look. They are usually dangerous or missing persons. As used by American police, the term dates to at least 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=APB |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An all-points bulletin can also be known as a '''BOLO''' or '''BOL''', which stands for "be on (the) look-out". Such an alert may also be called a '''lookout''' or '''ATL''' ("attempt to locate").

==Other countries==
A similar, longer acronym used by Australian law enforcement is '''KALOF''' or '''KLO4''' (for "'''keep a look-out for'''"). The United Kingdom uses a similar system known as the '''all-ports warning''' or '''APW''', which circulates a suspect's description to airports, ports and international railway stations to detect an offender or suspect leaving the country. Because of the great numbers of commuters at such places, British police forces often prefer to contact specific airports, ports or stations and circulate descriptions individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policespecials.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=47046&amp;st=0&amp;gopid=927104&amp; |title=All Points Bulletin/All Ports Warning |publisher=Police Specials |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519011808/http://www.policespecials.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=47046&amp;st=0&amp;gopid=927104&amp; |archivedate=2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas of Caesarea''' ({{lang-el|Ἀνδρέας Καισαρείας}}; 563 – 637) was a [[Greek people|Greek]] theological writer and [[bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia]]. [[Karl Krumbacher]] assigned him to the first half of the sixth century. He is variously placed by other scholars, from the fifth to the ninth century. However, today it is unquestionable that his life spanned the late sixth/early seventh centuries.

== Works ==

His principal work is a commentary on the [[Book of Revelation]] (''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'' vol. 106, cols. 215–458 and 1387–94) and is the oldest Greek patristic commentary on that book of the Bible. The very first Greek commentary on Revelation barely predates Andrew's work and is attributed to "Oikoumenios." [[Œcumenius|Oikoumenios]] is not a recognized Father of the Church. Therefore, Andrew of Caesarea's work is correctly identified as the earliest Greek Patristic commentary on the Apocalypse. Most subsequent Eastern Christian commentators of the Book of Revelation have drawn heavily upon Andrew and his commentary, which was preserved in nearly 100 complete Greek manuscripts, as well in translation in Armenian, Georgian, and Slavonic manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Barry|editor1-last=Kazhdan|editor1-first=Alexander P.|title=The Oxford dictionary of Byzantium|date=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-504652-8|page=92|chapter=Andrew, archbishop of Caesarea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew's most important contribution was that he preserved many existing Eastern traditions associated with Revelation, both oral and written. His commentary was so influential that it preserved a specific text type for Revelation, known as the Andreas type.

An unpublished study of the work, including an English translation, was made as a thesis by Dr. Eugenia Constantinou in 2008. The English translation of Andrew's commentary has been published by Catholic University of America Press as part of the Fathers of the Church series and became available in November 2011. In 2011 the Catholic University of America published Dr. Constantinou's study as [https://www.amazon.com/Commentary-Apocalypse-Fathers-Church-Patristic/dp/0813201233#reader_0813201233 ''Commentary on the Apocalypse (Fathers of the Church Patristic Series)''] In 2013 the Catholic University of America published Dr. Constantinou's study as [https://www.amazon.com/Guiding-Blessed-End-Apocalypse-Commentary/dp/0813221145 ''Guiding to a Blessed End: Andrew of Caesarea and His Apocalypse Commentary in the Ancient Church''] Dr. Constantinou's original 2008 PhD thesis, Quebec: Université Laval 508 page manuscript is available from theses.ulaval.ca as a pdf [http://archimede.bibl.ulaval.ca/archimede/fichiers/25095/25095.pdf '' Andrew of Caesarea and the Apocalypse in the Ancient Church of the East'']

'''Anusaaraka''' is an ''English to Indian'' language accessing (translation) software, which employs algorithms derived from [[Pāṇini|Panini's]] Ashtadhyayi (Grammar rules).&lt;ref&gt;http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/~anusaaraka/PUBLICATIONS/rsvp_symposium.html RSVP Symposium&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/downloads/nlpbook/nlp-panini.pdf Panini&lt;/ref&gt; The software is being developed by the [[Chinmaya Mission|Chinmaya International Foundation (CIF)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinfo.org/Anusaaraka.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053747/http://www.chinfo.org/Anusaaraka.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }} www.chinfo.org/Anusaaraka.html&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad]] (IIIT-H) and the [http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in University of Hyderabad (Department of Sanskrit Studies)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiit.net/research/ltrc/Anusaaraka/anu_home.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717032552/http://www.iiit.net/research/ltrc/Anusaaraka/anu_home.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anusaaraka is viewed as the fusion of traditional advanced Indian [[shastra]]s and advanced contemporary technologies.

Anusaaraka is intended to allow users to access text in any [[languages of India|Indian language]] after translation from the source language (i.e. English or any other regional Indian language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltrc.iiit.net/showfile.php?filename%3Ddownloads%2Fanu%2Findex.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717124156/http://ltrc.iiit.net/showfile.php?filename=downloads%2Fanu%2Findex.htm |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's Information Age large volumes of information are available in English – whether it be information for competitive exams or general reading. However, many people whose primary language is Hindi or any other Indian language are unable to access information in English. Anusaaraka aims to bridge this language barrier by allowing a user to enter an English text into Anusaaraka and read it in an Indian language of their choice.

Anusaaraka derives its name from the Sanskrit word "anusaran" which means "to follow." It is so called, as the translated Anusaaraka output appears in layers – i.e. a sequence of steps that follow each other till the final translation is displayed to the user.

==Features==

===Faithful representation of text in source language===
Throughout the various layers of Anusaaraka output, there is an effort to ensure that the user should be able to understand the information contained in the English sentence. This effort is given greater importance than giving perfect sentences in Hindi, for it would be pointless to have a translation that reads well but does not truly capture the information of the source text.

The layered output is unique to Anusaaraka. Thus, source language text information and how the Hindi translation is finally arrived at can be accessed by the user. The critical feature of the layered output is that the information transfer is done in a controlled manner at every step thus, making it possible to revert without any loss of information. Also, any damage to information that cannot be avoided in a translation process is then done gradually. Therefore, even if the translated sentence is not as 'perfect' as human translation, with some effort and orientation on reading Anusaaraka output, an individual can understand what the source text is implying by looking at the layers and context in which that sentence appears.

=== Reversibility===
The feature of gradual transference of information from one layer to the next gives Anusaaraka an additional advantage of bringing reversibility in the translation process – a feature which cannot be achieved by a conventional machine translation system. A bilingual user of Anusaaraka can, at any point, access the source language text in English, because of the transparency in the output. Some amount of orientation on how to read the Anusaaraka output would be required for this.

=== Transparency ===
Display of step-by-step translation layers gives an increased level of confidence to the end-user, as he can trace back to the source and get clarity regarding translated text by analysis of the output layers and some reference to context.

'''Bleeding edge technology''' is a category of [[technology|technologies]] so new that they could have a high risk of being unreliable and lead adopters to incur greater expense in order to make use of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bleeding%20edge |title=bleeding edge. (n.d.) |website=Dictionary.com Unabridged |publisher=Random House |accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oz2008"/&gt; The term ''bleeding edge'' was formed as an [[allusion]] to the similar terms "leading edge" and "[[wikt:cutting edge|cutting edge]]". It tends to imply even greater advancement, albeit at an increased risk because of the unreliability of the [[software]] or [[Computer hardware|hardware]].&lt;ref name="SchommerBroschart2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ingo Schommer |author2=Steven Broschart |title=SilverStripe: The Complete Guide to CMS Development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pKBbDyyiCokC&amp;pg=PR22 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |date=7 January 2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-68270-8 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented example of this term being used dates to early 1983, when an unnamed banking executive was quoted to have used it in reference to [[Storage Technology Corporation]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayes |first=Thomas C. |title=Hope at Storage Technology |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/21/business/hope-at-storage-technology.html |accessdate=10 September 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 March 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By its nature, a proportion of bleeding edge technology will make it into the mainstream. For example, [[electronic mail]] (email) was once considered to be bleeding edge.&lt;ref name="Infosystems"&gt;{{cite book |title=Infosystems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1JUAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=14 December 2011 |year=1977 |publisher=Hitchcock Pub. Co. |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
A technology may be considered bleeding edge where it contains a degree of risk, or, more generally, there is a significant downside to early adoption, such as:
*''Lack of consensus'' &amp;ndash; competing ways of doing new things exist and there is little to no indication in which direction the market will go.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} By its very nature, consumers and firms will be unfamiliar with the product and its relationship to existing technologies,&lt;ref name="Oz2008"/&gt; leading to rapid changes in what is considered best practice as more becomes known about the technology's qualities.&lt;ref name="SchommerBroschart2010"/&gt;
*''Lack of testing'' &amp;ndash; The technology may be unreliable,&lt;ref name="Oz2008"/&gt; or simply untested.&lt;ref name="SchommerBroschart2010"/&gt;
*''Industry resistance to change'' &amp;ndash; trade journals and industry leaders have spoken against a new technology or product but some organizations are trying to implement it anyway because they are convinced it is technically superior.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Costs and benefits==
The rewards for successful early adoption of new technologies can be great in terms of establishing a [[comparative advantage]] in otherwise competitive markets;&lt;ref name="Oz2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Effy Oz |title=Management Information Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fATar8Nn6HEC&amp;pg=PA65 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |date=23 January 2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-1-4239-0178-5 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; unfortunately, the penalties for "betting on the wrong horse" (e.g. in a [[format war]]) or choosing the wrong product are equally large.  Whenever an organization decides to take a chance on bleeding edge technology there is a chance that they will be stuck with a [[white elephant]] or worse.

Bleeding edge computer software, especially [[open source software]], is especially common. Indeed, it is usual practice for open-source [[software developer|developers]] to release new, bleeding edge, versions of their software fairly frequently, sometimes in a rather [[work-in-progress|unpolished state]] to allow others to review, test, and, in many cases, contribute to it ([[beta testing]]). Therefore, users who want features that have not been implemented in older, more [[Software release life cycle#Release|stable releases]] of the software are able to choose the bleeding-edge version. In such cases, the user is willing to sacrifice stability, reliability, or ease of use for the sake of increased functionality.&lt;ref name="Inc.2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rikishi |first=Niramiai |title=Selling in the Bazaar: How Open Source Manages Code |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpoOEa4kiSIC&amp;pg=PA41 |journal=AAUGN |accessdate=9 November 2010 |date=December 2000 |publisher=AUUG, Inc. |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caboose''' (also ''camboose, coboose, cubboos'' derived from the Dutch ''kombuis'') is a term used for a small ship's [[kitchen]], i.e. [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], located on an open deck. At one time a ''caboose'' related to a smaller kitchen aboard a [[Cargo ship|merchantman]], while aboard a [[warship]] it was called a ''galley''.&lt;ref name="Naval Enc"&gt;''A Naval Encyclopaedia: comprising a dictionary of nautical words and phrases; biographical notices, and records of naval officers''; special articles on naval art and science, written expressly for this work by officers and others of recognized authority in the branches treated by them. Together with descriptions of the principal naval stations and seaports of the world. Lewis R. Hammersly &amp; Co, Philadelphia, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Falconer (poet)|William Falconer]]'s 1780 ''A Universal Dictionary of the Marine'' describes a caboose thus: "a sort of box or house to cover the chimney of some merchant-ships. It somewhat resembles a sentry-box, and generally stands against the barricade on the fore part of the quarter-deck". Sometimes the caboose was portable.

Prior to the introduction of the caboose the furnaces for cooking were, aboard [[three-decker]]s, placed on the middle deck, and aboard [[Two-decker|two-decked ships]] in the [[forecastle]].

In [[Canada]] a caboose was formerly used to describe a galley on a [[Timber rafting|timber raft]].&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary'' – Complete and Unabridged, HarperCollins Publishers, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was sometimes also applied to the cast-iron [[Kitchen stove|stove]] used for cooking on deck&lt;ref name="Naval Enc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third Unabridged Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; or in galleys during the early 19th century, as well as an outdoor oven or fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cataphatic theology''' or '''kataphatic theology''' is [[theology]] that uses "positive" terminology to describe or refer to [[Divinity|the divine]] –&amp;nbsp;specifically, [[God]]&amp;nbsp;– i.e. terminology that describes or refers to what the divine is believed to be, in contrast to the "negative" terminology used in [[apophatic theology]] to indicate what it is believed the divine is not.

==Etymology==
"Cataphatic" comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word κατάφασις ''kataphasis'' meaning "affirmation,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkata%2Ffasis&lt;/ref&gt; coming from κατά ''kata'' (an intensifier)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkata%2F1&lt;/ref&gt; and φάναι ''phanai'' ("to speak").

==Terminology==
To speak of God or the divine kataphatically is thought by some to be by its nature a form of limiting to God or divine. This was one of the core tenets of the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]. By defining what God or the divine is we limit the unlimited. A kataphatic way to express God would be that God is love. The apophatic way would be to state that God is not hate (although such description can be accused of the same dualism). Or to say that God is not love, as he transcends even our notion of love. Ultimately, one would come to remove even the notion of the Trinity, or of saying that God is one, because The Divine is above numberhood. That God is beyond all duality because God contains within Godself all things and that God is beyond all things. The apophatic way as taught by Saint Dionysus was to remove any conceptual understanding of God that could become all-encompassing, since in its limitedness that concept would begin to force the fallen understanding of mankind onto the absolute and divine.

==Eastern Orthodoxy==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] kataphatic theology is critical in the developmental stages of [[contemplation]] (see [[theoria]]). Once a firm grasp of the positive attributes of God or the divine has been achieved one moves onto the transcendent qualities of the superior or at least the corrective  [[apophatic theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e-uBWoO-e7oC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=V+Lossky+mystical+theology+of+the+Eastern+orthodox+church&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pMXuTLvEJ8P98AaWt5jyCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=apophatic%20&amp;f=false Mystical theology of the Eastern Orthodox church pg 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cataphatic treatment of ultimate reality in Buddhism ==

Within [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, there is a species of scripture which essays a descriptive hint of Ultimate Reality by using positive terminology when speaking of it. This manifestation of Buddhism is particularly marked in the [[Dzogchen]] and [[Tathagatagarbha]] forms of the religion. [[Nirvana]], for example, is equated with the True Self of the Buddha (pure, uncreated and deathless) in some of the Tathagatagarbha scriptures, and in other Buddhist tantras (such as the [[Kunjed Gyalpo]] or 'All-Creating King' [[tantra]]), the Primordial Buddha, [[Samantabhadra]], is described as 'pure and total consciousness' - the 'trunk', 'foundation' and 'root' of all that exists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Supreme Source: The Fundamental Tantra of the Dzogchen Semde Kunjed Gyalpo'', by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and Adriano Clemente, Snow Lion, Ithaca, 1999, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Gaudiya-vaishnavism==
[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] speaks positively about transcendental qualities of [[Krishna]]. He has 64 transcendental qualities as Supreme Personality of Godhead, although these qualities are explained as non-material and beyond duality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskconpress.com/books/cc/madhya/25/54|title=Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā 25.54|last=A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradoxical nature of [[Krishna]], the Absolute, being both beyond description and having qualities is discussed throughout the [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskconpress.com/books/kb/87|title=KṚṢṆA, The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Chapter 87|last=A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 64 qualities of [[Krishna]], 4 qualities are unique, which only Krishna has, these are:
*He is the performer of wonderful varieties of pastimes (especially His childhood pastimes).
*He is surrounded by devotees endowed with wonderful love of Godhead.
*He can attract all living entities all over the universes by playing on His flute.
*He has a wonderful excellence of beauty which cannot be rivaled anywhere in the creation.
There are other 60 qualities of Krishna, but [[Narayana]] also have them. Of these, 5 are special, which are not found in jiva-[[Atma (Hinduism)|atma]]s or (according to the Vaishnava view) other Hindu deities, even [[Brahma]] or [[Shiva]]:
*He has inconceivable potency.
*Uncountable universes generate from His body.
*He is the original source of all incarnations.
*He is the giver of salvation to the enemies whom He kills.
*He is the attractor of liberated souls.
Other 55 transcendental qualities are found in Brahma and Shiva, though they are common for Narayana and Krishna, but not found in jiva-atmas. And finally just 50 transcendental qualities can be found in jiva-atmas, who are not on the level of deities, but Krishna and Narayana also have these qualities. It also has to be carefully noted, that these qualities manifest in jiva-atmas only in minute qualities, and only if they become pure devotees of Krishna-[[Caitanya]]. On other hand, Krishna has these 64 qualities in full. See full list here: 64 Qualities of Lord Krishna&lt;ref&gt;[http://nitaaiveda.com/Compiled_and_Imp_Scriptures/Glories_of_Lord_Krishna/Krishna_the_Supreme_Absolute_Truth/64_Qualities_of_Lord_Krishna.htm 64 Qualities of Lord Krishna Shrila Rupa Gosvami]&lt;/ref&gt;

But once a firm grasp of the positive qualities or attributes of God has been achieved one moves onto the transcendent qualities of the superior apophatic theology. This is fully absent in Gaudiya Vaisnavism.

'''Chimuan''' (also '''Chimúan''') or '''Yuncan''' is a hypothetical small [[extinct language|extinct]] [[language family]] of northern [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] (inter-[[Andes|Andean]] valley).

==Family division==
Chimuan consisted of three attested languages:

* [[Mochica language|Mochica]] (a.k.a. Yunga, Chimú)
* [[Cañar–Puruhá]]
** Cañari (a.k.a. Cañar, Kanyari)
** Puruhá (a.k.a. Puruwá, Puruguay)

All languages are now extinct.

Mochica was one of the major languages of [[pre-Columbian]] South America. It was documented by Fernando de la Carrera and [[Middendorff]] in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries respectively. It became extinct ca. 1950, although some people remember a few words. Adelaar &amp; Muysken (2004) consider Mochica a [[language isolate]] for now.

Cañari and Puruhá are documented with only a few words. These two languages are usually connected with Mochica. However, as their documentation level is so low, it may not be possible to confirm this association. According to Adelaar &amp; Muysken (2004), Jijón y Caamaño's evidence of their relationship is only a single word: Mochica ''nech'' "river", Cañari ''necha''; based on similarities with neighboring languages, he finds a [[Barbacoan languages|Barbacoan]] connection more likely.

[[Quingnam language|Quingnam]], possibly the same language as Lengua (Yunga) Pescadora, is sometimes taken to be a dialect of Mochica, but it is unattested, unless a list of numerals discovered in 2010 turns out to be Quingnam or Pescadora as expected. Those numerals are not, however, Mochica.

'''ClearTalk''' is a [[controlled natural language]]—a kind of a [[formal language]] for expressing information that is designed to be both [[human-readable]] (being based on English) and easily [[natural language processing|processed by a computer]].

Anyone who can read English can immediately read ClearTalk, and the people who write ClearTalk learn to write it while using it. The ClearTalk system itself does most of the training through use: the restrictions are shown by menus and templates and are enforced by immediate syntactic checks. By consistently using ClearTalk for its output, a system reinforces the acceptable syntactic forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/gal4fmf.htm Graphics and Languages for the FMF&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used by the experimental [[knowledge management]] software [[Ikarus (knowledge management)|Ikarus]] and by a [[knowledge base]] management system Fact Guru.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~tcl/factguru1/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10149">== What is Collaborative Writing ==
To understand what collaborative writing is, we must first understand the word collaboration. Collaboration is known as the sharing of labor&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, whether this be as a pair or in groups. Therefore collaborative writing refers to the co authorship of a writing piece.

Collaborative writing includes three necessary components to make the writing process work, which include:

* Interaction between participants throughout the entire writing process. Whether it be brainstorming, writing a draft of the project, or reviewing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Writing in L2 Classrooms|last=Storch|first=Neomy|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shared power among participants. Everyone included in the project has the power to make decisions and no group member is incharge of all the text produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The collaborative production of one single and specific text.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the collaborative writing process all participants are to have equal responsibilities. All sections of the text should be split up to ensure the work load is evenly displaced, all participants work together and interact throughout the writing process, everyone contributes to planning, making of ideas, making structure of text, editing, and the revision process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundsford|first=Andrea|date=1991|title=Collaboration, Control, and the Idea of a Writing Center.|url=http://ucwbling.chicagolandwritingcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Andrea-Lunsford-Collaboration-Control-and-the-Idea-of-a-Writing-Center.pdf|journal=The Writing Center Journal|volume=12.1|pages=3-10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Often times collaborative writing is used in instances where a workload would be overwhelming for one person to produce. Therefore ownership of the text is from the group that produced it and not just one person.

== Benefits of Collaborative Writing ==

Collaborative writing allows authors to combine their literacy tools and knowledge on a single project.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Storch|first=Neomy|date=September 2005|title=Collaborative writing: Product, process, and students’ reflections|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jslw.2005.05.002|journal=Journal of Second Language Writing|volume=14|issue=3|pages=153–173|doi=10.1016/j.jslw.2005.05.002|issn=1060-3743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group writing is a social activity, and students who participated in group writing experiments felt it was a good learning exercise. The two parts of collaborative writing that researchers indicated were most influential were [[Peer review|peer reviewing]] and brainstorming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Students that chose to do group and independent writing in a gave feedback that group writers came away feeling like they had thought of something with their partners that they wouldn’t have on their own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Peer reviewing made readers feel more connected to the writing, and authors were able to get specific feedback from their audience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Teachers who observed collaborative groups said that members were more receptive and willing to change for constructive criticism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Peer reviewing and brainstorming requires all parties to use critical thinking skills. Critical thinking skills in collaborative writing could be used in deciding on ideas, assigning what each person’s job is, and catering your writing to your audience. 

Researchers who did grammatical tests on group writing versus independent writing in students found that even though the amount group authors wrote was less, they used more grammatically complex sentences and answered the prompt accurately.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Independent writers tended to use extra information and repeat words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although collaborative writing can take more time to write the same amount as an independent writer, group plans and simple task work can help time strains. 

Attitudes in the academic world value co-authorship, and will often publish more collaboratively written articles more often than single-author articles. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Richard L|date=September 2000|title=Co-authorship in the academic library literature: A survey of attitudes and behaviors|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0099-1333(00)00140-3|journal=The Journal of Academic Librarianship|volume=26|issue=5|pages=339–345|doi=10.1016/s0099-1333(00)00140-3|issn=0099-1333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents in the professional world surveyed that they felt collaborative writing improved their writing because of their collaborator's knowledge, and they were able to spend more time on article quality together. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Types of Collaborative Writing ==
Collaborative writing has been the subject of academic research and business for over two decades.[[Collaborative writing#cite%20note-5|&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

* '''Single Author writing or Collegial:''' one person is leading, they compile the group ideas and do the writing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowry|first=Paul Benjamin|last2=Curtis|first2=Aaron|last3=Lowry|first3=Michelle René|date=2004-01-01|title=Building a Taxonomy and Nomenclature of Collaborative Writing to Improve Interdisciplinary Research and Practice|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021943603259363|journal=The Journal of Business Communication (1973)|language=en|volume=41|issue=1|pages=66–99|doi=10.1177/0021943603259363|issn=0021-9436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''Sequential writing:''' each person adds their task work then passes it on for the next person to edit freely.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Horizontal Division writing:''' each person does one part of the whole project and then one member compiles it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Stratified Division writing''': each person plays a role in the composition process of a project due to talents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Reactive writing''': group all works on and writes the project at the same time, adjusting and commenting on everyone’s work. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;


== As an educational tool ==
{{see also|Collaborative learning}}
Collaborative writing is used by educators to teach novice authors, of all ages and educational levels, to write. Collaborative writing can be used by professors to teach writers of all ages and teach different educational levels. With collaborative writing, it helps provide participants to explore, discuss and help with learning capabilities. Collaborative writing corporate by contributing ideas with others.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The quantity of learning and growth. In the past ten years most studies says that most students are motivated in collaborative writing because of their improvement in writing competencies. When students work in groups, it generally produces shorter but better text such as grammatical accuracy and fulfillment. It gave students ideas and giving information.

An author acquires a copyright if their work meets certain criteria. In the case of works created by one person, typically, the first owner of a copyright in that work is the person who created the work, i.e. the author. But, when more than one person creates the work in collaboration with one another, then a case of [[joint authorship]] can be made provided some criteria are met.

Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60% and 76%, largely because of lack of education access in rural areas and a lack of instructors.&lt;ref name="Kellnerpg61"&gt;[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Cuban government of [[Fidel Castro]] at [[Che Guevara]]'s behest dubbed 1961 the "year of education" and sent "literacy brigades" out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominantly illiterate ''guajiros'' (peasants) to read and write. The campaign was "a remarkable success." By its completion, 707,212 adults were taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96%.&lt;ref name="Kellnerpg61"/&gt;

In 2011, producer and director [[Catherine Murphy (filmmaker)|Catherine Murphy]] released the 33-minute documentary ''[[Maestra (documentary)|Maestra]]'' about the Cuban Literacy Campaign. The film includes interviews with volunteers who taught during the campaign and archival footage from 1961.

==Background==
The dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]] was overthrown by an armed guerrilla movement known as the [[26th of July Movement]] (''Movimiento 26 de Julio'') on January 1, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;"Cuban Revolution." International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 2008. www.encyclopedia.com. 11 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The new revolutionary government, led by [[Fidel Castro]], immediately began a series of social and economic reforms. Among these were agrarian reform, health care reform, and education reform, all of which dramatically improved the quality of life among the lowest sectors of Cuban society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Serra, Ana. The "New Man" in Cuba Culture and Identity in the Revolution (Contemporary Cuba). New York: University of Florida, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the turmoil of the first several years of the revolution, the flight of many skilled workers caused a “[[brain drain]].” This loss of human capital sparked a renovation of the Cuban education system to accommodate the instruction of new workers, who would take the place of those who had emigrated from the country.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Klein, Deborah. "Education as Social Revolution." Independent School 63.3 (2004): 38-47.EBSCO. Web. 20 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the renewal of Cuba’s [[infrastructure]], there were strong ideological reasons for education reform. In pre-Revolutionary Cuba, there was a dichotomy between urban citizens and rural citizens (who were often agricultural workers). The Cuban Revolution was driven by the need for equality, particularly among these classes. Before the campaign, the rate of illiteracy among city dwellers was 11%, compared to 41.7% in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, C. Illiteracy: A World Problem. London: Pall Mall Press. 1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Literacy Campaign was designed to force contact between sectors of society that would not usually interact. As Fidel Castro put it in 1961 while addressing literacy teachers, “You will teach, and you will learn.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Volunteers from the city were often ignorant of the poor conditions of rural citizens until their experiences during this campaign. Besides literacy, the campaign aimed to create a collective identity of “unity, [an] attitude of combat, courage, intelligence, and a sense of history.” Politicized educational materials were used to further these ideals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Chomsky, Aviva, Barry Carr, and Pamela M. Smorkaloff, eds. ''The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics''. Durham and London: Duke UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was labeled a movement of “the people” and gave citizens a common goal, increasing solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Supko, Ruth A. Perspectives on the Cuban National Literacy Campaign. Latin American Studies Association. 26 September 1998. Web. 20 February 2010.&lt;http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/LASA98/Supko.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
It is estimated that 1,000,000 Cubans were directly involved (as teachers or students) in the Literacy Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;(Fagen B).&lt;/ref&gt; There were four categories of workers:
# “Conrado Benitez” Brigade (''Conrado Benitez Brigadistas'')—100,000 young volunteers (ages 10–19) who left school to live and work with students in the countryside. The number of students leaving schools to volunteer was so great that an alternative education was put in place for 8 months of the 1961 school year.
# Popular Alphabetizers (''Alfabetizadores populares'')—Adults who volunteered to teach in cities or towns. It is documented that 13,000 factory workers held classes for their illiterate co-workers after hours. This group includes the individuals who taught friends, neighbors, or family members out of their homes.
# “Fatherland or Death” Brigade (''Patria o Muerte Brigadistas'')—A group of 15,000 adult workers who were paid to teach in remote rural locations through an arrangement that their co-workers would fill in for them, so that the workforce remained strong.
# Schoolteacher Brigades—A group of 15,000 professional teachers who oversaw the technical and organizational aspects of the campaign. As 1961 progressed, their involvement grew to the extent that most teachers participated full-time for a majority of the campaign. The "Fatherland or Death" brigade, along with the Schoolteacher brigade, is sometimes simply referred to as the Workers Brigade (''Brigadistas Obreros'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1964"&gt;Fagen, Richard R. Cuba: The Political Content of Adult Education. Stanford: Stanford University, 1964. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Supko, Ruth A. Perspectives on the Cuban National Literacy Campaign. Latin American Studies Association. 26 September 1998. Web. 20 February 2010. &lt;http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/LASA98/Supko.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government provided teaching supplies to volunteers. Workers who traveled to rural locations to teach received a standard grey uniform, a warm blanket, a hammock, two textbooks — ''We Shall Read'' and ''We Shall Conquer'' — and a gas-powered lantern, so that lessons could be given at night after work ended.&lt;ref name = "LiteracyC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kozol, J.

==Challenges==

Supporters of the revolution who were too young or otherwise unable to participate in the downfall of Fulgencio Batista saw the campaign as an opportunity to contribute to the success of the new government and hoped to instill a revolutionary consciousness in their students.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Many of the instructional texts used during the Literacy Campaign focused on the history of the Revolution and had strong political messages, which made the movement a target of opposition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Counter-revolutionaries used violent acts of terrorism to destabilize Cuba and create an atmosphere of fear. Several acts were committed on public property, notably the bombing of the country’s largest department store, El Encanto, on April 13, 1961. That year, teachers, students, and peasants were tortured and murdered to terrorize the farming community and reduce support for the literacy campaign.&lt;ref name="cubaminrex1"&gt;"Cuba and Its Defence of All Human Right for All [sic]."

==Results==
{{quote|"Before 1959 it was the countryside versus the city. The literacy campaign united the country because, for the first time, people from the city understood how hard life was for people before the revolution, that they survived on their own, and that as people they had much in common. This was very important for the new government."| Luisa Yara Campos, Cuban literacy museum director &lt;ref name = "LiteracyC" /&gt;}}

Many of the Literacy Campaign’s volunteers went on to pursue teaching careers, and the rate of teachers is now 11 times higher than it was before the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Halebsky, Sandor, and John M. Kirk, eds. Cuba Twenty-Five Years of Revolution, 1959-1984. New York: Praeger, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the revolutionary government nationalized schools, private institutions often excluded large segments of society; wealthy Cubans often received exemplary instruction in private schools, while children of the working class received low-quality education or did not attend school at all.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Education became accessible to a much larger segment of the population after 1959. The percentage of children enrolled in school in Cuba (ages 6–12) increased dramatically over the years:
* 1953—56%
* 1970—88%
* 1986—nearly 100%&lt;ref name="autogenerated1995"/&gt;

It is estimated that 268,000 Cubans worked to eliminate illiteracy during the Year of Education, and around 707,000 Cubans became literate by December 22, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Bhola, H. S. Campaigning for Literacy. Paris: UNESCO. 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1962, the country’s literacy rate was 96%, one of the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1964"/&gt;

Cuban literacy educators trained during the campaign went on to assist in literacy campaigns in 15 other countries, for which a Cuban organization was awarded the [[UNESCO King Sejong Literacy Prize|King Sejong Literacy Prize]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;Abendroth, Mark. Rebel Literacy: Cuba's National Literacy Campaign and Critical Global Citizenship. Duluth, MN: Litwin Books, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the past 50 years, thousands of Cuban literacy teachers have volunteered in countries such as [[Haiti]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name = "LiteracyC" /&gt;

===Museum===
The thank-you letters to [[Fidel Castro]], used by [[UNESCO]] to evaluate the success of the campaign in 1964, are kept with photographs and details of all 100,000 volunteers in a museum in La Ciudad Libertad (City of Liberty), which is in [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s vast former headquarters in the western suburbs of [[Havana]].&lt;ref name = "LiteracyC" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76557">'''Cultivation theory''' examines the long-term effects of [[television]]. "The primary proposition of cultivation theory states that the more time people spend 'living' in the television world, the more likely they are to believe social reality aligns with reality portrayed on television."&lt;ref name="Karyn Riddle"&gt;{{cite conference|author=Riddle, K.|year=2009|title=Cultivation Theory Revisited: The Impact of Childhood Television Viewing Levels on Social Reality Beliefs and Construct Accessibility in Adulthood|type=Conference Papers|publisher=[[International Communication Association]]|pp=1–29|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/9/9/4/5/p299457_index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images and [[ideological]] messages transmitted through popular television media heavily influence perceptions of the real world.

Cultivation theory was founded by [[George Gerbner]] and is [[positivistic]], meaning it assumes the existence of objective reality and value-neutral research.&lt;ref name="wrtl"/&gt; A study conducted by Jennings Bryant and Dorina Miron in 2004, which surveyed almost 2,000 articles published in three top [[mass communication|mass-communication]] journals since 1956, found that Cultivation Theory was the third-most frequently utilized [[theory]], showing that it continues to be one of the most popular theories in mass-communication research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=J.|last2=Mirion|first2=D.|authorlink1=Jennings Bryant|year=2004|title=Theory and research in mass communication|url=|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=54|issue=|pages=662–704|doi=10.1093/joc/54.4.662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Cultivation theory suggests that exposure to media, over time, subtly "cultivates" viewers' perceptions of reality. Gerbner and Gross assert: "Television is a medium of the socialization of most people into standardized roles and behaviors. Its function is in a word, [[enculturation]]".&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt; Within his analysis of cultivation, Gerbner draws attention to three entities—institutions, messages, and publics.&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan"/&gt;

Though most researchers tend to focus on television as it is the most common form of media consumption in the world, Cultivation Theory has been shown to encompass many different forms of media, such as newspapers, film, and even photographs.  This can apply anytime social observation occurs in any form outside a natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, F. (2010). Cultivation effects of a newspaper on reality estimates and explicit and implicit attitudes. Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, And Applications, 22(4), 147-159&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial research on the theory establishes that concern regarding the effects of television on audiences stem from the unprecedented centrality of television in [[American culture]].&lt;ref name="Karyn Riddle"/&gt; Gerbner posited that television as a [[mass medium]] of communication had formed into a common symbolic environment that bound diverse communities together, [[socializing]] people into standardized roles and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Griffin, E.|year=2012|title=Communication Communication Communication|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pp=(8), 366–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thus compared the power of television to that of [[religion]], stating television was to modern society what religion once was in earlier times. Thus, Gerbner's research focused on the larger meaning of heavy [[television consumption]] instead of the meaning behind specific messages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Background==
===Cultural Indicators Project===
Developed by [[George Gerbner]] and Larry Gross in 1976, cultivation theory derived from several large-scale research projects in a comprehensive project entitled Cultural Indicators. The Cultural Indicators Project began as a stand-alone study commissioned by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] for the [[National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence]].&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt; The commission was formed to address issues of violence in American culture; one specific area of interest for the Johnson administration was the effects of [[television violence]] on audiences. Gerbner subsequently began work on the federally funded Cultural Indicators Project at the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School of Communications]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Congress then facilitated the creation of the Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory Committee on Television and Social Behavior in 1972. This new committee funded a number of studies on the effects of television: Gerbner's Cultural Indicators was one of those chosen. Through Gerbner's involvement with Cultural Indicators, he began to produce the Violence Index, a yearly content analysis of prime-time television that would show how violence was portrayed on television, from season to season. This allowed viewers the access to data regarding the frequency of violence in television shows but also raised questions regarding the accuracy of the study and the research hypotheses used. While the Violence Index received criticism, Gerbner and his team updated the Index to make sure that the data being produced was accurately composed, and addressed any criticisms posted. Gerbner's research found that violence was portrayed in prime time more frequently compared to violence in the real world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=West|first=Richard|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|year=2014|isbn=978-0-07-353428-2|location=New York, NY|pages=420–436|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerbner's project came about during an increasing divide between political conservatives and private commercial investors in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Man Who Counts the Killings|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/05/the-man-who-counts-the-killings/376850/|website=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing the task of middleman, Gerbner and his team acted as impartial researchers, examining the effects and implications of television consumption without having any vested political or financial interest in its outcome. This standpoint allotted Gerbner access to a number of grants that continued to fund the Cultural Indicators Project throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt;

==Assumptions==
Cultivation theory holds three core assumptions. The first assumption highlights the medium, the second, the audience, and the final assumption deals with the function of the medium on audiences and their ability to react to it. 
*'''Television is fundamentally different from other forms of [[mass media]].'''&lt;ref name="Gerbner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerbner|first1=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Jackson-Beeck|first3=M.|last4=Jeffries-Fox|first4=S.|last5=Signorielli|first5=N.|year=1978|title=Cultural indicators violence profile no. 9|url=|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=28|issue=3|pages=176–207|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1978.tb01646.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:This first assumption lists the differences between television and other forms of mass media. Television is visual and auditory, and therefore doesn't require viewers to be [[literate]]. It has the potential to be free, aside from the initial cost of obtaining a television (although free access to television is generally quite limited). There are multiple added costs for television viewing, including the necessity of a converter box to access most local television broadcasting and the high monthly fees required for accessing cable television. These costs may prohibit poor and low-income families from viewing television. However, television is still ageless in the sense that anyone from any walk of life can use it, and most importantly, anyone is able to comprehend the content that is broadcast through television. Television programming uses storytelling and engaging narratives to capture people's attention.
:Gerbner, Gross, Morgan, &amp; Signorielli argued that while religion or education had previously been greater influences on social trends, now "[t]elevision is the source of the most broadly shared images and messages in history ...Television cultivates from infancy the very predispositions and preferences that used to be acquired from other primary sources ... The repetitive pattern of television's [[mass-produced]] messages and images forms the mainstream of a common symbolic environment."&lt;ref name="Living"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerbner, G.|author2=Gross, L.|author3=Morgan, M.|author4=Signorielli, N.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1986|chapter=Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process|editor=[[Jennings Bryant|J. Bryant]]|editor2=D. Zillman|title=Perspectives on media effects|pp=17–40|location=Hilldale, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|chapterurl=http://web.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Television has a lower threshold for consumption than print media (because of the need for literacy) and film (because it requires a level of financial capability).&lt;ref name="wrtl" /&gt; According to Gerbner, television has become the "central cultural arm of our society."&lt;ref name="Gerbner" /&gt;

*'''Television shapes the way individuals within society think and relate to each other.'''

:Gerbner and Gross write that "the substance of the consciousness cultivated by TV is not so much specific attitudes and opinions as more basic assumptions about the [[fact]]s of life and standards of judgment on which conclusions are based."&lt;ref name="Living1"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=[[George Gerbner|Gerbner, G.]]|author2=Gross, L.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1972|title= Living with television: The violence profile|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=173–199|pmid=932235|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1976.tb01397.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, the realities created by television are not based on real facts but on speculation. 
:Gerbner observed that television reaches people, on average, more than seven hours a day. Television offers "a centralized system of story-telling".&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cultivation Analysis: An Overview|year=1998|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=1|issue=3–4|pages=175–194|doi=10.1080/15205436.1998.9677855|author1=Gerbner, G.|url=http://web.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerbner asserts that television's major cultural function is to stabilize [[social structure|social patterns]] and to cultivate [[resistance to change]]. We live in terms of the stories we tell and television tells these stories through news, [[drama]], and [[advertising]] to almost everybody most of the time.&lt;ref name="Gerbner" /&gt;
:Cultivation Theory doesn't predict what we will do after watching a violent television program, but rather posits a connection between our worry and fear about a violence-filled world and exposure to violent programming on television.

*'''Television's effects are limited.'''

:Assumption three paradoxically asserts that television is a part of a larger sociocultural system. Therefore, although the effects of watching television may be increased or decrease at any point in time, its effect is consistently present.&lt;ref name="Gerbner" /&gt;
:Gerbner's [[ice age]] analogy states that "just as an average temperature shift of a few degrees can lead to an ice age or the outcomes of elections can be determined by slight margins, so too can a relatively small but pervasive influence make a crucial difference. The size of an effect is far less critical than the direction of its steady contribution."&lt;ref name="Mainstreaming"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerbner|first1=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Morgan|first3=M.|last4=Signorielli|first4=N.|authorlink1=George Gerbner|year=1980|title=The "Mainstreaming" of America: Violence Profile No. 11|url=|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=30|issue=3|pages=10–29|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1980.tb01987.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than focus on the total impact of violent television, this analogy focuses more on the fact that there ''once was or is'' an impact to viewers just through exposure. Gerbner argues that watching television doesn't cause a particular behavior, but instead watching television over time adds up to our perception of the world around us.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Research strategy analyzing the role of the media==
Cultivation differential is the final step in a four-part process that looks at the effects of television on [[society]].&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shanahan|first2=J.|year=2010|title=The State of Cultivation|url=|journal=[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]|volume=54|issue=2|pages=337–355|doi=10.1080/08838151003735018|last1=Morgan|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two steps include institutional process analysis and message system analysis. While cultivation theory focuses on macrosystems of television's influence on society as a whole, the first two steps deal with the creation of media messages and how these messages are portrayed in front of an audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Analysis of Cultivation Theory|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12128/abstract|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|date=1 December 2014|issn=1460-2466|pages=1015–1036|volume=64|issue=6|doi=10.1111/jcom.12128|first=W. James|last=Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Step 1: message system analysis===
The first part of this strategy is known as message system analysis, which has been used since 1967 to track the most stable and recurrent images in media content. Described by Gerbner, Gross, Morgan and Signorielli as a "tool for making systematic, reliable, and cumulative observations about television content", it not only tracks the perceived awareness of an individual about what he or she is viewing on television, but also represents the ongoing collective messages shown on television that shape larger community impressions over an extended period of time. Although information provided through media channels is not always reliable, message system analysis provides a method for characterizing the messages transmitted through television.&lt;ref name="Living"/&gt;

"Based on message system analyses, cultivation researchers develop hypotheses about what people would think about various aspects of ''[[reality]]'' if everything they knew about some issue or [[phenomenon]] were derived from television's dominant portrayals."&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan" /&gt; This step entails creating a detailed content analysis on the consistent images, themes, and messages in any one particular show.

Another facet of the message-system analysis Gerbner discovered was something Griffin called "equal violence, unequal risk." The research Gerbner conducted showed that the amount of [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|violence portrayed in media]] stayed consistent, but the distribution of that violence was never equal. The children and the elderly, for example, are more common recipients of violence than young or middle-aged adults. Gerbner often discovered trends in violence toward minority groups, with [[African American]]s and [[Hispanic]]s being the recipients of violence more often than [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]; two other [[demographics]] that experienced similar inequality were women and "[[blue-collar]]" workers. Griffin wrote: "The ironic result of this tendency is that the demographics shown, inaccurately, to be more in danger of violence than the rest are the demographics that will walk away from the media more afraid of violence.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

===Step 2: questions regarding viewers' social realities===
The second part of this process focuses on people's feelings about their day-to-day lives to gain a larger understanding of how they perceive their realities. Findings from the message system analysis process guide researchers to formulate questions about social reality for the subjects of a study (in this case, television viewers).&lt;ref name="Living1"/&gt;

===Step 3: surveying the audience===

The third part of this process brings Step 2 into action: asking audience participants questions about their understanding of their lives, and surveying [[television consumption]] levels. After questions are formulated based on social reality, Gerbner and Gross explain that, "To each of these questions there is a "television answer", which is like the way things appear in the world of television, and another and different answer which is biased in the opposite direction, closer to the way things are in the observable world".&lt;ref name="Living1"/&gt; These questions are then used to evaluate detailed characteristics of the participants under evaluation. Measurement items include the breadth of television consumption, habitual characteristics relating to television, and the social, economic, and political makeup of the participants.

===Step 4: cultivation differential===
The final part of this process is Cultivation Differential. This is described as "the percentage of difference in response between light and heavy television viewers."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Certain measures are evaluated including, "...sex, age, education, and other characteristics. The margin of heavy viewers over light viewers giving the "television answers" within and across groups is the "cultivation differential" indicating conceptions about social reality that viewing tends to cultivate."&lt;ref name="Living1"/&gt; According to Griffin: "Cultivation deals with how TV's content might affect viewers—particularly the viewers who spend lots of time glued to the tube. This is where most of the action takes place in the theory."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Gerbner found that the effect of television on its viewers is not unidirectional, that the "use of the term cultivation for television's contribution to conception of social reality... (does not) necessarily imply a one-way, monolithic process. The effects of a pervasive medium upon the composition and structure of the symbolic environment are subtle, complex, and intermingled with other influences. This perspective, therefore, assumes an interaction between the medium and its publics."&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt;

This cultivation differential is what Gerbner sought to discover in his research. Griffin defines this as "the difference in the percentage giving the television answer within comparable groups of light and heavy TV viewers."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Gerbner wanted to find how often individuals who watched a significant amount of television were influenced by what they saw in the media. Gerbner believed there was no before-television stage in a person's life. He alleged the media influences a person the moment they are born.

There are four attitudes that Gerbner focused on: (1) the chances of involvement with violence, (2) fear of walking alone at night, (3) perceived activity of police, and (4) general mistrust of people.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; When a person watches more television, that person is more likely to think he or she has a higher chance of being involved violence and is more mistrustful of others. See also the description of [[mean world syndrome]] below.

==Perceptions of violence==
Gerbner's initial work specifically looked at the effects of [[television violence]] on American audiences.&lt;ref name="Gwalker"&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/comm321/gwalker/effectsmedia.htm "Media Effects Theories"]. Oregon State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence underscored the larger part of Gerbner's work on cultivation theory, as he and his team speculated that violence had an effect on the way Americans perceive safety, crime, and general lawlessness in both their immediate communities and the greater population. Therefore, they measured dramatic violence, which Gerbner defines as "the overt expression or threat of physical force as part of the plot."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Gerbner's research also focuses on the impact of television viewing on high-use television users and their interpretation of the prevalence of crime on television versus real life. He argues that since a high percentage of television programs include violent or crime-related content, viewers who spend a lot of time watching television are inevitably exposed to high levels of crime and violence portrayed. Thus, increased exposure causes viewers to judge the world around them as more violent and crime-filled than it may actually be in reality.&lt;ref name="Hughes"/&gt;

In 1968, Gerbner conducted a survey to demonstrate this theory. From his results he placed television viewers into three categories; "light viewers" (less than 2 hours a day), "medium viewers" (2–4 hours a day) and "heavy viewers" (more than 4 hours a day). He found that heavy viewers held beliefs and opinions similar to those portrayed on television rather than ones based in real-world circumstances, which demonstrates the compound effect of media influence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those whom Gerbner classified as heavy viewers experience shyness, loneliness, and depression much more than those who do not watch television or who do not watch television nearly as much.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammermeister|first=Joe|author2=Barbara Brock|author3=David Winterstein|author4=Randy Page|title=Life Without TV? Cultivation Theory and Psychosocial Characteristics of Television-Free Individuals and Their Television-Viewing Counterparts|journal=Health Communication|year=2005|volume=17|issue=4|pages=253–264|url=http://cultivationanalysisrtvf173.pbworks.com/f/Cultivat1.pdf|doi=10.1207/s15327027hc1703_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this study, Gerbner also began working on what would become his [[Mean world syndrome|Mean World Index]], which subscribes to the notion that heavy consumption of violence-related television content leads the viewer to believe the world is more dangerous than it actually is.

===Positive correlation between TV viewing and fear of criminal victimization===
"In most of the surveys Gerbner conducted, the results reveal a small but statistically significant relationship between TV consumption and fear about becoming the victim of a crime. The question at the start of the chapter is illustrative: Those with light viewing habits predict their weekly odds of being a victim are 1 out of 100; those with heavy viewing habits fear the risk 1 out of 10. Actual crime statistics indicate that 1 out of 10,000 is more realistic."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

Supporting this finding is a survey done with college students that showed a significant correlation between the attention paid to local crime and fear. This survey also showed a significant correlation between fears of crime and violence and the number of times the respondents viewed television per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=Bryan H.|author2=Yuhmim Chang|title=Assessing cultivation theory and public health model for crime reporting|journal=Newspaper Research Journal|date=1 September 2000|volume=21|issue=4|pages=99–112|url=http://sb6nw2tx4e.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Assessing+cultivation+theory+and+public+health+model+for+crime+reporting&amp;rft.jtitle=Newspaper+Research+Journal&amp;rft.au=Bryan+H+Reber&amp;rft.au=Yuhmiin+Chang&amp;rft.date=2000-11-01&amp;rft.issn=0739-5329&amp;rft.volume=21&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=99&amp;rft.externalDBID=INRS&amp;rft.externalDocID=73957882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Local television]] news also plays a role in influencing viewers' perception of high criminal activity due to events reported on the news. While news agencies boast their allegiance to report factual, timely news, they rely "heavily on sensational coverage of crime and other mayhem with particular emphasis on homicide and violence" (Hamilton, 1998; Klite, Bardwell, &amp; Salzman, 1995, 1997). Thus, viewers are more likely to develop a heightened sense of fear of crime because of the nature of information spread by local news outlets.

===Perceived activity of the police===

"People with heavy viewing habits believe that 5 percent of society is involved in [[law enforcement]]. Their video world is peopled with police officers, judges, and government agents. People with light viewing habits estimates a more realistic 1 percent."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

===General mistrust of people===
"Those with heavy viewing habits are suspicious of other people's motives. They subscribe to statements that warn people to expect the worst." These people would be likely to believe statements such as: "Most people are just looking out for themselves"; "In dealing with others, you can't be too careful"; and "Do unto others before they do unto You." This mindset is what Griffin calls the mean world syndrome.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

Gerbner's original analysis shows that heavy viewers are much more likely to be afraid of walking alone at night. The reluctance of these individuals has also been seen on a more global scale because heavy viewers in the United States are much more likely to believe they, as a nation, should stay out of world affairs.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Michael|title=The Fruits of Cultivation Analysis: A Reexamination of Some Effects of Television Watching|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1980|pages=287–302|url=http://sb6nw2tx4e.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=M&amp;aulast=Hughes&amp;atitle=The+fruits+of+cultivation+analysis:+A+reexamination+of+some+effects+of+television+watching&amp;id=doi:10.1086/268597&amp;title=Public+opinion+quarterly&amp;volume=44&amp;issue=3&amp;date=1980&amp;spage=287&amp;issn=0033-362X|doi=10.1086/268597|volume=44|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key terms in cultivation analysis==
===Mainstreaming===
"Mainstreaming is the blurring, blending, and bending process by which heavy TV viewers from disparate groups develop a common outlook on the world through constant exposure to the same images and labels on TV."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Mainstreaming through television plays a central role in society. There are many people that do not have access to television, but the reach of television is so expansive that it has become the primary channel responsible for shaping what is [[mainstream]] in our culture.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; The mainstream is more than the sum of all cross-currents and sub-currents; it represents the broadest range of shared meanings and assumptions in the most general, functional and stable way.&lt;ref name="Growing"/&gt; Heavy television viewing may override individual differences and perspectives, creating more of an American (and increasingly global) "melting pot" of social, cultural and political ideologies.&lt;ref name="Growing" /&gt;

Gerbner found that ideas and opinions commonly held by heavy viewers as a result of mainstreaming have to do with politics and economics. According to Griffin, Gerbner's research led to the conclusion that heavy viewers tend to label themselves as middle class citizens who are politically moderate. Gerbner also found people who labeled themselves as either liberal or conservative among those who mainly watched TV occasionally. However, he also found that "cultural indicators noted that their positions on social issues are decidedly conservative."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

===Resonance===
Resonance occurs when things viewed on television are congruent with the actual lived realities of viewers. Gerbner writes that this provides a double dose of messages that resonate and amplify cultivation.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; Additionally, Gerbner et al. defines ''resonance'' as the similarity between everyday reality and television narratives. The example they give is of minority groups whose fictional television character is stereotypically more frequently victimized on television, creating an exaggerated perception of violence for individuals who watch more television&lt;ref name="Growing" /&gt; Griffin sums it up nicely, when he states, "Gerbner claimed that other heavy viewers grow more apprehensive through the process of resonance."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Furthermore, Gerbner said, "The congruence of the television world and real-life circumstances may 'resonate' and lead to markedly amplified cultivation patterns."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; This cultivation could have a large effect on our society if these viewers insist on receiving more security from the government, their work place, family, friends, etc. Resonance seeks to explain why heavy TV viewers often have an amplified vigilance about the world.

As either mainstreaming or resonance, cultivation produces first-order or second-order effects. First-order effects refers to the learning of facts, while second-order effects involve "hypotheses about more general issues and assumptions" that people make about their environments.&lt;ref name="Living" /&gt;

===Mean World Index===
Gerbner et al. developed the [[Mean world syndrome|Mean World Index]]. The Mean World Index finds that long-term exposure to television in which violence is frequent cultivates the image of a mean and dangerous world. Viewers who consumed television at a higher rate believed that greater protection by law enforcement is needed and reported that most people "cannot be trusted" and are "just looking out for themselves".&lt;ref name="Mainstreaming" /&gt; The Mean World Index consists of three statements:

*Most people are just looking out for themselves.
*You can't be too careful in dealing with people.
*Most people would take advantage of you if they got the chance.

===Dramatic violence===
Dramatic violence is the "overt expression or serious threat of physical force as part of the plot."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Shows such as ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit|Law &amp; Order SVU]]'' and ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' use murder to frame each episode of their shows, thus underscoring the presence of dramatic and gratuitous violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Berger, A. A. (Ed.). (1987). Television in society. Transaction Publishers.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of dramatic violence underscores the relationship between fear and entertainment. Though death is being used as a plot point, it also functions to cultivate a particular image of looming violence.

===Heavy viewers===
Heavy viewers are individuals who watch at least four hours of television a day,&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; however [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] notes that heavy viewers are now defined as those that watch more than 11 hours of television a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tipping the Scale: Heavy TV Viewers=a Big Opportunity for Advertisers|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/tipping-the-scale-heavy-tv-viewers-a-big-opportunity-for-advertisers.html|website=www.nielsen.com|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy viewers are consistently characterized as being more susceptible to the images and messages on television. They also rely on television more to cultivate their perceptions of the real world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a recent study done on the cultivation effects of [[reality television]], an Indiana University study found that young girls who regularly watched the [[MTV]] hit ''[[Teen Mom]]'' had an unrealistic view of teen pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Study: Heavy viewers of 'Teen Mom' and '16 and Pregnant' have unrealistic views of teen pregnancy: IUB Newsroom: Indiana University|url=http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/01/16-and-pregnant-teen-mom-shows-encourage-teen-pregnancy.shtml|website=news.indiana.edu|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several cognitive mechanisms that explain cultivation effects have been put forth by [[Shrum]] (1995; 1996; 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrum|first=L.J.|title=Assessing the social influence of television: A social cognitive perspective on cultivation effects.|journal=[[Communication Research (journal)|Communication Research]]|year=1995|volume=22|issue=4|pages=402–429|doi=10.1177/009365095022004002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrum|first=L.J.|title=Psychological processes underlying cultivation effects: Further tests of construct accessibility.|journal=[[Human Communication Research]]|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=482–509|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00376.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrum|first=L.J.|title=The role of source confusion in cultivation effects may depend on processing strategy: A comment on Mares (1996).|journal=Human Communication Research|year=1997|volume=24|issue=2|pages=349–358|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1997.tb00418.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrum's availability [[heuristic]] explanation suggests that heavy viewers tend to have more frequent, recent, and vivid instances of television reality on the "top of the head" (i.e., available and accessible) when surveyors ask them questions, resulting in more responses that relate to television viewing and also speedier responses. Another mechanism that might explain the cultivation phenomenon is a cognitive-narrative mechanism. Previous research suggests that the realism of television narratives in combination with individual-level "transportability", or the ability to adopt a less critical stance toward a narrative, might facilitate cultivation effects (e.g., Bilandzic &amp; Busselle, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bilandzic|first=H.|author2=Busselle, R.W|title=Transportation and transportability in the cultivation of genre-consistent attitudes and estimates.|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|year=2008|volume=58|issue=3|pages=508–529|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00397.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magic bullet theory===
The [[Hypodermic needle model|magic bullet]] theory (also known as the '''hypodermic-syringe model''', '''transmission-belt model''', or '''hypodermic needle model''') is a [[Linear model|linear model of communication]]. This theory talks about "the audiences directly influenced by the mass media" and "the media's power on the audiences".

The "magic bullet" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the "media gun" into the viewer's "head" (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Mass Communication Theory|last=Arthur Asa|first=Berger|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|date=5 July 1995|edition=1|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "hypodermic needle model" uses the same idea of direct "injection." It suggests that the media delivers its messages straight into the passive audience's mind (Croteau, Hoynes 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Industries and Audience"|author1=Croteau, D.|author2=Hoynes, W|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages.

===Television reality===
Television reality describes the effects television viewing has on heavy viewers. Cultivation theory research seems to indicate that heavy television viewing can result in the creation of a television reality, which is a set of facts and beliefs based on television content rather than actual facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modeling Behavior from Images of Reality in Television Narratives|last=Tony R.|first=DeMars|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press, Ltd|year=2000|isbn=|location=US|pages=36|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the beliefs of heavy television viewers about the real world are consistent with the repetitive and emphasized images and themes presented on television.&lt;ref name="Growing"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Growing up with television: The cultivation perspective|vauthors=Gerbner G, Gross L, Morgan M, Signorielli N|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=1994|isbn=|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=|quote=|via=|editor= M. Morgan|title=Against the mainstream: The selected works of George Gerbner|pp=193–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, heavy viewing cultivates a television-shaped view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Searching for cognitive processes in the cultivation effect: Adult and adolescent samples in the United States and Australia|last=Hawkins|first=R. P.|author2=Pingree, S.|author3=Alter, I|publisher=|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=553–577|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While viewers might differ in their demographic characteristics, the amount of television viewing can make a difference in terms of their conceptions of social reality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbner|first=George|author2=Larry Gross|author3=Nancy Signorielli|author4=Michael Morgan|year=1980|title=Aging with Television: Image on Television Drama and Conceptions of Social Reality|journal=Journal of Communication |volume=30|issue=1|pp=37–47|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1980.tb01766.x|pmid=7372841|url=http://web.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, people's different degrees of sex-role stereotypes can be traced back to the independent contribution of TV viewing just like others such as sex, age, class, and education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Television viewing time is a main element of creating television reality to the audiences or the viewers. According to Gerbner's research, the more time spent 'living' in the world of television, the more likely people are to report perceptions of social reality which can be traced to television's most persistent representations of life and society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since the 1960s, communication scholars have examined television's contributions to viewers' perceptions of a wide variety of topics and issues. Little effort has been made to investigate the influence of television on perceptions of social reality among adolescents, particularly in the areas of sexism, sex roles, mean world, and television reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/05-Jong-G.-Kang-Stephen-S.-Andersen-Michael-Pfau.pdf|title=Television Viewing and Perception of Social Reality Among Native American Adolescents|author1=Jong G. Kang|author2=Stephen S. Andersen|author3=Michael Pfau|date=1996|website=|publisher=Illinois State University, Augustana College University of Wisconsin, Madison|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of several researchers support the concept of television reality as a consequence of heavy viewing. According to Wyer and Budesheim's research, television messages or information, even when they are not necessarily considered truthful, can still be used in the process of constructing social judgments. Furthermore, indicted invalid information may still be used in subsequent audience's judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=[[Robert S. Wyer|Wyer, Robert S.]]|author2=William H. Unverzagt|year=1985|title=Effects of Instructions to Disregard Information on Its Subsequent Recall and Use in Making Judgments|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=48|issue=3|pages=533–549|pmid=3989660|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.48.3.533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==
Although Gerbner's research focused on violence on TV this theory can be applied to a variety of different situations. Many other theorists have done studies related to the cultivation theory which incorporated different messages than Gerbner's original intent. This research has been conducted in order to defeat two criticisms of the theory; its breadth and lumping of genres.

===Cultivation effects on children===
"There was a positive relationship between childhood television viewing levels and the social reality beliefs in young adulthood. The results of this study suggest that television viewed during childhood may affect the social reality beliefs a person holds as an adult."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; "Accordingly, the present study focuses on the potential effect of childhood television viewing on social reality beliefs during adulthood. The focus of the present study will be childhood exposure to television genres that tend to be violent. Given that it has been argued and demonstrated that measuring exposure to violent content is a more appropriate method for cultivation analyses than measuring overall television exposure levels."&lt;ref name="Karyn Riddle"/&gt;

Another longitudinal study shows how television exposure is associated with overall self-esteem in children. Nicole Martins and Kristen Harrison measured the amount of television viewing in elementary school children and their overall level of self-esteem (not related to perceptions about the body) after television exposure over time. They found that higher levels of television viewing predicted lower self-esteem for White girls, Black girls, and Black boys, but higher self-esteem for White boys. This relationship indicates that exposure to portrayals of White males on television, which tend to be positive, and those of Black men and women and White women which tend to be negative, shape the way children understand their own identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Nicole|last2=Harrison|first2=Kristen|date=16 March 2011|title=Racial and Gender Differences in the Relationship Between Children's Television Use and Self-Esteem|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0093650211401376|journal=[[Communication Research (Journal)|Communication Research]]|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=338–357|doi=10.1177/0093650211401376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International cultivation analysis===
International cultivation analysis attempts to answer the question of whether the medium or the system is the message. Gerbner ''et al.'' found that countries where the television programs were less repetitive and homogeneous than the United States produced less predictable and consistent results.&lt;ref name="Growing" /&gt; The variety of television content is also an important factor. Increased diversity and balance within television channels or programs leads viewers to report similar preferences. Furthermore, importing television programs internationally can elicit variable responses depending on the cultural context and the type of television program. For example, exposure of US television programs to Korean females portrayed a [[liberalism|liberal]] perspective of gender roles and family. However, for the Korean male television viewers, US programs brought out increased hostility and protection of Korean culture. Another study showed that Australian students who watched US television programs (especially adventure and crime shows) were more likely to view Australia as dangerous;&lt;ref name="Growing" /&gt; however, they didn't transfer this danger to America, even though they were watching US television programs. A study conducted by Minnebo and Eggermont in 2007 found that heavy television viewers, over the age of 30, in [[Belgium]] "were more likely to believe that most young people are substance users."&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan"/&gt;

===Lifetime television exposure analysis===
In order to accurately survey and represent findings from cultivation theory research, the duration of television exposure has become a topic for further research. It's stated that "cultivation effect only occurs after long-term, cumulative exposure to stable patterns of content on television."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Television and its viewers: Cultivation theory and research|last=Shanahan|first=J|last2=Morgan|first2=M|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-4331-1368-0|location=Cambridge|pages=286–302|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research that tracks long-term media exposure is very rare and if conducted, must be thoroughly planned out in order to secure dependable results. In a study conducted in 2009, participants were asked to list the number of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' episodes they had viewed in prior and current seasons. The purpose of the study was to gain a perspective of how viewers see doctors based on impressions from television. Findings from the study showed a positive association with [[Grey's Anatomy|''Grey's Anatomy''{{'}}s]] portrayal with real-world doctors' acts of courage. The finding wasn't surprising, as many episodes within ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' often show doctors as courageous, either by employing a detailed view of an operation, or crediting doctors for their empathy in specific patient scenarios. Gerbner and colleagues argue that cultivation effects span total television viewing, not genre- or program-specific viewing (Gerbner et al., 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quick|title=The Effects of Viewing Grey's Anatomy on Perceptions of Doctors and Patient Satisfaction|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/HBEM|journal=[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]|volume=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609184549/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/HBEM|archivedate=9 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Jonathan Cohen and Gabriel Weimann, they found that cultivation through television is more prevalent within the age group of older teenagers and young adults, thus supporting the claim that a cumulative exposure to television throughout a viewer's life has a steady impact on their cultivation longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cultivation revisited: Some genres have some effects on some viewers|year=2000|publisher=|journal=Communication Reports|volume=13|issue=2|pages=99–114|doi=10.1080/08934210009367728|author1=Cohen, J.|author2=Weimann, G.|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on psychosocial health===
A study conducted by Hammermeister, Brock, Winterstein, and Page compares the psychosocial health of viewers that reported no television use, viewers who followed the [[American Academy of Pediatrics|American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)]] suggested consumption of up to 2 hours of television per day, and viewers with high exposure to television. They surveyed 430 participants within the United States implemented via survey method. They found that there was more of an impact on the psychosocial health of women who participated in the study and, "revealed that all the psychosocial variables examined in this study contributed significantly to the one function equation with depression, hopelessness, self-esteem, and weight satisfaction being the strongest discriminators" (Hammermeister, Brock, Winterstein, Page, 260). Findings also exposed the similarity in [[psychosocial]] health data between participants who watched up to 2 hours of television per day and participants who opt out of television consumption all together.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"/&gt;

==="InterTV"===
InterTV is a concept forecasting the inevitable melding of television and online media. Described by Shanahan and Morgan as television's "convergence" with computers, they argue that computers will essentially act as an extension of television through the creation of related websites and online news articles covered within the traditional television journalism realm. Additionally, television programming will also suffer a shift to an online platform in result of [[Streaming media|streaming services]] such as [[Netflix]] and [[Hulu]]. According to Shanahan and Morgan, this may not be the worst thing, as it allows advertisers a direct source in which they can gather information regarding viewers. They state that, "within a market filled with individual interests, desires and the channels to serve them, such a data-gathering enterprise would still allow advertisers to assemble mass audiences from the fragmented media systems". In a sense, this would allow viewers some way to control the content they are fed through the online platform. While advertisers are infringing on viewer information, the correlated result requires them to shift any programming or storyline content to the satisfaction of the viewer. This poses a challenging example in terms of extending the impact of cultivation theory, instead empowering the viewer to cultivate their own television use experience.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Music videos===
Kathleen Beullens, Keith Roe, and Jan Van den Bulck conducted research relating to [[alcohol]] consumption in music videos. The research revealed that high exposure to music videos develops an unrealistic perception of alcohol consumption. Musicians in these videos endorse alcohol in their songs and create a false reality about alcohol and its effects."&lt;ref name="Beullens and Van den Bulck"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beullens|first1=K.|last2=Roe|first2=K.|last3=Van|first3=|last4=den Bulck|first4=J.|year=2012|title=Music Video Viewing as a Marker of Driving After the Consumption of Alcohol|url=|journal=Substance Use &amp; Misuse|volume=47|issue=2|pages=155–165|doi=10.3109/10826084.2012.637449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Research conducted by Dmitri Williams draws the comparison of the effects of television to interactive [[video game]]s. He argues that while the parameters and basic content of the game developed is through the employment of game developers, creators and designers, the role of the "other player" within the game is also essential in the progression of the story within the video game. Essentially, an interactive game allows players to build relationships with others, and thus is more dynamic and unpredictable as compared to traditional television. Williams attempts to research the question of whether video games are as influential as television from a cultivation theory standpoint. Does it impact our [[social reality]]? In the field study, participants were asked to play a [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] game, one in which participants interacted with other players in real time. Crime measures divided into four categories were used to evaluate the correlation between the research hypotheses and cultivation theory. The study proved a strong correlation between the impact of cultivation on participants and the players of the MMORPG game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Dmitri|year=2006|title=Virtual cultivation: Online worlds, offline perceptions|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and sexuality===
====LGBT====
Sara Baker Netzley conducted research in a similar fashion to Gerbner in the way that [[homosexuals]] were depicted on television. This study found that there was an extremely high level of sexual activity in comparison to the amount of homosexual characters that appeared on television. This has led those who are heavy television consumers to believe that the gay community is extremely sexual. Much like the idea of a mean and scary world it gives people a parallel idea of an extremely sexualized gay community."&lt;ref name="Netzley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Netzley|first1=S|year=2010|title=Visibility That Demystifies Gays, Gender, and Sex on Television|url=|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=57|issue=8|pages=968–986|doi=10.1080/00918369.2010.503505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Jerel Calzo and Monique Ward, they first begin by analyzing recent research conducted on the portrayal of gay and lesbian characters on television. While growth in the representation of gay and lesbian characters has continued to grow, they found that most television shows frame gay and lesbian characters in a manner that reinforces [[LGBT stereotypes|homosexual stereotypes]]. Diving into discussion, they even use examples such as ''[[The Ellen Show|Ellen]]'' and ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', describing the storyline content as reinforcing "stereotypes by portraying these characters as lacking stable relationships, as being preoccupied with their sexuality (or not sexual at all), and by perpetuating the perception of gay and lesbian people as laughable, one-dimensional figures (Cooper, 2003; Fouts &amp; Inch, 2005; Herman, 2005)". Their findings confirmed that media genres played an important role in the attitudes developed regarding homosexuality. They also were surprised by the finding that prior prime-time shows, which are no longer on air, reinforced a larger magnitude of acceptance within the LGBTQ realm. They then suggested that because genre played a large impact in the perception that viewers gained while watching certain television shows, more research should be designated towards, "more genre-driven effects analyses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Media Exposure and Viewers' Attitudes Toward Homosexuality: Evidence for Mainstreaming or Resonance?|year=2009|journal=[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]|volume=53|issue=2|pages=280–299|doi=10.1080/08838150902908049|author1=Jerel P. Calzo M.A.|author2=L. Monique Ward|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women====
Beverly Roskos-Ewoldsen, John Davies and David Roskos-Ewoldsen posit that perceptions of women are integrated in a rather stereotypical fashion compared to portrayals of men on television. They state that, "men are characters in TV shows at about a 2 to 1 ratio to women(Gerbner et al., 2002)". Viewers who consume more television usually also have more sexist views of women (Gerbner et al., 2002; Morgan, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roskos-Ewoldsen|first=Beverly|last2=Davies|first2=John|last3=Roskos-Ewoldsen|first3=David|date=2004|title=Implications of the mental models approach for cultivation theory|journal=Communications: The European Journal of Communication Research|volume=29|issue=3|doi=10.1515/comm.2004.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that women are more likely to be portrayed as victims on television than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Television news and the cultivation of fear of crime|year=2003|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=53|issue=1|pages=88–104|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb03007.x|author1=Romer, D.|author2=[[Kathleen Hall Jamieson|Jamieson, K. H.]]|author3=Aday, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Sink and Dana Mastro studied women and gender depictions on American primetime television. Although women are often perceived to have better representation on television in recent years, these researchers show that this is not necessarily the case. Women are significantly proportionally underrepresented on primetime television, making up only 39% of characters despite the fact that women make up 50.9% of the population in the US. Men were also portrayed as more dominant than women, and although men were more often objectified, women were consistently portrayed as hyperfeminized and hypersexualized. Fewer older women appeared during primetime compared to men, and were often shown to be less competent than older male characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sink|first=Alexander|last2=Mastro|first2=Dana|date=2 January 2017|title=Depictions of Gender on Primetime Television: A Quantitative Content Analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15205436.2016.1212243|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=20|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.1080/15205436.2016.1212243|issn=1520-5436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual attitudes====
A study by Bradley J. Bond and Kristin L. Drogos examined the relationship between exposure to the television program ''Jersey Shore'' and sexual attitudes and behavior in college-aged adults. They found a positive relationship between time spent watching ''Jersey Shore'' and increased sexual permissiveness. This effect was found to be stronger in the younger participants than older participants, and held true even when the researchers controlled for other influences on participants' sexual attitudes such as religious beliefs and parents' attitudes. This higher level of sexually permissive behavior and attitudes was not a result of higher overall exposure to television, but to higher exposure to ''Jersey Shore'', a highly sexualized program, specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=Bradley J.|last2=Drogos|first2=Kristin L.|date=2 January 2014|title=Sex on the Shore: Wishful Identification and Parasocial Relationships as Mediators in the Relationship Between Jersey Shore Exposure and Emerging Adults' Sexual Attitudes and Behaviors|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15213269.2013.872039|journal=Media Psychology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=102–126|doi=10.1080/15213269.2013.872039|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and ethnicity===
Meghan S. Sanders and Srividya Ramasubramanian studied perceptions which African American media consumers hold about fictional characters portrayed in film and television. They found that, while study participants tended to view all African American characters positively, social class, rather than race or ethnicity, mattered more in perceptions about the warmth and competence of a character. Their study suggests that the race and ethnicity of media consumers need to be taken into account in cultivation studies because media consumers with different backgrounds likely perceive media portrayals and their faithfulness to reality differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Meghan S.|last2=Ramasubramanian|first2=Srividya|date=1 January 2012|title=An Examination of African Americans' Stereotyped Perceptions of Fictional Media Characters|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10646175.2012.641869|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|volume=23|issue=1|pages=17–39|doi=10.1080/10646175.2012.641869|issn=1064-6175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz and David Ta examined the cultivation effects of video games on White students' perceptions of Black and Asian individuals. While no significant effects were found for perceptions of Asian individuals, researchers found that increased time spent playing video games, no matter what genre, held less positive views of Black people. They also found that real-life interaction with Black individuals did not change this effect. Behm-Morawitz and Ta suggest that the stable, negative racial and ethnic stereotypes portrayed in video game narratives of any genre impact real-world beliefs in spite of more varied real-life interaction with racial and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Politics and policy preferences===
[[Diana Mutz|Diana C. Mutz]] and Lilach Nir conducted a study of how fictional television narratives can influence viewers' policy preferences and positive or negative attitudes regarding the justice system in the real world. They found that positive portrayals of the criminal justice system were associated with more positive views toward the system in real life, whereas negative television portrayals were associated with viewers feeling that the criminal justice system often works unfairly. Furthermore, researchers found that these attitudes did influence viewers' policy preferences concerning the criminal justice system in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mutz|first=Diana C.|last2=Nir|first2=Lilach|date=31 March 2010|title=Not Necessarily the News: Does Fictional Television Influence Real-World Policy Preferences?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15205430902813856|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=13|issue=2|pages=196–217|doi=10.1080/15205430902813856|issn=1520-5436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Anita Atwell Seate and Dana Mastro studied news coverage of immigration and its relationship with immigration policy preferences and negative attitudes about immigrants. They found that exposure to negative messages about immigrants in the news influenced anxious feelings towards the outgroup (i.e. immigrants), particularly when the news showed an example of a member of this outgroup on the program. This exposure did not necessarily influence immigration policy preferences, but long-term exposure to messages of this kind can affect policy preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seate|first=Anita Atwell|last2=Mastro|first2=Dana|date=2 April 2016|title=Media's influence on immigration attitudes: An intergroup threat theory approach|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2015.1068433|journal=[[Communication Monographs]]|volume=83|issue=2|pages=194–213|doi=10.1080/03637751.2015.1068433|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katerina-Eva Matsa explores cultivation effects through her thesis on television's impact on political engagement in Greece. She describes the role of satirical television within the cultural realm in Greece and how this form of television engrains the perception that Greek political institutions are corrupt, thus negatively influencing the public's overall opinion of politics in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Matsa, K. E.|year=2010|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/552931/matsaKaterina.pdf?sequence=1|title=Laughing at politics: effects of television satire on political engagement in Greece|publisher=Georgetown University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New media===
Michael Morgan, James Shanahan, and Nancy Signorielli conceptualize applications of cultivation theory to the study of [[new media]]. They note that media technology has never been static, and that there will always be new forms of media. However, in the present, older methods for cultivation analysis may have to move away from counting hours of television viewed, and take up a [[big data]] approach. These authors argue that, although many were skeptical that cultivation theory would be applicable with the increasing importance of new media, these media still use narrative, and since those narratives affect us, cultivation theory is still relevant for new media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Michael|last2=Shanahan|first2=James|last3=Signorielli|first3=Nancy|date=3 September 2015|title=Yesterday's New Cultivation, Tomorrow|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15205436.2015.1072725|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=18|issue=5|pages=674–699|doi=10.1080/15205436.2015.1072725|issn=1520-5436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen M. Croucher applies cultivation theory to his theory of social media and its effects on immigrant cultural adaptation. He theorizes that immigrants who use dominant social media while they are still in the process of adapting to their new culture will develop perceptions about their host society through the use of this media. He believes that this cultivation effect will also impact the way immigrants interact with host country natives in offline interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croucher|first=Stephen M.|date=1 November 2011|title=Social Networking and Cultural Adaptation: A Theoretical Model|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/17513057.2011.598046|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|volume=4|issue=4|pages=259–264|doi=10.1080/17513057.2011.598046|issn=1751-3057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===

Cultivation theory attempts to predict that media viewing has an effect on the values and beliefs that people have and the things they believe are "reality". A study conducted by David Atkin from the University of Connecticut revealed insights about television viewing of sports and the values of its viewers. An hypothesis that was researched stated "Level of agreement with sports-related values (i.e., being physically fit, athletic, and active) is positively related to participation in sports-related media and leisure activities" (Atkin 324). Studies were conducted and research was presented and the conclusion was that the hypothesis was correct. The study specifically found that "those for whom being physically fit, being athletic and being active are important also engage in more sports media" (Atkin). In this instance, cultivation theory is present because heavier exposure is related to greater agreement with the values that are presented.

Another related study felt that attendance at live and mediated sporting events might cultivate audience values that are consistent with the value of sports.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In an article titled "Sport in Society: Cultures, Commerce, Media and Politics", discussion was started about sports and cultivation theory. Cultivation theory can be applicable to many different aspects of society. The research shared "the line of research has found that, as exposure to television increases, an individual's beliefs and opinions of the real-world become more similar to that of the television world." This statement proves to be support of the previous hypothesis and is support for cultivation theory being present in the sports world. If someone engages in sports media, their beliefs of being physically fit and active will then become more and more similar to the beliefs of those they are watching and listening to in the sports media.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Cultivation theory and sports are just beginning to be studied. There are many more aspects that are being studied. One other aspect is the difference between those who participate in sporting events and those who watch them. Another part of cultivation theory can be explained by people being less active, because of what they watch on television and the rise in obesity levels. Because people don't see a lot of active people on television, their "reality" is that people no longer need to be active 30 or so minutes per day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Cultivation theory can be applied to sports as it can be applied to many other areas of media. A prime example of this is America's shift toward so-called "violent sports". A survey taken in 98 show that only 67% of American teenagers considered themselves baseball fans, compare that to football which is 78%. Just as we consume violent TV shows we also love the more violent sports. This 98 study relates perfectly to&amp;nbsp; current TV ratings, as football has by far the most hours watched since 2005 at 111.9 million hours.&amp;nbsp; Leo W. Jeffres, Jae-Won Lee, and Kimberly A. Neuendorf say that "new "media logic" that favors more violent, action-oriented sports, while slower-paced sports have been relegated to secondary status in the United States."

Past cultivation theory research supports the idea that the more someone watches television, the more that individual believes that the television content is like real world reality. This is likely to be found true when it comes to televised violence. But with new research emerging we now know that this cultivation effect is not likely to arise among individuals who watch sports. For example, an individual who happens to watch a lot of football is not going to view the world as a frightening place because of the violence that goes on during games.

Although there was no true correlation between the cultivation theory and sports, there has been research done on the level of violence in sports content and the effects it has on viewers. Results found by Raney and Depalma (2006) found that individuals were less likely to report being in a positive mood after watching violent sports content and its effect on viewers (Wanta 2013).

==Criticisms==
A number of scholars have critiqued Gerbner's assertions about cultivation theory, particularly its intentions and its scope. One critique of the theory analyzes the objective of the theory. Communications professor [[Jennings Bryant]] posits that cultivation research focuses more on the effects rather than who or what is being influenced. Bryant goes on to assert that the research to date has more to do with the "whys" and "hows" of a theory as opposed to gathering normative data as to the "whats", "whos", and "wheres".&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Road Most Traveled: Yet Another Cultivation Critique|date=1 March 1986|publisher=|journal=[[Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media]]|volume=30|issue=2|pages=231–335|doi=10.1080/08838158609386621|author=Bryant, Jennings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical leap===
Critics have also faulted the logical consistency of cultivation analysis, noting that the methods employed by cultivation analysis researchers do not match the conceptual reach of the theory. The research supporting this theory uses social scientific methods to address questions related to the humanities.&lt;ref name="wrtl" /&gt; Another possibility is that the relationship between TV viewing and fear of crime is like the relationship between a runny nose and a sore throat. Neither one causes the other—they are both caused by something else.".&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;{{Better source|reason=This accusation is quite general in communication field and may be true. However, this source seems to general to properly build the case for this assertion. A proper peer-reviewed scientific article is needed to show that cultivation theory really doesn't isolation properly cause and effect.|date=March 2017}} Many also question the breadth of Gerbner's research. When using the Cultural Indicators strategy, Gerbner separated his research into three parts. The second part focused on the effects of media when looking at [[gender]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]/ethnicity, and [[Job (role)|occupation]]. Michael Hughes writes: "it does not seem reasonable that these three variables exhaust the possibilities of variables available…which may be responsible for spurious relationships between television watching and the dependent variables in the Gerbner et al. analysis."&lt;ref name="Hughes"/&gt;{{rp|287}} Also, the variables Gerbner did choose can also vary by the amount of time a person has available to watch TV.

===Lived experience===
Another critique comes from [[Daniel Chandler]]: "those who live in high-crime areas are more likely to stay at home and watch television and also to believe that they have a greater chance of being attacked than are those in low-crime areas." He claims as well, "when the viewer has some direct lived experience of the subject matter this may tend to reduce any cultivation effect."&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler, Daniel. [http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/cultiv.html ''Cultivation Theory'']. Aberystwyth University, 18 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; While television does have some effect on how we perceive the world around us, Gerbner's study does not consider the lived experiences of those that do inhabit high crime areas.

===Forms of violence===
Gerbner is also criticized for his lumping of all forms of violence. Chandler argues, "different genres—even different programmes—contribute to the shaping of different realities, but cultivation analysis assumes too much homogeneity in television programmes".&lt;ref name="Chandler" /&gt; This point is addressed by [[Horace Newcomb]] (1978) who argues that violence is not presented as uniformly on television as the theory assumes; therefore, television cannot be responsible for cultivating the same sense of reality for all viewers.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newcomb|first1=H|year=1978|title=Assessing the violence profile studies of Gerbner and Gross: A humanistic critique and suggestion|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=5|issue=|pages=264–283|doi=10.1177/009365027800500303}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering different programs that are on television, it makes sense that scholars would criticize Gerbner's lack of categories. For example, [[Saturday morning cartoon]] "play" violence is in combination with a murder on ''[[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|Law and Order]]''. This does not seem to logically fuse together. Morgan and Shanahan understand this dispute, but they contend "that people (especially heavy viewers) do not watch isolated genres only, and that any 'impact' of individual program types should be considered in the context of the overall viewing experience".&lt;ref name="Morgan and Shanahan"/&gt; A study by Karyn Riddle attempts to address this critique, however, by combining heuristic processing models with cultivation theory to examine how not just exposure to violence in television, but also how vividly it is portrayed impacts cultivation effects. She found that there was an interaction effect for portrayals which were vivid and viewed frequently. In this case, real world beliefs were significantly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riddle|first=Karyn|date=28 May 2010|title=Always on My Mind: Exploring How Frequent, Recent, and Vivid Television Portrayals Are Used in the Formation of Social Reality Judgments|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15213261003800140|journal=Media Psychology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=155–179|doi=10.1080/15213261003800140|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanist critique===
Cultivation analysis has also been criticized by [[humanists]] for examining such a large cultural question. Because the theory discusses cultural effects, many humanists feel offended, thinking that their field has been misinterpreted. [[Horace Newcomb]] (1978) writes "More than any other research effort in the area of television studies the work of Gerbner and Gross and their associates sits squarely at the juncture of the social sciences and the humanities."&lt;ref name=Newcomb/&gt;{{rp|265}}

The theory has also received criticism for ignoring other issues such as the perceived [[Philosophical realism|realism]] of the televised content, which could be essential in explaining people's understanding of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minnebo|first1=J.|last2=Van Acker|first2=A.|year=2004|title=Does television influence adolescents' perceptions of and attitudes toward people with [[mental illness]]?|url=|journal=Journal of Community Psychology|volume=32|issue=|pages=267–275|doi=10.1002/jcop.20001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson, Martins, &amp; Markse (2005) argue that attention to television might be more important to cultivating perceptions than only the amount of television viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=B. J.|last2=Martins|first2=N.|last3=Marske|first3=A. L.|year=2005|title=Children's and parents' fright reactions to kidnapping stories in the news|url=|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=72|issue=|pages=46–70|doi=10.1080/0363775052000342526}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, C. R. Berger (2005) writes that because the theory ignores cognitive processes, such as attention or rational thinking style, it is less useful than desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=C. R.|year=2005|title=Slippery slopes to apprehension: Rationality and graphical depictions of increasingly threatening trends|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=32|issue=|pages=3–28|doi=10.1177/0093650204271397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived reality===
The correlation between cultivation effects and [[Philosophy of perception|perceived reality]] have been criticized due to the inconsistent findings from various research conducted on the subject. Hawkins and Pingree (1980) found that participants that reported a lower perceived reality scoring actually showed a stronger cultivation impact. Potter (1986) found that, "different dimensions and levels of perceived reality were associated with different magnitudes of cultivation effects". Additionally, a study conducted by Shrum, Wyer and O'Guinn (1994) showed a zero percentage correlation between perceived reality and cultivation effects.

===Utility===
Cultivation analysis has been criticized that its claims are not always useful in explaining the phenomenon of interest: how people see the world. Some also argue that violence is not presented as uniformly on television as the theory assumes, so television cannot be reliably responsible for cultivating the same sense of reality for all viewers. In addition, cultivation analysis is criticized for ignoring other issues such as the perceived realism of the televised content, which might be critical in explaining people's understanding of reality. Attention to television might be more important to cultivating perceptions than simply the amount of television viewing, so the fact that the cultivation analysis theory seems to ignore [[cognition]] such as attention or rational thinking style deems it to be less useful.&lt;ref name="wrtl"&gt;{{cite book|author=West, R.|author2=Turner, L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">In [[linguistics]] and in particular in [[natural language understanding]], a '''dialog act''' is an utterance, in the context of a conversational dialog, that serves a function in the dialog. Types of dialog acts include a question, a statement, or a request for action.&lt;ref name="McTear2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McTear |first1=Michael |last2=Callejas |first2=Zoraida |last3=Griol |first3=David |title=The Conversational Interface: Talking to Smart Devices |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319329673 |pages=162-166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_w0DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%22Dialog+act%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8kqaEirHbAhVxFjQIHUPADJ0Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dialog%20act%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialog acts are a type of  [[speech act]]. 

Dialog act recognition, also known as spoken utterance classification, is an important part of spoken language understanding. AI inference models or statistical models are used to recognize and classify dialog acts.&lt;ref name="McTear2016" /&gt;

A [[dialog system]] typically includes a taxonomy of dialog types or ''tags'' that classify the different functions dialog acts can play.  One study had 42 types of dialog act in their taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;

The research on dialog acts have increased since 1999, after [[spoken dialog systems]] became commercial reality.

'''Ding''' (also called ''Di'' or ''Dzing'') is a [[Bantu language]] that is spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

Maho (2009) considers the following to be distinct languages closely related to Ding:
: B861 Ngul (Ngwi), B862 Lwel (Kelwer), B863 Mpiin (Pindi), B864 West Ngongo, B865 [[Nzadi language|Nzadi]]
(See [[Boma–Dzing languages]].) 

Only Ngul, which includes Ngwi,{{fix|text=is this the Ngwii dialect of Mbere?}} has an ISO code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7829">'''Focus on form''' ('''FonF''') is an approach to [[language education]] in which learners are made aware of the grammatical form of language features that they are already able to use communicatively. It is contrasted with ''[[focus on forms]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes the final "S" is capitalized, making ''focus on formS'', or '''form-focused instruction''',; this is done to more readily distinguish it from ''focus on form'',&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited solely to the explicit focus on language features, and ''[[focus on meaning]]'', which is limited to focus on [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] with no attention paid to form at all. For a teaching intervention to qualify as ''focus on form'' and not as ''focus on forms'', the learner must be aware of the meaning and use of the language features before the form is brought to their attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doughty|Williams|1998|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Focus on form'' was proposed by [[Michael Long (academic)|Michael Long]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="Long1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1991}}. This paper was originally presented at the European-North-American Symposium on Needed Research in Foreign Language Education, Bellagio, Italy, in 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The concept of ''focus on form'' was motivated by the lack of support for the efficacy of ''focus on forms'' on the one hand, and clear advantages demonstrated by instructed language learning over uninstructed learning on the other.&lt;ref name="Long1991" /&gt; The research conflicting with ''focus on forms'' has been wide-ranging;&lt;ref name="Long1998p16-17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|Robinson|1998|pp=16–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; learners typically acquire language features in [[sequences of acquisition|sequences]], not all at once,&lt;ref&gt;For review, see e.g. {{Harvtxt|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=126–135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and most of the stages the learners' [[interlanguage]]s pass through will exhibit non-native-like language forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen|1984}}, {{Harvnb|Huebner|1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the progression of these stages is not clean; learners may use language features correctly in some situations but not in others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pica|1983}}, {{Harvnb|Young|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or they may exhibit [[U-shaped learning]], in which native-like use may temporarily revert to non-native-like use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kellerman|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; None of these findings sit well with the idea that students will learn exactly what you teach them, when you teach it.&lt;ref name="Long1998p16-17" /&gt; 

In a review of the literature comparing instructed with uninstructed language learning, Long found a clear advantage for instructed learning in both the rate of learning and the ultimate level reached.&lt;ref name="Long1991" /&gt; An important finding that supported Long's view came from [[French language|French]] [[language immersion]] programs in [[Canada]]; even after students had years of meaning-focused lessons filled with comprehensible input, their spoken language remained far from native-like, with many grammatical errors. This is despite the fact that they could speak fluently and had native-like listening abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Ray Jackendoff]] points out that applying folk linguistics to education can be potentially damaging to the attainment of students who speak [[less standard dialect]]s. Characterising different speech as ''good'' or ''bad'' can have a serious effect.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

The scientific understanding of language by linguists often contradicts that of native speakers.&lt;ref name=BerGr/&gt;&lt;ref name=KordiJin/&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|List of common misconceptions about language learning}}

Jackendoff (2003){{Ref label|a|a|none}} cites the following statements as typical examples of folk-linguistic beliefs.

* Claim: "Parents teach their children to talk". Adults assume that children either learn language directly from their parents or via simple [[imitation]]. 
** On the contrary, research in child [[language acquisition]] shows that a child acquires language more automatically, through a systematic pattern rarely noticed by adults. Although interaction with parents, adults and other children is crucial, it is actually very difficult to "correct" a child. Instead most children are able to learn to speak native languages (including those of their peers of the same age) through a process called "acquisition".{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Any [[speech error|error]]s noticed by a parent are often self-corrected by the child weeks or months later.
* Claim: "Children will get confused if they try to speak more than one language". Many parents are afraid a child cannot sort out input from multiple languages. 
** In reality, children can easily become [[simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual]] (native proficiency in two languages) if they are exposed to more than one language. There may be period of confusion, but most children are able to segregate two distinct grammars.
* Claim: "There is a proper, correct English".  Speakers generally value an educated form of the language, often its written form, and that other [[dialect]]al/spoken forms are considered structurally inferior or "sloppy", and speakers of these forms are often regarded as "stupid, lazy, sloppy, hick" or other pejorative terms.  
** However, linguists generally agree that dialectal forms such as [[AAVE|African American Vernacular English (AAVE)]]  have the same grammatical complexity as a standard English. Folk linguistic beliefs view these forms as inferior, and as a result speakers of non-standard forms often suffer forms of linguistic discrimination.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}
* Claim: "The modern language is going downhill". [[linguistic purism|Purist]]s opine that changes in the spoken language (e.g. [[new word]]s, innovations in grammar, new pronunciation patterns) are generally regarded as being detrimental rather than just change.
** In fact, living languages are not static. Their evolution is not just a modern phenomenon.

Other beliefs may include:
* A belief that a language's grammar can negatively influence and restrict how people think. This is also known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis|strong Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]. Although some linguists do advocate a form of this, many linguists reject this as being too simplistic.{{Ref label|b|b|none}} For instance, just because a language does not formally distinguish "he" vs. "she" in their personal pronouns does not mean that speakers do not distinguish and treat men and women differently. Similarly, just because English lacks a formal [[hodiernal tense]] does not mean that English speakers cannot distinguish events which occur "today" versus those on another day.
* Examples of [[folk etymology]] such as interpreting ''[[asparagus]]'' as "sparrow-grass".{{Ref label|b|b|none}} These are cases where speakers deduce an incorrect word origin. Another folk etymology is the assumption that the New York place name ''[[Fishkill, New York|Fishkill]]'' (on [[Fishkill Creek]]) means a place to kill fish. In reality, ''[[kill (creek)|-kill]]'' is from a Dutch word meaning "creek" (found also in river names such as [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wallkill River|Wallkill, New Jersey]]). However the folk etymology caused animal rights groups such as [[PETA]] to demand that the town should be renamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A fishy name will stay the same|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9609/06/fishy.name/| publisher=CNN|date=September 6, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generally recognized as safe and effective''' (abbreviated as '''GRASE''', '''GRAS/E''', or '''GRAS/GRAE''') is designation for certain old drugs that do not require prior approval from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in order to enter the [[United States]] marketplace because they are generally recognized as safe and effective by medical professionals.

The [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] defines a "new drug", which requires prior approval, as any drug "the composition of which is such that such drug is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/FDCActChaptersIandIIShortTitleandDefinitions/ucm086297.htm FDCA § 201(p)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to emphasize that "safe and effective" is always conditional on following the directions. For example, [[aspirin]] can be lethal when taken in large amounts but is approved to be GRAS/E by FDA for [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] use as directed.

FDA has acknowledged the possible existence of drugs that could be considered GRAS/E that they have not found to be GRAS/E yet. As FDA stated in its 2006 Guidance on Marketed Unapproved drugs: "A product would not be considered a new drug if it is generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE) and has been used to a material extent and for a material time… As mentioned above, the Agency believes it is not likely that any currently marketed prescription drug product is grandfathered or is otherwise not a new drug. However, the Agency recognizes that it is at least theoretically possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070290.pdf|title=Guidance for FDA Staff and Industry: Marketed Unapproved Drugs — Compliance Policy Guide|date=June 2006|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. FDA]]|accessdate=2009-07-12|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''H. Leivick''' (pen name of '''Leivick Halpern''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://yiddishbookcenter.org/+10319 On National Poetry Month], National Yiddish Book Center. Accessed online 10 April 2007. The page also contains a poem by Leivick (ייִדישע פּאָעטן ["Yiddish Poets"]) and links to a recording of Leivick reading the poem.&lt;/ref&gt; December 25, 1888 &amp;ndash; December 23, 1962) was a [[Yiddish language]] writer, known for his 1921 "dramatic poem in eight scenes" ''[[The Golem (Leivick)|The Golem]]''. He also wrote many highly political, realistic plays, including "Shop." He adopted the pen name of Leivick to avoid being confused with [[Moyshe-Leyb Halpern]], another prominent Yiddish poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.com/nytimes/nytimes_golem.html |title=Home - MET Group |publisher=Met.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and imprisonment==
Leivick was born in [[Chervyen]], [[Belarus]], the oldest of nine children. His father was a Yiddish instructor for young servants. Leivick was raised in a traditional Jewish household and attended a [[yeshiva]] for several years, an experience he thoroughly disliked and depicted in his dramatic poem ''Chains of the Messiah.'' Leivick joined the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]] before or during the [[1905 Russian Revolution]]. The influence of the organization helped to convince Leivick to become secular and to focus his writing on Yiddish rather than Hebrew.

In 1906 Leivick was arrested by Russian authorities for distributing revolutionary literature. He refused any legal assistance during his trial and delivered a speech denouncing the government instead:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I will not defend myself. Everything that I have done I did in full consciousness. I am a member of the Jewish revolutionary party, the Bund, and I will do everything in my power to overthrow the [[tsarist autocracy]], its bloody henchmen, and you as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leivick, then only eighteen, was sentenced to four years of forced labor and permanent exile to [[Siberia]]. His prison years were spent in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Moscow]] and [[Minsk]], where he wrote ''Chains of the Messiah.'' In March 1912 he was marched to Siberia on foot, a journey that lasted more than four months. Leivick was eventually smuggled out of Siberia with the assistance of Jewish revolutionaries in America and sailed to America in the summer of 1913.

==Rise to fame==
By the early 1920s, Leivick was writing poetry and drama for several Yiddish dailies, including the [[Communist Party USA|Communist]] ''[[Morgen Freiheit]]''. From 1936 to his death, he wrote regularly for ''[[Der Tog]]''. He was also active as an editor, working with fellow writer [[Joseph Opatoshu]] on an exhaustive series of Yiddish anthologies. Leivick was involved with ''[[Di Yunge]]'', a group of avant-garde American-Yiddish poets who praised Yiddish for its artistic and aesthetic possibilities, not merely a conduit for disseminating radical politics to the immigrant masses. ''Di Yunge'' included such notable personalities as [[Moyshe-Leyb Halpern]] and Mani Leib.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/+10291 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728054026/http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/+10291 |date=July 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leivick spent most of his life employed as a wallpaper-hanger while simultaneously pursuing his writing.

Leivick's style was [[neo-Romantic]] and marked by a deep [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] pessimism combined with an almost naive interest and yearning for the mystical and [[messiah|messianic]], themes that continually appeared in his writing, particularly ''The Golem,'' which depicted the Jewish [[Messiah]] and [[Jesus Christ]] as representatives of a peaceful redemption, only to be chased away by the [[Maharal of Prague]] and his violent [[Golem]], who ultimately rampaged through the streets of Prague injuring large numbers of people, both Jews and Christians. In ''The Golem,'' Leivick simultaneously condemned any attempts to heal the world through violence, but also highlighted the fallibility and impotence of all would-be Messiahs. The poem was widely interpreted as a thinly veiled critique of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and caused Leivick to be criticized by the [[Soviet Union]] and Communist Yiddishists. Leivick stopped writing for the Communist papers in 1929 following their public support for the [[1929 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] in Palestine and broke off all connections with the left following the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939.

Leivick's writing also incorporated his deep childhood wounds from his abusive father and unpleasant experiences with Orthodox Judaism, as well as his years of imprisonment. Leivick's own suffering strongly influenced that of his poetic characters', taking on near-mythic proportions and requiring similarly grandiose acts of redemption. Many of his poems dealt with themes of illness or exile, and his more realistic works were often set in sweatshops, like the ones Leivick had worked in as a new immigrant in [[Philadelphia]]. Leivick's work strongly resonated with the Yiddish public and helped him become one of the most prominent Yiddish poets in the world.

==Legacy==
The Leyvik House, named after H. Leivick, is a three-story building in Tel Aviv founded in 1970. It serves as the offices for the Association of Yiddish Writers and Journalists in Israel, the H. Leyvik Publishing House, and the Israeli Center for Yiddish Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Created by shay jacoby |url=http://www.leyvik.org.il/ArticlesEN2.aspx |title=אגודת סופרי ועיתונאי יידיש בישראל - What is The Leyvik House? |publisher=leyvik.org.il |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See Wiktionary||hafta|meaning of the word}}
'''Hafta''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: هفته) is the Persian word for [[week]] and is also used as a loanword in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Urdu]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. A week has seven days, and is possible that it could be from Hepta, for seven.

'''Hafta''' ([[Devanagari]]: हफ़्ता) is also [[slang]] for the [[protection money]] collected periodically by gangsters and corrupt policemen. In case of policemen, however even bribes paid are often quoted as giving ''hafta.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ipaidabribe.com/reports/paid/paying-rs-25000-monthly-hafta-police-our-restaurant|title = Paying Rs 25,000 monthly hafta to police for our restaurant|website = www.ipaidabribe.com|access-date = 2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meaning seems to have gained its popularity because of its usage as part of [[Bombay Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sidthebohemian.deviantart.com/art/Mumbai-Slang-47881860|title = Mumbai Slang|website = sidthebohemian.deviantart.com|access-date = 2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named so because the most common collection period is one week. The practice is highly prevalent in [[India]] and a refusal to pay up has its consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aamboli.com/translate/%25E0%25A4%25B9%25E0%25A4%25AB%25E0%25A4%25BC%25E0%25A5%258D%25E0%25A4%25A4%25E0%25A4%25BE|title = हफ़्ता- Translation, Meaning in Hindi, Thesaurus, Shabdkosh, examples.|last = AamBoli.com|website = www.aamboli.com|access-date = 2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031006/ldh1.htm Refusing ‘hafta’ to cop costs shoemaker his life]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
''Hafta'' has been used in the title of low-budget action movies in [[Bollywood]]. Some of the examples include movies like ''[[Hafta Vasuli]]'' (1998), ''[[Hafta Bandh]]'' (1991).

'''Hans Alex Keilson''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦɑns ˈkɛilsɔn}}; 12 December 1909 – 31 May 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/author-hans-keilson-dies-101|title=Author Hans Keilson dies at 101|work=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Jewish German/[[Dutch people|Dutch]] novelist, poet, psychoanalyst, and child psychologist. He was best known for his novels set during the Second World War, during which he was an active member of the Dutch resistance.

Keilson, having worked with traumatized orphans, mainly wrote about traumas induced by the war. His first novel was published in 1934, but most of his works were published after the war. In 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' 's [[Francine Prose]] described Keilson as "one of the world's greatest writers", notably honouring Keilson's achievements in the year in which he turned 101 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Francine Prose, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/books/review/Prose-t.html?pagewanted=all As Darkness Falls]," ''New York Times Sunday Book Review'', 5 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===1928–40: Exile===
From 1928 to 1934, Keilson studied [[pharmacology]] in Berlin, but due to the Nazi law prohibiting Jews from employment, Keilson was employed as a professional [[gym teacher]] in Jewish private schools, and occasionally made money as a musician. During this period, Keilson also met his first wife, graphologist Gertrud Manz (1901).
In 1936, the couple went into [[exile]] and fled to the [[Netherlands]]. During his time here, Keilson wrote a few books in Dutch language, crediting himself under the pseudonym Benjamin Cooper.

===1941–69: World War II and aftermath===
In 1941, Keilson went into hiding and had to leave his pregnant wife behind. His wife gave birth to a daughter, Barbara, in the same year; she pretended the girl's father was a German officer to prevent prosecution. Meanwhile, Keilson had moved in with a married couple in [[Delft]], taking on a new identity as physician Dr. Van der Linden. During this time, the Dutch resistance asked him to pay visits to Jewish children that had been separated from their parents after they had gone into hiding. These experiences in particular formed the main inspiration for Keilson's later works.
Keilson reunited with his wife and daughter after the war. He and Gertrud were unable to marry before the war. In Germany they couldn't marry because of Keilson's Jewish origins. In the Netherlands it was not possible to marry for the Dutch law as German citizens. And so, when the war was over they married within the Liberal Jewish Community of Amsterdam. After the war Gertrud had to explain to the Dutch neighbours that her husband was indeed German, but also Jewish, to avoid further consequences.
Keilson had to requalify for his physician's licence, should he want to work in the Netherlands, and did so. He specialized as a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. In 1969, Gertrud died.

During the war, Keilson's parents were deported to [[Auschwitz]], where both died. In later interviews Keilson expressed deep regret for being unable to save his parents.

===1970–2009: Second marriage===
In 1970 Keilson married literature historian Marita Lauritz (1935), 25 years his junior. Marita gave birth to his, and her, second daughter, Bloeme, in 1974. He published several more works and received little media attention. On his special birthday anniversaries, such as his 70th, 80th and 90th birthday, Dutch media would do interviews with him.

===2010–11: recognition===
In 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s [[Francine Prose]] described Keilson as "one of the world's greatest writers". Much media attention, in both the United States and his adopted home country, the Netherlands, was given to the fact that Keilson received this acknowledgement at the age of 100. Keilson was invited to Dutch talkshow ''[[De Wereld Draait Door]]'', where he was interviewed by presenter [[Matthijs van Nieuwkerk]]. Many more articles and interviews appeared in the following year, worldwide, and by then his ''Der Tod des Widersachers'' ("The Death of the Adversary") had been translated in 20 languages.

He died on 31 May 2011 in Hilversum, at the age of 101.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/books/hans-keilson-novelist-of-life-in-nazi-run-europe-dies-at-101.html?ref=deathsobituaries|title=Hans Keilson, Novelist of Life in Nazi-Run Europe, Dies at 101|date=2 June 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is Silver Professor of Philosophy at [[New York University]] and a notable contributor to philosophy of language, mind, and mathematics.  

Field is also Distinguished Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy, [[University of Birmingham]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/philosophy/field-hartry.aspx Professor Hartry Field] - Department of Philosophy - University of Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Field earned his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Harvard University]] under the direction of [[Hilary Putnam]].  He taught first at [[Princeton University]], and then at the [[University of Southern California]] and [[City University of New York Graduate Center]] before joining the NYU faculty.

Field was elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2003&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/field-hartry-1956&lt;/ref&gt; and is also a past winner of the [[Lakatos Prize]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/1987/09/15/1986-lakatos-award-bas-van-fraassen-and-hartry-field/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Field's first work was a commentary on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s theory of [[truth]], which he has worked on since 1972.  His current view on this matter is in favor of a [[deflationary theory of truth]]. His most influential work produced in this period is probably "Theory Change and the Indeterminacy of Reference" (''Journal of Philosophy'', '''70'''(14): 462–481), in which he introduced the concept of partial [[denotation]].

In the 1980s, Field started a project in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] discussing [[mathematical fictionalism]], the doctrine that all mathematical statements are merely useful fictions, and should not be taken to be literally true.  More precisely, Field holds that the existence of  [[set (mathematics)|sets]] may be denied, in opposition to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Yablo, Stephen. [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/factual/papers/YabloMistake.pdf "Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?"] ''Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume'' 72.1 (1998) p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his current work is in semantic [[paradox]]es. In 2008, he gave the [[John Locke Lectures]], entitled "Logic, Normativity, and Rational Revisability."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures John Locke Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021081503/http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures |date=2008-10-21 }} - Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

English was brought to Ireland as a result of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] of the late 12th century. Initially, it was mainly spoken in an area known as [[the Pale]] around [[Dublin]], with mostly [[Irish language|Irish]] spoken throughout the rest of the country. By the [[Tudor period]], Irish culture and language had regained most of the territory lost to the invaders: even in the Pale, "all the common folk… for the most part are of Irish birth, Irish habit, and of Irish language".&lt;ref name="multitext.ucc.ie"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Culture__Religion_in_Tudor_Ireland_1494-1558 |title=Culture and Religion in Tudor Ireland 1494–1558 |publisher=University College Cork |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416173828/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/Culture__Religion_in_Tudor_Ireland_1494-1558 |archivedate=16 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some small pockets remained predominantly English-speaking; because of their sheer isolation their dialects developed into later (now extinct) dialects known as [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Yola]] in [[County Wexford|Wexford]] and [[Fingallian]] in [[Fingal]], Dublin. These were no longer mutually intelligible with other English varieties. However, [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|the Tudor conquest]] and [[Plantations of Ireland|colonisation]] of Ireland in the 16th century marked a revival in the use of English. By the mid-19th century, English was the majority language spoken in the country.{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | According to the 1841 census, Ireland had 8,175,124 inhabitants, of whom four million spoke [[Irish Gaelic|Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John O'Beirne | last = Ranelagh | title = A Short History of Ireland | place = Cambridge | year = 1994 | page = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  It has retained this status to the present day, with even those whose first language is Irish being fluent in English as well. Today, there is only a little more than one percent of the population that speaks Irish natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hickey|first1=Raymond|title=Irish English: History and Present Day Forms|date=November 8, 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=121|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Irish_English.html?id=p3vDuPNG7nUC|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is one of two official languages, along with Irish, of the Republic of Ireland, and is the country's {{lang|la|de facto}} working language.

Hiberno-English's [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling]] and [[American and British English pronunciation differences|pronunciation standards]] align with British rather than American English. However, Hiberno-English's diverse accents and some of its grammatical structures are unique, with some influence by the [[Irish language]] and a tendency to be [[phonology|phonologically]] [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]], retaining older features no longer common in the accents of England or North America.

Phonologists today often divide Hiberno-English into four or five overarching classes of [[dialect]]s or accents:&lt;ref name="de Gruyter 2004 90–93"&gt;{{harvnb|de Gruyter|2004|pp=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Hickey, Raymond. ''A Sound Atlas of Irish English'', Volume 1.

==Ulster English==
[[Ulster English]] (or '''Northern Irish English''') here refers collectively to the varieties of the [[Ulster]] province, including [[Northern Ireland]] and neighbouring counties outside of Northern Ireland, which has been influenced by [[Ulster Irish]] as well as the [[Scots language]], brought over by Scottish settlers during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. Its main subdivisions are '''Mid-Ulster English''', '''South Ulster English''' and '''[[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots English]]''', the latter of which is more directly and strongly influenced by the Scots language. All Ulster English has more obvious pronunciation similarities with [[Scottish English]] than other Irish English dialects do.

Ulster varieties distinctly pronounce:
*An ordinarily grammatically structured (i.e. [[Topicalization|non-topicalised]]) [[declarative sentence]]s, often, with a [[high rising terminal|rising intonation at the end]] of the sentence (the type of intonation pattern that other English speakers usually associate with [[question]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ɪ}} as lowered, in the general vicinity of {{IPA-all|ë~ɘ~ɪ̈|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ}} as fronted and slightly rounded, more closely approaching {{IPA-all|ɞ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|uː}} and {{IPAc-en|ʊ}} both in the general vicinity of {{IPA-all|ʉ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|aʊ}} with a backed on-glide and fronted off-glide, putting it in the vicinity of {{IPA-all|ɐʏ~ɜʉ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|aɪ}} as {{IPA-all|ɛɪ~ɜɪ|}}, particularly before [[voiceless consonant]]s.
*{{IPAc-en|eɪ}} as {{IPA-all|eː|}}, though nowadays commonly {{IPA-all|eːə|}} or even {{IPA-all|ɪːə|}} when in a [[closed syllable]].
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}}, almost always, as a slightly raised [[monophthong]] {{IPA-all|o̝(:)|}}.
*A lack of [[Happy-tensing|''happy''-tensing]]; with the final vowel of ''happy, holy, money,'' etc. as {{IPA-all|e|}}.
*Syllable-final {{IPAc-en|l}} occasionally as "[[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|dark [ɫ]]]", though especially before a consonant.

==West and South-West Irish English==
'''West and South-West Irish English''' here refers to [[broad and general accents|broad varieties]] of Ireland's [[West Region, Ireland|West]] and [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West]] Regions. Accents of both regions are known for:
*The [[pin–pen merger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The backing and slight lowering of {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} towards {{IPA-all|ɐʊ~ʌʊ|}}.
*The more open starting point for {{IPAc-en|ɔr}} and {{IPAc-en|ɔː}} of {{IPA-all|ɑːɹ~äːɹ|}} and {{IPA-all|ɑː~ä|}}, respectively. 
*The preservation of {{IPAc-en|oʊ}} as [[monophthong]]al {{IPA-all|oː|}}. 
*{{IPAc-en|θ}} and {{IPAc-en|ð}}, respectively, as {{IPA-all|t~tʰ|}} and {{IPA-all|d|}}.
*In the West, {{IPAc-en|s}} and {{IPAc-en|z}} may respectively be pronounced as {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} before a consonant, so ''fist'' sounds like ''fisht'', ''castle'' like ''cashle'', and ''arrest'' like ''arresht''.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, 1982, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South-West Irish English''' (often known, by specific [[Counties of Ireland|county]], as '''Cork English''', '''Kerry English''', or '''Limerick English''') also features two major defining characteristics of its own: the raising of {{IPAc-en|ɛ}} to {{IPA|[ɪ]}} when before {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/m/}} (as in ''again'' or ''pen''), and the noticeable intonation pattern of a slightly higher pitch followed by a significant drop in pitch on stressed long-vowel syllables (across multiple syllables or even within a single one),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is popularly heard, in rapid conversation, as a kind of undulating "sing-song" pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishireland.ie/english-courses-cork-ireland.htm "Learn English in Cork City &amp; County"]. ''Language Travel Ireland: Learn English by Living It''. Language Travel Ireland, InnovationWorks, National Technology Park, Limerick, Ireland. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dublin English==
'''Dublin English''' is highly internally diverse and refers collectively to the Irish English varieties immediately surrounding and within the metropolitan area of [[Dublin]]. Modern-day Dublin English largely lies on a [[phonology|phonological]] continuum,{{citation needed|reason=This appears obvious to my experience, though a source that digs deeper into this would be great|date=May 2017}} ranging from a more traditional, lower-prestige, local urban accent on the one end to a more recently developing, higher-prestige, non-local (regional and even supraregional) accent on the other end, whose most advanced characteristics only first emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Dartspeak"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007b|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accent that most strongly uses the traditional working-class features has been labelled by linguistis as '''local Dublin English'''. Most speakers from Dublin and its suburbs, however, have accent features falling variously along the entire middle as well as newer end of the spectrum, which together form what is called '''non-local Dublin English''', spoken by middle- and upper-class natives of Dublin and the greater eastern Irish region surrounding the city. A subset of this variety, whose middle-class speakers mostly range in the middle section of the continuum, is called '''mainstream Dublin English'''. Mainstream Dublin English has become the basis of an accent that has otherwise become supraregional (see more below) everywhere except in the north of the country. The majority of Dubliners born since the 1980s (led particularly by females) has shifted towards the most innovative non-local accent, here called '''new Dublin English''', which has gained ground over mainstream Dublin English and which is the most extreme variety in rejecting the local accent's traditional features.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Raymond (2015). [https://www.uni-due.de/IERC/dublin.htm Dublin English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011849/https://www.uni-due.de/IERC/dublin.htm |date=22 October 2016 }} ''Irish English Resource Centre''. University of Duisburg and Essen.&lt;/ref&gt; The varieties at either extreme of the spectrum, local and new Dublin English, are both discussed in further detail below. In the most general terms, all varieties of Dublin English have the following identifying sounds that are often distinct from the rest of Ireland, pronouncing:
*{{IPAc-en|aʊ}} as fronted and/or raised {{IPA-all|æʊ~ɛʊ~eʊ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|aɪ}} as retracted and/or centralised {{IPA-all|əɪ~ɑɪ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}} as a [[diphthong]] in the range (local to non-local) of {{IPA-all|ʌʊ~oʊ~əʊ|}}.

===Local Dublin English===
'''Local Dublin English''' (or '''popular Dublin English''') here refers to a traditional, [[broad and general accents|broad]], working-class variety spoken in the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s capital city of [[Dublin]]. It is the only Irish English variety that in earlier history was non-rhotic; however, it is today weakly rhotic,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="de Gruyter 2004 91"&gt;{{harvnb|de Gruyter|2004|pp=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it uniquely pronounces:
*{{IPAc-en|aɪ}} as {{IPA-all|əɪ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|aʊ}} as {{IPA-all|ɛʊ~eʊ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}} as {{IPA-all|aɪ~äɪ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}} as {{IPA-all|ʌʊ~ʌo|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ}} as {{IPA-all|ʊ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|θ}} and {{IPAc-en|ð}}, respectively, as {{IPA-all|t(ʰ)|}} and {{IPA-all|d|}}.

The local Dublin accent is also known for a phenomenon called "vowel breaking", in which the vowel sounds {{IPAc-en|aʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|aɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|uː}}, and {{IPAc-en|iː}} in [[closed syllable]]s are "broken" into two syllables, approximating {{IPA-all|ɛwə|}}, {{IPA-all|əjə|}}, {{IPA-all|uwə|}}, and {{IPA-all|ijə|}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Gruyter|2004|pp=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Dublin English===
Evolving as a fashionable outgrowth of the mainstream non-local Dublin English, '''new Dublin English''' (also, '''advanced Dublin English''' and, formerly, '''fashionable Dublin English''') is a youthful variety that originally began in the early 1990s among the "[[avant-garde]]" and now those aspiring to a non-local "urban sophistication".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Dublin English itself, first associated with affluent and middle-class inhabitants of [[southside Dublin]], is probably now spoken by a majority of Dubliners born since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Dartspeak"/&gt; It has replaced (yet was largely influenced by) moribund '''[[Dublin 4|D4]] English''' (often known as "Dublin 4" or "[[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] speak" or, mockingly, "Dortspeak"), which originated around the 1970s from Dubliners who rejected traditional notions of Irishness, regarding themselves as more trendy and sophisticated;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, particular aspects of the D4 accent became quickly noticed and ridiculed as sounding affected, causing these features to fall out of fashion by the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Dublin"/&gt;

This "new mainstream" accent of Dublin's youth, rejecting traditional working-class Dublin, pronounces:
*{{IPAc-en|æ}} as open as {{IPA-all|a|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ɑr}} may be {{IPA-all|äːɹ||en-us-r.ogg}}, with a backer vowel than in other Irish accents, though still relatively fronted.
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː}} as high as {{IPA-all|ɔː|}} or even {{IPA-all|oː|}}, causing a re-split in the [[cot–caught merger]] that traditionally characterised Dublin speech.
*{{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}} as high as {{IPA-all|ɔɪ|}} or even {{IPA-all|oɪ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}} as the Londonian [[diphthong]] {{IPA-all|əʊ||En-uk-oh.ogg}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ɛər}} and {{IPAc-en|ɜr}} as both possibly rounded {{IPA-all|øːɻ|}}, perhaps causing a [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/#Square–nurse merger|fur–fair merger]].
*{{IPAc-en|ɔr}} and {{IPAc-en|oʊ|r}} as possibly merged, as well as {{IPAc-en|w}} and {{IPAc-en|ʍ}} as possibly merged, leading to potential [[horse–hoarse merger|horse–hoarse]] and [[witch–which merger]]s.

==Supraregional southern Irish English==
'''Supraregional southern Irish English''' (sometimes, simply, '''supraregional Irish English''' or '''supraregional Hiberno-English''') here refers to a variety crossing regional boundaries throughout all of the Republic of Ireland, except the north. As mentioned earlier, '''mainstream Dublin English''' of the early- to mid-1900s is the direct influence and catalyst for this variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most speakers born in the 1980s or later are showing fewer features of the twentieth-century mainstream supraregional form and more characteristics of an advanced supraregional variety that aligns clearly with the rapidly spreading new Dublin accent (see more above, under "Non-local Dublin English").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's supraregional dialect pronounces:
*{{IPAc-en|æ}} as quite open {{IPA-all|a|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|aɪ}} along a possible spectrum {{IPA-all|aɪ~äɪ~ɑɪ|}}, with innovative [ɑɪ] particularly more common before [[voiced consonant]]s,&lt;ref name="de Gruyter 2004 91"/&gt; notably including {{IPA|/r/}}.
* {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} as starting fronter and often more raised than other dialects: {{IPA|[aʊ~æʊ~ɛʊ]}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ɑr}} may be {{IPA-all|äːɹ||en-us-r.ogg}}, with a backer vowel than in other Irish accents, though still relatively fronted.
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː}} as {{IPA-all|ɒː|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|ɔr}} as {{IPA-all|ɒːɹ|}}, almost always separate from {{IPA-all|oːɹ|}}, keeping words like ''war'' and ''wore'', or ''horse'' and ''hoarse'', pronounced distinctly.
*{{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}} as {{IPA-all|ɒɪ|}}.
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}} as a [[diphthong]], approaching {{IPA-all|oʊ||en-us-o.ogg}}, as in the mainstream United States, or {{IPA-all|əʊ||En-uk-oh.ogg}}, as in mainstream England.
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ}} as higher, fronter, and often rounder {{IPA|[ə~ʊ]}}.

==Overview of pronunciation and phonology==
The following charts list the vowels typical of each Irish English dialect as well as the several distinctive consonants of Irish English.&lt;ref name="de Gruyter 2004 90–93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Phonological characteristics of overall Irish English are given as well as categorisations into five major divisions of Hiberno-English: northern Ireland (or Ulster); West &amp; South-West Ireland; local Dublin; new Dublin; and supraregional (southern) Ireland. Features of mainstream non-local Dublin English fall on a range between "local Dublin" and "new Dublin".

===Pure vowels (monophthongs)===
'''The defining [[monophthong]]s of Irish English:'''

The following pure vowel sounds are defining characteristics of Irish English:
*The vowel {{IPAc-en|ʌ}}, as in ''cut'' or ''run'', is typically [[central vowel|centralised]] in the mouth and often somewhat more rounded than other standard English varieties, such as [[Received Pronunciation]] in England or [[General American]] in the United States. 
*Most Irish English varieties make some distinction between the [[trap-bath split|"broad" ''a'' and "flat" ''a'']] of Received Pronunciation, whereas [[General American]], for example, makes no distinction. 
* There is inconsistency regarding the [[lot–cloth split]] and the [[cot–caught merger]]; certain Irish English dialects have these phenomena while others do not.
* ''Any'' and ''many'' are pronounced to rhyme with ''nanny'', ''Danny'', etc. by very many speakers, i.e. with each of these words pronounced with {{IPA|[æ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|D4|1}}
In [[southside Dublin]]'s once-briefly fashionable "[[Dublin 4]]" (or "Dortspeak") accent, the "{{IPA|/ɑː/}} and broad {{IPA|/æ/}}" set becomes rounded as [ɒː].&lt;ref name="Dublin"&gt;Hickey, Raymond.

{{note|SW|2}} In South-West Ireland, {{IPAc-en|ɛ}} before {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/m/}} is raised to {{IPA|[ɪ]}}.&lt;ref name = "South-West"&gt;{{harv|de Gruyter|2004|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|vowelbreak|3}} Due to the local Dublin accent's phenomenon of "vowel breaking", {{IPA|/iː/}} may be realised in this accent as {{IPA|[ijə]}} in a [[closed syllable]], and, in the same environment, {{IPA|/uː/}} may be realised as {{IPA|[ʊuwə]}}.

{{note|happy|4}}Unstressed syllable-final {{IPA|/iː/}} or {{IPA|/ɪ/}} is realised in Ulster accents uniquely as {{IPA|[e~ɪ]}}.&lt;ref name="de Gruyter 2004 91"/&gt;

'''Other notes:'''

*In some highly conservative Irish English varieties, words spelled with ''ea'' and pronounced with {{IPA|[iː]}} in RP are pronounced with {{IPA|[eː]}}, for example ''meat'', ''beat'', and ''leaf''.
* In words like ''took'' where the spelling "oo" usually represents {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, conservative speakers may use {{IPA|/uː/}}. This is most common in local Dublin and the speech of north-east Leinster.

===Gliding vowels (diphthongs)===
'''The defining [[diphthong]]s of Hiberno-English:'''

The following gliding vowel (diphthong) sounds are defining characteristics of Irish English:
*The first element of the diphthong {{IPAc-en|aʊ}}, as in ''ow'' or ''doubt'', may move forward in the mouth in the east (namely, Dublin) and supraregionally; however, it may actually move backward throughout the entire rest of the country. In the north alone, the second element is particularly moved forward, as in Scotland.  
*The first element of the diphthong {{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}}, as in ''boy'' or ''choice'', is slightly or significantly lowered in all geographic regions except the north.
*The diphthong {{IPAc-en|eɪ}}, as in ''rain'' or ''bay'', is most commonly [[monophthong]]ised to {{IPA-all|eː|}}. Furthermore, this often lowers to {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in words such as ''gave'' and ''came'' (sounding like "gev" and "kem").{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===''R''-coloured vowels===
'''The defining [[R-coloured vowel|''r''-coloured vowel]]s of Hiberno-English:'''

The following ''r''-coloured vowel features are defining characteristics of Hiberno-English: 
*[[Rhoticity in English|Rhoticity]]: Every major accent of Hiberno-English pronounces the letter "r" whenever it follows a vowel sound, though this is weaker in the local Dublin accent due to its earlier history of non-rhoticity. Rhoticity is a feature that Hiberno-English shares with [[Canadian English]] and [[General American]] but not with [[Received Pronunciation]]. 
*The distinction between {{IPA|/ɔːr/}} and {{IPA|/oʊr/}} is almost always preserved, so that, for example, ''horse'' and ''hoarse'' are not [[Horse–hoarse merger|merged]] in most Irish accents.

{{note|old|1}} In older varieties of the conservative accents, like local Dublin, the "r" sound before a vowel may be pronounced as a [[alveolar tap|tapped]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, rather than as the typical approximant {{IPA|[ɹ̠]}}.

{{note|rhotic|2}}Every major accent of Irish English is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] (pronounces "r" after a vowel sound).

{{note|NLD|3}}The "r" sound of the mainstream non-local Dublin accent is more precisely a [[velarization|velarised]] [[alveolar approximant|approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹˠ]}}, while the  "r" sound of the more recently emerging non-local Dublin (or "new Dublin") accent is more precisely a [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}}.

{{note|horse|8}}The distinction between {{IPA|/ɔːr/}} and {{IPA|/oʊr/}} is widely preserved in Ireland, so that, for example, ''horse'' and ''hoarse'' are not merged in most Irish English dialects; however, they are usually [[Horse–hoarse merger|merged]] in [[Belfast]] and new Dublin.

{{note|vowelbreak|9}}In local Dublin, due to the phenomenon of "vowel breaking" {{IPA|[(j)uːɹ]}} may in fact be realised as {{IPA|[(j)uʷə(ɹ)]}}.

===Consonants===
'''The defining [[consonant]]s of Hiberno-English:'''

The consonants of Hiberno-English mostly align to the typical English consonant sounds. However, a few Irish English consonants have distinctive, varying qualities. The following consonant features are defining characteristics of Hiberno-English: 
*''H''-fulness: Unlike most English varieties of England and Wales, which [[h-dropping|drop the word-initial {{IPA|/h/}} sound]] in words like ''house'' or ''happy'', Hiberno-English always retains word-initial {{IPAc-en|h}}.
*The phonemes {{IPAc-en|ð}} (as in ''the'') and {{IPAc-en|θ}} (as in ''thin'') are pronounced uniquely in most Hiberno-English. {{IPA|/ð/}} is pronounced as {{IPA-all|d|}} or {{IPA-all|d̪|}}, depending on specific dialect; and {{IPA|/θ/}} is pronounced as {{IPA-all|t|}} or {{IPA-all|t̪|}}.
*The phoneme {{IPAc-en|t}}, when appearing at the end of word or between vowel sounds, is pronounced uniquely in most Hiberno-English; the most common pronunciation is as a "[[slit fricative]]".
*The phoneme {{IPAc-en|l}} is almost always of a "light" or "clear" quality (i.e. not [[velarization|velarised]]), unlike Received Pronunciation, which uses both a clear and a dark "L" sound, or General American, which pronounces all "L" sounds as dark.
*[[Rhoticity in English|Rhoticity]]: The pronunciation of historical {{IPA|/r/}} is nearly universal in Irish accents of English. Like with General American (but not Received Pronunciation), this means that the letter "r", if appearing after a vowel sound, is always pronounced (in words such as ''here'', ''cart'', or ''surf'').

'''Footnotes:'''

{{note|NI|1}}In traditional, conservative [[Ulster English]], {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]] before a low front vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Gruyter|2004|pp=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|Dub|2}}Local Dublin also undergoes cluster simplification, so that [[stop consonant]] sounds occurring after [[fricative]]s or [[sonorant]]s may be left unpronounced, resulting, for example, in "poun(d)" and "las(t)".&lt;ref name="South-West"/&gt;

{{note|r|3}}Rhoticity: Every major accent of Irish English is strongly [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] (pronounces "r" after a vowel sound), though to a weaker degree with the local Dublin accent.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Hickey|1984|p=234"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|1984|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accents of local Dublin and some smaller eastern towns like [[Drogheda]] were historically non-rhotic and now only very lightly rhotic or variably rhotic, with the rhotic consonant being an alveolar approximant, {{IPA|[ɹ]}}. In extremely traditional and [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]] accents (exemplified, for instance, in the speech of older speakers throughout the country, even in South-West Ireland, such as [[Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh]] and [[Jackie Healy-Rae]]), the rhotic consonant, before a vowel sound, can also be an [[alveolar tap]], {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. The rhotic consonant for the northern Ireland and new Dublin accents is a [[retroflex approximant]], {{IPA|[ɻ]}}. Dublin's retroflex approximant has no precedent outside of northern Ireland and is a genuine innovation of the past two decades. A [[guttural R|guttural]]/[[uvular]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} is found in north-east [[Leinster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the rhotic consonant of virtually all other Irish accents is the [[postalveolar approximant]], {{IPA|[ɹ]}}.

{{note|th|4}}The symbol [θ̠] is used here to represent the [[voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative]], sometimes known as a "slit fricative",&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Hickey|1984|p=234"/&gt; whose articulation is described as being [[Apical consonant|apico]]-[[alveolar consonant|alveolar]].&lt;ref name="de Gruyter 2004 93"&gt;{{harv|de Gruyter|2004|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|hw|5}}Overall, {{IPA|/hw/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} are being increasingly [[Wine–whine merger|merged]] in supraregional Irish English, for example, making ''wine'' and ''whine'' [[homophones]], as in most varieties of English around the world.&lt;ref name="de Gruyter 2004 93"/&gt;

Other phonological characteristics of Irish English include that [[consonant cluster]]s ending in {{IPA|/j/}} before {{IPA|/u/}} are distinctive:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007b|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, 1982, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPA|/j/}} is dropped after [[sonorant]]s and [[fricative]]s, e.g. ''new'' sounds like ''noo'', and ''sue'' like ''soo''.
*{{IPA|/dj/}} becomes {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, e.g. ''dew/due, duke'' and ''duty'' sound like "jew", "jook" and "jooty".
*{{IPA|/tj/}} becomes {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, e.g. ''tube'' is "choob", ''tune'' is "choon"
*The following show neither dropping nor coalescence: {{IPA|/kj/}} (as in ''cute''), {{IPA|/mj/}} (as in ''mute''), and {{IPA|/hj/}} (as in ''huge''; though the {{IPA|/h/}} can be dropped in the South-West of Ireland).

The naming of the letter ''H'' as "haitch" is standard.

Due to [[Irish language|Gaelic]] influence, an epenthetic [[schwa]] is sometimes inserted, perhaps as a feature of older and less careful speakers, e.g. ''film'' {{IPA|[ˈfɪləm]}} and ''form'' {{IPA|[ˈfɒːɹəm]}}.

===Loan words from Irish===
A [[Irish words used in the English language|number of Irish-language loan words]] are used in Hiberno-English, particularly in an official state capacity.  For example, the head of government is the [[Taoiseach]], the deputy head is the [[Tánaiste]], the parliament is the [[Oireachtas]] and its lower house is [[Dáil Éireann]]. Less formally, people also use loan words in day-to-day speech, although this has been on the wane in recent decades and among the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = A dictionary of Hiberno-English: the Irish use of English |last= Dolan |first= Terence Patrick | year= 2004 | publisher= Gill &amp; Macmillan | location= Dublin, [[Ireland|IE]] | isbn= 978-0-7171-3535-6 | page = xix | url = https://books.google.com/?id=uPo0oB19gDUC&amp;lpg=PR19&amp;dq=decline%20of%20hiberno-english%20words&amp;pg=PR19#v=onepage&amp;q=decline%20of%20hiberno-english%20words&amp;f=false | accessdate= 29 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Derived words from Irish ===
Another group of Hiberno-English words are those ''derived'' from the Irish language. Some are [[List of English words of Irish origin|words in English that have entered into general use]], while others are unique to Ireland. These words and phrases are often Anglicised versions of words in Irish or direct translations into English. In the latter case, they often give a meaning to a word or phrase that is generally not found in wider English use.

===Derived words from Old and Middle English===
Another class of vocabulary found in Hiberno-English are words and phrases common in [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]], but which have since become obscure or obsolete in the modern English language generally. Hiberno-English has also developed particular meanings for words that are still in common use in English generally.

==Grammar and syntax==
The [[Irish syntax|syntax of the Irish language]] is quite different from that of English. Various aspects of Irish syntax have influenced Hiberno-English, though many of these idiosyncrasies are disappearing in suburban areas and among the younger population.

The other major influence on Hiberno-English that sets it apart from modern English in general is the retention of words and phrases from Old- and Middle-English.

===From Irish===

====Reduplication====
[[Reduplication]] is an alleged trait of Hiberno-English strongly associated with [[Stage Irish]] and Hollywood films.

* the Irish ''ar bith'' corresponds to English "at all", so the stronger ''ar chor ar bith'' gives rise to the form "at all at all".
**"I've no time at all at all."
* ''ar eagla go …'' (lit. "on fear that …") means "in case …". The variant ''ar eagla na heagla'', (lit. "on fear of fear") implies the circumstances are more unlikely. The corresponding Hiberno-English phrases are "to be sure" and "to be sure to be sure". In this context, these are not, as might be thought, disjuncts meaning "certainly"; they could better be translated "in case" and "just in case". Nowadays normally spoken with conscious levity.
** "I brought some cash in case I saw a bargain, and my credit card to be sure to be sure."

====Yes and no====
Irish lacks words that directly translate as [[yes and no|"yes" or "no"]], and instead [[echo response|repeats the verb used in the question]], negated if necessary, to answer. Hiberno-English uses "yes" and "no" less frequently than other English dialects as speakers can repeat the verb, positively or negatively, instead of (or in redundant addition to) using "yes" or "no".

* "Are you coming home soon?" – "I am."
* "Is your mobile charged?" – "It isn't."

This is not limited only to the verb ''to be'': it is also used with ''to have'' when used as an auxiliary; and, with other verbs, the verb ''to do'' is used. This is most commonly used for intensification, especially in Ulster English.
* "This is strong stuff, so it is."
* "We won the game, so we did."

====Recent past construction====
Irish indicates recency of an action by adding "after" to the present continuous (a verb ending in "-ing"), a construction known as the "hot news perfect" or "after perfect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1jpNgJhjJF4C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=%22hot+news+perfect |title=A semantic and pragmatic examination ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=26 November 2010|isbn=978-3-87808-372-6|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aPPexF5hyIkC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=%22after+perfect%22+irish |title=Dialects across borders: selected ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=26 November 2010|isbn=978-90-272-4787-2|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idiom for "I had done X when I did Y" is "I was after doing X when I did Y", modelled on the Irish usage of the compound [[preposition]]s ''i ndiaidh'', ''tar éis'', and ''in éis'': ''bhí mé tar éis/i ndiaidh/in éis X a dhéanamh, nuair a rinne mé Y''.
* "Why did you hit him?" – "He was after giving me cheek." (he had been cheeky to me).
A similar construction is seen where exclamation is used in describing a recent event:
* "I'm after hitting him with the car!" ''Táim tar éis é a bhualadh leis an gcarr!''
* "She's after losing five stone in five weeks!"

When describing less astonishing or significant events, a structure resembling the German perfect can be seen:
* "I have the car fixed." ''Tá an carr deisithe agam.''
* "I have my breakfast eaten." ''Tá mo bhricfeasta ithe agam.''

This correlates with an analysis of "H1 Irish" proposed by Adger &amp; Mitrovic,&lt;ref&gt;Adger (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; in a deliberate parallel to the status of German as a [[V2 word order|V2 language]].

====Reflection for emphasis====
The reflexive version of pronouns is often used for emphasis or to refer indirectly to a particular person, etc., according to context.  ''Herself'', for example, might refer to the speaker's boss or to the woman of the house. Use of ''herself'' or ''himself'' in this way often indicates that the speaker attributes some degree of arrogance or selfishness to the person in question. Note also the indirectness of this construction relative to, for example, ''She's coming now''
* "'Tis herself that's coming now." ''Is í féin atá ag teacht anois.''
* "Was it all of ye or just yourself?" ''An sibhse ar fad nó tusa féin a bhí i gceist?''

====Prepositional pronouns====
There are some language forms that stem from the fact that there is no verb ''to have'' in Irish. Instead, possession is indicated in Irish by using the preposition ''at'', (in Irish, ''ag.''). To be more precise, Irish uses a prepositional pronoun that combines ''ag'' "at" and ''mé'' "me" to create ''agam''.
In English, the verb "to have" is used, along with a "with me" or "on me" that derives from ''Tá … agam.''  This gives rise to the frequent
* "Do you have the book?" – "I have it with me."
* "Have you change for the bus on you?"
* "He will not shut up if he has drink taken."
Somebody who can speak a language "has" a language, in which Hiberno-English has borrowed the grammatical form used in Irish.
* "She does not have Irish." ''Níl Gaeilge aici.'' literally "There is no Irish at her".

When describing something, many Hiberno-English speakers use the term "in it" where "there" would usually be used. This is due to the Irish word ''ann'' (pronounced "oun" or "on") fulfilling both meanings.
* "Is it yourself that is in it?" ''An tú féin atá ann?''
* "Is there any milk in it?" ''An bhfuil bainne ann?''

Another idiom is this thing or that thing described as "this man here" or "that man there", which also features in [[Newfoundland English]] in Canada.
* "This man here." ''An fear seo.'' (cf. the related ''anseo'' = here)
* "That man there." ''An fear sin.'' (cf. the related ''ansin'' = there)

Conditionals have a greater presence in Hiberno-English due to the tendency to replace the simple present tense with the conditional (would) and the simple past tense with the conditional perfect (would have).
* "John asked me would I buy a loaf of bread." (John asked me to buy a loaf of bread.)
* "How do you know him? We would have been in school together." (We went to school together.)

'''Bring''' and '''take''': Irish use of these words differs from that of British English because it follows the Irish grammar for ''beir'' and ''tóg''. English usage is determined by direction; person determines Irish usage. So, in English, one '''takes''' "''from'' here ''to'' there", and '''brings''' it "''to'' here ''from'' there". In Irish, a person '''takes''' only when accepting a transfer of possession of the object from someone else{{spaced ndash}}and a person '''brings''' at all other times, irrespective of direction (to or from).
* Don't forget to bring your umbrella with you when you leave.
* (To a child) Hold my hand: I don't want someone to take you.

====To be====

The Irish equivalent of the verb "to be" has two present tenses, one (the present tense proper or "aimsir láithreach") for cases which are generally true or are true at the time of speaking and the other (the habitual present or "aimsir ghnáthláithreach") for repeated actions. Thus, "you are [now, or generally]" is ''tá tú'', but "you are [repeatedly]" is ''bíonn tú''. Both forms are used with the verbal noun (equivalent to the English [[present participle]]) to create compound tenses. This is similar to the distinction between ''[[wikt:ser|ser]]'' and ''[[wikt:estar|estar]]'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The corresponding usage in English is frequently found in rural areas, especially [[County Mayo|Mayo]]/[[County Sligo|Sligo]] in the west of Ireland and [[County Wexford|Wexford]] in the south-east, Inner-City Dublin along with border areas of the North and Republic. In this form, the verb "to be" in English is similar to its use in Irish, with a "does be/do be" (or "bees", although less frequently) construction to indicate the continuous, or habitual, present:
* "He does be working every day." ''Bíonn sé ag obair gach lá.''
* "They do be talking on their mobiles a lot." ''Bíonn siad ag caint go minic ar a bhfóin póca.''
* "He does be doing a lot of work at school." ''Bíonn sé ag déanamh go leor oibre ar scoil.''
* "It's him I do be thinking of." ''Is air a bhíonn mé ag smaoineamh.''

This construction also surfaces in [[African American Vernacular English]], as the famous [[habitual be]].

===From Old and Middle English===

In old-fashioned usage, "it is" can be freely abbreviated ''’tis'', even as a standalone sentence. This also allows the double contraction ''’tisn’t'', for "it is not".

Irish has separate forms for the second person singular (''tú'') and the second person plural (''sibh'').
Mirroring Irish, and almost every other [[Indo-European Languages|Indo European language]], the plural ''you'' is also distinguished from the singular in Hiberno-English, normally by use of the otherwise archaic English word ''ye'' {{IPA|[jiː]}}; the word ''yous'' (sometimes written as ''youse'') also occurs, but primarily only in Dublin and across [[Ulster]]. In addition, in some areas in [[Leinster]], north [[Connacht]] and parts of Ulster, the hybrid word ''ye-s'', pronounced "yiz", may be used. The pronunciation differs with that of the northwestern being {{IPA|[jiːz]}} and the Leinster pronunciation being {{IPA|[jɪz]}}.

* "Did ye all go to see it?" ''Ar imigh sibh go léir chun é a fheicint?''
* "None of youse have a clue!" ''Níl ciall/leid ar bith agaibh!''
* "Are ye not finished yet?" ''Nach bhfuil sibh críochnaithe fós?''
* "Yis are after destroying it!" ''Tá sibh tar éis é a scriosadh!''

The word ''ye'', ''yis'' or ''yous'', otherwise archaic, is still used in place of "you" for the second-person plural. ''Ye'r'', ''Yisser'' or ''Yousser'' are the possessive forms, e.g. "Where are yous going?"

The verb ''mitch'' is very common in Ireland, indicating being truant from school. This word appears in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (though he wrote in [[Early Modern English]] rather than [[Middle English]]), but is seldom heard these days in [[British English]], although pockets of usage persist in some areas (notably [[South Wales]], Devon, and [[Cornwall]]). In parts of Connacht and Ulster the ''mitch'' is often replaced by the verb ''scheme'', while in Dublin it is often replaced by "on the hop/bounce".

Another usage familiar from Shakespeare is the inclusion of the second person pronoun after the imperative form of a verb, as in "Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed" ([[Romeo and Juliet]], Act III, Scene IV). This is still common in [[Ulster]]: "Get youse your homework done or you're no goin' out!" In [[Munster]], you will still hear children being told, "Up to bed, let ye" {{IPA|[lɛˈtʃi]}}.

For influence from [[Scotland]], see [[Ulster Scots language|Ulster Scots]] and [[Ulster English]].

===Other grammatical influences===

'''Now''' is often used at the end of sentences or phrases as a semantically empty word, completing an utterance without contributing any apparent meaning. Examples include "Bye now" (= "Goodbye"), "There you go now" (when giving someone something), "Ah now!" (expressing dismay), "Hold on now" (= "wait a minute"), "Now then" as a mild attention-getter, etc. This usage is universal among English dialects, but occurs more frequently in Hiberno-English.  It is also used in the manner of the Italian 'prego' or German 'bitte', for example a barman might say "Now, Sir." when delivering drinks.

'''So''' is often used for emphasis ("I can speak Irish, so I can"), or it may be tacked onto the end of a sentence to indicate agreement, where "then" would often be used in Standard English ("Bye so", "Let's go so", "That's fine so", "We'll do that so"). The word is also used to contradict a negative statement ("You're not pushing hard enough" – "I am so!"). (This contradiction of a negative is also seen in American English, though not as often as "I am too", or "Yes, I am".) The practice of indicating emphasis with ''so'' and including reduplicating the sentence's subject pronoun and auxiliary verb (is, are, have, has, can, etc.) such as in the initial example, is particularly prevalent in more northern dialects such as those of Sligo, Mayo and the counties of Ulster.

'''Sure''' is often used as a tag word, emphasising the obviousness of the statement, roughly translating as but/and/well. Can be used as "to be sure", the famous Irish stereotype phrase. (But note that the other stereotype of "Sure and …" is not actually used in Ireland.) Or "Sure, I can just go on Wednesday", "I will not, to be sure." The word is also used at the end of sentences (primarily in [[Munster]]), for instance "I was only here five minutes ago, sure!" and can express emphasis or indignation.

'''To''' is often omitted from sentences where it would exist in British English. For example, "I'm not let go out tonight", instead of "I'm not allowed ''to'' go out tonight".

'''Will''' is often used where British English would use "shall" or American English "should" (as in "Will I make us a cup of tea?"). The distinction between "shall" (for first-person simple future, and second- and third-person emphatic future) and "will" (second- and third-person simple future, first-person emphatic future), maintained by many in England, does not exist in Hiberno-English, with "will" generally used in all cases.

'''Once''' is sometimes used in a different way from how it is used in other dialects; in this usage, it indicates a combination of logical and causal conditionality: "I have no problem laughing at myself once the joke is funny."  Other dialects of English would probably use "if" in this situation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15099">The '''high rising terminal''' ('''HRT'''), also known as '''upspeak''', '''uptalk''', '''rising inflection''', or '''high rising intonation''' ('''HRI'''), is a feature of some variants of [[English language|English]] where [[declarative sentence]] clauses end with a rising-pitch [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], until the end of the sentence where a falling-pitch is applied.

Empirically, one report proposes that HRT in [[American English]] and [[Australian English]] is marked by a high tone (high pitch or high [[fundamental frequency]]) beginning on the final accented syllable near the end of the statement (the terminal), and continuing to increase in frequency (up to 40%) to the end of the intonational phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladd |first=R. D. |title=Intonational phonology |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1996 |ISBN=0-521-47498-1 |page=123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  New research suggests that the actual rise can occur one or more syllables after the last accented syllable of the phrase, and its range is much more variable than previously thought.&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=P. |title=Patterns of late rising in New Zealand English:  Intonational variation or intonation change? |journal=Language Variation and Change |volume=17 |year=2005 |pages=209&amp;ndash;230 |ISSN=0954-3945 |doi=10.1017/s095439450505009x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The origins of HRT remain uncertain. Anecdotal evidence places the conception of the American English variety on the West Coast &amp;ndash; anywhere from [[California English|Southern California]] to the [[Pacific Northwest English|Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/pacificnorthwest/ Do you speak American? American Varieties: Pacific Northwest]&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the southern hemisphere, it has been suggested that the feature may have originated in [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="allan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Allan |first=S. |chapter=The rise of New Zealand intonation |editor1-first=A. |editor1-last=Bell |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Holmes |title=New Zealand ways of Speaking English |pages=115&amp;ndash;128 |place=Clevendon |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=1990 |ISBN=1-85359-083-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether the American English varieties and the Oceanic varieties had any influence on each other regarding the spread of HRT.

== Usage ==
In the United States, the phenomenon of HRT may be fairly recent but is an increasingly common characteristic of speech especially among younger speakers. However, serious scientific and linguistic inquiry on this topic has a much more extensive history in linguistic journals from Australia, New Zealand, and Britain where HRT seems to have been noted as early as World War II.

It has been noted in speech heard in areas of [[Canada]], in [[Cape Town]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and in the [[United States]] where it is often associated with a particular [[sociolect]] that originated among affluent teenage girls in [[Southern California]] (see [[Valleyspeak]] and [[Valley girl]]). It was observed in Mississippi in 1963 (see "Twirling at Ole Miss" in ''[[Red-Dirt Marijuana and Other Tastes]]''). Elsewhere in the United States, this tonal pattern is characteristic of the speech heard in parts of the rural [[Upper Midwest]] that have come under the influence of [[Norwegian phonology]] through [[Norwegian Minnesotan|Norwegian migration to Minnesota]] and [[Norwegian Dakotan|North Dakota]].

Although it is characterized in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as "Australian question intonation" (AQI) and blamed on the popularity of Australian [[soap opera]]s among teenagers, HRT is also a feature of several Irish-English dialects, especially in [[Ulster English|mid-Ulster and Belfast English]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=No reference in this section supports any content (added 20 May 2004) referring to usage in UK/N.Ireland}}

A 1986 report stated that in [[Sydney]], it is used more than twice as often by young generations as by older ones, and particularly by women.&lt;ref name="guy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guy |first1=G. |last2=Horvath |first2=B. |last3=Vonwiller |first3=J. |last4=Daisley |first4=E. |last5=Rogers |first5=I. |title=An intonation change in progress in Australian English |journal=Language in Society |volume=15 |year=1986 |pages=23&amp;ndash;52 |ISSN=0047-4045 | doi = 10.1017/s0047404500011635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also subtly indicates that the speaker is "not finished yet", thus perhaps discouraging interruption.&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guy"/&gt;

High rising terminal also occurs in non-English languages, such as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ([[Iraqi Arabic]], [[Egyptian Arabic]] and [[Lebanese Arabic]]), [[Cham language|Cham]], [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]], [[Dominican Spanish]],&lt;ref name="Warren2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Warren|title=Uptalk: The Phenomenon of Rising Intonation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pOzCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-45385-8|pages=168–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1884&amp;context=pwpl Uptalk in Spanish Dating Shows?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Media in Australia, Britain, and the United States have negatively portrayed the usage of HRT, claiming that its use exhibits a speaker's insecurities about the statement and undermines effective speaking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movi0es/lake-bell-talks-about-in-a-world--and-the-politics-of-dialect/2013/08/08/71eb5ed0-ff76-11e2-96a8-d3b921c0924a_story.html "Lake Bell talks about 'In a World ...' and the politics of dialect"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/a-female-senator-explains-why-uptalk-is-part-of-womens-nature/283107/ A Female Senator Explains Why Uptalk Is Part of Women's 'Nature'] ''The Atlantic'', January 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2015/07/23/425608745/from-upspeak-to-vocal-fry-are-we-policing-young-womens-voices "From Upspeak to Vocal Fry: Are We 'Policing' Young Women's Voices?"] ''[[Fresh Air]]''. NPR, July 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/vocal-fry-strong-female-voice Young women, give up the vocal fry and reclaim your strong female voice] by Naomi Woofe, July 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/caveman-logic/201010/the-uptalk-epidemic "The uptalk epidemic - Can you say something without turning it into a question?"] ''Psychology Today'', October 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Time'' reports that it hampers job interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/2820087/3-speech-habits-that-are-worse-than-vocal-fry-in-job-interviews/ "3 speech habits that are worse than vocal fry in job interviews"] ''Time'', June 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Recent evidence shows that leaders of the peer group are more likely to use HRT in their declaratives than the junior members of the particular peer group.&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McLemore |first=C.A. |title=The Pragmatic Interpretation of English Intonation: Sorority Speech |journal=Dissertation Abstracts International A: The Humanities and Social Sciences |volume=52 |number=4 |year=1991 |pages=1311&amp;ndash;A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cheng |first1=W. |first2=M. |last2=Warren |year=2005 |title=//CAN i help you //: The use of rise and rise-fall tones in the Hong Kong Corpus of Spoken English |journal=International Journal of Corpus Linguistics |volume=10 |number=1 |pages=85&amp;ndash;107 |ISSN=1384-6655 |doi=10.1075/ijcl.10.1.05che}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[University of Pennsylvania]] phonologist [[Mark Liberman]], [[George W. Bush]] began to use HRT extensively in his speeches as his presidency continued.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Liberman]], [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002708.html "Uptalk uptick?"]. ''[[Language Log]]'', 15 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Robin Lakoff]] drew attention to the pattern in her book ''Language and Women's Place'', which argued that women were socialized to talk in ways that lacked power, authority, and confidence. Rising intonation on declarative sentences was one of the features Lakoff included in her description of "women's language", a gendered speech style which in her view both reflected and reproduced its users' subordinate social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakoff|first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Lakoff|title=Language and Woman's Place: Text and Commentaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-NdKhaWQfUC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195347173|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rising-pitch is mostly applied to clauses before the end of the sentence, it serves as a type of notice that the sentence remains 'in-progress' and thus to prevent interruption.

==Implications for gender==

Because HRT has been popularized as "Valley Girl Speak", it has acquired an almost exclusively feminine gender connotation. Studies confirm that more women use HRT than men.&lt;ref name="NYblogs"&gt;{{cite web 
| url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/overturning-the-myth-of-valley-girl-speak/? 
| title=Overturning the Myth of Valley Girl Speak | work=The New York Times 
| first=Jan |last=Hoffman 
| date=December 23, 2013 | accessdate=August 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Thomas J. Linneman]] contends, "The more successful a man is, the less likely he is to use HRT; the more successful a woman is, the more likely she is to use uptalk".&lt;ref name=NYblogs/&gt; Though women appear to use HRT more often than men, the differences in frequency are not significant enough to brand HRT as an exclusively female speech pattern. Susan Miller, a vocal coach in Washington, D.C., insists that she receives both male and female clients with equal frequency—not because either gender is concerned that they sound too feminine, but that they sound too young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://time.com/2820087/3-speech-habits-that-are-worse-than-vocal-fry-in-job-interviews/ | title=3 Speech Habits That Are Worse Than Vocal Fry in Job Interviews | work=Time.com | date=June 4, 2014 | accessdate=March 24, 2016 | author=Rhodan, Maya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Sankin, a New York State licensed speech pathologist, affirms that she has "now noticed in my practice that it is a conversational style that extends equally across gender, age, and socioeconomic levels.  It seems that nobody is immune to this trend that has become as contagious as the common cold".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sankinspeechimprovement.com/are-you-asking-me-or-telling-me-speech-pattern/ | title=Are You Asking Me or Telling Me? {{!}} What is Upspeak? | publisher=Sankin Speech Improvement | accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings have thus been inconclusive regarding HRT as a gendered speech pattern, though the (partial) evidence that HRT is more common among women is consistent with the third principle of the [[gender paradox]] identified by sociolinguist [[William Labov]], namely that "in linguistic change from below, women use higher frequencies of innovative forms more than men do". Viewing HRT as "change from below" also explains why it appears to be more common among young speakers.

Despite inconclusive research,{{citation_needed|date=June 2017}} there appears to be merit to the claim that gendered connotations of HRT give rise to difficulties in the feminist sphere. Anne Charity Hudley, a linguist at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], suggests, "When certain linguistic traits are tied to women ... they often will be assigned a negative attribute without any actual evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-24/upspeaks-use-by-smart-men-and-women-and-what-it-means | title=What Does How You Talk Have to Do With How You Get Ahead? | work=Bloomberg.com | date=April 24, 2014 | accessdate=March 24, 2016 | author=Winter, Caroline |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216083104/http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-24/upspeaks-use-by-smart-men-and-women-and-what-it-means|archivedate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative associations with the speech pattern, in combination with gendered expectations, have contributed to an implication that for female speakers to be viewed as authoritative, they ought to sound more like men than women. These implications are perpetuated by various media, including the coverage of politics.

Female U.S. Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], for example, has voiced her concern that traditionally feminine speech patterns do not allow a female speaker to be taken seriously. "To meet those standards," she says, "you have to speak less like a young girl and more like a young, aspiring professional...it's a choice every young woman is going to have to make about how she wants to be and how she wants to be received".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/a-female-senator-explains-why-uptalk-is-part-of-womens-nature/283107/ | title=A Female Senator Explains Why Uptalk Is Part of Women's 'Nature' | work=The Atlantic | date=January 16, 2014 | accessdate=March 24, 2016 | author=Green, Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist objections to this may take issue with the perhaps arbitrary distinction Gillibrand makes between a "young girl" and "a young, aspiring professional". Further, the choice young women purportedly must make about how she wants to be received does not appear to be a choice young men must also make—at least not one as widely urged by authoritative figures. Lydia Dallet of ''Business Insider'' affirms this concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-uptalk-could-cost-you-a-promotion-2014-1 |work=Business Insider |title=This Communication Quirk Could Cost You a Promotion | accessdate=August 14, 2016 |last=Dallet |first=Lydia|date=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob of [[Suruç|Sarug]]''' ({{lang-syr|ܝܥܩܘܒ ܣܪܘܓܝܐ}}, ''Yaʿquḇ Sruḡāyâ'', {{IPA-syc|ˌjaˤˈquβ sᵊˌruɣˈɒˌjɒ}}; his toponym is also spelled ''Serug'' or ''Serugh''; {{lang-la|Iacobus Sarugiensis}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northvegr.org/lore/langobard/001.php |title=Northvegr - History of the Langobards |date=2006-09-27 |access-date=2017-03-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927152559/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/langobard/001.php |archivedate=27 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{c.}} 451 – 29 November 521), also called '''[[Mor (honorific)|Mar]] Jacob''', was one of the foremost [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[poet]]-[[Christian theology|theologians]], perhaps only second in stature to [[Ephrem the Syrian]] and equal to [[Narsai]]. Where his predecessor Ephrem is known as the 'Harp of the Spirit', Jacob is the 'Flute of the Spirit'. He is best known for his prodigious corpus of more than seven-hundred verse [[homily|homilies]], or ''mêmrê'' ({{lang|syr|ܡܐܡܖ̈ܐ}} {{IPA-syc|ˈmemˌre}}), of which only 225 have thus far been edited and published.

==Life==
Jacob was born around the middle of the fifth century in the village of Kurtam ({{lang|syc|ܟܘܪܬܘܡ}}) on the [[Euphrates]] in the ancient region of Serugh, which stood as the eastern part of the province of [[Commagene]] (corresponding to the modern Turkish districts of [[Suruç]] and [[Birecik]]). He was educated in the famous [[School of Edessa]] and became [[chorbishop|chorepiscopus]] back in the Serugh area, serving rural churches of Haura ({{lang|syr|ܚܘܪܐ}}, ''Ḥaurâ''). His tenure of this office extended over a time of great trouble to the [[Christian]] population of [[Mesopotamia]], due to the fierce war carried on by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian emperor]] [[Kavadh I]] within the Roman borders. When, on 10 January 503, the city of Amida (now [[Diyarbakır]]) was captured by the Sasanians after a [[Siege of Amida (502–503)|three-month siege]] and all its citizens put to the sword or carried captive, a panic seized the whole district, and the Christian inhabitants of many neighbouring cities planned to leave their homes and flee to the west of the Euphrates. They were recalled to a more courageous frame of mind by the letters of Jacob.

In 519, Jacob was elected [[bishop]] of the main city of the area, called in Syriac ''Baṭnān d-Sruḡ'' ({{lang|syr|ܒܛܢܢ ܕܣܪܘܓ}}). As Jacob was born in the same year as the controversial [[Council of Chalcedon]], he lived through the intense rifts that [[schism|split]] [[Eastern Christianity]], which led to [[Syriac Orthodox Church|most Syriac speakers being separated]] from [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Byzantine communion]]. Even though imperial persecution of [[anti-Chalcedonianism|anti-Chalcedonians]] became increasingly brutal towards the end of Jacob's life, he remained surprisingly quiet on such divisive theological and political issues. However, when pressed in correspondence by Paul, bishop of [[Edessa]], he openly expressed dissatisfaction with the proceedings of Chalcedon.

From the various extant accounts of Jacob's life and from the number of his known works, we gather that his literary activity was unceasing. According to [[Bar Hebraeus]] (''Chron. Eccles.'' i. 191) he employed 70 [[amanuenses]] and wrote in all 760 metrical homilies, besides expositions, letters and hymns of different sorts. Of his merits as a writer and poet we are now well able to judge from [[Paul Bedjan]]'s edition of selected metrical homilies (Paris 1905-1908), containing 146 pieces. They are written throughout in dodecasyllabic metre, and those published deal mainly with biblical themes, though there are also poems on such subjects as the deaths of [[Christian martyrs]], the fall of the idols and the [[First Council of Nicaea]].

Of Jacob's prose works, which are not nearly so numerous, the most interesting are his letters, which throw light upon some of the events of his time and reveal his attachment to [[Miaphysitism]], which was then struggling for supremacy in the Syrian churches, and particularly at Edessa, over the opposite teaching of [[Nestorius]].

The Catholic Church regards Jacob of Serugh as a Saint. He is recorded as such on 29 November in the latest edition of the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', that of 2004 (p. 649).
==Works==
He is especially famous for his metrical [[homilies]] in the [[dodecasyllabic verse]] of which, says [[Bar Hebraeus]], he composed over eight hundred known to us. Only a selection of them have been published in modern translations, e.g. on [[Simeon Stylites]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefano Evodio Assemani|Assemani]], "Acta Martyrum", Il. 230 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[virginity]], [[fornication]], etc.,&lt;ref&gt;In Overbeck, "S. Ephraemi Syri ... opera selecta", pp. 385 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; two on [[Mary, mother of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;In Abbeloos, "De vita et scriptis S. Jacobi Sarugensis", Louvain, 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; on the chariot described by [[Ezekiel]],&lt;ref&gt;In Moesinger, "Monum. Syr.", II.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ongoing series of texts with English translations being published by [[Gorgias Press]] in the series,&lt;ref&gt;The Metrical Homilies of Mar Jacob of Sarug.&lt;/ref&gt; which has also republished the five-volume publication of homilies by P. Bedjan with a supplemental sixth volume of additional homilies collected by S. Brock. He wrote his earliest homilies in his early twenties.

'''Kuppur Yalappa Narayanaswamy''', also known as '''KYN''', is a popular Kannada poet, scholar, critic, and playwright. He is currently a Kannada professor in the Government Arts College, Bangalore. He is the author of many popular Kannada plays including ''Kalavu, Anabhigna Shakuntala, Chakraratna, Huliseere,'' and ''Vinura Vema''. He has also translated Kuvempu’s ''Shudra Tapaswi'' into Telugu. He is credited with adapting Kuvempu’s magnum opus ''[[Malegalalli madumagalu]]'' into a 9-hour play. He has also written the screenplay for the films ''Kalavu''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2913910/|title=Kalavu|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Suryakaanti]]''.

He won the Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karnatakasahithyaacademy.org/downloads/Book_Prize2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=2005£ÉAiÀÄ ¸Á°£À §ºÀÄªÀiÁ¤vÀ ¥ÀÄ¸ÀÛPÀUÀ¼ÀÄ|website=Karnatakasahityaacademy.org|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his play ''Pampabharatha'', which is considered a milestone in modern Kannada theatre. He is considered to be an influential writer and thinker. His plays are representative of Kannada theatre’s search for new frontiers in experimental theatre.

==Biography==
KYN was born in Kuppur village near Masthi in Malur Taluk, Kolar district, Karnataka. He was born to Yalappa and Muniyamma. He finished his schooling in Masthi and moved to Bangalore to obtain his BA, MA and M.Phil degrees in Kannada. His PhD, titled ''Neeradeevige'', is considered a milestone in the societal understanding of cultural associations with water. He currently lives in Bangalore with his wife and two children.

==Writing career==
KYN first came into prominence with his play ''Pampabharatha'', whose essence is based on Adikavi Pampa’s epic poem ''Vikramarjunavijaya'', which is also known as ''Pampabharatha''. While Pampa’s epic relates the Mahabharatha from the perspective of Arjuna, KYN’s play is based on Karna’s viewpoint of events in Mahabharatha. However, the play is also a deconstruction of Pampa’s version and the Mahabharatha itself, and it moves the narration to contemporary times and also focuses on issues of contemporary relevance. The play, staged by the theatre group Samudaya, has seen a hundred shows.

Since Pampabharatha, his other plays such as ''Kalavu, Anabhigna Shakuntala'', and ''Male Mantrika'' have been widely appreciated by Kannada audiences. He is currently working on a new play tentatively titled ''Mallige''.

In 2010, KYN adapted Kuvempu’s ''Malegalalli Madumagalu'' ''(The Bride in the Mountains)'' into a 9-hour play&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130909235156/http://caravanmagazine.in/lede/dusk-dawn] &lt;/ref&gt; that was directed by noted theatre director and NSD alumnus [[C. Basavalingaiah]]. The play was staged about 15 times each in Bangalore and Mysore, and showcased to nearly 60,000 audience members.

KYN also co-authored the script for the light and sound show ''Manushya Jathi Tanonde Valam''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141015151935/http://karnatakavarthe.org/en/manushya-jati-tanonde-valam-2/] &lt;/ref&gt; with Kotaganahalli Ramaiah and Lakshmipathy Kolar. This show, also directed by Basavalingaiah, with music composed by famed music director Hamsalekha, was staged in 28 districts in Karnataka.

KYN has also written screenplays for the films ''Kalavu'' (a cinematic adaptation of his play) and ''Suryakaanti''. He is currently working on screenplays with renowned Kannada film directors TS Nagabharana and Nagathihalli Chandrashekar.

He has curated a music album titled ''Kolar Desi Gold'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bangalore/article1239933.ece|title=Keeping the folk tradition alive|website=Newindianexpress.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with music scored by Hamsalekha. The album is a compilation of Telugu folk songs that have also been translated into Kannada. He has written the lyrics for the music album ''Kailamp'' ''(KYN love songs)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/bangalore/Trio-release-music-album-for-mentor/2013/11/23/article1906622.ece|title=Trio release music album for mentor|website=Newindianexpress.com|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with music being composed by his student Arvinda SD and the songs sung by an ensemble of popular singers in styles ranging from classical and folk to jazz.

As a Kannada professor, KYN has authored the Kannada text Sahitya Samvada -1 for Bangalore University.

 | footer            = In the early 18th century, the [[Théâtre de la foire]] in [[Paris]] – a collective name for the theatres at the annual fairs at St Germain, St Laurent (see illustration above) and later, St Ovide – offered performances with both music and spoken dialogue. First called [[comédie en vaudeville]], these developed into the [[opéra comique]]. The Théâtre de la foire appeared in [[London]] in the 1720s, to be imitated in the form of the English [[ballad opera]], which in turn stimulated the creation of the German [[Singspiel]].

This is an inclusive [[glossary]] '''list of opera genres''', giving alternative names.

"Opera" is an Italian word (short for "opera in musica"), however it was not ''commonly'' used in Italy (or indeed in other countries) to refer to the genre of particular works. Most composers used more precise designations to present their work to the public. Often specific genres of opera were commissioned by theatres or patrons (in which case the form of the work might deviate more or less from the genre norm, depending on the inclination of the composer). Opera genres are not exclusive. Some operas are regarded as belonging to several.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' is regularly referred to as both a [[dramma giocoso]] and an [[opera buffa]], however [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] himself called the work an [[opera buffa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Opera genres have been defined in different ways, not always in terms of stylistic rules. Some, like [[opera seria]], refer to traditions identified by later historians,&lt;ref name=OS&gt;McClymonds, Marita P and [[Daniel Heartz|Heartz, Daniel]]: "Opera seria" in ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. [[Stanley Sadie]] (London, 1992) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, like [[Zeitoper]], have been defined by their own inventors. Other forms have been associated with a particular theatre, for example [[opéra comique]] at the [[Opéra-Comique|theatre of the same name]], or [[opéra bouffe]] at the [[Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens]].

This list does not include terms that are vague and merely descriptive, such as '[[comic opera]]',&lt;ref&gt;"A general name for an operatic work in which the prevailing mood is one of comedy." [[John Warrack|Warrack John]]; Ewan West, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', (1992), {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'sacred opera', 'tragic opera' or 'one-act opera' etc. Original language terms are given to avoid the ambiguities that would be caused by English translations.{{clear}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4382">The following '''lists of endangered languages''' are mainly based on [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|the definitions used by UNESCO]]. In order to be listed, a language must be classified as "endangered" in a cited academic source. Researchers have concluded that in less than one hundred years, almost half of the languages known today will be lost forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/science/19language.html|title=Languages Die, but Not Their Last Words|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|date=2007-09-19|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-10|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SIL Ethnologue]] (2005) lists 473 out of 6,909 living languages inventorized (6.8%) as "nearly extinct", indicating cases where "only a few elderly speakers are still living"; this figure dropped to 6.1% as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2013. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Seventeenth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Online version: [http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/status Summary by language status]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to judge if a language is endangered, the number of speakers is less important than their age distribution. There are languages in [[Indonesia]] reported with as many as two million native speakers alive now, but all of advancing age, with little or no transmission to the young. On the other hand, while there are only 30,000 [[Ladin language|Ladin]] speakers left, almost all children still learn it as their mother tongue, thus Ladin is not currently endangered. Similarly, the [[Hawaiian language]] has only about 1,000 speakers but it has stabilized at this number, and there is now school instruction in the language, from preschool through the 12th grade. Thus the language is classified as merely vulnerable.

While there are somewhere around six or seven thousand languages on Earth today, about half of them have fewer than about 3,000 speakers. Experts predict that even in a conservative scenario, about half of today's languages will become extinct within the next fifty to one hundred years.

Apart from a period of study at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]], his home has always been in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] (Cornish ''Porthia'').

He is a member of [[Gorseth Kernow]], and was initiated as a [[bard]] under the [[Bardic name]] ''Skogynn Pryv'' (Worm's Fool) in 2003 on passing a [[Cornish language]] examination after four years of study, largely conducted during train journeys as a trade union representative. The name derives from the nickname of a [[smuggling|smuggler's]] assistant in a local story involving outwitting a Customs man, and was chosen as appropriate as he worked for 32 years in the [[Inland Revenue]]. He was Deputy Grand Bard from September 2006, and was installed as Grand Bard in September 2009 until he handed over to Maureen Fuller (Steren Mor) at the end of the Camelford Gorsedd on 1 September 2012. Member of the Cornish Language Board (Kesva an Taves Kernewek) 2006-2015. Chairman Bewnans Kernow 2009-2012,Treasurer Bewnans Kernow 2012-2016.

As well as contributions to anthologies, he has written three collections of poetry in Cornish with English translations, and is Cornish Language Editor of ''[[Poetry Cornwall / Bardhonyaeth Kernow]]''. His poetry combines the easy flow of colloquial [[Cornish language|Cornish]] with a variety of influences ranging from Afro-American song to [[Primo Levi]] and early Celtic literature.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} He is a frequent contributor to magazines such as ''[[Scryfa]]'' and ''Poetry Cornwall / Bardhonyeth Kernow''. His collection "A Worm's Folly" received a nomination in the 2012 Holyer An Gof literary awards.
He was elected President St Ives Old Cornwall Society at its 2014 AGM and continued until the AGM 2017, he was succeeded by Margaret Stevens.

'''Moovalur Ramamirtham''' ({{lang-ta|மூவலூர் ராமாமிர்தம்}}) (1883–1962) was a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] social reformer, author, and political activist of the [[Dravidian Movement]], who worked for the abolition of the ''Devadasi'' system in the [[Madras Presidency]]. She was born in Thiruvarur, and was brought up at moovalur a village near mayiladhuthurai.hence she was called commonly known as moovalur ramamirtham ammaiyar. She was the author of the 1936 novel ''Dasigalin Mosavalai alladhu madhi pettra minor'' (lit. Devadasis' web of deceit or the minor grown wise) which exposed the plight of the devadasis. Originally a supporter of the nationalist [[Indian National Congress]], she became a member of [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]]'s [[Self-Respect Movement]] after Periyar left the Congress in 1925. In 1930, she supported [[Muthulakshmi Reddi]]'s failed attempt to abolish the Devadasi system in the Presidency through legislation. She took part in the [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|Anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40]] and in November 1938, was jailed for six weeks for participating in the agitations. The public awareness created by her novel and her continuous campaign to abolish the devadasi system, were instrumental in the passage of the [[Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act]] or the Devadasi Abolition Bill, which outlawed the practice in 1947. In 1949, she parted ways with Periyar, when he married Maniammai, a woman much younger than he was. She became a supporter of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), a new party started by Periyar's protégé [[C. N. Annadurai]]. She remained a DMK supporter till her death in 1962. In her memory, the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] has instituted the "Moovalur Ramamirtham Ammal Ninaivu Marriage Assistance Scheme" - a social welfare scheme to provide financial assistance to poor women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sumathy|last=Ramaswamy|year=1997|title= Passions of the tongue: language devotion in Tamil India, 1891-1970|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-20805-6|oclc=36084635|url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;chunk.id=ch5&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ch5&amp;brand=eschol| pages=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarkar"&gt;{{cite book | first=Tanika| last=Sarkar| authorlink=| year=2008| title=Women and social reform in modern India: a reader |edition= | publisher=Indiana University Press| location= | isbn= 978-0-253-22049-3| pages=395–403| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLGBUEs74n4C&amp;pg=PA397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thorner"&gt;{{cite book | first=Alice | last=Thorner, | first2=Maithreyi | last2=Krishna Raj|authorlink=| year=2000| title=Ideals, images, and real lives: women in literature and history |edition= | publisher=Orient Blackswan| location= | isbn= 978-81-250-0843-9| pages=241–250| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO-ztHz3XTUC&amp;pg=PA241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anandi"&gt;{{Cite journal| first = S.|last=Anandhi| title =Representing Devadasis: 'Dasigal Mosavalai' as a Radical Text| journal = Economic and Political Weekly| volume = 26| issue = 11/12| pages = 739–746| date = March 1991| jstor =4397430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessline"&gt;{{cite web

'''Negro''' is the name of an artist's drawing medium, consisting of black pencil lead often encased in a wooden or paper tool. Its history and uses are common knowledge among illustrators and historians interested in illustrative art.&lt;ref&gt;Borgman, Harry (2002). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V4O4fKCx4ecC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=negro+pencil+charcoal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nbHL2k6HOG&amp;sig=XAefCYv1hH0LuKvKwgq17gRtDGg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TYa7UM3dD8jYywG754DQDQ&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=negro%20pencil%20charcoal&amp;f=false Pen and Pencil Drawing Techniques]'', Courier Dover Publications, page 12. {{ISBN|978-0486418018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Negro", translates to "black" in Spanish and Italian, and is a term commonly used to describe artists' media and pigments that are black or dark in color.

== History ==
Negro lead was originally composed of a mixture of wax and charcoal and was often used in combination with heavily textured coquille paper. The intention was to create sturdy pencil line art which was dark enough to be reproduced with early photographic technology. It was used as a replacement for lithographic printmaking, just as pen and ink line art essentially took the place of intaglio in late 19th-century illustration.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

While the name is used in the artistic sense, the word "Negro" literally, depictions of stylized African natives have been used in marketing campaigns and product packaging. One of the original producers of negro pencils was the [[Koh-i-Noor]] company, however those manufactured by the company today are composed of lead that is slightly less dark and waxy than the originals. [[Cretacolor]] produces what they call Nero pencils, which are similar in composition. [[Prismacolor]] also manufactures a lead-based black pencil that is very close in composition.

==Nouns==

The nominal case category distinguishes 7 cases for nouns, 6 for pronouns and adjectives (no vocative):

Nouns belonging to this declension class are generally masculines ending in '''''-ъ''''' in the nominative singular (''bogъ'', ''gradъ'', ''rodъ''). The only exception are the nouns in ''-ъ'' that inflect as u-stem masculines.

Sometimes (but not yet obligatorily, in contrast to later Slavic languages), in the accusative singular, the beginnings of a difference between an animate and inanimate subgender can be seen, as the genitive may occasionally be used instead of the accusative for animate objects (''raba'' beside ''rabъ'').

&lt;br&gt;
Nouns with the suffix '''''-(j)an-in-ъ''''' (''graždaninъ'') also belong to this declension class in the singular, but in the plural they lose the ''-in-'' interfix and conform to the consonantal paradigm (''graždane, graždanъ, graždanem, graždany, graždane, graždanexъ, graždany).

Nouns belonging to this declension class are masculines ending in  '''''-ь''''' preceded by a [[palatal]] in the nominative singular (''vračь'', ''kralь'', ''košь'').

This paradigm encompasses nouns such as ''krai'' that don't appear to be ending in a palatal, but are in fact underlyingly combinations like ''krajь'' and so undergo this declension (''kraj -ь'', ''kraj -a'').

Nouns ending in agentive suffixes '''''-tel-ь''''' and '''''-ar-ь''''' also belong to this class (''učitelь, učitelja, učitelju...'', ''mytarь, mytarja, mytarju...'').

Just as the first and second person pronouns, the third person pronoun is commonly used only in oblique cases. Nominative singular forms are not attested in the OCS corpus, and are reconstructed. In the East South Slavic dialectal area where OCS originated, a suppletive nominative singular stem of the demonstrative ''tъ'' ('that') is used, elsewhere ''onъ'' ('that one there, yon'), or very rarely ''sь'' ('this').

By attaching the enclitic particle ''že'' to the forms of *i one obtains the relative pronoun: ''iže'' ('he who'), ''ježe'' ('the (female) one to whom'), ''jejuže'' ('the two of whom'), etc.

When following prepositions, these pronouns take a prothetic ''n-'', hence ''kъ n'imъ'' ('to them') instead of ''*imъ'', ''na n'emь'' ('on him'), etc. This is a remnant of final -m/n in the PIE prepositions *kom (cf. Latin [[:wikt:cum#Latin|cum]], Sanskrit [[:wikt:कम्|kám]]), 
*sm̥ (cf. Sanskrit [[:wikt:सम्|sám]]) and 
*h₁n̥ that yielded the OCS prepositions ''kъ'', ''sъ'', and ''vъ'' and then spread analogically to all the other prepositions.

The reflexive pronoun has only singular oblique forms, which is the state of affairs inherited from PIE [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European *swé|*swé]]. The reflexive pronoun refers to the subject as a whole, and can be translated as English ''-self'' (myself, yourself, himself etc.)

As mentioned, the third person pronoun *i participates in the formation of the relative pronoun by appending the indeclinable enclitic ''že''. Unlike the third person pronoun, however, the nominative case forms do occur. Similarly, a prothetic ''n-'' occurs when following prepositions, e.g., ''vъ n'ьže'' ('in which').

{{col-end}}

===Indefinite pronouns and adjectives===
The interrogative pronouns ''kъto, čьto'' can also have the indefinite meanings of 'anybody', 'anything' respectively.

The prefix ''ně-'' imparts an indefinite meaning to the word to which it is attached: thus ''kъto'' ('who?') becomes ''někъto'' ('someone'), and ''čьto'' ('what?') becomes ''něčьto'' ('something'). Similarly, the prefix ''ni-'' imparts a negative meaning: ''nikъto'' ('no one'), ''ničьto'' ('nothing'). A prepositions may come between prefix and base word:
: ně u kogo — ''with someone''
: ni o komьže nerodiši — ''you care for no one''

==Adjectives==
OCS adjectives can be in two forms: '''short''' and '''long''', corresponding to '''indefinite''' and '''definite''' meaning respectively. The long form is generally used only attributively, whereas the short form is predicative in nature. So, e.g., ''člověkъ dobrъ'' "a good man, man is good" whilst ''člověkъ dobryi'' "the good man, the man who is good".

Indefinite adjectives are inflected as the corresponding nouns of the primary declension, e.g., ''novъ'' as ''rabъ'', ''nova'' as ''žena'', ''novo'' as ''selo'', ''ništь'' as ''vračь'', ''ništa'' as ''duša'', ''nište'' as ''polje''.

Definite adjectives (also known as '''compound''', '''long''', or '''pronominal''' forms of adjective) are formed by suffixing to the indefinite form the anaphoric third-person pronoun ''jь'' (spelled as ''i'' in OCS orthography), ''ja, je'' as shown in the table.

===Adjective gradation===
There are three levels of adjective gradation in OCS:

*'''positive''', stating an absolute property of an object;
*'''comparative''', stating a relative property of an object;
*'''superlative''', stating a property of an object in relation to any other object it may be compared to.

====Comparative====
# Adjectives with falling tone on the root syllable:
#: dragъ ("dear") − draž-ii (''m''), draž-e (''n''), draž-ьši (''f'');
#: tęžьkъ ("heavy") − tęžii, tęže, tęžьši;
#: grǫbъ ("grumpy") − grǫblii, grǫble, grǫblьši.
# Adjectives with rising tone on the root syllable:
#: novъ ("new") − nov-ěi, nov-ěje, nov-ěiši;
#: starъ ("old") − star-ěi, star-ěje, star-ěiši;
#: junъ ("young") − jun-ěi, jun-ěje, jun-ěiši.

====Superlative====
The superlative is formed:
# by adding the prefix ''nai-'' to the comparative base: '''naidražii, naitęžьši, naigrǫble''';
# by combining the comparative form with the pronoun ''vьsego/vьsěxъ'': '''nověi vьsego, dražii vьsěxъ'''.

The '''absolute superlative''' is formed:
# by adding the prefix ''prě-'' to the positive: '''prědragъ, prěnova, prěstaro''';
# by using the adverb ''Ʒělo'' with the positive: '''Ʒělo dragъ, Ʒělo nova, Ʒělo staro'''.

==Verbs==
===Present===
The '''present tense''' is formed by adding present-tense endings onto the '''present tense stem''', which itself is sometimes hidden due to [[sound change]]s that have occurred in the past (more common verbs are listed):

*bosti (bod-), vesti (ved- or vez-), krasti (krad-), iti (id-)
*plesti (plet-), mesti (met-), greti (greb-), krasti (krad-)
*rešti (rek-), pešti (pek-), mošti (mog-), tešti (tek-)

There are several classes of verbs:

1. e-type verbs add the interfix ''-e-'' to the present stem (except in front of ''-ǫ'') and the endings:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verb
! Singular
! Plural
! Dual
|-
| bosti (bod-) ("be (future)")
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  bod -'''ǫ'''
 |2.  bod -'''e''' + -'''ši'''

 |3.  bod -'''e''' + -'''te'''
 }}
|-
| rešti (rek-) ("speak")
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  rek -'''ǫ'''
 |2.  reč -'''e''' + -'''ši'''
 |3.  reč -'''e''' + -'''tъ'''

| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  reč -'''e''' + -'''vě'''
 |2.  reč -'''e''' + -'''ta'''
 |3.  reč -'''e''' + -'''te'''
 }}
|}

2. i-type verbs exhibit the same set of endings, but this time the interfix is ''-i-'' (except in front of ''-ǫ'' and ''-ę''). In the first person singular one finds the processes of [[iotation]] (''k/c + j &gt; č, g/z + j &gt; ž, x/s + j &gt; š, l + j &gt; lj, n + j &gt; nj, t + j &gt; št, d + j &gt; žd'') and [[epenthesis]] (''bj &gt; blj, pj &gt; plj, mj &gt; mlj, vj &gt; vlj''):
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verb
! Singular
! Plural
! Dual
|-
| xvaliti (xval-) ("praise")
| {{unbulleted list

 |2.  xval -'''i''' + -'''ta'''
 |3.  xval -'''i''' + -'''te'''
 }}
|-
| ljubiti (ljub-) ("love")
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  ljub + -'''lj''' + -'''ǫ'''
 |2.  ljub -'''i''' + -'''ši'''
 |3.  ljub -'''i''' + -'''tъ'''
 }}
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  ljub -'''i''' + -'''mъ'''
 |2.  ljub -'''i''' + -'''te'''
 |3.  ljub -'''ętъ'''
 }}
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  ljub -'''i''' + -'''vě'''
 |2.  ljub -'''i''' + -'''ta'''
 |3.  ljub -'''i''' + -'''te'''
 }}
|}

3. The athematic verbs ''byti'', ''dati'', ''věděti'', ''iměti'' and ''jasti'' form the present tense irregularly:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verb
! Singular

|-
| byti ("be")
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  jesmь
 |2.  jesi

 }}
| {{unbulleted list

 |2.  jesta
 |3.  jeste
 }}
|-
| věděti ("know")
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  věmь
 |2.  věsi
 |3.  věstъ
 }}
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  věmъ
 |2.  věste
 |3.  vědętъ
 }}
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  věvě
 |2.  věsta
 |3.  věste
 }}
|-
| iměti ("have")
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  imamь
 |2.  imaši
 |3.  imatъ
 }}
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  imamъ
 |2.  imate
 |3.  imǫtъ
 }}
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  imavě
 |2.  imata
 |3.  imate
 }}
|-
| jasti ("eat")
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  jamь
 |2.  jasi
 |3.  jastъ
 }}
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  jamъ
 |2.  jaste
 |3.  jadętъ
 }}
| {{unbulleted list
 |1.  javě
 |2.  jasta
 |3.  jaste
 }}
|}

One should distinguish the verbs ''iměti'' (''imamь, imaši, imatъ''), ''imati'' (''jemljǫ, jemleši, jemletъ'') and ''jęti'' (''imǫ, imeši, imetъ''). Exceptional is also the verb ''xotěti'' which exhibits iotation even though it's not an i-type verb (''xoštǫ, xošteši, xoštetъ'').

===Asigmatic aorist===
The '''asigmatic aorist''' (also called '''root''' or '''simple''' aorist) was named after the loss of the phoneme /s/ in the inflection ([[Ancient Greek language|AGr.]] ''[[sigma]]''), i.e. there is no ''VsV &gt; VxV'' change (intervocalic /s/ yielding /x/). Over time, the asigmatic aorist became increasingly marked as an archaic language feature and was eventually replaced by the other two [[aorist]] formations.

The asigmatic aorist was formed by adding to the '''infinitive stem''' of e-type verbs with stem ending in a consonant (i.e. verbs with the infix ''-nǫ-'', which is dropped before the aorist endings, and verbs with the null infix) the following endings: '''''-ъ, -e, -e; -omъ, -ete, -ǫ; -ově, -eta, -ete'''''.

2. dviž -'''eta'''&lt;br&gt;
3. dviž -'''ete'''
|}

===Sigmatic aorist===
The '''sigmatic''' or '''s-aorist''' was formed in the following ways:

*Verbs whose stem ends in '''b, p, d, t, z, s''' form this aorist by dropping the final consonant and adding the interfix '''''-s-''''' plus the endings '''''-ъ, -, -; -omъ, -te, -ę; -ově, -ta, -te'''''. Intervocalic [[sigma]] (''s'') exhibits no change. As a side effect, '''''e''''' is lengthened to '''''ě''''', and '''''o''''' to '''''a'''''.
*Verbs whose stem ends in '''''r''''' or '''''k''''' form this aorist in the same way as previously mentioned, except that intervocalic sigma (''s'') changes into ''x'', the same set of endings being suffixed to the interfix. As a side effect, '''''e''''' is lengthened to '''''ě''''', and '''''o''''' to '''''a'''''.
*Verbs whose stem ends in a vowel form this aorist by suffixing exactly the same set of endings to the infinitive stem, and intervocalic ''-s-'' changes into ''-x-''.

:The 2nd and 3rd person singular forms of these verbs match the infinitive stem due to the elision of word-final sigma.

3. baste
|}

===New aorist===
The '''new aorist''' (also known as '''ox-aorist''') is formed by suffixing to the infinitive stem of e-type verbs ending in a consonant (verbs with the interfix ''-nǫ-'' and verbs with the null interfix) the interfix ''-os-'' (''-ox'') and onto it the endings '''''-ъ, -, -; -omъ, -te, -ę; -ově, -ta, -te'''''. Intervocalic sigma ''s'' changes into ''x''.

The 2nd and the 3rd person singular forms are not attested and thus the asigmatic aorist forms are taken as a replacement.

===Imperfect===
There are two ways of forming the imperfect:

1. If the infinitive stems ends in ''-a'' or ''-ě'', the interfix '''''-ax-''''' is appended (which changes to '''''-aš-''''' according to the first palatalization in front of ''e'') and onto it, the endings of the asigmatic aorist: '''''-ъ, -e, -e; -omъ, -ete, -ǫ; -ově, -eta, -ete'''''.

2. vidě -'''aš''' -'''eta'''&lt;br&gt;
3. vidě -'''aš''' -'''ete'''&lt;br&gt;
|}

2. The other way of forming the imperfect, applying to all other verbal stems, is by adding onto the present stem the interfix '''''-ěax-''''' (which, in accordance with the first palatalization, is changed to ''-ěaš-'' in front of ''e'') and onto it the endings of asigmatic aorist: '''''-ъ, -e, -e; -omъ, -ete, -ǫ; -ově, -eta, -ete'''''.

2. bod -'''ě''' -'''aš''' -'''eta'''&lt;br&gt;
3. bod -'''ě''' -'''aš''' -'''ete'''&lt;br&gt;
|}

Both of these imperfect formations often occur side by side in verbs with stem alternation:
*bьrati (bьra-; ber-) &gt; ''bьraaxъ'' or ''berěaxъ''
*gъnati (gъna-; žen-) &gt; ''gъnaaxъ'' or ''ženěaxъ''
*plьvati (plьva-; pljuj-) &gt; ''plьvaaxъ'' or ''pljujěaxъ''
*zъvati (zъva-; zov-) &gt; ''zъvaaxъ'' or ''zověaxъ''

In the texts of the OCS canon the forms are often contracted, so that '''''ěax''''' becomes '''''ěx''''' and '''''aax''''' becomes '''''ax'''''. An illustrating example is in [[Chernorizets Hrabar]]'s famous work ''O pismenex'' "An Account of Letters":&lt;br&gt;
:''Prěžde ubo slověne ne iměxǫ knigъ, nǫ črъtami i rězami čьtěxǫ i gataaxǫ, pogani sǫšte.''

Some forms exhibit [[sound change]]s, namely [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] or [[iotation]] in front of ''ě'', [[yat]] thus turning into ''a''. The same applies if the stem ends in ''j'' which is then reduced in front of yat and yat again changes into ''a'':
*xvaliti (xval-) &gt; xval + ě + axъ &gt; ''xvaljaaxъ''
*nositi (nos-) &gt; nos + ě + axъ &gt; ''nošaaxъ''
*pešti (pek-) &gt; pek + ě + axъ &gt; ''pečaaxъ''
*čuti (čuj-) &gt; čuj + ě + axъ &gt; ''čujaaxъ''

That the second form and not the first is the original one (the first being formed by the change of yat to ''a'') is confirmed by the imperfect paradigm of the verb ''byti'':

===Participles===
====Present active participle====
The '''present active participle''' is formed by adding the following endings to the present stem:

1. e-type verbs and athematic verbs:
* present stem + '''''-y''''' (masculine and neuter) and '''''-ǫšti''''' (feminine)
:(e.g., ''greti (greb-) &gt; greby; grebǫšti'')

2. e-type verbs whose present stem ends in a palatal:
* present stem + '''''-ę''''' (masculine and neuter) and '''''-ǫšti''''' (feminine)
:(e.g., ''kupovati (kupuj-) &gt; kupuję, kupujǫšti'')

3. i-type verbs:
* present stem + '''''-ę''''' (masculine and neuter) and '''''-ęšti''''' (feminine)
:(e.g., ''ljubiti (ljub-) &gt; ljubę, ljubęšti'')

====Present passive participle====
The '''present passive participle''' is formed by suffixing to the present stem the endings '''''-o/e/i''''' + '''''m''''' + '''''ъ/a/o''''' (masculine, feminine, neuter):

1. e-type verbs and athematic verbs:
* present stem + '''''o''''' + '''''m''''' + '''''ъ/a/o'''''
:(e.g., ''pešti (pek-) &gt; pekomъ, pekoma, pekomo'')

2. e-type verbs whose stem ends in a palatal:
* present stem + '''''e''''' + '''''m''''' + '''''ъ/a/o'''''
:(e.g., ''želeti (želj-) &gt; željemъ, željema, željemo'')

3. i-type verbs:
* present stem + '''''i''''' + '''''m''''' + '''''ъ/a/o'''''
:(e.g., ''xvaliti (xval-) &gt; xvalimъ, xvalima, xvalimo'')

====Past active participle====
The '''past active participle''' is formed by suffixing to the infinitive stem the following endings:

1. e-type verbs and athematic verbs:
* infinitive stem + '''''-ъ''''' (masculine and neuter) or '''''-ъši''''' (feminine)
:(e.g., ''bosti (bod-) &gt; bodъ, bodъši'')

2. i-type verbs exhibit epenthetic ''v'', which eliminates [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]:
* infinitive stem + '''''-vъ''''' (masculine and neuter) or '''''-vъši''''' (feminine)
:(e.g., ''xvaliti (xvali-) &gt; xvalivъ, xvalivъši'')

The latter i-type verbs have twofold forms of this participle - the mentioned one of older origin, and a newer one which arose due to analogical leveling:
* ''nositi'' (nosi-) &gt; ''nošъ, nošъši'' (by [[iotation]] from ''+ ''jъ, jъši'') or ''nosivъ, nosivъši''
* ''roditi'' (rod-) &gt; ''roždъ, roždъši'' (by [[iotation]] from ''+ ''jъ, jъši'') or ''rodivъ, rodivъši''

3. Verbs with [[liquid metathesis]] form this participle from its older stem form:
* ''mrěti'' (&lt; ''*merti'') &gt; ''mьrъ, mьrъši'' (and not ''mrěvъ, mrěvъši'')
* ''prostrěti'' (&lt; ''*prosterti'') &gt; ''prostьrъ, prostьrъši'' (and not ''prostrěvъ, prostrěvъši'')

4. Irregular participles:
* ''iti'' &gt; ''šьdъ, šьdъši''
* ''jaxati'' &gt; ''javъ, javъši''

====l-participle====
The '''l-participle''' (also known as the '''resultative participle''' or '''second past active participle''') is formed by adding to the infinitive stem the interfix '''''-l-''''' and the endings '''''ъ/a/o'''''. If the stem ends in ''-t'' or ''-d'', this consonant is dropped.
* ''xvaliti (xvali) &gt; xvalilъ, xvalila, xvalilo''
* ''plesti (plet-) &gt; plelъ, plela, plelo''

====Past passive participle====
The '''past passive participle''' is formed by suffixing to the infinitive stem the following endings:

1. Verbs with stem ending in a consonant, ''-y'' or ''-i'':
* infinitive stem + '''''en''''' + '''''ъ/a/o'''''
:(e.g., ''bosti (bod-) &gt; bodenъ, bodena, bodeno'')
:(e.g., ''nositi (nosi-) &gt; nošenъ, nošena, nošeno'' - by [[iotation]] from ''nosi + enъ &gt; nosjenъ &gt; nošenъ'')
:(e.g., ''umyti'' with interfix ''-ъv-'' &gt; ''umъvenъ, umъvena, umъveno'')

2. Verbs with stem ending in ''-a'' or ''-ě'':
* infinitive stem + '''''n''''' + '''''ъ/a/o'''''
:(e.g., ''glagolati (glagola-) &gt; glagolanъ, glagolana, glagolano'')
:(e.g., ''viděti (vidě-) &gt; vižden, viždena, viždeno'' - by [[iotation]] from ''viděn, viděna, viděno'')

3. Verbs with stem ending in ''-ę'', ''-u'', ''-i'' and ''-ě'' (obtained by [[liquid metathesis]]):
* infinitive stem + '''''t''''' + '''''ъ/a/o'''''
:(e.g., ''klęti (klę-) &gt; klętъ, klęta, klęto'')
:(e.g., ''obuti (obu-) &gt; obutъ, obuta, obuto'')
:(e.g., ''mrěti (mrě-) &gt; mrětъ, mrěta, mrěto'')
:(e.g., ''viti (vi-) &gt; vitъ, vita, vito'')

Of the latter verbs, those with stem ending in ''-i'' (''viti, biti'' etc.) can also form the past passive participle like the verbs in the first group: ''bitъ'' or ''bijenъ'', ''vitъ'' or ''vijenъ'' etc.).

===Compound tenses===
====Perfect====
The '''perfect''' is formed by combining the l-participle with the imperfective present forms of the auxiliary verb ''byti''.

*''nosilъ/a/o'' ''jesmь, jesi, jestъ''
*''nosili/y/a'' ''jesmъ, jeste, sǫtь''
*''nosila/ě/ě'' ''jesvě, jesta, jeste''

====Pluperfect====
The '''pluperfect''' can be formed in multiple ways, by combining the l-participle with the perfect, imperfect or aorist formation of the auxiliary verb ''byti''.
*''nosilъ/a/o'' ''bylъ/a/o jesmь'' or ''běaxъ'' or ''běxъ''
*''nosili/y/a'' ''byli/y/a jesmъ'' or ''běaxomъ'' or ''běxomъ''
*''nosila/ě/ě'' ''byla/ě/ě jesvě'' or ''běaxově'' or ''běxově''

====Future====
The '''future tense''' is usually expressed using the present tense form of the perfective verb. Imperfective verbs form the future tense by combining the auxiliary verb (''byti, xotěti, načęti, iměti'') and the infinitive.
*''bǫdǫ / xoštǫ / načьnǫ / imamь'' ''xvaliti''

====Future perfect====
The '''future perfect''' is formed by combining the l-participle with the perfective present of the auxiliary verb ''byti''.
* ''nosilъ/a/o'' ''bǫdǫ, bǫdeši, bǫdetъ''
* ''nosili/y/a'' ''bǫdemъ, bǫdete, bǫdǫtъ''
* ''nosila/ě/ě'' ''bǫdevě, bǫdeta, bǫdete''

====Conditional====
The '''conditional''' (or '''conditional-optative''') modal formation is formed by combining the l-participle with special modal forms of the auxiliary verb ''byti'' (with unattested dual forms):
*''nosilъ/a/o'' ''bimь, bi, bi''
*''nosili/y/a'' ''bimъ, biste, bǫ/bišę''

An alternative conditional is formed with the perfective aorist forms of ''byti'':
*''nosilъ/a/o'' ''byxъ, by, by''
*''nosili/y/a'' ''byxomъ, byste, byšę''

==Adverbs==
===Primary adverbs===
These are original adverbs with difficult to guess etymology and origin.

*'''abьje''' ('''abije''') = right away
*'''jedъva''' = hardly, barely
*'''ješte''' = yet, still
*'''nyně''' = now, today
*'''paky''' = again, back
*'''(j)uže''' = already

===Derived adverbs===
====Pronominal adverbs====
Pronominal adverbs are derived by suffixing pronouns (e.g., ''ov'' + ''amo'' = ovamo, ''kъ'' + ''de'' = ''kъde''):
*'''''-amo''''' = direction of movement (''tamo'', ''kamo'', ''onamo'')
*'''''-ako / -ače''''' = way, mode, manner (''tako'', ''inako'', ''inače'')
*'''''-de''''' = place (''sьde'', ''onude'', ''vьsьde'')
*'''''-gda''''' = time (''tъgda'', ''kъgda'', ''egda'')
*'''''-lь / -li / / -lě / -lьma / -lьmi''''' = measure, amount (''kolь'', ''kolě'', ''kolьmi'')

====Nominal adverbs====
Nominal adverbs are derived from nominals or turn by conversion to adverbs which are in fact inflective lexemes with adverbial semantics.

Modal adverbs are created with the suffixes '''''-o''''' or '''''-ě''''' (the endings of accusative and locative singular neuter gender respectively), with no difference in meanings between suffixes, although some adverbs have only the forms in ''-o'' (''veselo''), and some in ''-ě'' (''javě'').

Modal adverbs could also be formed deadjectivally by means of the interfix '''''-ьsk-''''' and the ending '''''-y''''' (by origin, the instrumental plural ending; e.g., ''slověnьsky'').

Adverbs could also be formed with the suffix '''''-ь''''' (''pravь'', ''različь'') and are by origin probably inherited [[Proto-Slavic]] accusative forms.

Frequently occurring are the adverbialized a-stem instrumentals such as ''jednьnojǫ'' and also adverbially used oblique cases.

Locative adverbs are by origin mostly petrified locative case forms of nouns: ''gorě'', ''dolě'', ''nizu'', and the same can be said for temporal adverbs: ''zimě'', ''polu dьne''.

==Prepositions==
===Primary prepositions===
The primary and non-derived prepositions are of [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] and [[Proto-Slavic language|PSl.]] heritage:
*'''''bez''''' "without" + [[genitive|G]]
*'''''iz''''' or '''''is''''' "from, out" + [[genitive|G]]
*:izdrǫky &lt; iz rǫky — ''from the hand''
*'''''kъ''''' "to, for, unto" + [[dative|D]]
*:..reče že Marθa kъ Iisusu.. — ''and Martha said unto Jesus''
*'''''na''''' "on, to, upon" + [[accusative|A]] (denoting direction) or [[locative|L]] (denoting place)
*:zlijašę ognь na zemьjǫ — ''they poured fire on earth''
*'''''nadъ''''' "on, upon, over" + [[accusative|A]] (denoting direction) or [[instrumental case|I]] (denoting place)
*:nadъ glavǫ — ''over the head''
*'''''o''''' or '''''ob''''' "over, round, about" + [[accusative|A]] (denoting direction) or [[locative|L]] (denoting place)
*:ob noštь vьsǫ — ''the whole night through''
*'''''otъ''''' "from, away" + [[genitive|G]]
*:otъ nebese — ''from heaven''
*'''''po''''' originally "under, below" + [[dative|D]] (extension in space), [[accusative|A]] (extension in space or time) or [[locative|L]] (temporal and local)
*:po vьsę grady — ''through all towns''
*:po tomь že — ''after that''
*:po morjǫ xodę — ''walking over the sea''
*'''''podъ''''' "under, beneath" + [[accusative|A]] (denoting direction) or [[instrumental case|I]] (denoting situation, location)
*:podъ nogy, podъ nogama — ''under the feet''
*'''''pri''''' "at, at the time" + [[locative|L]]
*:pri vraƷěxъ — ''among the heathen''
*'''''prědъ''''' "in front of, before" + [[accusative|A]] (denoting direction) or [[instrumental case|I]] (denoting situation)
*:prědъ gradomь — ''in the vicinity of the city''
*'''''sъ''''' "for the extent of" + [[accusative|A]], "from, off, away" + [[genitive|G]], "with" + [[instrumental case|I]] (denoting association, not instrument)
*:sъ lakъtь — ''a cubit long''
*:sъ nebese — ''down from heaven''
*:sъ nimь — ''with him''
*'''''u''''' "at, in" + [[genitive|G]]
*:u dvьrьcь — ''at the doors''
*'''''vъ''''' "in" + [[accusative|A]] (denoting direction) or [[locative|L]] (denoting place)
*:vъ tъ dьnь — ''that day''
*:vъ kupě — ''together''
*'''''vъz''''' or '''''vъs''''' "for, in exchange for" + [[accusative|A]]
*:vъs kǫjǫ — ''why?''
*'''''za''''' "for, after, behind" + [[accusative|A]] (denoting direction), [[instrumental case|I]] (denoting place) or [[genitive|G]] (in the sense "because")
*:ęti za vlasy — ''to seize by the hair''

===Secondary prepositions===
The secondary prepositions are derived from adverbial expressions: ''vьslědъ'' from ''vь slědъ'', ''prěžde'' is a comparative form of ''prědъ'' etc.

==Conjunctions and particles==
Conjunctions and particles are not easily separable because they sometimes function as an [[intensifier]], and sometimes as a conjunction.

*'''''a''''', '''''ali''''' "but" - (proclitic), setting two parts of a statement in opposition
*'''''ako''''', '''''jako''''', '''''ěko''''' "that, so that, how, when, as" - (proclitic) introducing indirect or direct speech; highly context-dependent
*'''''ašte''''' "if, whether" - (proclitic) a conditional particle, also used to generalize relative pronouns
*'''''bo''''' "for, because" - (enclitic) denoting caustive relationships (''i'' + ''bo'' = ibo, ''u'' + ''bo'' = ubo)
*'''''da''''' "in order that" - (proclitic) introducing final result
*'''''i''''' "and; even, too" - (proclitic) connecting clauses or used as an adverb within a clause
*'''''ide''''' "for, since" - (proclitic)
*'''''jegda''''', '''''jegdaže''''' "when, if" - (proclitic)
*'''''jeda''''' "surely not" - (proclitic), introducing a question expecting a negative answer
*'''''li''''' "or", '''''li...li''''' "either... or" - (proclitic or enclitic) generally when forming a question; when enclitic, usually a direct question, when proclitic, taking the meaning "or"
*'''''ne''''' "not", '''''ne...ni''''' "neither... nor" - ''ne'' generally occurs before the negated item, occurring usually once in the main clause, but ''ni'' may occur several times in the same clause
*'''''nъ''''' "but" - (proclitic) connecting two clauses
*'''''to''''' "then, so" - (proclitic) correlative to ''ašte''
*'''''že''''' "on the other hand, or, and" - (enclitic) the commonest particle functioning both as an intensifier and a conjunction; often bound to pronouns and adverbs (''jakože'', ''nikъto že'')

The '''Omotic languages''' are group of languages spoken in southwestern [[Ethiopia]]. The [[Ge'ez script]] is used to write some of the Omotic languages, the [[Latin script]] for some others. They are fairly [[agglutinative]] and have complex [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] systems (for example, the [[Bench language]]). The languages have around 6.2 million speakers. The group is generally classified as belonging to the [[Afroasiatic language family]], but this is disputed by some.

==Languages==
The [[North Omotic languages|North]] and [[South Omotic languages|South Omotic]] branches ("Nomotic" and "Somotic") are universally recognized. The primary debate is over the placement of the [[Mao languages]]. [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Bender]] (2000) classifies Omotic languages as follows:
*[[South Omotic languages|South Omotic]] / Aroid ([[Hamer-Banna language|Hamer-Banna]], [[Aari language|Aari]], [[Dime language|Dime]], [[Karo language|Karo]])
*[[North Omotic languages|North Omotic]] / Non-Aroid
**[[Mao languages|Mao]]
***[[Bambassi language|Bambassi]]
***West Mao ([[Hozo language|Hozo]], [[Seze language|Seze]], [[Ganza language|Ganza]])
**[[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]] ([[Dizi language|Dizi]], [[Sheko language|Sheko]], [[Nayi language|Nayi]])
**[[Gonga–Gimojan languages|Gonga–Gimojan]]
***[[Gonga languages|Gonga/Kefoid]] ([[Boro language (Ethiopia)|Boro]], [[Anfillo language|Anfillo]], [[Kafa language|Kafa]], [[Shekkacho language|Shekkacho]])
***[[Gimojan languages|Gimojan]]
****''[[Yemsa language|Yemsa]]''
****[[Ometo–Gimira languages|Ometo–Gimira]]
*****''[[Bench language|Bench]]''
*****''[[Chara language|Chara]]''
*****[[Ometo languages]]

Apart from terminology, this differs from [[Harold C. Fleming|Fleming]] (1976) in including the Mao languages, whose affiliation had originally been controversial, and in abolishing the "Gimojan" group.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} There are also differences in the subclassification of Ometo, which is not covered here.

Hayward (2003) separates out the Mao languages as a third branch of Omotic and breaks up Ometo–Gimira:

*[[South Omotic languages|South Omotic]]
*[[Mao languages|Mao]]
*[[North Omotic languages|North Omotic]]
**[[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]]
**[[Ta–Ne languages]]
***[[Gonga languages|Gonga]]
***[[Gimojan languages|Gimojan]]
****''[[Yemsa language|Yemsa]]''
****''[[Bench language|Bench]]''
****[[Ometo–Chara languages|Ometo–Chara]]

Blench (2006) gives a more agnostic classification:&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006. [http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[South Omotic languages|South Omotic]]
*[[North Omotic languages|North Omotic]]
**[[Mao languages|Mao]]
**[[Dizoid languages|Dizoid]]
**[[Gonga languages|Gonga]] (Kefoid)
**''[[Yem language|Yem]]''
**[[Gimira language|Gimira]]
**[[Ometo languages|Ometo]] (?[[Chara language|Chara]])

[[Bosha language|Bosha]]† is unclassified; ''Ethnologue'' lists it as a dialect of Kafa but notes it may be a distinct language.

==Classification==
Omotic is generally considered the most divergent branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages]]. Greenberg (1963) had classified it as the Western branch of [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]. Fleming (1969) argued that it should instead be classified as an independent branch of Afroasiatic, a view which Bender (1971) established to most linguists' satisfaction,&lt;ref&gt;Hayward (2000:85)&lt;/ref&gt; though a few linguists maintain the West Cushitic position&lt;ref&gt;
Lamberti (1991), Zaborksi (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; or that only [[South Omotic]] forms a separate branch, with [[North Omotic]] remaining part of Cushitic. Blench (2006) notes that Omotic shares honey-related vocabulary with the rest of Afroasiatic but not cattle-related vocabulary, suggesting that the split occurred before the advent of [[pastoralism]]. A few scholars have raised doubts that the Omotic languages are part of the Afroasiatic language family at all,&lt;ref&gt;
I. M. Diakonoff (1998) ''Journal of Semitic Studies'' 43:209: "It is quite evident that cultural ties between Proto-Semitic and the African branches of the Afrasian macrofamily must have been severed at a very early date indeed. However, the grammatical structure of [Common Semitic] (especially in the verb) is obviously close to that of Common Berbero-Libyan (CBL), as well as to Bedauye. (Bedauye might, quite possibly, be classified as a family distinct from the rest of Kushitic.) The same grammatical isoglosses are somewhat more feebly felt between Semitic and (the other?) Kushitic languages. They practically disappear between the Semitic and the Omotic languages, which were formerly termed Western Kushitic, but which actually may not be Afrasian at all, like their neighbours the Nubian languages and Meroitic."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Newman (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; and Theil (2006) proposes that Omotic be treated as an independent family.&lt;ref name="Theil"&gt;
Rolf Theil (2006) [http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf ''Is Omotic Afro-Asiatic?]'' pp 1–2: "I claim to show that no convincing arguments have been presented [for the inclusion of Omotic (OM) in Afro-Asiatic (AA)], and that OM should be regarded as an independent language family. No closer genetic relations have been demonstrated between OM and AA than between OM and any other language family."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general consensus, based primarily on morphological evidence, is that membership in Afroasiatic is well established.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrit Dimmendaal (2008) "Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent", in ''Language and Linguistics Compass'' 2/5:841: "Although its Afroasiatic affiliation has been disputed, the allocation of Omotic within this family is now well-established, based on the attestation of morphological properties that this family shares with other Afroasiatic branches."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proclamaţia de la Islaz (1848).jpg|thumb|right|The 1849 ''Proclamation of Islaz'' written in [[Romanian Cyrillic]].]]

The '''Proclamation of Islaz''' ({{Lang-ro|Proclamația de la Islaz}}) was the program adopted on 9 June 1848 by [[Romanian people|Romanian]] revolutionaries. It was written by [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]]. On 11 June, under pressure from the masses, [[Domnitor]] [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] was forced to accept the terms of the proclamation and recognise the provisional revolutionary government.

==Provisions==
The Proclamation of Islaz has the form and value of a constitutional act. Between these 22 provisions are notably:

*The independence of the administration and legisalature.
*Separation of powers.
*Equal rights of the people.
*The election of a responsible [[domnitor]] for a period of 5 years.
*Reduction of the [[civil list]]s of the [[domnitor]].
*Emancipation of the [[Jew]]s and all other compatriots belonging to other rites.
*Emancipation of the [[Romani people|Gypsies]].
*Equal instruction.
*Creation of a system of prisons.
*Creation of a national guard.

The location of [[Islaz]] (now in [[Teleorman County]], then in [[Romanați County]]) was a small port on the Danube with some commercial significance, which, unlike the ports of [[Turnu Măgurele]], [[Giurgiu]] and [[Calafat]], was not under the direct control of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

[[File:Tamashiro-kata-Tampere-2006.jpg | 200px|thumb | right | Karateka Akio Tamashiro displaying a karate red belt]]

A '''red belt''' is one of several colored belts used in some [[martial art]]s where each practitioner's level is marked by the color of the belt, these are most commonly those of [[Kodokan|Kodokan style Judo]] origin. Like the more commonly known [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black Belt]], its use varies between arts, with most using it for the style founder, [[Grandmaster (martial arts)|Grandmaster]] or other high rank, while others use it as the immediately pre–black belt rank or even to denote a beginner who holds no rank. In some schools, a red belt signifies ninth or tenth degree [[Dan (rank)|Dan rank]], where the tenth degree is the highest rank attainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-budokai.com/articles/belts.htm Belt colors and ranking tradition]. E-budokai.com (2010-09-09). Retrieved on 2012-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In karate, even though grandmasters and non–black belts (according to whatever system) may both wear a "red belt", the difference is obvious. Not only is there a clear difference in age, but the respective belts are different, as well: Dan rank belts are broader, with [[kyu]] (pre–black belt) rank belts normally having a width of 4 centimeters and dan rank belts having a width of 5 centimeters. Also, the grandmaster's red belt is usually darker in color and embroidered with the person's name and style (as customary for dan rank belts).

* In [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]], the 7th degree belt is red and black, the 8th degree belt is red and white, and the 9th and 10th degree belts are [[Black belt (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu)|solid red]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiu-jitsu.net/faq.shtml#rn Jiu-jitsu Newbie Guide – FAQs: Information for Beginners about Brazilian Jiu-jitsu]. Jiu-jitsu.net. Retrieved on 2012-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Japanese martial art]] of [[Judo]], at 6th degree ([[Dan (rank)|dan]]) the belt is replaced by an alternately red and white belt, and at 9th degree it is replaced by a solid red belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judoinfo.com/obi.htm The Judo Rank System – Belts]. Judoinfo.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In most Okinawan [[Karate]] styles and in some schools of [[Okinawan kobudō|Kobudo]] (Okinawan weaponry), the alternately red and white belt is used for seventh and eighth dans, whereas the solid red belt is used for ninth and tenth dans, which are purely honorary, i.e. cannot be attained by applying for (and passing) the respective exam. From seventh dan onwards, a practitioner is allowed to use the title [[shihan]], which translates as "expert examples".
* In modern [[Karate]], as governed by the [[World Karate Federation]] and its subsidiary federations, red (aka) and blue (ao) belts are worn by competitors. Only red and blue belts are to be worn for competition, with foot and fist pads of the corresponding color for [[kumite]] competition. In tournaments sanctioned by the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), red (aka) and white (shiro) belts (colors of the Japanese flag)were previously worn. However, this practice has largely been replaced after the 1980s, with both competitors now wearing black belts and the athlete designated as aka wearing a thin red tassel on his/her belt.
* Usually in traditional Korean [[taekwondo]], the red belt is just before gaining a first degree black belt, or first Dan. The pattern, or poomsae, which must be learned by the practitioner in order to attain the rank varies between styles and schools.
* In Tsien Tao Chinese Kempo, the red belt is equivalent to a sixth degree black belt (first degree master). Stripes are added to the red belt to denote second, and third degree master. A fourth degree master is represented by a red and white striped belt.
* In Seiki Juku [[Karate]], a red belt denotes karate-ka at 10th Kyu.&lt;ref&gt;http://yawaramartialarts.com/more/more_karate_syllabus.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Vovinam]], red belt is highest rank for master rank, and they have seven levels, from zero to six.

'''Regina Yaou''' (sometimes '''N'doufou''') (1955 in [[Dabou]] – 4 November 2017) was a writer from [[Ivory Coast]].

==Life and career==
Yaou was raised by her aunt in a literary family,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civox.net/A-la-decouverte-du-Prix-d-excellence-de-litterature-2014-Regina-Yaou-une-plume-qui-a-immortalise-les-epoques_a5333.html|title=À la découverte du Prix d’excellence de  littérature 2014: Regina Yaou, une plume qui a immortalisé les époques|first=CIVOX.|last=NET|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote her first poems between the ages of twelve and fourteen. She attended the technical high school in [[Cocody]], where in 1977 she participated in a literary contest organized by the publishing house [[Nouvelles éditions africaines]]; this led to the creation of her first work, a novella entitled ''La Citadine'' which has remained unpublished, but which won a prize in the contest.&lt;ref name="uwa.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/YaouRegina.html|title=Regina N'Doufou Yaou|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CollectifFouque2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Collectif|author2=Antoinette Fouque|author3=Mireille Calle-Gruber|author4=Béatrice Didier|title=Le Dictionnaire universel des créatrices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-0BCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17522|date=2015-11-26|publisher=Éditions des femmes|isbn=978-2-7210-0651-6|pages=17522–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school she worked for a few years before returning to her studies in 1982; she attended the [[University of Tours]] and spent a year at the [[Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] in Cocody.&lt;ref name="uwa.edu.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rezoivoire.net/profil/article/63/regina-n-doufou-yaou.html|title=Rezo-Ivoire .net - La référence culturelle de la Côte d'Ivoire|first=|last=rezo-ivoire.net|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also lived in [[Akrou]], in the [[Jacqueville Department]].&lt;ref name="uwa.edu.au"/&gt;

Yaou completed her first novel, ''Lezou Marie ou les écueils de la vie'', in 1977, presenting it to an editor in 1981 and publishing it in 1982.&lt;ref name="uwa.edu.au"/&gt; She followed it with ''La révolte d'Affiba'' in 1985; she has since written numerous other novels. From 1991 until 1993 she was in the [[United States]] as a [[guest lecturer]] at a number of universities. She then returned to Ivory Coast, where in addition to her literary activities she held a number of other positions; in 2005 she returned to the United States once more, for two years of comparative study of the similarities between the stories of the [[southern United States]] and those of her home country.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2009 she returned again to Ivory Coast.&lt;ref name="uwa.edu.au"/&gt;

Beginning in the 1990s, Yaou published a number of works under [[pseudonym]]s such as Joëlle Anskey and Ruth Owotchi. Her work generally focuses on themes of modern life and the role of women in Ivorian society, and includes discussion of [[domestic violence]], infidelity, and maternity, among other issues.&lt;ref name="CollectifFouque2015"/&gt;

She died on 4 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koaci.com/m/cote-divoire-deces-lecrivaine-regina-yaou-abidjan-114589-i.html Côte d'Ivoire: Décès de l'écrivaine Regina Yaou à Abidjan] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sadhu Singh Hamdard (Sadhu Singh Saini)''' (1918-1984) was a well-known [[Resistance movement|freedom fighter]] and journalist of [[Punjab region|Punjab]],  excelling in both [[Urdu]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and an innovative poet, who carried in his name the pseudonym 'Hamdard', "sharing with all the pangs of their hearts," "friendly towards all."

== Early life as freedom fighter ==

As a high school student, he was active in Chaudhri Sher Jang's group of the radicals in the Yug Paltai Dal, party to impart a radical turn to the age. The Dal was formed in 1939-40 by Giani Harbans Singh of Sarhala Khurd in [[Hoshiarpur district]]. The Dal ceased to exist after the arrest and execution of its founder Harbans Singh, Sadhu Singh then joined the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee taking over its publicity wing.

== As a journalist and Chief Editor of Ajit ==

In 1944, Sadhu Singh entered the field of [[journalism]]. He took up editorship of the up to [[Daily Ajit]] (Urdu) and retained this position till 1957. In 1955, he also became chief editor of the Punjabi Ajit. The birth of the Ajit was an entirely new phenomenon in Punjabi journalism. It marked a new era of change and experimentation. In Sadhu Singh's hands, Punjabi journalism matured and reached new heights. The Ajit and Sadhu Singh Hamdard became synonymous names, he had so lovingly nursed the paper. Sadhu Singh set its permanent seal on Punjabi journalism. He created a new taste in Punjabi writing and introduced several new techniques. His services to Punjabi journalism, to what he did to give it a new face and format, were widely acknowledged.

== Awards ==
In 1963, the [[Government of Punjab, India|Punjab Government]] honoured him with the title of Shiromani Pattarkar (the journalist of the year). He was chairman of the reception committee of All India Newspapers Editors Conference held at [[Jalandhar]] in 1973. He also edited two monthly magazines Tasvir and Drishtl.

Within his lifetime, Sadhu Singh converted all his property and assets into a public trust for the advancement of Punjabi culture and letters.

Dr Sadhu Singh Hamdard was also awarded the title of [[Padma Shri]] by the Central Government in January 1984, but he surrendered the honour in protest against the army action in the precincts of the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], [[Amritsar]], in June 1984. Sadhu Singh Hamdard died a month later at [[Jalandhar]] on 29 July 1984.

== Poet ==

As a poet, Sadhu Hamdard is especially remembered for popularising the [[Ghazal]] form in Punjabi. His collection of Punjabi poems in the genre, entitled ''Ghazal'' won him a first prize from the Punjab Government in 1963. An anthology of his prose writings assembled under the title ''Akkhin Ditha Rus'', a travelogue on his visits to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1967, also won the Punjab Government's award in 1972-73. He also wrote some novels built around heroic episodes from [[Sikh]] history as well as some short stories.

== Conferring of Ph.D ==

[[Guru Nanak Dev University]], Amritsar, awarded him the Ph.D. degree for his thesis on ''"Origin and Development of the Punjabi Ghazal."'' He was a fellow of that University and member of its Syndicate. He was also a member of the Advisory Committee of the Languages Department and Press Advisory Committee of the Punjab Government, and of the Indian Academy of Letters (1973–1978). He was also president of the Kendri Punjabi Lekhak Sabha during 1972-79 and founder-president of Bazm-I-Adab (Urdu).

'''Semiotics of Fashion''' is the study of [[fashion]] and how humans signify specific social and cultural positions through dress. Ferdinand de Saussure defined [[semiotics]] as "the science of the life of signs in society". Semiotics is the study of signs and just as we can interpret signs and construct meaning from text we can also construct meaning from visual images such as fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Daniel. (2007). ''Semiotics: The Basics'' . London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion is a language of signs that non-verbally converse meanings about individuals and groups. It holds a symbolic and communicative role having the capacity to express one’s unique style, identity, profession, social status, and gender or group affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Pauline, [http://www.fashion-era.com/sociology_semiotics.html "Theories of Fashion Costume and Fashion History"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothing is a non-verbal sign that can be interpreted differently depending on the context, situation or culture. It’s in this way that the semiotics of fashion can be linked to [[social semiotics]]. According to Fred Davis, “ The chief difficulty of understanding fashion in its apparent vagaries is the lack of exact knowledge of the unconscious symbolisms attaching to forms, colors, textures, postures, and other expressive elements of a given cultures. The difficulty is increased by the fact that some of the expressive elements tend to have quite different symbolic references in different areas. "&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Fred. (1994). Fashion, Culture, and Identity. ''The University of Chicago Press''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The meanings that are constructed through fashion largely depend on culturally accepted codes.  This can be demonstrated in the choice of color for wedding ceremonies across different cultures.  For example, a white dress is the traditional attire for a wedding ceremony in the western culture; however in the Asian culture the color white is associated with death and would be more appropriately worn at a funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Ohio State University, [http://costume.osu.edu/exhibitions/wedding/ "Historic Costumes and Textile Collections"], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific dress codes are identified by individuals within a culture and convey a message to help categorize and create meaning. A [[uniform]] is a specific type of clothing that is worn to associate that person with an organization, trade or rank. Uniforms are symbolic and their meanings are arbitrary, in that they stand for their referent based upon agreement or habit of individuals within that culture.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, R. and G. Kress.(1988). ''Social Semiotics''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In western society a policeman will typically wear variations of a blue suit and this generally symbolizes law, security, and authority. Doctors wear white lab coats to represent their profession in health and also to suggest sanitation. Nuns wear black and white dresses that associate them with their involvement in religion.

Fashion can go beyond symbolizing a profession, it can also communicate ideas about an individuals personality, social status, or religious belonging. The Burka is a head covering worn by Islamic women and signifies their belonging to an Islamic society. Brand name jeans and designer label garments are worn by individuals to represent value or status in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, M.,[http://politicsoffashionuiuc.wordpress.com/tag/semiotics/ "Politics of Fashion. Reading Notes for Roland Barthes"], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Desmond Morris states, "It is impossible to wear clothes without transmitting social signals."&lt;ref name="emulehparker"&gt;Parker, Emily,[http://emulehparker.co.uk/semiotics-in-fashion-article/ "Semiotics in Fashion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711033207/http://emulehparker.co.uk/semiotics-in-fashion-article/ |date=2013-07-11 }}, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Roland Barthes]] was a semiotician, who studied the fashion system and how ideologies are transmitted through dress.&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland.(1967). ''The Fashion System''.&lt;/ref&gt; The semiotic system is formed by social interests and ideologies, and the fashion system is no different.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In our society the ideologies in fashion are often implemented by celebrities or the dominant class. [[Jackie Kennedy]] was an important style icon for American women during the 1960s, where her style became a symbol of wealth, power and prestige .&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikibooks:Visual Rhetoric/Semiotics of Fahion|"Kennedy a Symbol of Fashion"]], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The fashion system is not static, and as society and social interests change, so do trends and styles in dress. Pants were originally a garment worn by men and signified masculinity, but society evolved and pants became an acceptable garment for both men and women. Pants are no longer confined to signifying masculinity. Society changes and as individuals in that society adapt so do their dress codes and fashion choices. Fashion is a system of signs, whose meanings and significations are constantly shifting and changing depending on the time, place, and culture.&lt;ref name="emulehparker" /&gt;

The '''Sillan language''', or '''Silla''', was a Koreanic language spoken in the ancient kingdom of [[Silla]] (57 BCE – 935 CE), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=The Global Prehistory of Human Migration|date=2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden|isbn=9781118970591}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is generally accepted that Silla language was similar to that of Goguryeo and Baekje.&lt;ref&gt;김수경(1989), 세나라 시기 언어 력사에 관한 남조선 학계의 견해에 대한 비판적 고찰 (Criticism of South Korea's Views on the Linguistic History of the Three Kingdoms Period)&lt;/ref&gt; Literary records of the Silla language, such as ''[[hyangga]]'', are more numerous than those for the languages of [[Goguryeo language|Goguryeo]] and [[Baekje language|Baekje]]. Sillan is sometimes considered to be synonymous with [[Old Korean]], though that is commonly used as a cover term for all three languages of the Three Kingdoms.

The modern [[Korean language]] is descended from Sillan.

'''Southern Quechua''' ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: '''Urin qichwa''', {{lang-es|quechua sureño}}), or simply '''Quechua''' ('''Qichwa''' or '''Qhichwa'''), is the most widely spoken of the major regional groupings of [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] [[dialect]]s within the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua language family]], with about 6.9 million speakers. It is also the most widely spoken indigenous language in the entire New World. The term ''Southern Quechua'' refers to the Quechuan varieties spoken in regions of the [[Andes]] south of a line roughly east-west between the cities of [[Huancayo]] and [[Huancavelica]] in central [[Peru]].  It includes the Quechua varieties spoken in the regions of [[Ayacucho]], [[Cusco]] and [[Puno]] in Peru, in much of [[Bolivia]] and parts of north-west [[Argentina]]. The most widely spoken varieties are South Bolivian, Cusco, Ayacucho, and Puno (Collao).

In the traditional classification of the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua language family]] by [[Alfredo Torero]], Southern Quechua is equivalent to Torero's 'Quechua IIc' (or just 'QIIc').  It thus stands in contrast to its many sister varieties within the wider Quechuan family that are spoken in areas north of the Huancayo-Huancavelica line:  Central Quechua (Torero's QI) spoken from Huancayo northwards to the [[Ancash Region]];  North Peruvian Quechua around [[Cajamarca]] and [[Incahuasi District|Incahuasi]] (Torero's IIa);  and [[Kichwa language|Kichwa]] (part of Torero's Quechua IIb).

==Dialects==
Dialects are [[Ayacucho Quechua]], [[Cusco Quechua]], [[Puno Quechua]] ([[Altiplano|Collao]] Quechua), [[North Bolivian Quechua]] (Apolo Quechua), and [[South Bolivian Quechua]]. [[Santiagueño Quechua]] in Argentina is divergent, and appears to derive from a mix of dialects, including South Bolivian.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most salient distinction between Ayacucho Quechua and the others is that it lacks the [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] (tʃʰ, pʰ, tʰ, kʰ, qʰ) and [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] (tʃʼ, pʼ, tʼ, kʼ, qʼ) series of [[stop consonant]]s. The other varieties of Bolivia and Southern Peru taken together have been called [[Cusco–Collao Quechua]] (or "Qusqu–Qullaw"); however, they are not monolithic. For instance, Bolivian Quechua is morphologically distinct from Cusco and Ayacucho Quechua, while North Bolivian is phonologically quite conservative compared to both South Bolivian and Cusco so there is no bifurcation between Ayacucho and Cusco–Collao.

Santiagueño also lacks the aspirated and ejective series, but it was a distinct development in Argentina. It also maintains remnants of the Quechua ''s–š'' distinction, which has otherwise been lost from Southern Quechua, which suggests other varieties of Quechua in its background.

==Standard Quechua==
The Peruvian linguist [[Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino]] has devised a standard [[orthography]] intended to be viable for all the different regional forms of Quechua that fall under the umbrella term Southern Quechua.  It is a compromise of conservative features in the pronunciations of the various regions that speak forms of Southern Quechua. It has been accepted by many institutions in Peru and Bolivia and is also used on Wikipedia Quechua pages, and by Microsoft in its translations of software into Quechua.

Here are some examples of regional spellings different from the standard orthography:

{| class="wikitable"
!Ayacucho
!Cuzco
!Standard
!Translation
|-
| upyay
| uhay
| upyay 
| "to drink"
|-
| llamkay
| llank'ay
| llamk'ay
| "to work"
|-
| ñuqanchik
| nuqanchis
| ñuqanchik
| "we (inclusive)"
|-
| -chka-
| -sha-
| -chka-
| (progressive suffix)
|-
| punchaw 
| p'unchay
| p'unchaw
| "day"
|}

In Bolivia, the same standard is used except for "j", which is used instead of "h" for the sound [h] (like in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).

[[File:Qu-pata phata p'ata.ogg|thumb|Sound examples for words ''pata'', ''phata'' ''p'ata''.]]

The following letters are used for the inherited Quechua vocabulary and for [[loanword]]s from [[Aymara language|Aymara]]:&lt;br&gt;
a, ch, chh, ch', h, i, k, kh, k', l, ll, m, n, ñ, p, ph, p', q, qh, q', r, s, t, th, t', u, w, y.

Instead of "sh" (appearing in the northern and central Quechua varieties), "s" is used.&lt;br&gt;
Instead of "ĉ" (appearing in the Quechua varieties of Junín, Cajamarca, and Lambayeque), "ch" is used.

The following letters are used in loanwords from Spanish and other languages (not from Aymara):&lt;br&gt;
b, d, e, f, g, o.

The letters e and o are not used for native Quechua words because the corresponding sounds are simply [[allophone]]s of i and u that appear predictably next to q, qh, and q'. This rule applies to the official Quechua orthography for all varieties. Thus, the spellings {{angbr|qu}} and {{angbr|qi}} are pronounced [qo] and [qe].

The letters appear, however, in proper names or words adopted directly from Spanish:&lt;br&gt;
c, v, x, z; j (in Peru; in Bolivia, it is used instead of h).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5122">'''LeapFrog Tag''' is an electronic handheld stylus that stores audio for [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] paper books made by [[LeapFrog Enterprises]]. When in use the stylus is scanned across the page of a book, activating the stylus to play the prerecorded audio stored inside the stylus. When a word is scanned, for example, the stylus "reads" the word aloud to the user. The user can also play various games through this technique. LeapFrog Enterprises introduced it as the successor to the [[LeapPad]] which served as a platform for interactive books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leapfrog.com/tag/ |title=Leapfrog: Tag - The Amazing Touch Reading System |website=Leapfrog.com|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tag stylus and the proprietary Tag books are primarily targeted to young children learning to read.

The Tag reader offers an alternative to either [[audiobook]]s or a supervisory person reading aloud, chiefly for before children are able to read on a particular level. It can teach phonics and help children develop a sense of independent reading, which, in turn, helps them become better readers.&lt;ref name="Sharpe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/curr213.shtml|title=Reading Aloud—Is It Worth It?|website=Educationworld.com|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LeapFrog has developed a number of titles and book sets that target specific phonic skills. These sets can be used as a supplement to support a reading or literacy curriculum currently implemented in the classroom. LeapFrog's Tag reader is accessible to a wide variety of students' learning abilities. Because Tag readers are designed with both full reading and individual word recognition this allows for differentiation. Tag also helps students learning [[English as a foreign or second language|English as a second language]]

==Costs and logistics==
Tag styluses have a low initial cost. Each Tag stylus starter system costs around $50.00 when purchased in retail stores which include the Tag stylus, a sampler book, a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] computer connection cable, and software disk. The individual books range anywhere from $10.00 to $20.00 and a variety of titles are available. Each phonics set is around $20.00 and contains 5 books. Leapfrog also sells bundles that can be purchased directly from their webpage that range between $70–$400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leapfrogschoolhouse.com/do/findpage?pageKey=tag_home |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514035236/http://www.leapfrogschoolhouse.com/do/findpage?pageKey=tag_home |archivedate=2010-05-14 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Before using the Tag stylus with a book, a software installation is required and an account set up with LeapFrog. Once the initial account is set up, then the Tag stylus must have the desired books' audio files downloaded to it. The stylus can hold multiple books at one time (from 4 to 10, depending on the size of the book and the amount of memory in the stylus). The Tag reader is powered by batteries.

==Technology==
[[File:LeapFrog Tag lowercase a with dot pattern.png|frame|The indefinite article "a" in a Tag book is uniquely identified by the pattern of dots all around.]]

Tag requires a [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Mac OS]] computer running LeapFrog Connect software to populate the Tag with audio for books.  The software downloads book audio from the LeapFrog web site and transmits it to Tag via a USB cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leapfrog.com/en/pages/support/product_pages/tag.html |title=Customer Support: Tag Reading System |website=Leapfrog.com|accessdate=4 July 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tag pen device works with specially made books which include an optical pattern of dots too small to disturb the human reading the book. A stylus touches the book to actuate the Tag device, and the device, through analysis of the printed pattern, divines both the book being read and its exact position within the book. With the book and position known, the Tag device looks up the appropriate audio to play for that location in the book and plays it. This technique for position recognition is patented by [[Anoto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

Tag includes a [[state machine]] to facilitate game play on specially-designed pages of books, with games like, "Find the letter that makes the sound ''k''." It also collects statistics on usage to reconnect with the software and present electronic rewards to the learner and help parents monitor learning progress.

Tag and the proprietary, compatible books are covered by U.S. Patents 6502756, 6548768, 6666376, 6667695, 6674427, 6732927, 6836555, 7224348, and 7281664.

{{noref|date=May 2018}}

In [[game]]s and [[sport]]s, a '''tiebreaker''' or '''tiebreak''' is used to determine a winner from among players or teams that are tied at the end of a contest, or a set of contests.

== General operation ==

=== In matches ===
In some situations, the tiebreaker may consist of another round of play. For example, if contestants are tied at the end of a [[Quiz|quiz game]], they each might be asked one or more extra questions, and whoever correctly answers the most from that extra set is the winner. In many sports, teams that are tied at the end of a match compete in an additional period of play called "[[Overtime (sports)|overtime]]" or "[[extra time]]". The extra round may also not follow the regular format, e.g. a tiebreak in [[tennis]] or a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] in [[association football]].

===In tournaments and playoffs===
{{See also|Group tournament ranking system#Tiebreaker criteria}}
In some sports, [[tournament]]s, and [[playoff]]s, the tiebreaker is a statistic that is compared to separate contestants who have the same win-loss record. Some competitions, such as the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[EuroLeague]], the [[National Basketball Association]], the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[National Football League]], have a whole set of tiebreaking rules in which a group of statistics between the tied teams are compared, one at a time, to determine the [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeding]] in their respective [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] or [[playoffs|playoff tournament]].

The statistics that are compared may include total goals scored, the record between the two tied teams, and other factors. In many of these tiebreaking rules, if the teams remain tied after comparing all of these statistics, then the tie is broken at random using a [[coin toss]] or a drawing of lots. [[Swiss system tournament]]s use a variety of criteria not found in other types of tournament which exploit features specific to the Swiss system: see [[tie-breaking in Swiss system tournaments]].

In some sports leagues, a [[one-game playoff]], or occasionally a [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|"best-of" series format]], may be played instead to break the tie.

===In promotion/relegation and draft order===
Some sports leagues may use tiebreaking rules to help determine which teams who have the same win-loss record are [[Promotion and relegation|promoted and relegated]] or have the higher pick in their respective [[sports draft]]. These tiebreaking rules may be the same ones used in their respective knockout or playoff tournament, except that the tied team with the worse statistic is the one that is either relegated or receives a higher draft pick. However, in some sports leagues, such as the National Football League, the set of tiebreaking rules to compare the worst-ranked teams is completely different than the rules to determine the playoff teams.

==Specific sports==

===Association football===
In [[association football]] contests, many matches are allowed to end in a draw, but in cases where a winner must be chosen, there are three methods of deciding this. The usual method is Normal Extra Time, where each team will play two 15-minute periods of extra time (but see also [[Golden goal]]).  The team that leads at the end of 30 minutes wins the tie.  If, at the end of extra time, no winner can be decided, the match goes to a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]].  Occasionally, in matches such as the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] in England, the match can go straight to a penalty shootout after 90 minutes' play has been completed.  Alternatively, in tournaments such as the English [[FA Cup]], the match is replayed in its entirety, going through the aforementioned stages of extra time and penalties if the second match is drawn. This method is no longer used from the quarter finals onwards.

===American football===
In the [[National Football League]] of professional [[American football]], if both teams are tied at the end of regulation, an overtime period is played under modified "sudden death" rules. Before the 2017 season, this period was 15 minutes in all games. Since 2017, a 15-minute period has been used only in playoff games (in which a winner ''must'' be decided); overtime in preseason and regular-season games consists of a 10-minute period.  If the team that receives the ball first scores a field goal, then the opponent must receive a chance at equalising that score of their own; the first team to score a touchdown or safety wins the game;  and once both teams have had possession of the ball in overtime, the first team to score under any legal means, touchdown (offensive or defensive), field goal or safety, wins. If neither team scores before the end of the overtime period, or both teams score one field goal each, the game is considered a draw and ends, and counts as a "half-win" in the standings for purposes of winning percentage for both draft order and playoff positioning. However, in the playoffs, true sudden death rules apply from double overtime onwards.

===Australian rules football===
There is no tie-break for regular season matches in Australian rules football, and both teams earn two points each. 

In the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], new rules were introduced for finals in 2016: if there is a tie at the expiration of regulation time, including in the [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], two five minute halves of extra time are played with the teams swapping end after each half. If the match is still tied when extra time has expired, there is a third untimed extra time period under sudden death rules, and the final siren will not sound until the next team scores.

====Previous systems====
Prior to 1991, if the scores were tied in a finals match after the final siren, the drawn final would be replayed on the following weekend, thus delaying all other finals by one week. 

Due to various logistical issues that arose following the drawn 1990 Qualifying Final, the AFL replaced this procedure with extra time (with the exception of the Grand Final) in 1991. Until 2015, if the scores in a finals match were tied when regulation time expired, two five-minute halves of [[extra time]] were played until a winner was determined. This procedure was used twice: in the 1994 Second Qualifying Final between North Melbourne and Hawthorn (won by North Melbourne), and the 2007 Second Semi-Final between West Coast and Collingwood (won by Collingwood).

If the scores were tied after the final siren in the Grand Final, the match would be replayed on the following weekend.

===Baseball===
If a [[baseball]] game is tied at the end of the usual nine [[Innings#Baseball|innings]], the game continues into [[extra innings]] until an inning ends with one team ahead.  Although games are occasionally ended as ties on account of weather or darkness (the latter happened much more often before lights were installed on most professional baseball fields in the 1940s), and some leagues (including [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]) allow only a limited number of extra innings before a game ends as a tie, professional baseball in the United States has no such limit.  The longest Major League game in history (on May 1, 1920) lasted 26 innings, and a [[minor league baseball|minor-league]] game in 1981 [[Longest professional baseball game|lasted 33 innings]].  In some venues, including [[World Baseball Softball Confederation|international baseball]], starting with the second extra inning, that inning may begin a full reset of the batting order to the coach's choice with up to two runners already on base, in order to increase the chances of a resolution.

Major League Baseball uses the term "tiebreaker" to refer to [[One-game playoff#Major_League_Baseball|one or more additional games]] played after the scheduled end of the regular season between teams with identical win-loss records in order to determine participants in postseason play.

===Cricket===
{{main|Super Over}}

===Field target===
[[Field target]] — a precision [[air rifle]] shooting sport — uses either a sudden-death or shot count tiebreaker. The sudden-death tiebreaker (usually used to determine a single place such as 3rd when 3 awards are to be given or between two shooters) consists of each tied shooter (order dictated or decided by coin-toss or other technique) shoots at a target (typically a difficult shot such as ½" at 35 yards). If all shooters in the tie fail, then the target is moved closer. If one shooter hits, then the next shooter(s) who miss are out of the competition. If a round is complete with multiple ties remaining, the target is moved out (made more difficult) and the same procedure is repeated until only one shooter remains. This procedure can then be repeated to determine further placings among the losers of the previous round.

In cases where multiple places are to be determined (as in five people tied for first place), one approach is to have each shooter make several shots (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 or more with ''n'' being the number of tied shooters). If all shooters miss all shots, the target is moved in (made easier); similarly, if all shooters hit on all shots, the target is moved out (made more difficult). If some variation in hits exists after a round, the top score gets the highest placing while those with identical scores can have a sudden-death shootout or a repeat of the multiple shot shootout (typically with a more difficult target) to determine other placings.

===Ice hockey===
{{main|Overtime (ice hockey)}}

===Tennis===
{{main|Tennis score#Scoring a tiebreak game}}

===Snooker===
If the scores are level when all the balls are potted in a frame of [[snooker]], the black is "respotted" (placed back on the table, on its designated spot) and the cue ball put "in hand". The referee will then toss a coin, and the winner of the coin toss decides who will take the first shot. Play then continues until the black is potted or another frame-ending situation occurs.

==Outside sports==

The term "tiebreaker" is sometimes used loosely outside the world of sports — for example, for an innovative weapon or strategy introduced in a war where the two opposing armies are evenly matched, a decisive political move introduced in an electoral race where the contending parties are evenly matched (such as a [[casting vote]]), and similar situations in other fields.

{{about|the class of poisonous substances}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}
A '''toxin''' (from {{lang-grc|τοξικόν|[[Arrow poison|toxikon]]}}) is a [[poison]]ous substance produced within living cells or organisms;&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000109718|toxin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urltoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toxin |title=toxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |website= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; synthetic [[Biocide|toxicants]] created by artificial processes are thus excluded. The term was first used by organic chemist Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWhqhK1cE-gC&amp;pg=PA6|title=Endotoxin in Health and Disease|first=Helmut|last=Brade|date=2 July 1999|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780824719449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toxins can be [[small molecule]]s, [[peptide]]s, or [[protein]]s that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by [[Biological tissue|body tissue]]s interacting with biological [[macromolecule]]s such as [[enzyme]]s or [[Receptor (biochemistry)|cellular receptors]]. Toxins vary greatly in their [[toxicity]], ranging from usually minor (such as a [[bee]] [[Stinger|sting]]) to almost immediately deadly (such as [[botulinum toxin]]).

==Terminology==
Toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents by their method of production—the word toxin does not specify method of delivery (compare with [[venom]] and the broader meaning of [[poison]]—all substances that can also cause disturbances to organisms). It simply means it is a biologically produced poison.
There was an ongoing terminological dispute between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] over whether to call a toxin a [[Biological agent|biological]] or [[chemical agent]], in which the NATO opted for biological agent, and the Warsaw Pact, like most other countries in the world, for chemical agent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

According to an [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] review of the [[Biological Weapons Convention]], "Toxins are poisonous products of organisms; unlike biological agents, they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves", and "Since the signing of the Constitution, there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or toxins".&lt;ref name="urlThe Biological Weapons Convention - An overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNPA |title=The Biological Weapons Convention - An overview |website= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Title 18 of the United States Code]], "... the term "toxin" means the [[Toxicity|toxic]] material or product of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[microorganism]]s (including, but not limited to, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], [[rickettsiae]] or [[protozoa]]), or infectious substances, or a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] or synthesized molecule, whatever their origin and method of production..."&lt;ref name="urlU.S. Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+235+1++()%20%20AND%20((18)%20ADJ%20USC)%3ACITE%20AND%20(USC%20w/10%20(209))%3ACITE |title=U.S. Code |website= |accessdate=13 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721042611/http://law2.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t17t20+235+1++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2818%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%28209%29%29%3ACITE |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable:
* [[Hemotoxin]], causes destruction of [[red blood cells]] ([[hemolysis]])
* [[Phototoxin]], causes dangerous photosensitivity

On a broader scale, toxins may be classified as either [[exotoxin]]s, being excreted by an organism, or [[endotoxin]]s, that are released mainly when bacteria are [[lysis|lysed]].

== Biotoxins ==
The term "biotoxin" is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin.&lt;ref name="urlbiotoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biotoxin |title=biotoxin - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |website= |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000012874|biotoxin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotoxins can be further classified, for example, as [[mycotoxin|fungal biotoxins]], microbial biotoxins, [[phytotoxin|plant biotoxins]], or animal biotoxins.

Toxins produced by [[microorganism]]s are important [[virulence]] determinants responsible for microbial [[pathogenicity]] and/or evasion of the host [[immune response]].&lt;ref name= ProftT&gt;{{cite book |author= Proft T (editor)| year=2009 |title=Microbial Toxins: Current Research and Future Trends | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-44-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism, and can be highly complex (the [[venom]] of the [[cone snail]] contains dozens of small [[protein]]s, each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor), or relatively small protein.

Biotoxins in nature have two primary functions:

* [[Predation]], such as in the [[spider]], [[snake]], [[scorpion]], [[jellyfish]], and [[wasp]]
* Defense as in the [[bee]], [[ant]], [[termite]], [[honey bee]], [[wasp]], and [[poison dart frog]]

Some of the more well known types of biotoxins include:
*[[Cyanotoxin]]s, produced by [[cyanobacteria]]
*[[Dinotoxin]]s, produced by [[dinoflagellate]]s
*[[Necrosis|Necrotoxins]] cause necrosis (i.e., death) in the cells they encounter and destroy all types of [[biological tissue|tissue]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Necrotoxins spread through the bloodstream{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. In humans, [[skin]] and [[muscle]] tissues are most sensitive to necrotoxins{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. Organisms that possess necrotoxins include:
**The [[brown recluse spider|brown recluse]] or "fiddle back" spider
**Most [[rattlesnake]]s and [[vipers]] produce [[phospholipase]] and various [[trypsin]]-like [[serine proteases]]
**[[Bitis arietans|Puff adder]]
**[[Necrotizing fasciitis]] (caused by the "flesh eating" bacterium ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'') - produces a [[pore-forming toxin|pore forming toxin]]
*[[Neurotoxin]]s primarily affect the nervous systems of animals. The group neurotoxins generally consists of [[:Category:Ion channel toxins|ion channel toxins]] that disrupt ion channel conductance. Organisms that possess neurotoxins include:
**The [[Latrodectus|black widow]] spider.
**Most [[scorpion]]s
**The [[box jellyfish]]
**[[Elapidae|Elapid]] snakes
**The [[cone snail]]
**The [[Blue-ringed octopus]]
**[[Venomous fish]]
**[[Frogs]]
**''[[Palythoa]]'' [[coral]]
**Various different types of [[algae]], [[cyanobacteria]] and [[dinoflagellates]] 
*[[Myotoxin]]s are small, basic [[peptide]]s found in [[snake]] and [[lizard]] [[Venom (poison)|venom]]s, They cause muscle tissue damage by a non enzymatic receptor based mechanism. Organisms that possess myotoxins include:
**[[rattlesnake]]s
**[[eastern bearded dragon]]
*[[Cytotoxicity|Cytotoxins]] are toxic at the level of individual cells, either in a non-specific fashion or only in certain types of living cells:
**[[Ricin]], from [[castor bean]]s
**[[Apitoxin]], from [[honey bee]]s
**[[T-2 mycotoxin]], from certain toxic [[mushroom]]s

==Environmental toxins==
The term "environmental toxin" can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants&lt;ref name="pmid14977703"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grigg J |title=Environmental toxins; their impact on children's health |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=244–50 |date=March 2004 |pmid=14977703 |pmc=1719840 |doi= 10.1136/adc.2002.022202|url=http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14977703}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as industrial [[pollutant]]s and other artificially made [[Toxicity|toxic]] substances. As this contradicts most formal definitions of the term "toxin", it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts.

Environmental toxins from [[food chain]]s that may be dangerous to human health include:

=== Finding information about toxins===
The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html|title=Environmental Health and Toxicology Information ? National Library of Medicine|author=|date=|website=sis.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by TEHIP and by other government agencies and organizations. This web site includes links to databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources. TEHIP also is responsible for the Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/|title=TOXNET|author=|date=|website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web.

[[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) that is part of TOXNET. TOXMAP uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s.

=== Computational resources for prediction of toxic peptides and proteins===
One of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based therapy is their toxicity. Recently, ''in silico'' models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins, developed by [[Gajendra Pal Singh Raghava]]'s group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = In Silico Approach for Predicting Toxicity of Peptides and Proteins | author = Sudheer Gupta, Pallavi Kapoor, Kumardeep Chaudhary, Ankur Gautam, Rahul Kumar, Open Source Drug Discovery Consortium, Gajendra P. S. Raghava | journal = PLOS ONE | date = 2013 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0073957 | volume=8 | issue = 9 | pages=e73957 | pmid=24058508 | pmc=3772798| bibcode=2013PLoSO...873957G }}&lt;/ref&gt; predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy. The prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides. The prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred|title=ToxinPred|author=|date=|website=crdd.osdd.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misuse of the term==
When used non-technically, the term "toxin" is often applied to any [[Toxicity|toxic]] substance, even though the term [[toxicant]] would be more appropriate. Toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed [[poison]]s and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to [[toxicity|toxic]] substances in general.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

In the context of [[quackery]] and [[alternative medicine]], the term "toxin" is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health. This could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous [[pesticide]]s, to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation ([[Colon cleansing|auto-intoxication]]), to food ingredients such as [[sucrose|table sugar]], [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG), and [[aspartame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/detox_overview.html | title = "Detoxification" Schemes and Scams | publisher = [[Quackwatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}
In the field of [[translation]], a '''translation unit''' is a segment of a text which the translator treats as a single cognitive unit for the purposes of establishing an equivalence. The translation unit may be a single word, a phrase, one or more sentences, or even a larger unit.

When a translator segments a text into translation units, the larger these units are, the better chance there is of obtaining an idiomatic translation. This is true not only of human translation, but also in cases where human translators use [[computer-assisted translation]], such as [[translation memory|translation memories]], and also when translations are performed by [[machine translation]] systems.

== Perceptions on the concept of ''unit'' ==
Vinay and Darbelnet took to [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'s original concepts of the linguistic sign when beginning to discuss [http://wwwdrshadiabanjar.blogspot.com.es/2009/11/lecture-notes-unit-of-translation.html the idea of a single word as a translation unit]. According to Saussure, the sign is naturally arbitrary, so it can only derive meaning from contrast in other signs in that same system.

However, Russian scholar Leonid Barkhudarov&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Urovni yazykovoy iyerarkhii i perevod (Levels of language hierarchy and translation). In: Tetradi perevodchika (The Translator's Notebooks)|last = Barkhudarov|first = Leonid|publisher = |year = 1969|isbn = |location = |pages = 3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that, limiting it to poetry, for instance, a translation unit can take the form of a complete text. This seems to relate to his conception that a translation unit is the smallest unit in the source language with an equivalent in the target one, and when its parts are taken individually, they become untranslatable; these parts can be as small as phonemes or morphemes, or as large as entire texts.

[[Susan Bassnett]] widened Barkhudarov's poetry perception to include prose, adding that in this type of translation text is the prime unit, including the idea that sentence-by-sentence translation could cause loss of important structural features.

German linguist Werner Koller connected Barkhudarov's idea of unit sizing to the difference between the two languages involved, by stating that the more different or unrelated these languages were, the larger the unit would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Einführung in die Übersetzungswissenschaft (Introduction to Translation Studies)|last = Koller|first = Werner|publisher = Quelle &amp; Meyer|year = 1992|isbn = |location = Heidelberg|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One final perception on the idea of ''unit'' came from linguist [[Eugene Nida]]. To him, translation units have a tendency to be small groups of language building up into sentences, thus forming what he called ''meaningful mouthfuls of language''.

== Points of view towards translation units ==

=== Process-oriented POV ===
According to this point of view, a translation unit is a stretch of text on which attention is focused to be represented as a whole in the target language. In this point of view we can consider the concept of the '''think-aloud protocol''', supported by German linguist Wolfgang Lörscher: isolating units using self-reports by translating subjects. It also relates to how experienced the translator in question is: language learners take a word as a translation unit, whereas experienced translators isolate and translate units of meaning in the form of phrases, clauses or sentences.

=== Product-oriented POV ===
Here, the target-text unit can be mapped into an equivalent source-text unit. A case study on this matter was reported by [[Gideon Toury]], in which 27 English-Hebrew student-produced translations were mapped onto a source text. Those students that were less experienced had larger numbers of small units at word and morpheme level in their translations, while one student with translation experience had approximately half of those units, mostly at phrase or clause level.

He is known for finding the true portrait of [[Shivaji]] (see inscription below portrait). He was a student of [[Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade]] and worked for [[Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal]].{{citation needed|reason=portrait part is sourced by the image but not the Rajwade part and Mandal- although they are very likely true|date=March 2018}}

His works include "Sadhan-Chikitsa", which is considered a concise introduction to Maratha history and a guide for tools to conduct historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendrey|first=Vasudeo Sitaram |title=Sadhan-Chikitsa |publisher=Independent Publisher |date=2015 |isbn=9781467517874 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Sadhan_Chikitsa.html?id=IcsVRBS81_kC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He wrote several books on the history of Marathas,&lt;ref&gt;{{WorldCat|id=lccn-n81072052}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created indexes of [[Peshwa]]'s Daftar or historical records, known as "Bendrey's Indexes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chitnis|first=KN |title=Research Methodology in History |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |date=1990 |isbn=9788171561216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azsdBX41x7oC&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=v%20s%20bendrey&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=v%20s%20bendrey&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, it was given the ''Votrax'' name (taken from the name of its first commercial product, the model VS4 "Votrax") and moved to [[Troy, Michigan]] and, in 1980, split off of its parent company entirely and became Votrax International, Inc., which produced speech products up until 1984.&lt;ref name="articannex_about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.articannex.ws/artictec.htm |title=About Artic Technologies |publisher=Articannex.ws |date= |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artic_history"&gt;[http://www.artictech.com/history.htm Artic History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327064418/http://www.artictech.com/history.htm |date=March 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the company declared bankruptcy and restructured itself as a commercial phone/speech auto-answering systems company after downsizing much of the staff.

== History ==

All the Votrax [[speech synthesis|speech synthesizers]] owe their existence to the speech synthesizer design created in 1970 by Richard T. Gagnon. After coming up with a viable design scheme in his basement laboratory, Gagnon licensed it to [[Federal Screw Works]], whom he was working for at the time, and they continued development of his original design. This became the "Vocal division of Federal Screw Works."&lt;ref name="ssshp_votrax"/&gt;

In 1984, Votrax either declared bankruptcy or came close to doing so, and restructured itself as a commercial phone-interface provider, and hence produced no new consumer products. The later commercial-only products are not listed on the below list because literature about these seems to have been of limited distribution and has not yet been found. During the restructuring, much of the existing staff was downsized off, including [[Tim Gargagliano]] and [[Kathryn F. Gargagliano]], who along with two other former Votrax employees, [[Art Velthoven]] and [[Dale McDaniel]], started [[Artic Technologies]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="articannex_about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artic_history"/&gt; Tim and Kate had earlier written an article about the SC-01 for [[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] magazine.&lt;ref name="byte_article"&gt;[http://www.byte.com/art/9602/sec5/art3.htm BYTE.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185353/http://www.byte.com/art/9602/sec5/art3.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1987, Votrax merged with Vynet Corp and the product lines of both companies were combined.&lt;ref name="vynet_thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vynet_nyt"/&gt;

== Products ==
Votrax was responsible for designing and manufacturing several important early speech synthesizer back-ends, and several widely used [[integrated circuit]] [[phoneme]] synthesizers. Votrax produced speech backend modules and cards for various personal computers, and worked with the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) to create an extensible speech frontend system. Votrax's speech technology was also used by 3rd parties in several [[arcade games]], [[Gottlieb#System 80 pinball games|Gottlieb System 80 pinball machines]], and talking [[Computer terminal|terminals]].&lt;ref name="redcedar_sc01"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dale Grover |url=http://www.redcedar.com/sc01.htm |title=SC-01A |publisher=Redcedar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, Votrax produced a series of discrete speech synthesizers, with epoxy-coated boards to thwart people copying their designs. In 1980, they designed and manufactured an [[integrated circuit]] speech synthesizer called the SC-01. This IC proved very popular in the third party market, and was produced until at least 1984. It was succeeded by the somewhat more dynamic SC-02, also known as the SSI-263P. From the beginning of SC-02 production, Silicon Systems Inc. (now part of [[Texas Instruments]])&lt;ref name="redcedar_sc01"/&gt; manufactured the SC-02 chip under the product number SSI-263P, and this was apparently later adopted as the official name of the IC. Votrax continued to intermittently sell SC-01-A and SC-02 synthesis chips, and Personal Speech System text to speech units until at least October, 1990.&lt;ref name="abledata_PSS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abledata.com/abledata.cfm?pageid=113583&amp;top=0&amp;productid=94209&amp;trail=0 |title=product detail |publisher=AbleData |date=2003-04-24 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early in its life, Votrax specialized in making phoneme-based speech synthesizers and text-to-speech algorithms. The popular United States Naval Research Laboratory, or "NRL" text-to-phoneme [[algorithm]] was developed by a collaboration between Votrax and the NRL in 1973. This algorithm and variants of it were used on a number of text-to-speech devices, such as the votrax type-n-talk, the votrax personal speech system, and the General Instruments CTS256A-AL2 text-to-allophone chip.&lt;ref name="ssshp_votrax"/&gt; A good rundown of the [[NRL algorithm]] can be found under reference.&lt;ref name="davies_t2smicrv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/werdav/t2smicrv.html |title=Microvox |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Votrax also supplied the SC-02 speech chip used in the [[amateur radio]] 'DOVE-OSCAR 17' or 'DOVE' Microsatellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://201.91.65.226/dove/dove.html Dove]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/nk6k/msatname.html |title=AMSAT-NA Microsats - Participants |publisher=Amsat.org |date=1995-01-19 |accessdate=2010-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419125336/http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/nk6k/msatname.html |archivedate=April 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/n7hpr/do17.html |title=Amateur Satellite Summary - DO-17 |publisher=Amsat.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516205721/http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/n7hpr/do17.html |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas McIlroy|M. D. Mcilroy]] used a "Votrax" branded "Federal Screw Works" synth, a single potted block, as the 'Screw Works' backend for the [[Unix]] '[[speak (Unix)|speak]]' command on Unix V1/2/3/4 in 1972/1973.&lt;ref name="pups"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnie.tuhs.org/PUPS/index.html |title=The PDP-11 Unix Preservation Society |publisher=Minnie.tuhs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the algorithm were later (1974) described in his paper "Synthetic English speech by rule", Bell Telephone Laboratories Computer Science Technical Report #14, which is available on his personal site's publications page.&lt;ref name="m_d_mcilroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/pubs.html |title=Publications |publisher=Cs.dartmouth.edu |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
