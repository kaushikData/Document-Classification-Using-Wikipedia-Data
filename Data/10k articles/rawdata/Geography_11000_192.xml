It is a distinct network of nuclear-weapons manufacturing tunnels to the likewise defunct [[Underground Project 131]] and the still operational, "[[Underground Great Wall of China]]."

==Introduction==
The base has the “World's Largest Artificial [[Cave]]”.&lt;ref name="816 Plant ChinaDaily"/&gt; The project was started in 1966 when [[Sino-Soviet relations]] dramatically declined (see also the [[Sino-Soviet split]]). To enhance China's [[Defense (military)|national defence]] and prevent possible Soviet invasion and nuclear attack, the project was approved (directly by then-Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]) and undertaken in secret. More than 60,000 [[Military engineer|engineering soldiers]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]] participated in the construction of the base.&lt;ref name="816 Plant ChinaDaily"/&gt;  The underground base was designed to be able to tolerate thousands of tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] explosives and 8-[[Seismic scale|magnitude]] [[earthquake]]s.&lt;ref name="816 Plant ChinaDaily"/&gt;

The surface area of the cave is more than 104,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the total length of the [[tunnel]]s is more than 20 kilometers.&lt;ref name="816 Plant QQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.qq.com/a/20100426/000373.htm |script-title=zh:图集：重庆地下核工厂首次作为旅游景点开放 |publisher=[[Tencent QQ]] News  |date=2010-04-26 &lt;!-- 08:00   --&gt; |accessdate=23 May 2010|language=zh| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100429185500/http://news.qq.com/a/20100426/000373.htm| archivedate= 29 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole complex consists of 13 levels, 18 artificial caves linked to each other, and has more than 80 [[road]]s and 130 tunnels.&lt;ref name="816 Plant QQ"/&gt; [[Automobile]]s such as [[car]]s are able to pass the roads and tunnels inside.&lt;ref name="816 Plant QQ"/&gt; The largest artificial cave has a height of 79.6 meters, and is roughly equal to that of a 20-floor building.&lt;ref name="816 Plant QQ"/&gt;

The project was under construction for 17 years, and the construction was nearly completed in 1984. In 1964 China made its [[596 (nuclear test)|first public nuclear test]]. Largely due to change in the [[Cold War]] international situation, the project was cancelled in February 1984.&lt;ref name="816 Plant tourists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlog.org/10651195-chongqing-816-nuclear-defense-cave-will-open-to-the-public.html |title=

{{History of Albania}}
The '''Albanian Vilayet''' ({{lang-ota|ولايت ارناود}}, ''Vilâyet-i Arnavid'') was a projected ''[[vilayet]]'' of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the western [[Balkan Peninsula]], which was to include the four Ottoman vilayets with substantial ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] populations: [[Kosovo Vilayet]], [[Scutari Vilayet]], [[Manastir Vilayet]] and [[Janina Vilayet]]. At times it included the [[Salonica Vilayet]] too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clayer |first=Nathalie |title=Aux origines du nationalisme albanais: la naissance d'une nation majoritairement musulmane on Europe |url=https://books.google.com/?id=umotBF3KFWgC&amp;pg=PA666&amp;dq=Themistokli+G%C3%ABrmenji#v=snippet&amp;q=vilayet&amp;f=false |accessdate= January 19, 2011 |date= 2007 |publisher= Karthala |isbn= 978-2-84586-816-8 |page= 463|quote= Contrairement à ce qui est souvent affirmé, la revendication d'un territoire englobant le vilayet de Salonique fut assez fréquente |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Plans for an Albanian Vilayet were lost with the [[Partition of Albania]].

A separate Albanian super-vilayet was a part of the agenda of many Albanian organizations and societies since 1877, during the period known as the [[Albanian National Awakening]]. Establishment of such a vilayet was agreed between the Albanian rebels and the authorized representatives of the Ottoman government on September 4, 1912, following the [[Albanian Revolt of 1912]]. Soon after that agreement however, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out and most of the remaining European territory of the Ottoman Empire was occupied by the [[Balkan League]] member states. After the army of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] captured [[Skopje]], [[Ismail Qemali]] invited a group of [[Albanians]] from all four Ottoman vilayets that were agreed to be united into the Albanian Vilayet, to attend an [[All-Albanian Congress]] in [[Vlorë|Valona]]. There they declared [[Independent Albania|independence]] on November 28, 1912, and set up the [[Provisional Government of Albania]].

The same territories were claimed by nations in the region that had already raised their national development to independent statehood: Shkodër vilayet was claimed by the [[Serbs]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Kosovo vilayet]] by the Serbs, Montenegrins and Bulgarians, Monastir vilayet by the Serbs, [[Greeks]] and [[Bulgarians]] and [[Janina Vilayet]] by the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Sellers |first= Mortimer|authorlink= Mortimer Sellers |first2= Tadeusz |last2= Tomaszewski |title=The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9Rx7_KyUp7cC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=borders+of+the+Albanian+vilayet#v=onepage&amp;q=borders%20of%20the%20Albanian%20vilayet&amp;f=false |accessdate= January 19, 2011 |date= 2010-04-15|publisher= Springer Dordrecht Heidelberg |location= London |isbn=978-90-481-3748-0 |doi= 10.1007/978-90-481-3749-7|page= 202 |quote= However, the same regions were also claimed by those nations living in area that had started their national developments and risen to nation statehood level somewhat before Albanians.

=== Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights ===
{{Further|Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights}}
The [[Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights]] was organization established in the city of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], then [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1877 by an influential group of [[Albania]]n intellectuals, patriots, and politicians, such as [[Sami Frashëri]], [[Pashko Vasa]], [[Abdyl Frashëri]] and many others.&lt;ref name="El74-76"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elsie|first=Robert |title=Albanian literature: a short history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=pandeli+sotiri&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=pandeli%20sotiri&amp;f=false|date=January 2006|publisher=I.

=== League of Prizren 1878 ===
{{Further|League of Prizren}}
The [[League of Prizren]] was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] political organization founded on 10 June 1878 in [[Prizren]], in the [[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]] province (''[[vilayet]]'') of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

=== League of Peja 1899 ===
{{Further|League of Peja}}
The [[League of Peja]] ({{lang-sq|Lidhja e Pejës}}) was an Albanian political organization established in 1899 in the city of [[Peć]] (Peja), [[Kosovo]]. It was led by [[Haxhi Zeka]], a former member of the [[League of Prizren]] and shared the same platform in quest for an autonomous [[Albanian vilayet]] within [[Ottoman Empire]]. There were two groups of members. The first group of conservative and more moderate members wanted five vilayets (with [[Salonica Vilayet]] included) to be united into the Albanian vilayet, and the second group of the more radical members wanted full administrative autonomy for the four vilayets united in the Albanian vilayet.&lt;ref name="University of Washington Press"/&gt;

The village was named Bikuli because, there were no [[water]] sources (Kulo) for [[irrigation]] in that village and hence meaning is without [[canals]]. Bikuli was new version of Bekulo ('Be' stands for 'not' and 'Kulo' stands for 'canals').

The village is situated 8 [[Km]] [[north]] of the district [[Capital city]],capital, [[Taulihawa]] and 8.5&amp;nbsp;km north of the [[Tilaurakot]], the proper kapilvastu, where Lord [[Gautam Buddha]] is said to have been born and grown up. While this is 12&amp;nbsp;km south from the East-West [[Highway]] of [[Nepal]]. This place lies on the bank of the largest [[man-made]] Lake of [[Asia]] called Jagadishpur taal (lake). The [[lake]] also called [[reservoir]], made for the collection of [[river]] water for the irrigation of the southern belt of the [[Kapilvastu District]] during the [[dry season]].

Brazil was inhabited by [[Indigenous Brazilian|numerous tribal nations]] prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], who claimed the area for the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Brazil remained a [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony]] until 1808, when the capital of the empire was [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. [[Brazilian Independence|Independence]] was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the [[Empire of Brazil]], a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]]. The country [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|became a presidential republic]] in 1889 following a military [[coup d'état]]. An authoritarian [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military junta]] came to power [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|in 1964]] and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current [[Constitution of Brazil|constitution]], formulated in 1988, defines it as a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[federal republic]].&lt;ref name="Constituição"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Federal Constitution |publisher=Presidency of the Republic |year=1988 |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao.htm |language=Portuguese |accessdate=3 June 2008}} {{cite web |title=Brazilian Federal Constitution |publisher=v-brazil.com |year=2007 |url=http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html |quote=Unofficial translate |accessdate=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks [[List of World Heritage Sites in Brazil|thirteenth in the world]] by number of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list |title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre&amp;nbsp;— World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that the word "Brazil" comes from the Portuguese word for [[Caesalpinia echinata|brazilwood]], a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.&lt;ref name="Fausto1999"&gt;{{cite book|first=Boris|last=Fausto|title=A Concise History of Brazil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJdaM325m8IC&amp;pg=PA9|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56526-4|page=9|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portuguese, brazilwood is called ''pau-brasil'', with the word ''brasil'' commonly given the etymology "red like an ember", formed from Latin ''brasa'' ("ember") and the suffix ''-il'' (from ''-iculum'' or ''-ilium'').&lt;ref name="Vincent2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon S.

Around the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Robert M. |title=The History of Brazil |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2003 |isbn=978-1403962553 |page=32 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The indigenous population of Brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g. the [[Tupí people|Tupis]], [[Guaraní people|Guaranis]], [[Gê peoples|Gês]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawaks]]). The Tupí people were subdivided into the [[Tupiniquim people|Tupiniquins]] and [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambás]], and there were also many subdivisions of the other groups.{{sfnp|Levine|2003|p=31}}

The land now called Brazil was claimed for the [[Portuguese Empire]] on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].&lt;ref name="Boxer, p. 98"&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes, most of whom spoke languages of the [[Tupi–Guarani]] family, and fought among themselves.&lt;ref name="Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;100"&gt;Boxer, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, [[colonization]] effectively began in 1534, when King [[John III of Portugal|John&amp;nbsp;III of Portugal]] divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous [[Captaincies of Brazil|Captaincy Colonies of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, pp.&amp;nbsp;100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27"&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the [[Governorate General of Brazil]], a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America.&lt;ref name="Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing [[opportunistic]] alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Meuwese, Mark "Brothers in Arms, Partners in Trade: Dutch-Indigenous Alliances in the Atlantic World, 1595–1674" Koninklijke Brill NV 2012 {{ISBN|9789004210837}} ''Chapter III''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf, Alida C.

In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of [[continental Portugal]], causing [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent João]], in the name of [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]], to move the royal court from [[Lisbon]] to [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213"&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local [[stock exchange]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Marta Barcellos &amp; Simone Azevedo; ''Histórias do Mercado de Capitais no Brasil'' ("Financial Markets' Histories in Brazil") (Portuguese) Campus Elsevier 2011 {{ISBN|85-352-3994-4}} Introduction (by Ney Carvalho), Intro. page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[Banco do Brasil|National Bank]], additionally ending the Portuguese [[monopoly]] on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the [[Portuguese conquest of French Guiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, p.&amp;nbsp;145.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a [[colony]]. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for the prior six years, the Crown established the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], thus creating a [[pluricontinental]] transatlantic monarchic state.&lt;ref name="Mosher2008"/&gt; However, such a ploy didn't last long, since the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to require the return of court to Lisbon (as postulated by the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]]), and also groups of Brazilians, impatient for practical and real changes, still demanded independence and a republic, as demonstrated by the [[Pernambucan Revolt|1817 Pernambucan Revolt]].&lt;ref name="Mosher2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey C.

Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased, and the [[Portuguese Cortes]], guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;117–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|declaring the country's independence from Portugal]] on 7 September 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;150–153&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first [[Emperor of Brazil]], with the royal title of Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro&amp;nbsp;I]], resulting in the foundation of the [[Empire of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianna, p.&amp;nbsp;418&lt;/ref&gt;

As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age, a [[Regency (government)|regency]] was set up by the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, during this period a series of localized rebellions took place, such as the [[Cabanagem]] in [[Grão-Pará Province]], the [[Malê Revolt]] in [[Salvador da Bahia]], the [[Balaiada]] ([[Maranhão]]), the [[Sabinada]] ([[Bahia]]), and the [[Ragamuffin War]] beginning in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and supported by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. These emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent [[nation state]].{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Chapter 2, 2.1 to 2.3}} This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the [[Praieira revolt]] in [[Pernambuco]], was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the [[Dom Pedro II#Early coronation|premature coronation of Pedro II]] in 1841.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999}}

During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] was abandoned in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Bethell|Bethell, Leslie]] "The Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade: Britain, Brazil and the Slave Trade" [[Cambridge University Press]] 1970, ''"Cambridge Latin American Studides"'', Chapters 9 to 12.

The foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related to issues with the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] with which Brazil had borders.

The early republican government was nothing more than a military dictatorship, with army dominating affairs both at Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.{{sfnp|Smallman|2002|loc=end of Chapter 1, from page 18 "Military rule"}} Only in 1894, following the unfoldings of two severe crises, [[encilhamento|an economic]] along with [[Revolta da Armada|a military one]], the civilians rose to power staying there until October 1930.{{sfnp|Smallman|2002|pp=21–26}}&lt;ref&gt;Triner, Gail D.

Little by little, [[Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil#1st Republican period (1889-1930)|a cycle of general instability]] sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent, that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate [[Getúlio Vargas]] supported by most of the military, successfully led the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|October 1930 Coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine; Robert M. &amp; Crocitti; John J.

In the 1930s, three failed attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power occurred. The first was the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] in 1932, led by the [[São Paulo (state)|Paulista]] oligarchy. The second was a [[Brazilian uprising of 1935|Communist uprising]] in November 1935, and the last one a ''putsch'' attempt by [[Brazilian Integralism|local fascists]] in May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;E.

The 1937 ''coup d'état'' resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election, formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] era, which was noted for government brutality and censorship of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, Richard "Getulio Vargas of Brazil, 1883–1954" C.

With the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with democracy "reinstated" by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;McCann 2004, Page 441 (middle to the end)&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Roett; Riordan "Brazil; Politics in a Patrimonial Society" GreenWood Publishing Group 1999, end of page 106 to page 108 {{ISBN|0-275-95899-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keen &amp; Haynes 2004, pages&amp;nbsp;361–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Kubitschek's successor, [[Jânio Quadros]], resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt; His vice-president, [[João Goulart]], assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;210&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|deposed in April 1964]] by a coup that resulted in a [[Brazilian military government|military regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;397&lt;/ref&gt;

The new regime was intended to be transitory&lt;ref&gt;Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', pp.141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the [[AI-5|Fifth Institutional Act]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="Gaspari p.35"&gt;Gaspari, ''A Ditadura Envergonhada'', p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society,{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&amp;pg=PA395 395], last paragraph}}&lt;ref&gt;Richard Young, Odile Cisneros "Historical Dictionary of Latin American Literature and Theater" Scare Crow Press 2011, page 224, 2nd § [https://books.google.com/books?id=i0ZyleoLY5UC&amp;pg=PA224 View on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; inside and outside the country through the infamous "[[Operation Condor]]".&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Burgorgue-Larsen &amp; Amaya Úbeda de Torres "The Inter-American Court of Human Rights: Case Law and Commentary" Oxford University Press 2011 {{ISBN|9780199588787}} Page 299 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fQpnBsRWNlYC&amp;pg=PA299 View on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&amp;pg=PA396 396]}} Despite its brutality, like other [[authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]], due to an economic boom, known as an "economic miracle", the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&amp;pg=PA395 395] (from 2nd paragraph) to 397}}

Slowly however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Burns 1993, Page 457&lt;/ref&gt; plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals [[Ernesto Geisel]] and [[Golbery do Couto e Silva]].{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Chapter 6 "The military government and the transition to democracy (1964–1984)"}} With the enactment of the [[Amnesty law#Brazil|Amnesty Law]] in 1979, Brazil began a slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999}}

Civilians returned to power in 1985 when [[José Sarney]] assumed the presidency. He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and [[hyperinflation]] he inherited from the military regime.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;464–465.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the [[Brazilian presidential election, 1989|election in 1989]] of the almost-unknown [[Fernando Collor de Mello|Fernando Collor]], subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;465, 475.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Itamar Franco]], who appointed [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful [[Plano Real]],&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;311.&lt;/ref&gt; that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the Brazilian economy.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Epilogue}}&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;482.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardoso won the [[Brazilian presidential election, 1994|1994 election]], and [[Brazilian presidential election, 1998|again in 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;474.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ulyssesguimaraesconstituicao.jpg|thumb|[[Ulysses Guimarães]] holding the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1988]] in his hands.]]

The peaceful transition of power from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] ([[Brazilian presidential election, 2002|elected in 2002]] and [[Brazilian presidential election, 2006|re-elected in 2006]]), was seen as proof that Brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;502.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zirin, 2014.

Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate.&lt;ref name="Encarta 9"/&gt; This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude.&lt;ref name="BBC Weather"/&gt; In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme.

Biodiversity can contribute to [[agriculture]], livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chickens, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.

The natural heritage of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, oil and gas extraction, over-fishing, wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water pollution, climate change, fire, and invasive species.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; In many areas of the country, the natural environment is threatened by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Under threat |publisher=Greenpeace |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/forests/south-america/under-threat/ |accessdate=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement; dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats; and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape.&lt;ref name="Encarta 11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amazon destruction: six football fields a minute |publisher=Greenpeace |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/amazon-destruction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405192352/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/amazon-destruction |archivedate=5 April 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region, including the controversial [[Belo Monte Dam|Belo Monte]] hydroelectric dam.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8492577.stm Brazil grants environmental licence for Belo Monte dam]."

The form of government is a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[Federation|federative]] [[republic]], with a [[presidential system]].&lt;ref name="Constituição"/&gt; The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,&lt;ref name="Constituição"/&gt; with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is [[Michel Temer]], who replaced [[Dilma Rousseff]] after her [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|impeachment]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/americas/brazil-rousseff-impeachment-vote/index.html|title=Brazil's Senate ousts Rousseff in impeachment vote|last=CNN|first=Catherine E.

The [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]]. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. Brazil is a [[democracy]], according to the [[Democracy Index]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Democracy Index 2010 |url=http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf|website=eiu.com|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political-administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities.&lt;ref name="Constituição"/&gt; The Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government". The [[federation]] is set on five fundamental principles:&lt;ref name="Constituição"/&gt; sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism. The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Constituição"/&gt; The executive and legislative are organized [[Separation of powers|independently in all three spheres of government]], while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres.

===Law===
{{Main|Law of Brazil|Law enforcement in Brazil|Crime in Brazil}}

[[File:Supremo Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|[[Supreme Federal Court of Brazil]] serves primarily as the Constitutional Court of the country]]

Brazilian law is based on the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html "The Brazilian Legal System"], Organization of American States. Retrieved 17 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.

The legal system is based on the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]], promulgated on 5 October 1988, and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.&lt;ref&gt;José Afonso da Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'' (Malheiros, 2004; {{ISBN|85-7420-559-1}}), p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|04}}, there have been 53 amendments. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'', p.&amp;nbsp;592.&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" ({{lang|pt|leis orgânicas}}), which act in a similar way to constitutions.&lt;ref name="DeffentiBarral2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fabiano Deffenti|author2=Welber Oliveira Barral|title=Introduction to Brazilian Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ba2J5eD8wYC&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=6 June 2013|year=2011|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=978-90-411-2506-4|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.&lt;ref name="Constituição"/&gt; Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]] allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.&lt;ref name="Constituição"/&gt; There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.&lt;ref name="Constituição"/&gt; The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Court]].

This system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Glugoski and Odete Medauar, "[http://www.usp.br/jorusp/arquivo/2003/jusp667/pag0304.htm Nossos direitos nas suas mãos]," [[University of São Paulo|USP]] Journal, 24–30 November 2003.

===Foreign policy===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Brazil}}
[[File:Brasilia-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Itamaraty Palace]], the seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]]]

Brazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]], which establishes [[Non-interventionism|non-intervention]], [[self-determination]], [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] and the [[Peacebuilding|peaceful settlement of conflicts]] as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html Article 4 of the Federal Constitution of Brazil] V-Brazil. Retrieved on 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Constitution, the [[President of Brazil|President]] has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while the [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]] is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and [[Treaty|international treaties]], as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleIV.html Article 84 of the Federal Constitution of Brazil] V-Brazil. Retrieved on 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a [[regional power]] in [[Latin America]], a leader among [[developing countries]], and an emerging [[world power]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090710013700/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/news/docs/RL33456.pdf U.S. Congressional Report on Brazil] [[United States Congress]]. Retrieved on 23 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of [[multilateralism]], peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Georges D. Landau, "The Decision-making Process in Foreign Policy: The Case of Brazil," Center for Strategic and International Studies: Washington DC: March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries.&lt;ref name="ODI1"&gt;Cabral and Weinstock 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5120&amp;title=brazil-election-emerging-donor-aid Brazil: an emerging aid player] ({{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113185641/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5120&amp;title=brazil-election-emerging-donor-aid|date=13 January 2011}}). London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels.&lt;ref name="ODI1"/&gt; Total aid is estimated to be around $1&amp;nbsp;billion per year that includes:&lt;ref name="ODI1"/&gt;

* an estimated $450&amp;nbsp;million for in-kind expertise provided by Brazilian institutions specialising in technical cooperation

In addition, Brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti]] ($350&amp;nbsp;million) and makes in-kind contributions to the [[World Food Programme]] ($300&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="ODI1"/&gt; This is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies.

=== Law enforcement and crime ===

{{Main|Law enforcement in Brazil|Crime in Brazil}}
[[File:Fnst.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the [[National Public Security Force]]]]
In Brazil, the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]] establishes five different police agencies for law enforcement: [[Federal Police Department]], [[Federal Highway Police]], [[Federal Railroad Police]], [[Military Police (Brazil)|Military Police]] and [[Civil Police (Brazil)|Civil Police]]. Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities and the last two are subordinate to state governments. All police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or state powers.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; The [[National Public Security Force]] also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/defesa-e-seguranca/2012/05/ordem-publica-e-prioridade-da-forca-nacional-de-seguranca |title=Ordem pública é prioridade da Força Nacional de Segurança |publisher=Portal Brasil |date=29 April 2012 |accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide. In 2012, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|highest rates of homicide of the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasil.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,brasil-tem-maior-numero-absoluto-de-homicidios-do-mundo,1604827|title=Brasil tem maior número absoluto de homicídios do mundo|publisher=[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number considered tolerable by the WHO is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Secretaria de Segurança Pública do Estado de São Paulo |url=http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/estatistica/dados.aspx?id=E |title=Taxa de delito por 100 mil habitantes |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/619lg4o87?url=http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/estatistica/dados.aspx?id=E |archivedate=23 August 2011 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences between the crime rates in the [[States of Brazil|Brazilian states]]. While in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, in [[Alagoas]] it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/uma-pessoa-e-assassinada-a-cada-dez-minutos-no-brasil|title=Os estados com mais homicídios no Brasil|publisher=[[Exame]]|date=11 November 2014|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world (behind only [[China]] and the [[United States]]), with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country (June 2014), an increase of about 300% compared to the index registered in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2014/06/1465527-brasil-passa-a-russia-e-tem-a-terceira-maior-populacao-carceraria-do-mundo.shtml|title=Brasil passa a Rússia e tem a terceira maior população carcerária do mundo|publisher=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system, leading to a shortfall of about two hundred thousand accommodations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/brasil/noticia/2014/01/brasil-tem-hoje-deficit-de-200-mil-vagas-no-sistema-prisional.html|title=Brasil tem hoje deficit de 200 mil vagas no sistema prisional|publisher=G1|date=15 January 2014|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
Brazil is a federation composed of 26 [[Federated state|states]], one [[federal district]], and the 5570 [[Municipality|municipalities]].&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt;
The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: [[Northern Region, Brazil|Northern]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]]. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.

Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government.&lt;ref name="Constituição" /&gt; Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called ''[[comarca]]'' (county).

Tourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of the country.

Natural areas are its most popular tourism product, a combination of [[ecotourism]] with [[leisure]] and [[recreation]], mainly sun and beach, and [[adventure travel]], as well as [[cultural tourism]]. Among the most popular destinations are the [[Amazon Rainforest]], [[beach]]es and [[dune]]s in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]], the [[Pantanal]] in the [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Region]], beaches at [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], cultural tourism in [[Minas Gerais]] and business trips to [[São Paulo]] city.&lt;ref name="Palhares2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guilherme Lohmann Palhares|title=Tourism in Brazil: Environment, Management and Segments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O91SVF9nH8gC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-67432-4|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the 2015 [[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report|Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index]] (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28st place at the world's level, third in the [[Americas]], after [[Canada]] and [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2015 |publisher=World Economic Forum |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/TT15/WEF_Global_Travel&amp;Tourism_Report_2015.pdf |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TTCI2013"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TT_Competitiveness_Report_2013.pdf|author=Jennifer Blanke and Thea Chiesa, Editors |year = 2013 |title = Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013 |publisher = [[World Economic Forum]], Geneva, Switzerland|accessdate=14 April 2013}} ''See Table 4, pp. 18–19 and Country/Economy Profile: Brazil, pp. 116–117.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's main competitive advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria out of all countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many [[World Heritage site]]s. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and high taxation. Safety and security have improved significantly: 75th in 2011, up from 128th in 2008.&lt;ref name="TTCI2013" /&gt;

According to the [[World Tourism Organization]] (WTO), international travel to Brazil accelerated in 2000, particularly during 2004 and 2005. However, in 2006 a slow-down took place, and international arrivals had almost no growth in 2007–08.&lt;ref name="WTO2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/highlights_07_eng_hr.pdf|title=UNWTO Tourism Highlights, Edition 2007|publisher=UNWTO|author=World Tourism Organization|accessdate=14 June 2008|year=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409090548/http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/highlights_07_eng_hr.pdf|archivedate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EMBRATUR09"&gt;{{cite web |year = 2009 |url=http://www.abav.com.br/info_indicadores_detalhe.aspx?id=24&amp;id_area=20&amp;id_doc=28|title = Anuário Estatístico de Turismo 2009|author = EMBRATUR|publisher= Ministério de Turismo |accessdate=5 September 2008|language=Portuguese}} ''See tables 1.1 and 3.8''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.worldtourism.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/highlights_06_eng_lr.pdf |title = Tourism Highlights 2006 [pdf] |publisher = |author = The World Tourism Organization |accessdate = 6 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this trend, revenues from international tourism continued to rise, from [[USD]] 4&amp;nbsp;billion in 2005 to 5&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007, despite 330 000 fewer arrivals. This favorable trend is the result of the strong devaluation of the US dollar against the [[Brazilian Real]], which began in 2004, but which makes Brazil a more expensive international destination.&lt;ref name="Boletim0207"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://200.189.169.141/site/arquivos/dados_fatos/Boletimdedesempenho/boletim_13___fevereiro_de_2007.pdf |title=Boletim de Desempenho Econômico do Turismo |author=Facultade Getúlio Vargas |publisher=Ministério de Turismo |accessdate=21 June 2008 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003062353/http://200.189.169.141/site/arquivos/dados_fatos/Boletimdedesempenho/boletim_13___fevereiro_de_2007.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008}} ''Fevereiro 2007, Ano IV, nº 13, pp. 3''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite continuing record-breaking international tourism revenues, the number of Brazilian tourists travelling overseas has been growing steadily since 2003, resulting in a net negative [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] balance, as more money is spent abroad by Brazilians than comes in as receipts from international tourists visiting Brazil.&lt;ref name="Boletim0308" /&gt;

Brazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic. The road system totaled 1.98&amp;nbsp;million km (1.23&amp;nbsp;million mi) in 2002. The total of paved roads increased from {{convert|35496|km|0|abbr=on}} (22,056&amp;nbsp;mi) in 1967 to {{convert|184140|km|0|abbr=on}} (114,425&amp;nbsp;mi) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Brazil-TRANSPORTATION.html|title=Road system in Brazil |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first investments in road infrastructure have given up in the 1920s, the government of [[Washington Luis]], being pursued in the governments of [[Getúlio Vargas]] and [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Pereira|first1=LAG|last2=LESSA|first2=SN|last3=CARDOSO|first3=AD|title=Planejamento e Transporte Rodoviário no Brasil}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] (1956–61), who designed and built the capital [[Brasília]], was another supporter of highways. Kubitschek was responsible for the installation of major car manufacturers in the country ([[Volkswagen]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors]] arrived in Brazil during his rule) and one of the points used to attract them was support for the construction of highways. With the implementation of [[Fiat]] in 1976 ending an automobile market closed loop, from the end of the 1990s the country has received large foreign direct investments installing in its territory other major car manufacturers and utilities, such as [[Iveco]], [[Renault]], [[Peugeot]], [[Citroen]], [[Honda]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], [[Hyundai]], [[Toyota]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Alberto Latini; "A Implantação da Indústria Automobilística no Brasil"; Editora Alaúde 2007 {{ISBN|9788598497556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil is the seventh most important country in the [[auto industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/all-vehicles.pdf|title=Automotive industry in Brazil and the world|access-date=14 May 2010|publisher=International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers|format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's [[Rail transport|railway]] system has been declining since 1945, when emphasis shifted to [[highway]] construction. The total length of railway track was {{convert|30875|km|0|abbr=on}} in 2002, as compared with {{convert|31848|km|0|abbr=on}} in 1970. Most of the railway system belonged to the Federal Railroad Corporation RFFSA, which was privatized in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www2.transportes.gov.br/bit/03-ferro/princ-ferro.html OPrincipais ferrovias]."

The other metro systems are in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Recife]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brasília]], [[Teresina]] and [[Fortaleza]].

The country has an extensive rail network of {{convert|28538|km|abbr=off}} in length, the tenth largest network in the world.&lt;ref name="2012ciagini"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2172.html Country Comparison to the World: Gini Index – Brazil] [[The World Factbook]].

There are about 2,500 [[airport]]s in Brazil, including landing fields: the second largest number in the world, after the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL86760-5598,00.html Ociosidade atinge 70% dos principais aeroportos]." globo.com, 12 August 2007. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport]], near São Paulo, is the largest and busiest airport with nearly 20 million passengers annually, while handling the vast majority of commercial traffic for the country.&lt;ref name="Palhares2012x"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guilherme Lohmann Palhares|title=Tourism in Brazil: Environment, Management and Segments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O91SVF9nH8gC&amp;pg=PA48|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-67432-4|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For freight transport [[waterways]] are of importance, e.g. the [[Free Economic Zone of Manaus|industrial zones of Manaus]] can be reached only by means of the Solimões–Amazonas waterway ({{convert|3250|km|abbr=off}} with {{convert|6|m|abbr=off}} minimum depth).

However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area. In 2012, Brazil had 1.85 doctors and 2.3 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS?locations=BR|title=Physicians (per 1,000 people)|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization's Global Health Workforce Statistics|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.BEDS.ZS|title=Hospital beds (per 1,000 people)|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization The World Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all the progress made since the creation of the [[universal health care]] system in 1988, there are still several public health problems in Brazil. In 2006, the main points to be solved were the high [[List of countries by infant mortality rate|infant]] (2.51%) and maternal mortality rates (73.1 deaths per 1000 births). The number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, such as [[cardiovascular diseases]] (151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and [[cancer]] (72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), also has a considerable impact on the health of the Brazilian population. Finally, external but preventable factors such as car accidents, violence and suicide caused 14.9% of all deaths in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Saúde|website=Radar social|publisher=Ministério do Planejamento|url=http://www.planejamento.gov.br/secretarias/upload/Arquivos/spi/programas_projeto/radar_social/2006_PRP_Radar_radarSocial.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081216074831/http://www.planejamento.gov.br/secretarias/upload/Arquivos/spi/programas_projeto/radar_social/2006_PRP_Radar_radarSocial.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 December 2008|accessdate=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian health system was ranked 125th among the 191 countries evaluated by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/paper30.pdf |title=Measuring overall health system performance for 191 countries|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=2000|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), which included representatives from all countries with Portuguese as the official language, reached an [[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990|agreement on the reform of the Portuguese orthography]] to unify the two standards then in use by Brazil on one side and the remaining lusophone countries on the other. This spelling reform went into effect in Brazil on 1 January 2009. In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on 21 July 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies will co-exist. The remaining CPLP countries are free to establish their own transition timetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nash |first=Elizabeth |title=Portugal pays lip service to Brazil's supremacy |publisher=The Independent |date=2 May 2008 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/portugal-pays-lip-service-to-brazils-supremacy-819728.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624131043/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/portugal-pays-lip-service-to-brazils-supremacy-819728.html |archivedate=24 June 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal. It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Pedro Cabral]] discovered Brazil in 1500. [[Portuguese colonial architecture]] was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Hue, Jorge de Souza (1999). Uma visão da arquitectura colonial no Brasil [A vision of Colonial Architecture in Brazil] (in Portuguese). Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, Charles Ralph (1962). The Golden Age of Brazil, 1695–1750: Growing Pains of a Colonial Society. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century during the time of the [[Empire of Brazil]], Brazil followed European trends and adopted [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. Then in the 20th century especially in Brasilia, Brazil experimented with [[Modernist architecture]].

The colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonise Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture which included Churches, civic architecture including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside. During 19th Century Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture. In the 1950s the [[modernist architecture]] was introduced when [[Brasilia]] was built as new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior. The architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] idealized and built Government buildings, Churches and civic buildings was constructed in the modernist style.&lt;ref name="Guimaraens"&gt;Guimaraens, Cêça de.

The music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European and African elements.&lt;ref name="FonsecaWeiner1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Duduka Da Fonseca|author2=Bob Weiner|title=Brazilian Rhythms for Drumset|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuZQUm_hhygC&amp;pg=PA7|year=1991|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|isbn=978-0-7692-0987-6|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with influence of Viennese classicism.&lt;ref name="Grazia2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donna M.

[[Brazilian literature]] dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as [[Pêro Vaz de Caminha]], filled with descriptions of [[fauna]], [[flora]] and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&amp;pg=PA360 360]}}

Brazil produced significant works in [[Romanticism]] – novelists like [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]] and [[José de Alencar]] wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated indigenous people as heroes in the [[Indianism (arts)|Indigenist]] novels ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[Ubirajara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100730/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/literature.html Brazilian Literature: An Introduction]."

The Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the [[Belle Époque]]. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as ''Rio the Magnificent'' were made in [[Rio de Janeiro]] to promote tourism in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio the Magnificent (1932)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7Q1kITY168|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films ''[[Limite]]'' (1931) and ''[[Ganga Bruta]]'' (1933), the latter being produced by [[Adhemar Gonzaga]] through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/movies/10cinema.html |title=Brazil's Best, Restored and Ready for a 21st-Century Audience |last1=Larry |first1=Rohter |last2= |first2= |date=9 November 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1941 unfinished film ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' was divided in four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by [[Orson Welles]]; it was originally produced as part of the United States' [[Good Neighbor Policy]] during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.

During the 1960s, the [[Cinema Novo]] movement rose to prominence with directors such as [[Glauber Rocha]], [[Nelson Pereira dos Santos]], [[Paulo Cesar Saraceni]] and [[Arnaldo Jabor]]. Rocha's films ''[[Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol]]'' (1964) and ''[[Terra em Transe]]'' (1967) are considered to be some of the greatest and most influential in Brazilian film history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tose|first1=Juliano|title=Editorial|url=http://www.contracampo.com.br/27/frames.htm|website=Contracampo – revista de cinema|publisher=Revista Contracampo|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, Brazil saw a surge of critical and commercial success with films such as ''[[O Quatrilho]]'' ([[Fábio Barreto]], 1995), ''[[O Que É Isso, Companheiro?]]'' ([[Bruno Barreto]], 1997) and ''[[Central Station (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' ([[Walter Salles]], 1998), all of which were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], the latter receiving a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] nomination for [[Fernanda Montenegro]].

The theatre in Brazil has its origins in the period of Jesuit expansion when theater was used for the dissemination of Catholic doctrine in the 16th century. in the 17th and 18th centuries the first dramatists who appeared on the scene of European derivation was for court or private performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brasilescola.uol.com.br/biografia/padre-anchieta.htm PADRE ANCHIETA] ''Brasil Escola''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, dramatic theater gained importance and thickness, whose first representative was [[Luis Carlos Martins Pena]] (1813–1848), capable of describing contemporary reality. Always in this period the comedy of costume and comic production was imposed. Significant, also in the nineteenth century, was also the playwright [[Antônio Gonçalves Dias]].&lt;ref name=teatro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/theater.html |title=Brazilian Theatre: An Introduction |publisher=Ambasciata brasiliana a Ottawa |language=english |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205061026/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/theater.html |archivedate= 5 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous operas and orchestras. The Brazilian conductor [[Antônio Carlos Gomes]] became internationally known with operas like ''[[Il Guarany]]''. At the end of century 19th century orchestrated dramaturgias became very popular and were accompanied of songs of famous artists like the conductress [[Chiquinha Gonzaga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.seed.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=196 O Teatro no Brasil] ''Secretaria da Educação do Paraná''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the early 20th century there was the presence of theaters, entrepreneurs and actor companies, but paradoxically the quality of the products staggered, and only in 1940 the Brazilian theater received a boost of renewal thanks to the action of Paschoal Carlos Magno and his student's theater, the comedians group and the Italian actors [[Adolfo Celi]], Ruggero Jacobbi and Aldo Calvo, founders of the ''Teatro Brasileiro de Comedia''. From the 1960s it was attended by a theater dedicated to social and religious issues and to the flourishing of schools of dramatic art. The most prominent authors at this stage were [[Jorge Andrade]] and [[Ariano Suassuna]].&lt;ref name=teatro/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}[[File:Cairn at Garvera, Surselva, Graubuenden, Switzerland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A cairn marking a mountain summit in [[Graubünden]], [[Switzerland]] ]]
A '''cairn''' is a human-made pile (or stack) of stones. The word ''cairn'' comes from the {{lang-gd|càrn}} {{IPA-gd|ˈkʰaːrˠn̪ˠ||}} (plural {{lang|gd|càirn}} {{IPA-gd|ˈkʰaːrˠɲ||}}).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drummond, ''Scottish Hill Names'', Scottish Mountaineering Trust (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-907521-95-2}}, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairns have been and are used for a broad variety of purposes, from prehistoric times to the present.

In [[modern time]]s, cairns are often erected as [[landmark]]s, a use they have had since [[ancient times]]. However, since [[prehistory]], they have also been built and used as [[Sepulchre|burial]] monuments; for defense and hunting; for ceremonial purposes, sometimes relating to  [[astronomy]]; to locate buried items, such as caches of food or objects; and to mark trails, among other purposes.

[[File:Cairn Northumberland and Durham.jpg|thumb|Cairn at the boundary of Counties Durham and Northumberland UK]]

Cairns are used as [[Trail blazing|trail markers]] in many parts of the world, in [[Upland (geology)|uplands]], on  [[moorland]],   on  [[Summit (topography)|mountaintops]], near [[waterway]]s and on [[sea cliff]]s, as well as in barren [[desert]]s and [[tundra]]. They vary in size from small stone markers to entire artificial hills, and in complexity from loose conical rock piles to delicately balanced sculptures and elaborate feats of [[megalith]]ic engineering. Cairns may be painted or otherwise decorated, whether for increased visibility or for religious reasons. An ancient example is the [[inuksuk]] (plural inuksuit), used by the [[Inuit]], [[Inupiat]], [[Kalaallit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], and other peoples of the [[Arctic]] region of North America.  Inuksuit are found from [[Alaska]] to [[Greenland]]. This region, above the [[Arctic Circle]], is dominated by the tundra [[biome]] and has areas with few natural [[landmark]]s.

==Modern cairns==
[[File:Lion's Head snow.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Line of cairns used to mark the way above the treeline on [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington, New Hampshire]], US]]
Different types of cairns exist from rough piles of stones to interlocking dry stone round cylinders.  The most important cairns commonly used around the world are interlocking stone survey cairns constructed around a central survey mark about every 30&amp;nbsp;km on the tallest peaks across a nation. These physical survey mark cairn systems are the basis for national survey grids to interconnect individual land survey measurements for entire nations. On occasion these permanent interlocking stone cairns are taken down then reconstructed to re-mark measurements to increase the accuracy of the national survey grid. They can also be used in unpopulated countries as emergency location points.  In [[North America]] and [[Northern Europe]] any type of cairn can be used to mark [[mountain bike]] and [[hiking trail]]s and other cross-country [[trail blazing]], especially in mountain regions at or above the [[tree line]]. For example, the extensive trail network maintained by the DNT, the [[Norwegian Trekking Association]], extensively uses cairns in conjunction with T-painted rock faces to mark trails.  Other examples of these can be seen in the lava fields of [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Volcanoes National Park]] to mark several hikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/hike_bc.htm |title=Backcountry Hikes - Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placed at regular intervals, a series of cairns can be used to indicate a path across stony or barren terrain, even across [[glacier]]s. Such cairns are often placed at junctions or in places where the trail direction is not obvious. They may also be used to indicate an obscured danger such as a sudden drop, or a noteworthy point such as the summit of a mountain.  Most trail cairns are small, usually being a foot or less in height. However, they may be built taller so as to protrude through a layer of snow. Hikers passing by often add a stone, as a small bit of maintenance to counteract the erosive effects of severe weather. North American trail marks are sometimes called "ducks" or "duckies", because they sometimes have a "beak" pointing in the direction of the route. The expression "two rocks do not make a duck" reminds hikers that just one rock resting upon another could be the result of accident or nature rather than intentional trail marking.

The building of cairns for recreational purposes along trails, to mark one's personal passage through the area, can result in an overabundance of rock piles. This distracts from cairns used as genuine navigational guides, and also conflicts with the [[Leave No Trace]] ethic. This ethic of outdoor practice advocates for leaving the outdoors undisturbed and in its natural condition.
[[File:Isandlwanamassgrave.JPG|left|thumb|200px|One of many cairns marking British mass graves at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] (1879), [[South Africa]]]]
Coastal cairns, or "sea marks", are also common in the northern latitudes, especially in the island-strewn waters of [[Scandinavia]] and eastern [[Canada]]. Often indicated on navigation charts, they may be painted white or lit as beacons for greater visibility offshore.

Modern cairns may also be erected for historical or memorial commemoration or simply for decorative or artistic reasons. One example is a series of many cairns marking [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers' [[mass graves]] at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], [[South Africa]]. Another is the [[Matthew Flinders]] Cairn on the side of [[Arthur's Seat, Victoria|Arthur's Seat]], a small mountain on the shores of [[Port Phillip Bay]], [[Australia]]. A large cairn, commonly referred to as "the igloo" by the locals, was built atop a hill next to the [[I-476]] highway in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]] and is a part of a series of large rock sculptures initiated in 1988 to symbolize the township's [[Wales|Welsh]] heritage and to beautify the visual imagery along the highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 Radnor Township website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820120212/http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 |date=2007-08-20 }}, Gateway Enhancement Strategy.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are merely places where farmers have collected stones removed from a field. These can be seen in the [[Catskill Mountains]], [[North America]] where there is a strong Scottish heritage, and may also represent places where livestock were lost. In locales exhibiting fantastic rock formations, such as the [[Grand Canyon]], tourists often construct simple cairns in reverence of the larger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[:commons:File:Cairns at Grand Canyon North Rim 2013.jpg]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, cairns may have a strong aesthetic purpose, for example in the art of [[Andy Goldsworthy]].

===Illegal construction===
Norwegian authorities said in 2015 that illegal cairns are being built each year, to a large degree by tourists to Norway; part of the problem is that individual stones are being removed from registered- and unregistered ''kulturminner'' (e.g., historical monuments).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/finnmark/_-ulovlige-varder-er-blitt-en-farsott-1.12499962 – Ulovlige varder er blitt en farsott] [– Illegal cairns have become a craze]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Clear}}

===Europe===
The building of cairns for various purposes goes back into [[prehistory]] in [[Eurasia]], ranging in size from small rock sculptures to substantial man-made hills of stone (some built on top of larger, natural hills). The latter are often relatively massive [[Bronze Age]] or earlier structures which, like kistvaens and [[dolmen]]s, frequently contain burials; they are comparable to [[Tumulus|tumuli]] ([[kurgan]]s), but of stone construction instead of [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. ''Cairn'' originally could more broadly refer to various types of hills and natural stone piles, but today is used exclusively of artificial ones.
[[File:Cairn Gavrinis exterieur.jpg|thumb|Cairn of the [[Neolithic]]-era [[passage grave]] on [[Gavrinis]] island, [[Brittany]]]]
The word ''cairn'' derives from [[Scots language|Scots]] {{lang|gd|cairn}} (with the same meaning), in turn from [[Scottish Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|càrn}}, which is essentially the same as the corresponding words in other native [[Celtic language]]s of [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]], including [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|carn}} (and {{lang|cy|carnedd}}), [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|karn}}, [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|carn}}, and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] {{lang|kw|karn}} or {{lang|kw|carn}}.  Cornwall ({{lang|kw|Kernow}}) itself may actually be named after the cairns that dot its landscape, such as Cornwall's highest point, [[Brown Willy Cairns|Brown Willy Summit Cairn]], a 5&amp;nbsp;m (16&amp;nbsp;ft) high and 24&amp;nbsp;m (79&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter mound atop [[Brown Willy]] hill in [[Bodmin Moor]], an area with many ancient cairns.  Burial cairns and other [[megalith]]s are the subject of a variety of legends and folklore throughout Britain and Ireland. In [[Scotland]], it is traditional to carry a stone up from the bottom of a hill to place on a cairn at its top. In such a fashion, cairns would grow ever larger. An old Scottish Gaelic blessing is {{lang|gd|Cuiridh mi clach air do chàrn}}, "I'll put a stone on your stone".  In Highland folklore it is recounted that before Highland clans fought in a battle, each man would place a stone in a pile. Those who survived the battle returned and removed a stone from the pile. The stones that remained were built into a cairn to honour the dead. Cairns in the region were also put to vital practical use. For example, [[Dún Aonghasa]], an all-stone [[Iron Age]] Irish [[hill fort]] on [[Inishmore]] in the [[Aran Islands]], is still surrounded by small cairns and strategically placed jutting rocks, used collectively as an alternative to [[Defensive wall|defensive earthworks]] because of the [[karst]] landscape's lack of soil.
[[File:BorderPost272 - Norway and Sweden.jpg|thumb|The [[Stone Cairn (Riksrösen)|Riksrösen]] divide Norway and Sweden.]]
In [[Scandinavia]], cairns have been used for centuries as trail and sea marks, among other purposes. In [[Iceland]], cairns were often used as markers along the numerous single-file roads or paths that crisscrossed the island; many of these ancient cairns are still standing, although the paths have disappeared. In [[Norse Greenland]], cairns were used as a hunting implement, a game-driving "lane", used to direct reindeer towards a [[game jump]].&lt;ref&gt;Arneborg 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythology of ancient Greece, cairns were associated with [[Hermes]], the god of overland travel. According to one legend, Hermes was put on trial by [[Hera]] for slaying her favorite servant, the monster [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]]. All of the other gods acted as a jury, and as a way of declaring their verdict they were given pebbles, and told to throw them at whichever person they deemed to be in the right, Hermes or Hera. Hermes argued so skillfully that he ended up buried under a heap of pebbles, and this was the first cairn.
In [[Croatia]], in areas of ancient [[Dalmatia]], such as [[Herzegovina]] and the [[Krajina]], they are known as ''gromila''.

In [[Portugal]] a cairn is called  a {{lang|pt|moledro}}. In a legend the moledros are enchanted soldiers, and if one stone is taken from the pile and put under a pillow, in the morning a soldier will appear for a brief moment, then will change back to a stone and magically return to the pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Genética e a Teoria da Continuidade Paleolítica aplicada à Lenda da Fundação de Portugal e Escócia Apenas Livros|year=2008|isbn=978-989-618-180-2|url=http://www.continuitas.org/texts/morais_genetica.pdf|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cairns that mark the place where someone died or cover the graves alongside the roads where in the past people were buried are called {{lang|pt|Fiéis de Deus}}. The same name given to the stones was given to  the dead whose identity was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SoUyAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Diccionario+da+lingua+portugueza:+recopilado+dos+vocabularios+impressos#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Diccionario da lingua portugueza:recopilado dos vocabularios impressos até agora, e nesta segunda edição novamente emendado, e muito accrescentado, Volume 2. pg 31 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30|year=1813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|gl|Fieis de Deus}} or {{lang|gl|Fes de Deus}} are, in the Galician legends, spirits of the night. The word "Fes" or "Fieis" is thought to mean [[fairy]], the same root as "fate"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sli.uvigo.es/ddd/ddd_pescuda.php?pescuda=fes&amp;tipo_busca=lema ''Dicionario de Dicionarios. Corpus lexicográfico da lingua galega'']. ''Dicionario de Dicionarios''. "Entienden por éstos o estas fes los espíritus nocturnos, fantasmas, espectros, etc. Acaso serán lo mismo que las fees en francés, y todo de fata." Retrieved January 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (''fado''), that can take the same meaning as the proto-Celtic *bato-, meaning "death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spns.org.uk/ProtoCelt.pdf |title=Proto-Celtic―English |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairns are also common on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Corsica]].{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Please give examples}}

===North and northeast Africa===
[[File:Qableh3.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Ancient cairns in [[Qa’ableh]], [[Somalia]]]]
Cairns (''taalo'') are a common feature at [[El Ayo]], [[Haylan]], [[Qa’ableh]], [[Qombo'ul]], [[Heis (town)|Heis]], [[Salweyn]] and [[Macajilayn]], among other places. Northern [[Somalia]] in general is home to a lot of such historical settlements and [[archaeological site]]s wherein are found numerous ancient ruins and buildings, many of obscure origins. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.&lt;ref name="Hodd"&gt;Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade &amp; Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Neolithic]] times, the climate of [[North Africa]] has become drier. A reminder of the [[desertification]] of the area is provided by [[megalith]]ic remains, which occur in a great variety of forms and in vast numbers in presently arid and uninhabitable wastelands: cairns (''kerkour''), [[dolmen]]s and circles like [[Stonehenge]], underground cells excavated in rock, [[Long barrow|barrows]] topped with huge slabs, and step [[pyramid]]-like mounds.

===Asia and the Pacific===
Starting in the [[Bronze Age]],{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=WHERE?!? "Asia" is huge.}} burial [[cist]]s were sometimes interred into cairns, which would be situated in conspicuous positions, often on the skyline above the village of the deceased. The stones may have been thought to deter grave robbers and scavengers. A more sinister explanation is that they were to [[Revenant (folklore)|stop the dead from rising]]. There remains a [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition of placing small stones on a person's grave as a token of respect, though this is generally to relate the longevity of stone to the eternal nature of the soul and is not usually done in a cairn fashion. [[Stupa]]s in India and [[Tibet]] probably started out in a similar fashion, although they now generally contain the ashes of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] saint or [[lama]].

[[File:TallOvoo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Mongolian ceremonial cairn (''[[ovoo]]'')]]A traditional and often decorated, heap-formed cairn called an ''[[ovoo]]'' is made in [[Mongolia]]. It primarily serves religious purposes, and finds use in both [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ceremonies.

In [[Hawaii]], cairns are called by the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word {{lang|haw|ahu}}.{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=So what? Is this an ancient thing? If so, tell us about it and cite sources. If it's just the word for modern trail cairns on the volcanoes, then remove this entire paragraph since this isn't Wiktionary, and WP isn't here to provide translation services.}}

In [[South Korea]] cairns are quite prevalent, often found along roadsides and trails, up on mountain peaks, and adjacent to Buddhist temples.  Hikers frequently add stones to existing cairns trying to get just one more on top of the pile, to bring good luck.  This tradition has its roots in the worship of San-shin, or Mountain Spirit, so often still revered in Korean culture.&lt;ref name="san"&gt;{{cite book | title=Spirit of the Mountains - Korea's San-Shin and Traditions of Mountain Worship| last=Mason| first=David| year=1999| page=41| publisher=Hollym International Corp.| location=Seoul, South Korea and Elizabeth, New Jersey| isbn=1-56591-107-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
[[File:Flag of Nunavut.svg|thumb|An inuksuk on the [[flag of Nunavut]]]]
Throughout what today are the [[continental United States]] and Canada, cairns still mark [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]' game-driving "lanes" leading to [[buffalo jump]]s, some of which may date to 12,000 years ago.
Natives of arctic North America (i.e. northern Canada, [[Alaska]] and indigenous [[Greenland]]) have built carefully constructed cairns and stone sculptures, called by names such as [[Inuksuk|{{lang|iu|inuksuit|nocat=yes}} and {{lang|iu|inunnguat|nocat=yes}}]], as landmarks and directional markers since [[European colonization of the Americas|before contact with Europeans]]. They are iconic of the region (an {{lang|iu|inuksuk}} even features on the flag of the Canadian far-northeastern territory, [[Nunavut]]), and are increasingly used as a symbol of Canadian national identity. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In North America, cairns are often [[petroform]]s in the shapes of turtles or other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Cairns have been used since [[pre-Columbian]] times throughout what is now [[Latin America]] to mark trails. Even today, in the [[Andes]] of [[South America]], the [[Quechuan]] peoples use cairns as religious shrines to the indigenous [[Inca]] goddess [[Pachamama]]. This is often part of a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] form of [[Roman Catholicism]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Anthropomorphism==
Although the practice is not common in [[Modern English language|English]], cairns are sometimes referred to by their [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities. In [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a cairn is known as {{lang|de|steinmann}} and {{lang|nl|steenman}} respectively, meaning literally "stone man".  A form of the [[Inuit]] {{lang|iu|[[inuksuk]]}} is also meant to represent a human figure, and is called an {{lang|iu|inunguak}} ("imitation of a person"). In Italy, especially the [[Italian Alps]], a cairn is an {{lang|it|ometto}}, or a "small man".
&lt;!--Don't need this yet: {{clear|right}}--&gt;

==Sea cairns==
[[File:Kummel Korpo 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sea mark]] in [[Finland|Finnish]] coastal waters]]
Coastal cairns called [[sea mark]]s are also common in the northern latitudes, and are placed along shores and on islands and islets. Usually painted white for improved offshore visibility, they serve as [[Navigational aid|navigation aid]]s. In [[Sweden]] they are called {{lang|sv|kummel}}, in Norway {{lang|no|varde}}, and are indicated in navigation charts and maintained as part of the nautical marking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://portal.fma.fi/portal/page/portal/589032C37AAC7314E040B40A0A016368 |title=Legend (INT Symbology) |format=PDF |location=[[Helsinki]] |publisher=Finnish Transport Agency and Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi) |work=Merenkulku.fi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126004546/http://portal.fma.fi/portal/page/portal/589032C37AAC7314E040B40A0A016368 |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }} Three-language key to reading Finnish navigation charts.&lt;/ref&gt; Inversely, they are used on land as sea cliff warnings in rugged and hilly terrain in the foggy [[Faroe Islands]].

'''Cuarteron Reef''' (''Huayang Jiao'' 华阳礁 in Chinese; ''Calderon Reef'' in Filipino; ''Terumbu Calderon'' in Malay; ''Bái Châu Viên'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]) is a [[reef]] at the east end of the [[London Reefs]] in the [[Spratly Islands]] of the [[South China Sea]]. It is occupied and controlled by [[China]] (PRC) as part of [[Sansha]], and also claimed by the [[Philippines]] (as part of [[Kalayaan, Palawan]]) and [[Taiwan]] (ROC). The reef is {{convert|3|nmi}} long and has an area of {{convert|8|sqkm}} ({{convert|800|ha}}).&lt;ref name="HancoxPrescott1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. J.

==Geographical features==
On 12 July 2016, the tribunal of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] concluded that Cuarteron Reef contains, within the meaning of Article 121(1) of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Convention]], naturally formed areas of land, surrounded by water, which are above water at high tide. However, for purposes of Article 121(3) of the Convention, the high-tide features at Cuarteron Reef is  rocks that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and accordingly shall be entitled to 12nm of territorial sea measured from its baseline but have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. &lt;ref name=PCA20130712&gt;{{cite web |title=Award |work=PCA Case No 2013-19 |date=12 July 2016 |publisher=Permanent Court of Arbitration |url=https://pca-cpa.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/175/2016/07/PH-CN-20160712-Award.pdf}} p.259&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Four continents|Biblical cosmology|Flat Earth}}
[[File:Earth symbol.svg|thumb|The astronomical symbol of [[Earth]] represents either the four quadrants of the world or the [[four continents]].]]

Several [[cosmology|cosmological]] and mythological systems portray '''four corners of the world''' or '''four quarters of the world''' corresponding approximately to the four [[points of the compass]] (or the two solstices and two equinoxes). At the center may lie a sacred mountain, garden, [[world tree]], or other beginning-point of creation. Often four rivers run to the four corners of the world, and water or irrigate the four quadrants of the Earth.

[[File:Cosmological Diagram. Aluvihara, Sri Lanka 0475.jpg|thumb|Tibetan conception of four rivers dividing the world into quadrants]]
In [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], the Old Testament ({{bibleverse|Genesis|2:8-14|KJV}}) identifies the [[Garden of Eden]], and the four rivers as the [[Tigris]], [[Euphrates]], [[Pishon]], and [[Gihon]]. The Tigris runs to [[Assyria]], the Euphrates to [[Armenia]], the Pishon to [[Havilah]] or [[Elam]], and the Gihon to [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=George&gt;George &amp; George (2014) ''The Mythology of Eden'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian cosmology]], four rivers flowing out of the garden of creation, which is the center of the world, define the four corners of the world.&lt;ref name=George/&gt;  From the point of view of the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], the northern geographical horizon was marked by [[Subartu]], the west by [[Amorites|{{smallcaps|Mar.tu}}]], the east by [[Elam]] and the south by [[Sumer]]; later rulers of all of Mesopotamia, such as [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], claimed among their titles ''{{transl|akk|[[Lugal|LUGAL]] kib-ra-a-ti er-bé-et-tì}}'', "King of the Four Quarters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.binujohn.name/2013/04/14/the-four-quarters-of-the-world/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], the sacred mountain [[Mount Kailash|Kailash]] has four sides, from which four rivers flow to the four quarters of the world (the [[Ganges]], [[Indus]], [[Oxus]] (Amu Darya), and [[Śita River|Śita]] (Tarim)), dividing the world into four quadrants. Another account portrays a celestial mountain, [[Mount Meru]], buttressed by four terrestrial mountain ranges which extend in four directions. Between them lie four sacred lakes, through which the celestial river divides into four earthly rivers, which flow to the four corners and irrigate the four quadrants of the Earth. [[Buddhism]] and the [[Bon religion]] of Tibet have similar accounts.&lt;ref name=George/&gt;

'''GPS Block IIIA''' consists of the first ten (known as "tranche") of [[GPS (satellite)|GPS III satellites]], which will be used to keep the Navstar [[Global Positioning System]] operational. [[Lockheed Martin]] designed, developed and manufactured the GPS III Non-Flight Satellite Testbed (GNST) and all ten Block IIIA satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2013/february/u-s--air-force-awards-lockheed-martin-contract-to-begin-work-on-.html "U.S. Air Force Awards Lockheed Martin Contracts to Begin Work on Next Set of GPS III Satellites"] (Press release) Lockheed Martin 2013-02-25&lt;/ref&gt; The first satellite in the series was projected to launch in 2014,&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2012/may/0531-ss-gpsIII.html "U.S. Air Force Awards Lockheed Martin GPS III Flight Operations Contract"] (Press release) Lockheed Martin 2012-05-31&lt;/ref&gt; but significant delays&lt;ref name="gps_iii_capacitor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gpsworld.com/gps-iii-satellite-delivery-slips-because-of-capacitor/ |title=GPS III satellite delivery slips because of capacitor |work=GPS World |date=September 15, 2016 |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pushed the scheduled launch to December 2018.&lt;ref name="directions_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gleckel-2017-11" /&gt; The tenth and final GPS Block IIIA launch is projected in Q2 2023.&lt;ref name="gleckel-2017-11"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gps.gov/governance/advisory/meetings/2017-11/gleckel.pdf |title=GPS Status &amp; Modernization Program |publisher=U.S. Air Force |website=GPS.gov |last=Gleckel |first=Gerry |date=November 15, 2017 |access-date=December 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eelv_2017-11-07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gao_dec2017"/&gt;

==Overview==
The United States' [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) reached Fully Operational Capability on July 17, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=gpsFaq
 | title = GPS FAQ
 | author = U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center | publisher = U.S. Department of Homeland Security
}}&lt;/ref&gt; completing its original design goals. However, additional advances in technology and new demands on the existing system led to the effort to modernize the GPS system. Announcements from the Vice President and the White House in 1998 initiated these changes.  In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized the effort, referred to as '''GPS III'''.

The project involves new ground stations and new satellites, with additional navigation signals for both civilian and military users, and aims to improve the accuracy and availability for all users.

[[Raytheon]] was awarded the Next Generation GPS Operational Control System (OCX) contract on Feb 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/asd/2010/03/01/12.xml&amp;headline=Raytheon%20Wins%20Next-Gen%20GPS%20Award |title = Raytheon Wins Next-Gen GPS Award |work = Aviation Week |date = 2010-05-01 |publisher = The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Block IIIA satellites use Lockheed Martin's [[A2100]] bus structure. The propellant and pressurant tanks are manufactured by [[Orbital ATK]] from lightweight, high-strength composite materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/contracts/100412-lockheed-orders-gps-satellite-buses.html "Lockheed Orders GPS 3A Satellite Buses from ATK"]&lt;/ref&gt; Each satellite will carry 8 deployable JIB antennas designed and manufactured by [http://www.northropgrumman.com/AstroAerospace Northrop Grumman Astro Aerospace]&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.northropgrumman.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=112386&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1908334&amp;highlight= "Northrop Grumman's Astro Aerospace Delivers Antennas For Next-Generation GPS III Satellites 3 through 6"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first GPS III satellite was originally scheduled for launch in 2014,&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt; but in December 2016 the Director of the U.S. Air Force's Global Positioning Systems Directorate announced the first satellite will launch in the spring of 2018.&lt;ref name="directions_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gpsworld.com/2016-in-review-gps-navigates-the-future/ |title=Directions 2017: GPS navigates the future |last=Whitney |first=Steven |publisher=North Coast Media LLC |website=GPS World |date=December 2, 2016 |access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, the US General Accounting Office stated "Technical issues with both the GPS III satellite and the OCX Block 0 launch control and checkout system have combined to place the planned March 2018 launch date for the first GPS III satellite at risk."&lt;ref name="gao_assessment_mar_2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/683838.pdf |title="Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs" |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=March 2017 |publisher=US General Accounting Office |access-date=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delays have been caused by a number of factors, primarily due to issues found in the navigation payload.&lt;ref name="gps_iii_capacitor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/us-air-force-not-happy-with-delays-on-lockheed-gps-satellite/articleshow/35465485.cms&lt;/ref&gt; Further launch date slippages were caused by the need to complete qualification testing and validation of the new SpaceX [[Falcon 9]] rocket modification that is planned to deliver the first GPS III satellite to its orbit. As of August 2018, this launch is scheduled for December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-10/gps-satellite-praised-by-pence-for-space-force-delayed-yet-again |title=The GPS Satellite Praised by Mike Pence for Space Force Is Delayed Yet Again |publisher=Bloomberg |date=August 10, 2018 |access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future Block III variants are planned to incorporate additional capabilities. They include [[Distress Alerting Satellite System]] (DASS) capabilities for search and rescue, as well as satellite crosslinks for rapid command and reduced age of data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/space/&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2016, [[Space Exploration Technologies Corp.]] (SpaceX), in Hawthorne, California was awarded an $82,700,000 firm-fixed-price contract for launch services to deliver a GPS III satellite to its intended orbit. This launch service contract will include launch vehicle production, mission integration, and launch operations for a GPS III mission. The locations of performance are Hawthorne, California; Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida and McGregor, Texas. The work is expected to be completed by July 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract-View/Article/744434&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the U.S. Air Force exercised a $395 million contract option with Lockheed Martin for the ninth and tenth Block IIIA space vehicles, expected to be available for launch by 2022.&lt;ref name=spacenews-20160921 /&gt;

== New navigation signals ==
{{main|GPS signals}}

=== Civilian L2 (L2C) ===

One of the first announcements was the addition of a new civilian-use signal to be transmitted on a frequency other than the L1 frequency used for the existing GPS [[GPS signals#Legacy GPS signals|Coarse Acquisition]] (C/A) signal. Ultimately, this became known as the L2C signal because it is broadcast on the L2 frequency (1227.6&amp;nbsp;MHz). It can be transmitted by all block IIR-M and later design satellites.  The original plan stated that until the new OCX (Block 1) system is in place, the signal would consist of a default message ("Type 0") that contains no navigational data.&lt;ref name="ocx"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/civilsignals/#L2C | title = New Civil Signals: Second Civil Signal | publisher =  National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing | date = 2016-09-23 | accessdate = 2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; OCX Block 1 with the L2C navigation data was scheduled to enter service in February 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/control/#OCX | title = Control Segment: Next Generation Operational Control System | publisher =  National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing | date = 2013-09-26 | accessdate = 2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kolibaba2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.stanford.edu/group/scpnt/pnt/PNT12/2012_presentation_files/15-Kolibaba_presentation.pdf | title = GPS OCX Program Status | first = Ray | last = Kolibaba | work = Stanford 2012 PNT Challenges and Opportunities Symposium | date = 2012-11-14 | accessdate = 2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been delayed until 2022 or later.&lt;ref name="gps_ocx_primary_delay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/5252 |title=GAO: New GPS Ground System, Not GPS III Engineering, Primary Cause for Delays |work=Inside GNSS |date=November 30, 2016 |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of OCX delays, the L2C signal was decoupled from the OCX deployment schedule. All satellites capable of transmitting the L2C signal (all GPS satellites launched since 2005&lt;ref name="ocx" /&gt;) began broadcasting pre-operational civil navigation (CNAV) messages in April 2014, and in December 2014 the Air Force started transmitting CNAV uploads on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="ocx" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gpsworld.com/l2c-and-next-generation-smart-pnt-receivers/ |title=L2C and Next-Generation Smart PNT Receivers |last=Jewell |first=Don |publisher=GPS World |date=August 12, 2015 |accessdate=December 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The L2C signal will be considered fully operational after it is being broadcast by at least 24 space vehicles, currently projected to happen in 2021.&lt;ref name="ocx"/&gt; As of October 2017, L2C was being broadcast from 19 satellites.&lt;ref name="ocx" /&gt;

The L2C signal is tasked with providing improved accuracy of navigation, providing an easy-to-track signal, and acting as a redundant signal in case of localized interference.

The immediate effect of having two civilian frequencies being transmitted from one satellite is the ability to directly measure, and therefore remove, the [[ionospheric delay]] error for that satellite. Without such a measurement, a GPS receiver must use a generic model or receive ionospheric corrections from another source (such as a [[Satellite Based Augmentation System]]). Advances in technology for both the GPS satellites and the GPS receivers have made ionospheric delay the largest source of error in the C/A signal. A receiver capable of performing this measurement is referred to as a dual frequency receiver. The technical characteristics of it are:

* L2C contains two distinct PRN sequences:
** CM (for Civilian Moderate length code) is 10,230 bits in length, repeating every 20 [[millisecond]]s.
** CL (for Civilian Long length code) is 767,250 bits, repeating every 1,500 [[millisecond]]s (i.e., every 1.5 s).
** Each signal is transmitted at 511,500 bits per second ([[bit/s]]); however, they are [[multiplexed]] to form a 1,023,000 bit/s signal.
* CM is [[modulated]] with a 25 bit/s navigation message with [[forward error correction]], whereas CL contains no additional modulated data.
* The long, non-data CL sequence provides for approximately 24 [[Decibel|dB]] greater correlation protection (~250 times stronger) than L1 C/A.
* L2C signal characteristics provide 2.7&amp;nbsp;dB greater data recovery and 0.7&amp;nbsp;dB greater carrier tracking than L1 C/A.
* The L2C signals' transmission power is 2.3&amp;nbsp;dB weaker than the L1 C/A signal.
* In a single frequency application, L2C has 65% more ionospheric error than L1.

It is defined in IS-GPS-200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Military (M-code) ===

A major component of the modernization process, a new military signal called M-code was designed to further improve the anti-jamming and secure access of the military GPS signals. The M-code is transmitted in the same L1 and L2 frequencies already in use by the previous military code, the P(Y) code. The new signal is shaped to place most of its energy at the edges (away from the existing P(Y) and C/A carriers).

Unlike the P(Y) code, the M-code is designed to be autonomous, meaning that users can calculate their positions using only the M-code signal. P(Y) code receivers must typically first lock onto the C/A code and then transfer to lock onto the P(Y)-code.

In a major departure from previous GPS designs, the M-code is intended to be broadcast from a high-gain [[directional antenna]], in addition to a wide angle (full Earth) antenna. The directional antenna's signal, termed a ''[[spot beam]]'', is intended to be aimed at a specific region (i.e., several hundred kilometers in diameter) and increase the local signal strength by 20&amp;nbsp;dB (10× voltage field strength, 100× power). A side effect of having two antennas is that, for receivers inside the spot beam, the GPS satellite will appear to be two GPS satellites occupying the same position.

While the full-Earth M-code signal is available on the Block IIR-M satellites, the spot beam antennas will not be available until the Block III satellites are deployed. Like the other new GPS signals, M-code is dependent on OCX—specifically Block 2—which was scheduled to enter service in October 2016,&lt;ref name="kolibaba2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inside201301"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.insidegnss.com/node/3377 | title = More Than Money Worries: OCX and the New Civil Signals | first = Dee Ann | last = Divis | work = [[Inside GNSS]] |date=January–February 2013 | accessdate = 2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which has been delayed until 2022,&lt;ref name="ocx_rebaseline_20170731"/&gt; and that initial date did not reflect the two year first satellite launch delay expected by the GAO.&lt;ref name="did04900"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/the-usas-gps-iii-satellites-04900/ |title = Future GPS: The USA’s GPS-III Programs | work =  Defense Industry Daily | date = May 14, 2014 | accessdate = May 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GAO-13-294SP"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-294SP | title = Defense Acquisitions: Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs | work = Report Number GAO-13-294SP | publisher = U.S. Government Accountability Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other M-code characteristics are:
* Satellites will transmit two distinct signals from two antennas: one for whole Earth coverage, one in a spot beam.
* [[Binary offset carrier modulation]]
* Occupies 24 [[MHz]] of bandwidth
* It uses a new MNAV navigational message, which is packetized instead of framed, allowing for flexible data payloads
* There are four effective data channels; different data can be sent on each frequency and on each antenna.
* It can include [[Forward error correction|FEC]] and error detection
* The spot beam is ~20&amp;nbsp;dB more powerful than the whole Earth coverage beam
* M-code signal at Earth's surface: –158 [[dBW]] for whole Earth antenna, –138 dBW for spot beam antennas.

=== Safety of Life (L5) ===

Safety of Life is a civilian-use signal, broadcast on the L5 frequency (1176.45&amp;nbsp;MHz). In 2009, a WAAS satellite sent the initial L5 signal test transmissions.  [[USA-213|SVN-62]], the first GPS block IIF satellite, continuously broadcast the L5 signal starting on June 28, 2010.

As a result of schedule delays to the GPS III control segment, the L5 signal was decoupled from the OCX deployment schedule. All satellites capable of transmitting the L5 signal (all GPS satellites launched since May 2010&lt;ref name="gps_l5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/civilsignals/#L5 |title=Civil Signals - Third Civil Signal: L5 |publisher=GPS.gov |date=September 23, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) began broadcasting pre-operational civil navigation (CNAV) messages in April 2014, and in December 2014 the Air Force started transmitting CNAV uploads on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.defense.gov/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=16666 |title=DOD Announces Start of Civil Navigation Message Broadcasting |publisher=U.S. Department of Defense |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The L5 signal will be considered fully operational once at least 24 space vehicles are broadcasting the signal, currently projected to happen in 2024.&lt;ref name="gps_l5" /&gt; As of April 18, 2017, L5 was being broadcast from 12 satellites.&lt;ref name="gps_l5" /&gt;

* Improves signal structure for enhanced performance
* Higher transmission power than L1 or L2C signal (~3&amp;nbsp;dB, or twice as powerful)
* Wider bandwidth, yielding a 10-times processing gain
* Longer spreading codes (10 times longer than used on the C/A code)
* Located in the [[Aeronautical Radionavigation Services]] band, a frequency band that is available worldwide.

WRC-2000 added space signal component to this aeronautical band so the aviation community can manage interference to L5 more effectively than L2. It is defined in IS-GPS-705.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Civilian L1 (L1C) ===

L1C is a civilian-use signal, to be broadcast on the same L1 frequency (1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz) that contains the C/A signal used by all current GPS users.

L1C broadcasting will start when GPS III Control Segment (OCX) Block 1 becomes operational, currently scheduled for 2022.&lt;ref name="gps_ocx_primary_delay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="directions_2017" /&gt; The L1C signal will reach full operational status when being broadcast from at least 24 GPS Block III satellites, currently projected for the late 2020s.&lt;ref name="gps_l1c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/civilsignals/#L1C |title=Civil Signals - Fourth Civil Signal: L1C |publisher=GPS.gov |date=September 23, 2016 |accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Implementation will provide C/A code to ensure backward compatibility
* Assured of 1.5&amp;nbsp;dB increase in minimum C/A code power to mitigate any noise floor increase
* Non-data signal component contains a [[Pilot signal|pilot carrier]] to improve tracking
* Enables greater civil interoperability with [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] L1

It is defined in IS-GPS-800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/IS-GPS-800D.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improvements ==

Increased signal power at the Earth's surface
* M-code: −158 dBW / −138 dBW.
* L1 and L2: −157 dBW for the C/A code signal and −160 dBW for the P(Y) code signal.
* L5 will be −154 dBW.

Researchers from [[The Aerospace Corporation]] confirmed that the most efficient means to generate the high-power M-code signal would entail a departure from full-Earth coverage, characteristic of all the user downlink signals up until that point. Instead, a high-gain antenna would be used to produce a directional spot beam several hundred kilometers in diameter. Originally, this proposal was considered as a retrofit to the planned Block IIF satellites. Upon closer inspection, program managers realized that the addition of a large deployable antenna, combined with the changes that would be needed in the operational control segment, presented too great a challenge for the existing system design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*NASA has requested that Block III satellites carry laser [[Retroreflector|retro-reflectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/retromtg_060406.pdf |title=ILRS Meeting on Retroreflector Arrays}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows tracking the orbits of the satellites independent of the radio signals, which allows satellite clock errors to be disentangled from [[ephemeris]] errors.  This, a standard feature of [[GLONASS]], will be included in the [[Galileo positioning system]], and was included as an experiment on two older GPS satellites (satellites 35 and 36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/retromtg_060406_slides.pdf |title=Slides from ILRS Meeting on Retroreflector Arrays |date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control Segment ==

The GPS Operational Control Segment (OCS),&lt;ref name="gps_ocs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losangeles.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Article/343722/gps-operational-control-segment |title=GPS Operational Control Segment |work=U.S. Air Force |date=November 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a worldwide network of satellite operations centers, ground antennas and monitoring stations, provides Command and Control (C2) capabilities for GPS Block II satellites. The latest update to the GPS OCS, Commercial Off-The-Shelf Upgrade #2 (CUP2), was completed on December 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/digital-battlespace/lockheed-martin-upgrades-us-gps-system/ |title=GPS constellation has upgraded control system |work=Shephard Media |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Next-Generation Operational Control Segment (OCX) ===
In 2010, the United States Air Force announced plans to develop a modern control segment, a critical part of the GPS modernization initiative. OCS will continue to serve as the ground control system of record until the new system, Next Generation GPS Operational Control System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18676 |title=GPS ADVANCED CONTROL SEGMENT(OCX) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503181621/http://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18676 |archivedate=2012-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (OCX), is fully developed and functional.

OCX features are being delivered to the United States Air Force in three separate phases, known as "blocks."&lt;ref name="gps_control"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/control/ |title=GPS Control Segment |work=GPS.gov |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCX blocks are numbered zero through two. With each block delivered, OCX gains additional functionality.

In June 2016, the U.S. Air Force formally notified Congress the OCX program's projected program costs had risen above $4.25 billion, thus exceeding baseline cost estimates of $3.4 billion by 25%, also known as a critical [[Nunn-McCurdy]] breach. Factors leading to the breach include "inadequate systems engineering at program inception", and "the complexity of cybersecurity requirements on OCX."&lt;ref&gt;http://spacenews.com/air-force-declares-nunn-mccurdy-breach-on-gps-ground-system/&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, the Department of Defense formally certified the program, a necessary step to allow development to continue after a critical breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/articles/raytheons-ocx-offering-survives-nunn-mccurdy-breach |title=

==== OCX Block 0 (Launch and Checkout System) ====

OCX Block 0 provides the minimum subset of full OCX capabilities necessary to support launch and early on-orbit spacecraft bus checkout on GPS III space vehicles.&lt;ref name="directions_2017" /&gt;

Block 0 completed two cybersecurity testing events in April and May 2018 with no new vulnerabilities found.&lt;ref name="gps_status_20180926"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gps.gov/cgsic/meetings/2018/schaub.pdf |title=GPS Status and Modernization Progress: Service, Satellites, Control Segment, and Military GPS User Equipment |publisher=US Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center |date=September 26, 2018 |access-date=November 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Block 0 had its third successful integrated launch rehearsal with GPS III.&lt;ref name="gps_status_20180926" /&gt;

The U.S. Air Force accepted the delivery of OCX Block 0 in November 2017, and is using it to prepare for the first GPS launch in 2018.&lt;ref name="ocx_block_zero_acceptance" /&gt;

==== OCX Block 1 (Civilian GPS III features) ====

OCX Block 1 is an upgrade to OCX Block 0, at which time the OCX system achieves Initial Operating Capability (IOC). Once Block 1 is deployed, OCX will for the first time be able to command and control both Block II and Block III GPS satellites, as well support the ability to begin broadcasting the civilian L1C signal.&lt;ref name="directions_2017" /&gt;

In November 2016, the GAO reported that OCX Block 1 had become the primary cause for delay in activating the GPS III PNT mission.&lt;ref name="gps_ocx_primary delay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/5252 |title=GAO: New GPS Ground System, Not GPS III Engineering, Primary Cause for Delays |last=Divis |first=Dee Ann |publisher=Gibbons Media &amp; Research LLC |website=InsideGNSS |date=November 30, 2016 |access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Block 1 completed the final iteration of Critical Design Review (CDR) in September 2018.&lt;ref name="gps_status_20180926" /&gt; Software development on Block 1 is scheduled to complete in Q2 2019, after which the Block 1 software will undergo 2.5 years of system testing.&lt;ref name="gps_status_20180926" /&gt;

==== OCX Block 2 (Military GPS III features, Civilian Signal Monitoring) ====

OCX Block 2 upgrades OCX with the advanced M-code features for military users and the ability to monitor performance of the civilian signals.&lt;ref name="gps_control" /&gt; In March 2017, the contractor rephased its OCX delivery schedule so that Block 2 will now be delivered to the Air Force concurrently with Block 1.&lt;ref name="ocx_rebaseline_20170427"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidegnss.com/node/5449|title=OCX Passes Deep Dive Review; GAO Says Program Risk Remains High|publisher=InsideGNSS.com|date=April 27, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2017|last=Divis|first=Dee Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, an additional nine months delay to the schedule was announced. According to the July 2017 program schedule, OCX will be delivered to the Air Force in April 2022.&lt;ref name="ocx_rebaseline_20170731"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/5573 |title=OCX Delayed Again as Development Jumps to $6 Billion |publisher=Gibbons Media &amp; Research LLC |website=InsideGNSS.com |date=July 31, 2017 |accessdate=August 15, 2017 |last=Divis |first=Dee Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contingency Operations ===

GPS III Contingency Operations ("COps") is an update to the GPS Operational Control Segment, allowing OCS to provide Block IIF Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) features from GPS III satellites.&lt;ref name="directions_2017" /&gt;  The Contingency Operations effort enables GPS III satellites to participate in the GPS constellation, albeit in a limited fashion, without having to wait until OCX Block 1 becomes operational (currently scheduled for 2022).

The United States Air Force awarded the 96 million dollar Contingency Operations contract in February 2016.&lt;ref name="weapons_tester_warning_cops"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/2016/03/03/weapons-tester-warns-risk-air-forces-gps-contingency-plan/81260248/ |title=Weapons Tester Warns of Risk to Air Force’s GPS Contingency Plan |work=Defense News |last=Seligman |first=Lara |date=March 3, 2016 |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, software development had been complete, and component integration test was scheduled to complete in October 2018.&lt;ref name="gps_status_20180926" /&gt; Operational acceptance testing is scheduled for January 2020.&lt;ref name="gps_status_20180926" /&gt;

The basin provides the only source of [[fresh water]] through much of inland Australia.&lt;ref name=fresh&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Spanevello|first=M. D. |title=The phylogeny of prokaryotes associated with Australia's Great Artesian Basin|type=Ph.D.|chapter= |url=http://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/5daeafb1-3029-96de-12cd-2a83e20a19b4/1/02Whole.pdf|author= |date=November 2001|publisher=[[Griffith University]]|accessdate=20 September 2014|docket= |oclc= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basin underlies 22% of the continent,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/national/great-artesian-basin&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]] of [[Queensland]] (most of), the [[Northern Territory]] (the south-east corner of), [[South Australia]] (the north-east part of), and [[New South Wales]] (northern part of). The basin is {{convert|3000|m}} deep in places and is estimated to contain {{convert|64900|km3}} of [[groundwater]].&lt;ref name="fs"/&gt; The Great Artesian Basin Coordinating Committee (GABCC)&lt;ref name=GABCC&gt;[http://www.gabcc.org.au/index.aspx  GABCC website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207075858/http://www.gabcc.org.au/index.aspx |date=7 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; coordinates activity between the various levels of government and community organisations.

==Physiography==
This area is one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger [[East Australian Basins]] division, and includes the smaller [[Wilcannia Threshold]] physiographic section.

===Geology===
The water of the GAB is held in a sandstone layer laid down by continental erosion of higher ground during the [[Triassic]], [[Jurassic]], and early [[Cretaceous]] periods. During a time when much of what is now inland Australia was below [[sea level]], the sandstone was then covered by a layer of marine sedimentary rock shortly afterward, which formed a confining layer, thus trapping water in the sandstone aquifer. The eastern edge of the basin was [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] when the [[Great Dividing Range]] formed. The other side was created from the [[landform]]s of the [[Central Eastern Lowlands]] and the [[Great Western Plateau]] to the west.

Most recharge water enters the rock formations from relatively high ground near the eastern edge of the basin (in Queensland and New South Wales) and very gradually flows toward the south and west.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gabcc.org.au/tools/getFile.aspx?tbl=tblContentItem&amp;id=96 page 40  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204111235/http://www.gabcc.org.au/tools/getFile.aspx?tbl=tblContentItem&amp;id=96 |date=4 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A much smaller amount enters along the western margin in arid central Australia, flowing to the south and east. Because the sandstones are permeable, water gradually makes its way through the pores between the [[sand]] grains, flowing at a rate of one to five metres per year.

Discharge water eventually exits through a number of [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], mostly in the southern part of the basin. The age of the groundwater determined by carbon-14 and chlorine-36 measurements combined with hydraulic modelling ranges from several thousand years for the recharge areas in the north to nearly 2&amp;nbsp;million years in the south-western discharge zones.&lt;ref name=Mudd&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mudd |first1=G.M.|date=March 2000 |title=Mound springs of the Great Artesian Basin in  South Australia:a case study from Olympic Dam |journal=Environmental Geology |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages= |publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/2nf4ncwxrgeyvcep/|doi=10.1007/s002540050452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water source===
Prior to European occupation, waters of the GAB discharged through mound springs, many in arid South Australia. These springs supported a variety of endemic invertebrates (molluscs, for example), and supported extensive Aboriginal communities and trade routes.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, Colin (2002). [http://www.icomos.org/australia/Tracks/02%20Harris,%20Mound%20Springs.doc Culture and geography: South Australia’s mound springs as trade and communication routes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116034933/http://www.icomos.org/australia/Tracks/02%20Harris%2C%20Mound%20Springs.doc |date=16 November 2005 }}, ''[[Historic Environment]]'', 16 (2), 8-11. {{issn|0726-6715}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrival of Europeans, they enabled early exploration and faster communications between southeastern Australia and Europe via the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; The Great Artesian Basin became an important water supply for [[cattle station]]s, [[irrigation]], and [[livestock]] and domestic usage, and is a vital life line for rural Australia.&lt;ref name="herqldout"/&gt; To tap it, [[water well]]s are drilled down to a suitable rock layer, where the pressure of the water forces it up, mostly without [[pump]]ing.

The discovery and use of water held underground in the Great Artesian Basin opened up thousands of square miles of country away from rivers in inland New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia, previously unavailable for pastoral activities. European discovery of the basin dates from 1878 when a shallow bore near [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]] produced flowing water.  There were similar discoveries in 1886 at Back Creek east of [[Barcaldine, Queensland|Barcaldine]], and in 1887 near [[Cunnamulla, Queensland|Cunnamulla]].&lt;ref name="herqldout"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage Trails of the Queensland Outback |last=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland)]] |year=2002 |publisher=State of Queensland |isbn=0-7345-1040-3 |pages=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicol"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicol |first=Sally |year=2005 |url=http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/water/gab/cd_rom/track1.html |title=The  Great Artesian Basin: past, present and future |work=Water management |publisher=The State of Queensland (Department of Natural Resources and Water) |accessdate=2 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315203025/http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/water/gab/cd_rom/track1.html |archivedate=15 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, water extraction from the GAB is a mining operation, with recharge much less than current extraction rates. In 1915, there were 1,500 bores providing {{convert|2000|Ml|acre.ft|lk=out}} of water per day, but today the total output has dropped to {{convert|1500|Ml|acre.ft}} per day.&lt;ref name="fs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/factsheets/pdf/water/w68.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923113138/http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/factsheets/pdf/water/w68.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 September 2010 |title=Underground water factsheets: Great Artesian Basin |accessdate=30 September 2010 |publisher=Department of Environment and Resource Management }}&lt;/ref&gt; This included just under 2000 freely flowing bores and more than 9000 that required [[Mechanical advantage|mechanical power]] to bring water to the surface. Many bores are unregulated or abandoned, resulting in considerable water wastage. These problems have existed for many decades, and in January 2007 the Australian Commonwealth Government announced additional funding in an attempt to bring them under control. However, many of the mound springs referred to above have dried up due to a drop in water pressure, probably resulting in extinction of several invertebrate species.&lt;ref&gt;Ponder,

The [[Olympic Dam mine]] in South Australia is permitted to extract up to 42 million litres of water daily from the Great Artesian Basin under the ''Roxby Downs (Indenture Ratification) Act 1982''. The underground copper and uranium mine commenced operations in 1988 and is expected to continue operating until approximately 2060.

In addition, the basin has provided water via a {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep bore for a [[geothermal power]] station at [[Birdsville, Queensland|Birdsville]]. The heated water is 98&amp;nbsp;°C (208&amp;nbsp;°F) and provides 25% of the town's needs. [[Ergon (Australia)|Ergon Energy]] is expanding the 80&amp;nbsp;kW plant to completely meet Birdsville's electricity requirements.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Whole of Basin management==
As the Great Artesian Basin underlies parts of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory, which each operate under different legislative frameworks, policies and resource management approaches, a coordinated "whole-of-Basin" approach to the management of this important natural resource is required.{{according to whom|date=February 2016}} The Great Artesian Basin Coordinating Committee (GABCC) provides advice from community organisations and agencies to State, Territory and Australian Government Ministers on efficient, effective and sustainable whole-of-Basin resource management and to coordinate activity between stakeholders.&lt;ref name=GABCC/&gt;

Membership of the Committee comprises all State, Territory, and Australian Government agencies with responsibilities for management of parts of the Great Artesian Basin, community representatives nominated by agencies; and sector representatives.&lt;ref name=GABCC/&gt;

== Environmental concerns ==
There is a strong debate surrounding [[Coalbed methane|coal seam gas]] (CSG) drilling and hydraulic fracturing.{{when?|date=October 2018}} 

In 2011, [[ABC1|ABC TV]]'s public affairs program ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' revealed that significant concerns were being expressed about depletion and chemical damage to the Basin as a result of [[coal seam gas]] extraction. In one incident, reported in the program, the [[Queensland Gas Company]] (QGC) ''[[Hydraulic fracturing|fracked]]'' its Myrtle 3 well connecting the Springbok aquifer to the coal seam below (the Walloon Coal Measures) in 2009. A local farmer was concerned that the process may have released {{convert|130|l}} of a potentially toxic chemical into the Basin. QGC admitted the incident, but "did not alert  authorities or nearby water users about the problem until thirteen months after the incident."&lt;ref name="abc.net.au-2011-02-21/farmers-count1951670"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=Farmers count cost of coal seam gas rush |newspaper=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=21 February 2011 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-21/farmers-count-cost-of-coal-seam-gas-rush/1951670 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety data sheet QGC had submitted for the hydraulic fracturing chemical was derived from the United States, incomplete and ten years out of date.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au-2011-02-21/farmers-count1951670" /&gt; Over thirty chemicals may be used in the process of hydraulic fracturing and their long-term impact on aquifers and the agriculture and people supported by them is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tozer, Joel|author2=Cubby, Ben|title=List reveals toxic chemicals used in coal  seam mining|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 October 2010|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/list-reveals-toxic-chemicals-used-in-coal-seam-mining-20101018-16qt5.html|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, there have been no proven instances of drilling or hydraulic injection affecting drinking water, bore quality or making ingress into the Artesian Basin. Australia's Oil and Gas operators provide independently verified water quality monitoring bores throughout their operating range&lt;ref name="https://www.agl.com.au/waterportal"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=AGL water portal |newspaper=[AGL] |location=Australia |date= February 2017 |url=https://www.agl.com.au/waterportal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IESC has provided a peer reviewed report on fracking and CSG drilling in Australia ''[[IESC Report]]''.&lt;ref name="https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/de709bdd-95a0-4459-a8ce-8ed3cb72d44a/files/background-review-hydraulic-fracturing_0.pdf"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=Background Review on hydraulic facturing techniques, including reporting requirements and governance arrangements |newspaper=[IESC] |location=Australia |date= June 2014 |url=https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/de709bdd-95a0-4459-a8ce-8ed3cb72d44a/files/background-review-hydraulic-fracturing_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; BTEX chemicals (benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylene) in fracking fluids are banned in both Queensland and New South Wales, which together have all of Australia's CSG reserves.&lt;ref name="SBS Factbox CSG Australia"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=SBS Factbox CSG Australia |newspaper=[[SBS World News]] |location=Australia |date=12 March 2013 |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/03/12/factbox-csg-australia |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor '''Aage Gudmund Hatt''' (1 October 1884 – 27 January 1960) was a [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[Cultural geography|cultural geographer]]. He was a professor of cultural geography at the [[University of Copenhagen]] from 1929 through 1947.&lt;ref name="geopoliticsandtrial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geography.dur.ac.uk/conf/criticalgeopolitics2008/ConferenceTimetable/AbstractsforOpenSessions/HenrikGutzonLarsen/tabid/2880/Default.aspx|title=‘As a political geographer - and as a Dane’: the geopolitics and trial of Gudmund Hatt|last=Larsen|first=Henrik Gutzon|work=geography.dur.ac.uk|publisher=Durham University, Department of Geography|accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also an [[Ethnology|ethnologist]], he was the first person to systematically inventory cultural similarities and differences amongst northern peoples.&lt;ref name="Cunliffe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunliffe|first1=Barry|last2=Davies|first2=Wendy |last3=Renfrew|first3=Colin |title=Archaeology: the widening debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkhgPgH330YC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=Gudmund+Hatt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wnVKTNWfK5KksQPisPlI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Gudmund%20Hatt&amp;f=false|series=British Academy Centenary Monographs|year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-726255-4|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Hatt was born in [[Vildbjerg]] - before 2007 in [[Trehøje Municipality]], from 2007 in [[Herning Municipality]] - Denmark, and studied there through 1904. His father was the local teacher. In 1905, he went to the United States and lived among the [[Cherokee]] Indians in [[Oklahoma]] for a year, which led him to study ethnography at [[Harvard University]] from 1906 to 1907.&lt;ref name="Mahler"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nordligeverdener.natmus.dk/uploads/media/Skin_Clothing_From_The_North_01.pdf |title=Two Hatts and the Article Skin Clothing |last=Mahler |first=Ditlev L. |year=2010 |work=Skin Clothing from the North: Abstracts from the Seminar at the National Museum of Denmark November 26–27, 2009 |page=14 |accessdate=24 July 2010 |location=Copenhagen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Returned to Denmark, he lectured on [[Native Americans in the United States]] and their former way of living, and began his studies under [[Hans Peder Steensby]], ethnographer and professor of geography at the [[University of Copenhagen]].

In 1911, he married the painter and ethnographer [[Emilie Demant Hatt|Emilie Demant]], who had developed a keen interest in [[Sami people]].&lt;ref name="Harvard "&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvard College (1780- ). Class of 1910|first=|title=Secretary's third report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycknAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=Emilie+Demant+Hatt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UOVHTJPpDJKisQOyt5SoCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Emilie%20Demant%20Hatt&amp;f=false|edition=Digitized Jun 4, 2008|year=1910|publisher=Crimson Printing Co.|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he began doctoral studies of Arctic people, including an ethnographic study of [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]]. For two years, between 1912-1914, Hatt and Demant visited northern [[Sweden]] several times, collecting ethnographic materials for the [[National Museum of Denmark]].&lt;ref name="Mahler" /&gt; This research formed the basis for his 1914 doctoral thesis, ''Arctic skin clothing in Eurasia and America'' when he noticed the cut in the clothing of Arctic peoples was based on whether they fished marine life or hunted in loose snow. From this, he theorized that two cultures developed in the [[Arctic]], one that was land-locked and another that was coastal. In 1914, while a fellow of [[The American-Scandinavian Foundation]], he studied at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="TheAmerScand"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Henry Goddard Leach|title=The American-Scandinavian review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=do19AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA41&amp;dq=Emilie+Demant+Hatt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YXVMTMKWBIvEsAPp68BI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Emilie%20Demant%20Hatt&amp;f=false|edition=Digitized Oct 1, 2008|volume=2|year=1914|publisher=American-Scandinavian Foundation|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1919, Hatt was hired to be the inspector at the National Museum of Denmark's Ethnography Department, and he remained at this civil service post for ten years. This position gave him the opportunity to participate in archaeological research at numerous settlement sites in central and western [[Jutland]]. Here, he was among the first in Danish archaeology who recognized that the ancient houses were not destroyed by fire which he recognized after excavating the areas between the houses, and not just the individual house sites, which was previously the custom.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Niels|year=1960|title=Gudmund Hatt. 31. oktober 1884—27. januar 1960|journal=[[Danish Journal of Geography|Geografisk Tidsskrift]]|volume=59|url=http://www.tidsskrift.dk/visning.jsp?markup=&amp;print=no&amp;id=69322|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922-23, he led an archaeological expedition to the [[Virgin Islands]] and [[Santo Domingo]] in the [[Caribbean]]. From 1923, Hatt was a lecturer in cultural geography at the University of Copenhagen, becoming a full professor in 1929.

Hatt became a public figure in the late 1930s through the early 1940s with his geopolitical analyses that communicated through radio, newspaper, books and journal articles. During the [[World War II]] [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[occupation of Denmark]], Hatt joined the Danish-German reconciliation, possibly because he saw Germany as a natural and inevitable bulwark against Russian communism. After Denmark's liberation, Hatt was brought before an official court, was found to be engaged in ‘dishonourable national conduct’ during the German occupation, and was dismissed from his university chair, albeit with full pension. He became professionally more isolated, however, Hatt continued to publish more of his work in archeology.&lt;ref name="geopoliticsandtrial" /&gt; His last research was on the Danish [[Iron Age]] settlement in [[Fjand]].&lt;ref name="Nielsen" /&gt;

[[File:Zealandia-Continent map en.svg|thumb|350px|right|Map of the Zealandia continent]]
The '''Hikurangi Trench''', also called the '''Hikurangi Trough''', is an [[oceanic trench]] in the bed of the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the east coast of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand, lying between the southern end of the [[Cook Strait]] and the [[Chatham Rise]]. It is the southward continuation of the much deeper [[Kermadec Trench]]. It lies in the [[Hikurangi Margin]] [[subduction]] zone, which is the southern extension of the [[Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone]]. The Hikurangi Margin is the subduction zone where the thick oceanic [[Hikurangi Plateau]] is subducting beneath [[continental crust]] of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]. By contrast, the Kermadec and [[Tonga trench]]es represent the parts of the subduction zone where [[oceanic crust]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] is subducting beneath oceanic crust of the Indo-Australian Plate.

Although shallower than the trenches north of it, the Hikurangi Trench reaches depths of 3,000 metres as close as 80 kilometres from shore. Its maximum depth is about {{convert|3750|m|ft|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Keith B. Lewis, Jean-Yves Collott and Serge E. Lallemand (1998). [http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_57-58/010024805.pdf The dammed Hikurangi Trough: a channel-fed trench blocked by subducting seamounts and their wake avalanches (New Zealand-France GeodyNZ Project)], ''Basin Research'' 10, 441-468.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the southern end of the trench, off the coast of the [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]] region, the seabed rises sharply, and because of the prevailing winds and tides in this area, many deep water species are found close to the shore. This food source attracts the [[whales]] for which the town of [[Kaikoura]] is famous.

The plate boundary continues inland along the [[Marlborough Fault System]], linking through to the [[Alpine Fault]]. Here the plates converge much more obliquely, exhibiting [[transpression]] instead of subduction.

[[Image:Danewerk.jpg|thumb|200px|Hærvejen crossing the [[Danevirke|Dannevirke]]]]
'''Hærvejen''' ([[Danish language|Danish]], literally: ''the army road'', {{lang-de|link=no|Ochsenweg}}, literally: ''[[oxen]] way'', {{lang-nds|Ossenpadd}}, literally: oxen path), sometimes referred to in English as the '''Ox Road''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tiQsAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=H%C3%A6rvejen+%22army+road%22&amp;dq=H%C3%A6rvejen+%22army+road%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yeeYUuSpOfTy7Abjw4CgCQ&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ ''Discovering Archaeology in Denmark''] by James Dyer (1972). Retrieved 29 Nov 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to an [[ancient trackway]] in Denmark and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. The route runs from [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] via [[Flensburg]] to [[Hamburg]], the territory of which it entered at Ochsenzoll ("oxen toll", "toll" in the meaning of "customs") and where it connected with other roads. It has been known by several other names throughout history, most importantly "the Cattle Road" (''Studevejen'') and "the Oxen Road" or "Ox Road" (''Oksevejen'' / ''Ochsenweg'').

== History ==
[[Image:Povlsbro east 20040424.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Povl's Bridge from 1744]]
The road runs more or less along the [[drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[Jutland]] Peninsula, known as the ''Jyske Højderyg'' (Jutland Ridge), similar to the [[ridgeway (track)|ridgeway]]s in England. By using this route one could avoid rivers, or ford them close to their origins where they were still shallow. As time went by this route was improved with paved fords, embankments and bridges. Concentrations of mounds, defensive ditches, settlements and other historic landmarks can be found along the road. While sections of it can be traced as far back as 4000 BC, newer road construction has erased many traces. Some of them show a width of up to {{convert|100|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Drunter 2002 p. 8"&gt;''Drunter oder drüber: Elbquerungen gestern und heute'' (Brochure on the exhibition in Staatsarchiv Hamburg between 30 October till 20 December 2002 on occasion of the opening of the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)#Dilation|4th bore of the Elbe Tunnel]]), Joachim W. Frank (ed.), Hamburg: Staatsarchiv Hamburg / Amt für Geoinformation und Vermessung, 2002, p. 8. {{ISBN|3-89907-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the road declined during the Viking age,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} as transportation by ship became more convenient. New cities were constructed along the coast instead of the road.

Two of [[Denmark]]’s oldest settlements, [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] and [[Jelling]] are situated along the road.

In the southern, narrow part of the [[Jutland|Jutish]] peninsula the trackway followed the edge of western marshes and eastern moraine country. Near [[Haderslev]], [[Åbenrå]], [[Flensburg]], and [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]], it branched into western bypasses on the hills and accesses to the towns, each of them localized at the inner end of a long, narrow bay. One of the southern ends of the Ochsenweg has given its name to a suburb of [[Hamburg]]: ''Ochsenzoll'' is the locality of the ancient custom post.

Part of the tracks westerly bypassed Hamburg towards [[Wedel|Wedel bei Hamburg]] or [[Blankenese]],&lt;ref&gt;Blankenese became a part of Hamburg in 1937&lt;/ref&gt; where a ferry passing the Elbe connected to [[Cranz, Hamburg|Cranz]] (then [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen]]&lt;ref&gt;Since 1648 Cranz belonged to the [[Duchy of Bremen]], but forms a part of Hamburg since 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;''Drunter oder drüber: Elbquerungen gestern und heute'' (Brochure on the exhibition in Staatsarchiv Hamburg between 30 October till 20 December 2002 on occasion of the opening of the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)#Dilation|4th bore of the Elbe Tunnel]]), Joachim W. Frank (ed.), Hamburg: Staatsarchiv Hamburg / Amt für Geoinformation und Vermessung, 2002, p. 10. {{ISBN|3-89907-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easterly bypass headed for [[Zollenspieker Ferry]] (a Hamburg-Lübeckian condominium between 1420 and 1868&lt;ref&gt;Since 1868 Zollespieker is a part of Hamburg.&lt;/ref&gt;), passing the same river towards Hoopte in the then [[Principality of Lüneburg|Principality of Lunenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;''Drunter oder drüber: Elbquerungen gestern und heute'' (Brochure on the exhibition in Staatsarchiv Hamburg between 30 October till 20 December 2002 on occasion of the opening of the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)#Dilation|4th bore of the Elbe Tunnel]]), Joachim W. Frank (ed.), Hamburg: Staatsarchiv Hamburg / Amt für Geoinformation und Vermessung, 2002, p. 11. {{ISBN|3-89907-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; From south of the Elbe the cattle tracks continued up to [[Westphalia]].&lt;ref name="Drunter 2002 p. 8"/&gt;

==Use==
The road was primarily a trade road. The most important commodity was livestock (especially the eponymous [[oxen]]), but also amber, hides, honey and fur went south. Annually up to 50,000 head of cattle came along the oxen road.&lt;ref name="Drunter 2002 p. 8"/&gt;{{when|date=February 2014}} Metal, glass and weapons went north. In spite of the most familiar Danish name, it was seldom used for military invasions, neither northwards, nor southwards.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Nevertheless, many defensive constructions can be found straddling the road up through Jutland.

==Today==
[[Image:Hærvejen vandretureskilt.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A sign for the modern Danish Hærvejen walking route]]
Today modern highways follow the route of the old road. At a few places it is still possible to see the old tracks, embankments, sheep pens and fords. 
Parts of it have been converted into a long-distance walking route. A popular walk known as ''Hærvejsmarchen'' takes place each year. An international cycle route has been marked from the [[Elbe]] to [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8379">'''John Kirtland Wright''' (1891&amp;ndash;1969) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Geography|geographer]], notable for his [[cartography]], [[geosophy]], and study of the history of geographical thought. He was the son of classical scholar [[John Henry Wright]] and novelist [[Mary Tappan Wright]], and the brother of legal scholar and utopian novelist [[Austin Tappan Wright]]. He married Katharine McGiffert Jan. 21, 1921 in New York, N.Y. They had three children: [[Austin Wright|Austin McGiffert Wright]], Gertrude Huntington McPherson, and Mary Wolcott Toynbee.

Having completed a [[PhD]] in [[history]] at [[Harvard University]], in 1920 Wright was employed as librarian by the [[American Geographical Society]]; between the years of 1920 and 1956 he also served as an AGS editor, personal academic contributor, and eventually director.  As a result of his prolific academic and professional life, three main themes have emerged in John K. Wright’s published works. These include:  the overlapping of academic disciplines (mainly history) with geography, the power of the mind and the supernatural realm in creating subjectivity in geographic research, and the importance of sharing academic knowledge.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:John Kirtland Wright.jpg|thumb|alt=Jack Wright|J.K. Wright]] --&gt;

==Geographic Subjectivity==
	While at one point the discipline of geography ignored the influence of subjectivity in human and physical patterns, '''John Kirtland Wright''' brought to the forefront the significance of the mind and the imagination in affecting scientific research.  Specifically, he stressed the duality of both the mind’s reality and of mental, often transcendental, images.  Included in this arena of study were his interests in geographical cosmogony and cosmography, which pertained to the theological realm of the divine, “God’s invisible creation,” and the emotional bonds between people and places, which he then compared to the physical realm of land surface, climate, and [[cartography]]  (Wright 1928).

==History of Geography==
Wright was highly interested in the history of geography and the importance of accurate geographic archival records. He discovered and documented the influences of various religious perspectives on geography, with a very keen interest in Gothic and medieval representations that signified both divine and earthly geographic beauty (Wright 1965).  In addition, he wrote prolifically on the Greek and Roman geographic influences, largely pertaining to the fifteenth- century map of the world by [[Giovanni Leardo]] (Wright,AGS,1928). This was the second oldest map that was given to the AGS in 1906, dated in the 15th century.  Wright’s historic and cartographic fascination was sparked by the unusual, detailed features of the map, including a calendar encompassing the center image, and by the concept it depicted of the earth’s surface before the actual discovery of America; Leardo’s known world includes Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, and Europe.  Greek and Roman sources were used for the making of the map, specifically including Greek notions that the earth existed as a flat disk.  The document lacks the evocative drawings seen in many other medieval maps that were primarily used to fill blank map space (drawings mostly of animals.)  Lastly, Leardo features Jerusalem as the city center (Wright, AGS, 1928).  Ultimately, Wright indicates that the blurring of the fields of history and geography has much significance, as each subject relies on the other for accuracy (Wright, Henry Holt, 1928.)  After retiring as director from the American Geographical Society, Wright continued his quest for historic elucidation by writing on the history of the Society and its connection to the development of geography (Light 1950).
     
Wright coined the term [[choropleth map]] in 1938, although the mapping technique itself was first used by [[Charles Dupin]] in 1826. Wright cautioned against the use of choropleth maps, instead espousing the virtues of the [[dasymetric map]].  Nine years later, in 1947, Wright introduced the notion of [[geosophy]], `the study of geographical knowledge from any or all points of view. To geography what historiography is to history, it deals with the nature and expression of geographical knowledge both past and present' (Wright 1947).

This is a list of the '''15 [[trolleybus]] routes''' running in [[Bucharest]], Romania, operated by the city's public transport company, [[Societatea de Transport București|STB]] as of July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = STB - Societatea de Transport Bucuresti|url = http://stbsa.ro/v_troleibuz.php|website = stbsa.ro|accessdate = 2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information about Bucharest's trolleybus network, see [[Transport in Bucharest#Trolleybuses|Trolleybuses in Bucharest]]. Routes marked with {{access icon}} use wheelchair-accessible low-floor vehicles ([[Irisbus Citelis]]) on some services, however the Ikarus 415T trolleys are more common.

There are also other routes not running due to ongoing works on the [[Bucharest Metro Line M4|M4]] and [[Bucharest Metro Line M5|M5]] metro lines.

Temporary Suspended lines :

71 : Valea Argesului - Gara de Nord. Its place is taken by 93 (previously Gara de Nord - Valea Ialomitei) Suspended due to underground works. 90 and 91 were rerouted from Valea Ialomitei to Valea Argesului respectively to Depoul Alexandria. 

92 : Vasile Parvan - Universitate - Barajul Dunarii. Suspended due to tram line works in Titan and road rehabilitation . Probably its Barajul Dunarii end of line will be changed.

97 : Strand Straulesti - Calea Grivitei - Gara de Nord - Sfintii Voievozi. Suspended due to M4 underground works. Replaced by bus line 697 from Strand Straulesti - Pod Constanta - Mezeș. From Pajura routes 65 and 86 are continuing it's from Pod Constanta onwards until Sfintii Voievozi, except 86 which goes further.

The '''Monti Sabatini''' is a geologic region in [[Lazio]], central [[Italy]], a remnant of intense [[volcanism]] which started ca. 600,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, mainly with [[pyroclastic]] and [[maar]] forming [[eruption]]s which continued until 100,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. The mountains are part of the Lazio's [[Anti-Apennines]]. Included between the Monti Sabatini is the [[Lake Bracciano]], which is a [[volcanotectonic depression]] formed about 3.7 Ma, and the [[Lake Martignano]]. The [[sedimentary]] base of the Sabatini complex lies buried under {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of [[volcanic ash]] and [[rock (geology)|rock]]s.

The highest point is Monte Rocca Romana (a postcaldera [[stratocone]]), at {{convert|612|m|ft|abbr=on}}. 

Other mountains in the area include [[Monti della Tolfa]], [[Soracte|Monte Soratte]], and more southwards, by the [[Monti Cornicolani]].

The Mount Olympus Ski resort consists of the Sun Valley and North Face areas. Each area has its own chairlifts and runs.

Writing in the late first century BC or first century AD, the [[geographer]] [[Strabo]] reported that on one of its promontories was a temple to [[Aphrodite]] of the Heights ({{lang-el|ἀκραία}}), which women were forbidden to enter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]].

The '''Ontario tobacco belt''' is the [[tobacco]]-growing region located in [[Norfolk County, Ontario|Norfolk County]] and eastern [[Elgin County, Ontario|Elgin County]] in [[Southwestern Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The region is close to the north shore of [[Lake Erie]], with a moderate climate and sandy, silt-loam soils that are well-suited to a wide variety of crops.&lt;ref name="longpointbiosphere"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://longpointbiosphere.com/Publications/Wetlands/execsum/use.htm | title = Waterfowl and Wetlands of Long Point Bay and Old Norfolk County| publisher = Long Point Biosphere | date = | accessdate = 2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-value [[horticulture|horticultural]] crops thrive in this region, including 90% of all tobacco grown in Canada.&lt;ref name="idrc"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-28833-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html#| title = Farmers on Tobacco Road| publisher = International Development Research Centre| date = | accessdate = 2008-11-21| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081220121439/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-28833-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html| archivedate = 2008-12-20| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Parliament elected to ridings in the Ontario tobacco belt have strong pro-tobacco policies in addition to other policies in the interest of their rural constituents.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; Historically, the Ontario tobacco belt is composed of the rural area immediately surrounding the towns of Delhi, [[Aylmer, Ontario|Aylmer]] and [[Tillsonburg, Ontario|Tillsonburg]]. Additional tobacco farms can be found in [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], and near [[Joliette, Quebec|Joliette]], [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt;

==History==
[[United Empire Loyalist]]s introduced the tobacco crop after fleeing northwards from their established farms following the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; However, the first official tobacco plot wasn't planted in Norfolk County until 1920.&lt;ref name="longpointbiosphere"/&gt;

From the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s, the coastal portion of the Ontario tobacco belt was threatened with [[desertification]]. Only by planting [[coniferous]] seedlings was the desertification finally stopped.&lt;ref name="1960sglobalwarming"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.definingcanada.ca/2012/03/23/lets-plant-some-trees/| title = Desertification history of Southern Ontario| publisher = Defining Canada| date = | accessdate = 2012-07-25| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140506031707/http://www.definingcanada.ca/2012/03/23/lets-plant-some-trees/| archivedate = 2014-05-06| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 25% of Norfolk County is considered to be forested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treecanada.ca/programs/urbanforestry/cufn/Resources_Canadian/Tree%20Conservation%20By-Laws%20in%20Southern%20Ontario.pdf ''Report on Tree Conservation By-Laws in Southern Ontario''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925044321/http://www.treecanada.ca/programs/urbanforestry/cufn/Resources_Canadian/Tree%20Conservation%20By-Laws%20in%20Southern%20Ontario.pdf |date=2006-09-25 }} at Tree Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ontario tobacco belt would experience its economic zenith during the 1950s and 1960s. During those decades, most communities in the Ontario belt (as well as their residents) were reasonably affluent from the economic gains that the tobacco farms made. The song ''Tillsonburg'' by classic [[country music]] performer [[Stompin' Tom Connors]] would capture the hard working spirit of the Ontario tobacco belt during the middle of the 20th century. A [[1979 Woodstock, Ontario tornado|devastating tornado]] that started in nearby [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] would devastate several tobacco farms in the tobacco belt back during the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Newark, M. (Autumn 1979). The Woodstock Tornado. ''Chinook, 1,'' 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent tornadoes have not been as severe as the one that occurred in the summer of 1979, even when taking global warming into account.

While Canadian tobacco farmers (especially those in the Ontario tobacco belt) see themselves as "innocent victims" of government tobacco regulations, most of them started farming after provincial governments throughout Canada began introducing policies aimed at limiting tobacco consumption.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; As the older farmers retire, their children will most likely seek different career paths.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; Tobacco farms would eventually be sold to their neighbours; this has a [[domino effect]].&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; This domino effect ultimately results in fewer farmers having more acreage creating a further sense of [[economic inequality]] in the area.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt;

===Recent history===
[[File:OntarioTobaccoBeltFarmSummer2012.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Tobacco farm in Norfolk County, summer 2012.]]

The longstanding dominance of tobacco in the region has been on the wane in recent years. In 2002, politicians from the Ontario tobacco belt opposed several anti-smoking measures, causing a non-smoking group to give the [[Government of Ontario|Ontario government]] a failing grade at that time.&lt;ref name="nosmoking"/&gt; The tobacco belt members of [[Ontario Provincial Parliament|Provincial Parliament]] were responsible for scaling back a proposed tobacco tax from $10/carton to $5/carton.&lt;ref name="nosmoking"/&gt; They failed to implement a public [[smoking ban]] (until the Smoke Free Ontario law was passed in 2006).&lt;ref name="nosmoking"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://no-smoking.org/oct02/10-17-02-2.html| title = Ontario Fails to Control Tobacco| publisher = Action on Smoking and Health| date = 2002-10-17| accessdate = 2008-11-16| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060926190639/http://no-smoking.org/oct02/10-17-02-2.html| archivedate = 2006-09-26| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 8, 2008, tobacco [[farmer]]s in this region were given $300 million to buy out their entire tobacco quota.&lt;ref name="ottawacitizen"/&gt; All of the money was raised from a $1,000,000,000 fine against [[Imperial Tobacco]] and [[Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges|Rothman]]'s [[Benson &amp; Hedges]].&lt;ref name="ottawacitizen"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=3cee32c9-7819-4322-881f-19fc6a162b41| title = Where the buy-out money came from| publisher = Canada.com (Ottawa Citizen)| date = 2008-08-02| accessdate = 2008-11-02| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121105103145/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=3cee32c9-7819-4322-881f-19fc6a162b41| archivedate = 2012-11-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving the money, farmers that signed the buy-out are permitted to grow any crop except for tobacco; switching to raising livestock like cattle, poultry, or pigs is completely legal under this plan.

Only about one thousand farm families still produce tobacco in the entire belt.&lt;ref name="thestar"/&gt; Motivation to cease tobacco farming has been accelerated by health issues and high tobacco [[tax]]es.&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.thestar.com/News/Ontario/article/471380| title = Ontario tobacco buy-out | publisher = The Toronto Star| date = 2008-08-01| accessdate = 2008-08-27 | first=Colin | last=Perkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers who never agreed to the tobacco buy-out may grow as much tobacco as their farmland allows through a special tobacco growing licence that was created on the week of May 15, 2009.&lt;ref name="betterfarming"/&gt; Relatives of the farmers (either blood relatives or relatives through marriage) who agreed to the buy-out can still grow tobacco on the original farmer's land with a tobacco growing licence.&lt;ref name="betterfarming"/&gt; However, this right does not extend to the farmer himself who can still manage the farm but not own it in his name.&lt;ref name="betterfarming"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.betterfarming.com/online-news/feds-change-tobacco-license-eligibility-requirements-2148| title = Relatives of Bought-Out Farmers May Still Grow Tobacco | publisher = Better Farming| date = | accessdate = 2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers must also find a company that will buy his product; otherwise he cannot grow tobacco until next year.&lt;ref name="betterfarming"/&gt; Attempts by local youth sports leagues to prohibit the usage of tobacco amongst players, coaches, referees, and even spectators has been successful in a region that was once dominated by the massive profits of Big Tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.norfolkcounty.ca/media-releases/local-summer-hockey-league-goes-tobacco-free/8| title = Local summer hockey league goes tobacco-free | publisher = Norfolk County| date = | accessdate = 2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Tillsonburg is under a strict bylaw aimed at reducing levels of outdoor [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]]. This by-law was passed on May 14, 2012 by Tillsonburg Town council; prohibiting the usage of tobacco and tobacco-related products within {{convert|9|m|ft|disp=or}} of certain buildings intended for families and/or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://notes.town.tillsonburg.on.ca/suiteresponse/egenda%205.0%20ga/ordinances.nsf/1db1b6453fbf13c3852562ff0065dbeb/876fc2283aa5c804852579ff005755e8?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,3596&amp;S_PROVINCESTATEID=9&amp;S_LEGISLATIONDOMAINID=&amp;S_REGIONCITYID=584&amp;sID=1434| title = Bylaw 3596 : To Prohibit Smoking In Certain Public Places Within The Town Of Tillsonburg | publisher = The Town of Tillsonburg (Ontario, Canada)| date = | accessdate = 2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===
By 2020, the Ontario tobacco belt will become the "Ontario [[horticulture|horticultural]] centre" because of its abundance of water. Other reasons for the sudden transformation of this region include proximity to urban markets (e.g., [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[London, Ontario|London]]) and a [[sand]]y soil that favours horticultural crops.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; European farmers will boost the average cost of farmland to $570,000 by the year 2016 due to their overspending; which would essentially give them a monopoly on the local farming business over aspiring Canadian-born farmers. An increasing number of established farmers in the area call this tax hike "unfair;" as they perceive themselves to be paying 75% less for property taxes than people who live on residential properties nearby.&lt;ref name="europeanfarmers"/&gt; While beef production has declined in the Ontario tobacco belt in the past 20 years, the amount of pork and chicken products that are grown in the region have increased slightly. The transition from conventional farming to [[greenhouse]]s have resulted in fewer "field" crops and a greater amount of the "hothouse" variety.&lt;ref name="agingnorfolkfarmers"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2012/12/12/farmers-getting-older-fewer-in-numbers| title = Farmers getting older, fewer in numbers | publisher = The Simcoe Reformer| accessdate = 2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Should the sea levels rise by {{convert|60|m|ft|disp=or}}, the Ontario tobacco belt would not be affected by flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=42.8780,-80.4199&amp;z=7&amp;m=60| title = Impact of global warming on the Ontario Tobacco Belt | publisher = Firetree| accessdate = 2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may be affected by droughts as a by-product of the dislocation of available fresh water and may be forced to rely on [[desalination|desalinated]] salt water piped in from the [[Eastern United States]]. Constructing the proper infrastructure to carry the water hundreds of miles away would take considerable manpower along with significant economic costs and an unprecedented level of cooperation from multiple federal, state/provincial, and municipal governments. Another possible outcome of the global climate change would bring back desertification into the [[Lake Erie]] portion of the tobacco belt. Any grasslands in the area would become brown and eventually become sand; increasing in dryness the further the piece of land is from a source of fresh water. A regional bout of famine would occur if the desertification continued to spread inland and threatened the local crops.

The price of gasoline in the Ontario tobacco belt already exceeds $1.20/litre ($4.80/US gallon); making it critical for research agencies to find a commonly affordable non-oil based fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Canada&amp;city=Simcoe%2C+ON Cost of living in Simcoe, Ontario] at Numbeo&lt;/ref&gt; Even if ethanol fuel was economically feasible for consumers, the local climate is unable to sustain year-round temperatures of {{Convert|10|C|F|lk=on}} that is needed for optimal engine performance.&lt;ref name="NRELE15E20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feerc.ornl.gov/publications/Int_blends_Rpt_1.pdf |title=Effects of Intermediate Ethanol Blends on Legacy Vehicles and Small Non-Road Engines, Report 1 |format=PDF |author1=Brian West |author2=Keith Knoll |author3=Wendy Clark |author4=Ronald Graves |author5=John Orban |author6=Steve Przesmitzki |author7=Timothy Theiss |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=[[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] and [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-10-19 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217073219/http://feerc.ornl.gov/publications/Int_blends_Rpt_1.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }} NREL/TP-540-43543, ORNL/TM-2008/117&lt;/ref&gt; American farmers have finally admitted to their experiments with ethanol fuel technology to being complete failures after the 2012 drought wiped out most of the corn needed to create the ethanol fuel. Wide-scale usage of ethanol fuel outside motorsports and niche motorized vehicles may never come into fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/us/17ethanol.html?src=un&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fbusiness%2Fenergy-environment%2Findex.jsonp |title=Days of Promise Fade for Ethanol|author=Matthew L.

[[Hydrogen fuel]] promises to provide an alternative fuel product for local motorized vehicle drivers once it has been accepted in urban areas where mass transit is prevalent. According to the United States Energy Information Administration, hydrogen fuel is considered to be just as safe as unleaded petroleum gasoline when it comes to unwanted explosions.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Energy Information Administration. (n.d). Energy sources: hydrogen. Retrieved from: http://www.eia.gov/kids/energy.cfm?page=hydrogen_home-basics-k.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel with hydrogen is also on par with [[compressed natural gas]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogenandfuelcellsafety.info/2007/jun/h2cng.asp |title=Canadian Hydrogen Safety Program testing H2/CNG |work=Hydrogenandfuelcellsafety.info |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721205150/http://www.hydrogenandfuelcellsafety.info/2007/jun/h2cng.asp |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be found in Brazil in lieu of conventional unleaded (petrol) gasoline.

As school attendance continues to decline throughout the Ontario tobacco belt, one of the solutions would be to close down [[Simcoe Composite School]] and [[Waterford District High School]] while keeping [[Valley Heights Secondary School|Valley Heights Secondary]] and [[Delhi District Secondary School]]s open. The students from the Simcoe high school and the Waterford high school would be consolidated into a giant secular high school spanning {{convert|15|acre|sqft|disp=or}} somewhere in Norfolk County. Both VHSS and DDSS have the government funding and student enrolment figures to remain open on an indefinite basis.&lt;ref name="superschoolnorfolk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plan B: 'Build a super school' |work=The Simcoe Reformer |url=http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2012/03/22/plan-b-build-a-super-school |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Accommodation Review Committee (ARC) - Norfolk Secondary |work=Grand Erie District School Board |url=http://www.granderie.ca/BOARD/AccommodationReviewCommitteeARCNorfolkSec.aspx |accessdate=2012-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117073319/http://www.granderie.ca/BOARD/AccommodationReviewCommitteeARCNorfolkSec.aspx |archivedate=2012-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing the number of high schools in the Ontario tobacco belt would alleviate the burden of a rapidly aging population from paying extra [[property tax]]es during their time of financial need. The buildings that currently house SCS and WDHS can either be reconfigured into housing, corporate space, possible industry sites, or even demolished at taxpayers' cost. Online education through the Internet could allow teachers to operate and to retain some form of employment; even if the building itself had to close sometime in the distant future and the school had to "operate" on a remote Internet server. All public secondary schools that currently serve students from the Ontario tobacco belt will eventually have to be converted into "Internet-only" establishments. These establishments would allow anyone between the ages of 14 and 21 with a broadband Internet connection and fluency in the [[English language]] to "attend" a high school in the Ontario tobacco belt region. The core curriculum would be taught for students in grade 9 through grade 12 in addition to Canadian culture, laws, geography, and history; helping people acquire a Canadian-style secondary school education and facilitating their way to acquiring Canadian citizenship.

===Jobs===
Most of the Ontario tobacco belt also belongs to the [[Green Energy Hub]]; an environmental region in Southern Ontario that is dedicated to creating "[[Green-collar worker|green]]" jobs through solar panels, wind turbines, and recycled rain water. Delhi, once considered to be the "heart of the Ontario tobacco belt," historically had transient adolescent workers that could find employment quickly. The local police force started to take a less tolerant stand towards these job seekers in the later years when they started to threaten the employment of local workers.&lt;ref name="robinkers"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Picking tobacco in Delhi, Ontario'' |url=http://www.robinkers.com/tobacco.html |accessdate=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115144922/http://www.robinkers.com/tobacco.html |archive-date=2013-11-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As urbanization continues to claim the [[Niagara Peninsula]], displaced farmers will come to the Ontario tobacco belt seeking acres of land to farm.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; European farmers have bought farmland in massive amounts throughout the course of the Great Recession; fleeing the bleak prospect of farming land between airstrips in their native Europe.&lt;ref name="europeanfarmers"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Farmers face prospect of higher taxes'' |url=http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2013/06/13/farmers-face-prospect-of-higher-taxes |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their expertise in growing non-tobacco crops will forever change the economy of communities like Tillsonburg and Delhi.&lt;ref name="idrc"/&gt; Tobacco labourers will easily transition over into their new jobs in horticulture labour. Most of the jobs will involve heavy labour and no additional skills would be needed for the [[Jamaica]]n and [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[migrant worker|transient labourer]]s who "reside" in the tobacco belt region from March to November. Farm operators within the Ontario tobacco belt are 55 years old on average as of December 14, 2012 because operating a farm consists of long hours, intensive physical labour and little pay. Despite the recent economic woes, young people find greater job security working at urban office jobs than operating a rural farm in either Norfolk or Oxford County.&lt;ref name="agingnorfolkfarmers"/&gt;

Factories once operated in the Ontario tobacco belt; especially in the town of Simcoe. During the 42 years that it was operating, the metal-can manufacturing plant owned by The [[American Can Company]] employed many local residents. The Canadian Canning Company, which had been in operation in Simcoe since the 1870s, was a primary customer for some of the products of the American Can Plant, and was a producer of canned fruit, vegetable, and processed prepared foodstuffs, such as soup. This processing plant relied heavily on fruit and vegetables produced locally.
In 1991, the Robinson Street manufacturing plants closed. The shutdown of the plants can be partially attributed to the [[Early 1990s recession|recession of the early 1990s]].&lt;ref name="uerca"&gt;[http://www.uer.ca/locations/show.asp?locid=20330 ''American Canning Company''] historical information at UER.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

Delhi Industries and Delhi Foundry once offered non-tobacco jobs to Delhi. They both eventually closed due to the changing Canadian economy that emphasized more on service jobs than jobs in traditional manufacturing fields. Delhi Industries lasted until the midst of the [[Great Recession|Canadian economic recession]] when it closed down on March 2010; terminating 61 Canadian jobs on a permanent basis. They once made fans and blowers for industrial operations in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Delhi Industries to close doors in March |url=http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2010/02/02/delhi-industries-to-close-doors-in-march |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084920/http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2010/02/02/delhi-industries-to-close-doors-in-march |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-08-19 |accessdate=2012-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2600 people have officially joined the Norfolk County workforce between June 2012 and June 2013. Businesses have been expanding throughout Norfolk County again; often hiring people two at a time. Innovative business running measures are also improving the quality of life for Norfolk County residents who are members of the workforce. The economy of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] along with the rest of the world may become further interconnected with the changing economy of the Ontario tobacco belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2013/06/12/optimism-being-felt-in-norfolk |title=Optimism being felt in Norfolk |author=Daniel Pearce |date=June 2013 |work= |publisher=Simcoe Reformer |accessdate=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-established banks are removing their presence away from the rural communities of the Ontario tobacco belt at a fast pace. Places like Service Ontario and the Backus Heritage Conservation Area may have to shutter their doors after the departure of CIBC; leading to an almost-immediate loss of jobs within the tobacco belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2017/11/15/cibc-will-transfer-accounts-to-hagersville ''CIBC will transfer accounts to Hagersville''] at Simcoe Reformer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

===Traditional===
The traditional climate for most of the Ontario tobacco belt has witnessed temperatures as low of {{convert|-7.8|C|F}} in January and as high as {{convert|25.6|C|F}} in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.almanac.com/weather/history/ON/Delhi/1960-01-01| title = Delhi, Ontario weather for January 1, 1960 | publisher = Old Farmers' Almanac| accessdate = 2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.almanac.com/weather/history/ON/Delhi/1960-07-01| title = Delhi, Ontario weather for July 1, 1960 | publisher = Old Farmers' Almanac| accessdate = 2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winter of 1975 was the only unusually mild winter in the Ontario tobacco belt from 1877 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108%3C1440:MFDDAA%3E2.0.CO;2| title = Maximum Freezing Degree-Days as a Winter Severity Index for the Great Lakes, 1897–1977 | publisher = American Meteorological Society | accessdate = 2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the traditional climate was considered to be inhospitable for some as the threat of [[desertification]] raged on from the early 20th century through the 1960s. Only by planting [[coniferous]] seedlings did the Ontario tobacco belt started to become a more friendly climate for tobacco production.&lt;ref name="1960sglobalwarming"/&gt;

Historically, the hottest temperatures in the Ontario tobacco belt were recorded on July 9, 1936 with [[Delhi, Ontario|Delhi]] registering temperatures up to {{convert|40.6|C|F|disp=or}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Environment Canada]]

===Modern===
An overnight frost in the early fall of 1999 damaged the unharvested crops of one hundred local tobacco farms; Norfolk County, Brant County, and Oxford County were affected in the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/09/22/frost220999.html| title = Frost Caused Damage in Tobacco Belt | publisher = CBC News| date = 1999-09-22| accessdate = 2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official reading of {{convert|35.7|C|F|disp=or}} from the Delhi weather station recorded on July 7, 2012 has seen rising temperatures become a nearly unstoppable trend in the Ontario tobacco belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.almanac.com/weather/history/ON/Delhi/2012-07-07| title = Delhi, Ontario weather for July 7, 2012 | publisher = Old Farmers' Almanac| date = 2012-07-07| accessdate = 2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When temperatures in the Ontario tobacco belt manage to reach a high of beyond {{convert|30|C|F|disp=or}}, overall crop yields can be reduced as much as 1% per day; leading to potential crop failures months ahead of the proper harvest schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uoguelph.ca/plant/treefruit/documents/2011BookCelbratingThePast.pdf| title = Celebrating the Past | publisher = University of Guelph| accessdate = 2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of days that the Ontario tobacco belt spends in temperatures in excess of {{convert|30|C|F|disp=or}} are rising due to shifting weather patterns. Within the next 20 years, the industrial character of Norfolk, Brant and Oxford counties might have to change in order to adapt to the difficulties that future farmers will face concerning the well-being of their crops.

However, with the summer temperatures of 2009 having been the [[Year Without a Summer|coldest since 1816]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=en&amp;n=714D9AAE-1&amp;news=7DDF8AF2-FE36-439D-A474-4FD32F86C148| title = Ontario Weather Review - July 2009| publisher = Environment Canada| date = 2009-09-01| accessdate = 2011-10-27| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203043636/http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=714D9AAE-1&amp;news=7DDF8AF2-FE36-439D-A474-4FD32F86C148| archivedate = 2012-12-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of successful tobacco and food crops were fewer and more expensive because of fears of an early frost that never quite surfaced in 2009.

Between December 2012 and April 2013, temperatures managed to return to normal seasonal levels for the Ontario tobacco belt along with most of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Temperatures predictions for December 2012-April 2013 |url=http://vortex.accuweather.com/adc2004/pub/includes/columns/abrams/2012/590x375_07101134_jul9b.png |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While May and June 2013 has seen temperatures that were slightly above normal, July 2013 has seen the return of extremely warm temperatures. Temperatures did not return to normal seasonal patterns until the middle of October 2013. However, the [[2013–14 North American cold wave]] victimized Norfolk County from January to mid-April 2014 with unusually frequent cases of blizzards and snowstorms. An expected heat wave for the summer months of 2014 never emerged, meaning that temperatures in the Ontario tobacco belt have remained close to normal.

The months of April and May 2015 saw temperatures that went directly from being unseasonably cold to unseasonably warm and back to unseasonably cold without any moderate weather in between. Cloudy days with high winds dominate the colder days while the unseasonably warm weather brought about threats of thunderstorms during the evening hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuweather.com/en/ca/simcoe/n3y/april-weather/54995 Weather information for Simcoe, Ontario - April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuweather.com/en/ca/simcoe/n3y/month/54995?monyr=5/01/2015 Weather information for Simcoe, Ontario - May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The temperatures from June to early September 2015 were seen as unusually warm and/or muggy. Thunderstorms and essential rainfall was deemed to be few and far in-between; with normal seasonal temperatures returning around late September of that year.

The winter of 2016 experienced a lack of snowfall not seen since the winter of 2012. While the summer months of 2016 were as equally dry and hot as the summer of 2015, it was considerably more windy in 2016 than it was in 2015. The dry summer affected everything from trees to wildlife to the water levels for [[Lake Erie]]. Rain finally returned around October and November 2016 when the cold front needed to produce precipitation was finally created in order to fight the dominant warm front.

==Replacements for tobacco==

===Horticulture and animal farming===
Compared to 1998, tobacco farming is down by 60% and falling.&lt;ref name="smokypolitics"/&gt; It is possible that this tobacco industry will never recover and disappear forever.&lt;ref name="smokypolitics"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/politicalbytes/2008/08/tobacco_strategy.html| title = Political Bites: Smoky politics | publisher = CBC News| date = | accessdate = 2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls to action by local residents to diversify the tobacco belt into other industries have been slow in being answered by Norfolk County council. Diversification into several different types of products could help the region absorb the ups and downs of a changing economy. The winter hardiness and soil requirements of lavender are equivalent to that of tobacco; meaning that an "Ontario horticultural belt" could see the economy revolve around lavender plants rather than tobacco plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.norfolknews.ca/news-story/4404488-a-tale-of-two-tobacco-farms/| title = A tale of two tobacco farms | publisher = Norfolk News| date = | accessdate = 2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco farmers in this region have to deal with the same issues that haunt [[Europe]]an tobacco farmers; farmers are told to grow different crops or go out of business.&lt;ref name="europetobacco"/&gt; However, it is difficult to adjust to the changing supply and demand when most farmers are in heavy debt.&lt;ref name="europetobacco"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.savetobaccogrowers.com/index.php?action=article&amp;numero=22| title = Situation of tobacco farmers (from Europe's perspective) | publisher = Save Tobacco Growers| date = 2008-08-20| accessdate = 2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic fallout from the [[Great Recession|Canadian economic recession]] also played in role in declining tobacco sales and farmers going deeper into debt. There are also good opportunities for [[winery|wineries]], [[peanut]] farms, [[poultry]] farms, and [[apiary|apiaries]] to fill the void that tobacco leaves behind economically.&lt;ref name="ogov"/&gt; Most of these alternative crops are either grown or raised in Norfolk County; that is where the cash crush of a declining tobacco market is affecting the most people.&lt;ref name="ogov"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GONE/2008/06/05/c7463.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html| title = Government of Ontario (Canada) news | publisher = Government of Ontario (Canada)| date = 2008-06-05| accessdate = 2008-11-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind generators===
[[Wind generator]]s have been used extensively in the Port Rowan area and in the southwestern part of Norfolk County (particularly near Lake Erie).&lt;ref name="norcountywindturb"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolkcounty.ca/images/PDF/PlanningEcDev/Mapping/Wind%20Turbines.pdf| title = Lakeshore Wind Turbines| accessdate = 2010-04-11}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Port Rowan has seen some wind generators installed in the northern end of their community near their active adult community; but were dismantled after the local people starting protesting. Most of them are seen near the communities of Clear Creek, Jacksonburg, Houghton Centre, and Hemlock.&lt;ref name="norcountywindturb"/&gt; [[Port Dover, Ontario|Port Dover]] (on the easternmost part of the Ontario tobacco belt) has been declared to be the site of future wind generators.&lt;ref name="portdoverwindgenerators"&gt;The Simcoe Reformer - January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Norfolk County has banned the placement of new wind turbines after becoming a "willing host" for them back in 2003. One of the council members were worried about Norfolk County becoming "industrialized" and "unnatural." Many leaders in Norfolk County envision the surrounding area as being an agricultural hub for Southern Ontario even by the middle of the 22nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.simcoereformer.ca/2013/05/14/norfolk-seeks-end-to-turbine-development| title = Norfolk Seeks End to Turbine Development| accessdate = 2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By harvesting the local [[wind energy]], it is assumed that electricity could be created closer to home without using fossil fuels and without polluting the atmosphere or the water that people need to live. However, one of the side effects has been the unexplained killing of the [[bald eagle]] species that is being rehabilitated in the area.&lt;ref name="deadbirds"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://windconcernsontario.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/bald-eagle-killed-by-wind-turbine-in-norfolk-county-ontario/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100409185104/http://windconcernsontario.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/bald-eagle-killed-by-wind-turbine-in-norfolk-county-ontario/| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2010-04-09| title = Wind Concerns Ontario (Wordpress)| date = 2010-04-06| accessdate = 2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind energy supporters have stated in the past that fossil fuel-based [[power plant]]s affect the birds in a less humane manner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = B.

Sovacool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the wind generator devices (approximately $4 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] per unit) has caused the short-term price of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric energy]] to increase as it became more expensive to deliver the needed energy due to complications with the electricity grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Hydro+prices+going+like+rocket/3428382/story.html | title = Hydro prices going like rocket | publisher = Ottawa Citizen | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While rent has remained very cheap (approximately 870 Canadian dollars a month) by global standards in Brantford, the rising cost of electricity has made the typical restaurant meal in that city to be very expensive (with the cost of a meal between 10.50 Canadian dollars a person for lunch to 67.50 Canadian dollars a person for an elegant dinner); particularly when compared to other communities within Southern Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Canada&amp;city=Brantford Cost of living in Brantford, Canada] at Numbeo&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional Ontario electricity grid had become dependent on fossil fuels,&lt;ref name="electricityinontario"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uoguelph.ca/~whulet/OGN/Vol1Issue1/Glen_Estill.htm | title = Electricity in Ontario | publisher = University of Guelph | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[transformer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ontarioenergyboard.ca/OEB/Consumers/OEB+and+You/Ontario+Energy+Sector | title = The Electricity Sector | publisher = Ontario Energy Board | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] for decades before the wind turbines started appearing.&lt;ref name="electricityinontario"/&gt; However, these concerns are negated by wind energy proponents who say that the turbines could lead to electricity price reductions through lower natural gas prices (due to the reductions in natural gas demand).&lt;ref&gt;Wiser, R., Bolinger, M. (2007). “Can deployment of renewable energy put downward pressure on natural gas prices?” Energy Policy, Volume 35, pp.295-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[fossil fuel]]s is becoming less frequent amongst both rural and urban people as it becomes more expensive.&lt;ref name="saudiarabia2037"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fortunecity.com/boozers/bridge/632/article39.html| title = Saudi Arabia in the year 2037 - also deals with developed countries having alternative fuels| accessdate = 2010-11-17| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010723120601/http://www.fortunecity.com/boozers/bridge/632/article39.html| archivedate = 2001-07-23| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwindling oil supplies (that will be completely diminished by 2057&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Worldwide protests against the development of new [[oil field]]s are also bringing up the price of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Alaska Inter-Tribal Council.

{{Politics of Andorra}}

'''[[Andorra]]''' consists of seven communities known as '''parishes''' ({{lang-ca|'''parròquies'''}}, singular{{spaced ndash}}'''parròquia'''). Until relatively recently, it had only six parishes; the seventh, Escaldes-Engordany, was created in 1978.

==Overview==
[[Andorra la Vella]] is the capital of Andorra. Some parishes have a further territorial subdivision; [[Ordino]], [[La Massana]] and [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] are subdivided into ''quarts'' (quarters), while [[Canillo]] is subdivided into 10 ''veïnats'' (neighborhoods). Those mostly coincide with [[village]]s, which are found in all parishes.

Each parish has its own elected mayor who is the nominal head of the local government known as a ''comú'' in Catalan.

{{Politics of the Cayman Islands}}
The '''Premier of the Cayman Islands''' is the political leader and [[head of government]]. The post of Premier in the [[Cayman Islands]] is the equivalent to [[Chief Minister]] or [[Prime Minister]] in other [[British Overseas Territories]]. It is the highest political level that can be attained within the British overseas territory. Prior to 2009, the position was known as '''Leader of Government Business'''.

The Premier and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior ministers) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to Queen [[Elizabeth II]], to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands|Legislative Assembly]], to their political party and ultimately to the electorate.

The current Premier is [[Alden McLaughlin]], since 29 May 2013.

==Constitutional background==
Until 2001 the position had no official recognition, but it was formalized by an Order of the British Government in July 2001, as the Leader of Government Business along with the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Further constitutional amendments in 2009 modified the name to Premier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68897">'''Present day Mars habitability analogue environments on Earth''' are environments that share potentially relevant [[astrobiological]] conditions with Mars. These include sites that are analogues of potential subsurface habitats, and deep subsurface habitats.&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues/&gt; For analogues more generally see [[Terrestrial Analogue Sites]].

A few places on Earth, such as the hyper-arid core of the high Atacama desert and the McMurdo dry valleys in Antarctica approach the dryness of current Mars surface conditions. In some parts of Antarctica, the only water available is in films of brine on salt / ice interfaces. There is life there, but it is rare, in low numbers, and often hidden below the surface of rocks (endoliths), making the life hard to detect. Indeed, these sites are used for testing sensitivity of future life detection instruments for Mars.

Other analogues duplicate some of the conditions that may occur in particular locations on Mars. These include ice caves, the icy fumaroles of [[Mount Erebus]], hot springs, or the sulfur rich mineral deposits of the Rio Tinto region in Spain. Other analogues include regions of deep permafrost and high alpine regions with plants and microbes adapted to aridity, cold and UV radiation with similarities to Mars conditions.&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, The Open University|title=TN2: The Catalogue of Planetary Analogues|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/The_Catalogue_of_Planetary_Analogues.pdf|publisher=Under ESA contract: 4000104716/11/NL/AF|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrestonDartnell2014"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lewisdartnell.com/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/18-Preston-Dartnell2014_IJA.pdf|last1=Preston|first1=Louisa J.|last2=Dartnell|first2=Lewis R.|title=Planetary habitability: lessons learned from terrestrial analogues|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|volume=13|issue=1|year=2014|pages=81–98|issn=1473-5504|doi=10.1017/S1473550413000396|bibcode=2014IJAsB..13...81P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Mars analogue environments are used for furthering the study of [[astrobiology]]. For instance, they are used for testing life detection instruments to be sent to Mars, as a source for species to be tested for their ability to survive on Mars, and as a way to study how Earth life copes in conditions that resemble conditions on Mars. They may also give us some insight into adaptations that native Mars life could use to survive.

==Precision of analogues==
Mars surface conditions are not exactly reproduced anywhere on Earth&lt;!-- is it that the surface conditions "are not" reproduced or "cannot" be reproduced? and why is that? is it primarily due to differences in atmosphere? sentence should give a reason --&gt; so Earth surface analogues for Mars are necessarily partial analogues. Some Earth cave and deep subsurface analogues may be more exact analogues of Mars surface conditions (apart from the levels of gravity), if similar conditions occur on Mars. Here are some of the most significant differences between Earth and Mars surface conditions, with remarks on Mars' closest analogues on Earth:

* '''Ionizing radiation'''. Curiosity measured levels on Mars similar to the interior of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), which is far higher than surface Earth levels - however adaptations for desiccation resistance also give some Earth microbes high levels of ionizing radiation resistance - they can repair single and double breaks of their DNA within hours using the example of still intact DNA to repair breaks in the damaged DNA.&lt;ref name="DieserBattista2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dieser|first1=M.|last2=Battista|first2=J.

The Yungay area at the core of the Atacama desert used to be considered the driest area on Earth for more than a decade, until the discovery that [[#Maria Elena South|Maria Elena South]] is drier in results published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Azua-BustosCaro-Lara2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AstrobioMariaElenaSouth"/&gt; It can go centuries without rainfall, and parts of it have been [[hyper-arid]] for 150&amp;nbsp;million years. The older regions in this area have salts that are amongst the closest analogues of salts on Mars because these regions have nitrate deposits that contain not only the usual chlorides, but also sulfates, [[chlorate]]s, chromates, iodates, and perchlorates.&lt;ref name="Solid32011"/&gt; The infrared spectra are similar to the spectra of bright soil regions of Mars.&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues/&gt;

Experiments conducted on Mars have also been successfully repeated in this region.

This site is even drier than the Yungay area. It was found through a systematic search for drier regions than Yungay in the Atacama desert, using relative humidity data loggers set up from 2008 to 2012, with the results published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Azua-BustosCaro-Lara2015"/&gt; The relative humidity is the same as the lowest relative humidity measured by Curiosity.&lt;ref name="AstrobioMariaElenaSouth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Andrew|title=Driest Place on Earth Hosts Life|url=http://www.astrobio.net/extreme-life/driest-place-on-earth-hosts-life/|website=NASA Astrobiology Magazine (online)|publisher=NASA|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This region's maximum atmospheric relative humidity is 54.7% compared with 86.8% for the Yungay region.

The following living organisms were also found in this region:
* '''''[[Actinobacteria]]:''''' [[Actinobacterium]], [[Aciditerrmonas]], and [[Geodermatophilus]]
* '''''[[Proteobacteria]]:''''' [[Caulobacter]] and [[Sphyingomonas]]
* '''''[[Firmicutes]]:''''' [[Firmicutes]] and [[Clostridiales]]
* '''''[[Acidobacteria]]:''''' [[Acidobacterium]]
* 16 new species of [[Streptomyces]], 5 of [[Bacillus]] and 1 of Geodermatophilus.

There was no decrease in the numbers of species as the soil depth increased down to a depth of one meter, although different microbes inhabited different soil depths. There was no colonization of Gypsum, showing the extreme dryness of the site.

No [[archaea]] was detected in this region using the same methods that detected archaea in other regions of the Atacama desert. The researchers said that if this is confirmed in studies of similarly dry sites, it could mean that "there may be adry limit for this domain of life on Earth"&lt;ref name="Azua-BustosCaro-Lara2015"/&gt;

[[File:Trek-browse.jpg|thumb|Researchers scout out field sites in Antarctica's Beacon Valley, one of the most Mars-like places on Earth. Image credit: NASA]]
These valleys lie on the edge of the Antarctic plateau. They are kept clear of ice and snow by fast [[katabatic wind]]s that blow from the plateau down through the valleys. As a result, they are amongst the coldest and driest areas in the world.

The central region of [[Beacon Valley]] is considered to be one of the best terrestrial analogues for the current conditions on Mars. There is snowdrift and limited melting around the edges and occasionally in the central region, but for the most part, moisture is only found as thin films of brine around permafrost structures. It has slightly alkaline salt rich soil.&lt;ref name="McKay2008"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/snow-recurrence-sets-the-depth-of-dry-permafrost-at-high-elevations-in-the-mcmurdo-dry-valleys-of-antarctica/CF01B0520168E3A900CD4BD360049E2F/core-reader |last1=McKay |first1=Christopher P. |title=Snow recurrence sets the depth of dry permafrost at high elevations in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica |journal=Antarctic Science |volume=21 |issue=01 |year=2008 |page=89 |issn=0954-1020 |doi=10.1017/S0954102008001508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues3&gt;{{cite web |last1=The Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, The Open University |title=TN2: The Catalogue of Planetary Analogues, section 1.6.3 |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/The_Catalogue_of_Planetary_Analogues.pdf |publisher=Under ESA contract: 4000104716/11/NL/AF |date=December 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Don Juan pond===
This small pond in Antarctica, 100 meters by 300 meters, and 10&amp;nbsp;cm deep, is of great interest for studying the limits of habitability for present day life on Mars.

Research using a time lapse camera shows that it is partly fed by deliquescing salts revealing dark tracks that resemble the Recurrent Slope Lineae on Mars. The salts absorb water by deliquescence only, at times of high humidity, then flows down the slope as salty brines. These then mix with snow melt, which feeds the lake. The first part of this process may be related to the processes that form the [[Seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes|Recurring Slope Lineae]] (RSLs) on Mars.&lt;ref name="DicksonHead2013"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130130/srep01166/full/srep01166.html#supplementary-information|last1=Dickson|first1=James L.|last2=Head|first2=James W.|last3=Levy|first3=Joseph S.|last4=Marchant|first4=David R.|title=Don Juan Pond, Antarctica: Near-surface CaCl2-brine feeding Earth's most saline lake and implications for Mars|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|year=2013|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep01166|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1166D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stacey|first1=Kevin|title=How the world’s saltiest pond gets its salt - describing the research of Jay Dickson and Jim Head|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2013/02/antarctica|date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has an exceptionally low water activity of 0.3 to 0.6. Though microbes have been cultivated from it, they have not been shown to be able to reproduce in the salty conditions present in the lake, and it is possible that they only got there through being washed in by the rare occasions of snow melt feeding the lake. If this turns out to be the case, it may possibly be the only natural water body of any size without indigenous life on the Earth.

===Blood Falls===
{{Wide image|Blood Falls by Peter Rejcek.jpg|400px|[[Blood Falls]] seeps from the end of the Taylor Glacier into Lake Bonney. The tent at left provides a sense of scale }}

[[Image:blood falls1 f Low Res nsf.gov.jpg|thumb|A schematic cross-section of Blood Falls showing how subglacial microbial communities have survived in cold, darkness, and absence of oxygen for a million years in brine water below [[Taylor Glacier]].]]

This unusual flow of melt water from below the glacier gives scientists access to an environment they could otherwise only explore by drilling (which would also risk contaminating it). The melt water source is a subglacial pool of unknown size which sometimes overflows. Biogeochemical analysis shows that the water is marine in source originally. One hypothesis is that the source may be the remains of an ancient fjord that occupied the Taylor valley in the [[tertiary period]]. The ferrous iron dissolved in the water oxidizes as the water reaches the surface, turning the water blood red.&lt;ref name="DachwaldMikucki2014"/&gt;

[[Blood Falls]] was used as the target for testing [[IceMole]] in November 2014.

At {{convert|4500|m|ft}}, [[Qaidam Basin]] is the plateau with highest average elevation on the Earth. The atmospheric pressure is 50% - 60% of sea level pressures, and as a result of the thin atmosphere it has high levels of UV radiation, and large temperature swings from day to night. Also, the Himalayas to the South block humid air from India, making it hyper arid.

In the most ancient playas (Da Langtang) at the north west corner of the plateau, the evaporate salts are magnesium sulfates (sulfates are common on Mars). This combined with the Mars like conditions make it an interesting analogue of the Martian salts and salty regolith. An expedition found eight strains of [[Haloarchaea|halobacteria]] inhabiting the salts, similar to some species of [[Virgibacillus]], [[Oceanobacillus]], [[Halobacillus]], and Ter-ribacillus.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, A., et al.

Two sites of special interest: Colour Peak and Gypsum Hill, two sets of cold saline springs on [[Axel Heiberg Island]] that flow with almost constant temperature and flow rate throughout the year. The air temperatures are comparable to the McMurdo dry valleys, range -15&amp;nbsp;°C to -20&amp;nbsp;°C (for the McMurdo dry valleys -15&amp;nbsp;°C to -40&amp;nbsp;°C). The island is an area of thick permafrost with low precipitation, leading to desert conditions. The water from the springs has a temperature of between -4&amp;nbsp;°C and 7&amp;nbsp;°C. A variety of minerals precipitate out of the springs including gypsum, and at Colour Peak crystals of the metastable mineral [[ikaite]] ({{chem|Ca|C|O|3}}·6{{chem|H|2|O}}) which decomposes rapidly when removed from freezing water.&lt;ref&gt;Impey, Chris, Jonathan Lunine, and José Funes, eds.

===Colour Lake Fen===
This is another Mars analogue habitat in [[Axel Heiberg Island]] close to Colour Peak and Gypsum Hill. The frozen soil and permafrost hosts many microbial communities that are tolerant of anoxic, acid, saline and cold conditions. Most are in survival rather than colony forming mode. Colour Lake Fen is a good terrestrial analogue of the saline acidic brines that once existed in the Meridani Planum region of Mars and may possibly still exist on the martian surface.

== Permafrost soils ==
Much of the water on Mars is permanently frozen, mixed with the rocks. So terrestrial permafrosts are a good analogue.

As well as analogues of ice fumaroles on Mars, if they exist, they may also be useful analogues for hydrothermally heated ice caves on Mars more generally if they exist.

== Cave systems ==
There are several almost enclosed ecosystems below the surface of the Earth, in cave habitats, which are especially good analogues for Mars as similar environments might exist there. And the mines give access to deep subsurface environments which turn out to be inhabited on the Earth, and may possibly exist on Mars.&lt;ref name="AertsRöling2014"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/4/4/535/htm#322SubsurfaceEnvironments|last1=Aerts|first1=Joost|last2=Röling|first2=Wilfred|last3=Elsaesser|first3=Andreas|last4=Ehrenfreund|first4=Pascale|title=Biota and Biomolecules in Extreme Environments on Earth: Implications for Life Detection on Mars|journal=Life|volume=4|issue=4|year=2014|pages=535–565|issn=2075-1729|doi=10.3390/life4040535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basaltic lava tube caves===
The only caves found so far on Mars are lava tube caves. These are insulated to some extent from surface conditions and may retain ice also when there is none left on the surface, and may have access to chemicals such as hydrogen from serpentization to fuel chemosynthetic life. Lava tubes on Earth have microbial mats, and mineral deposits inhabited by microbes.

The [[Snottite]]s in the toxic sulfur cave [[Cueva de Villa Luz]] flourish on Hydrogen Sulfide gas and though some are aerobes (though only needing low levels of oxygen), some of these species (e.g. Acidianus), like those that live around hydrothermal vents, are able to survive independent of a source of oxygen.

So magnesium sulfate is a likely component of cold brines on the planet, especially with the limited availability of subsurface ice. Terrestrial magnesium sulfate lakes have similar chemical and physical properties. They also have a wide range of halophilic organisms, in all the three [[Kingdom (biology)#The three domains of life|Kingdoms of life]] (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota), in the surface and near subsurface.&lt;ref name="FosterKing2010"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063309002463|last1=Foster|first1=Ian S.|last2=King|first2=Penelope L.|last3=Hyde|first3=Brendt C.|last4=Southam|first4=Gordon|title=Characterization of halophiles in natural {{chem|Mg|S|O|4}} salts and laboratory enrichment samples: Astrobiological implications for Mars|journal=Planetary and Space Science|volume=58|issue=4|year=2010|pages=599–615|issn=0032-0633|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2009.08.009|bibcode=2010P&amp;SS...58..599F}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the abundance of algae and bacteria, in alkaline hypersaline conditions, they are of astrobiological interest for both past and present life on Mars.

These lakes are most common in Western Canada, and the northern part of Washington state, USA. One of the examples, is Basque Lake 2 in Western Columbia, which is highly concentrated in magnesium sulfate. In summer it deposits epsomite ("Epsom salts"). In winter, it deposits [[meridianiite]]. This is named after [[Meridiani Planum]] where Opportunity rover found crystal molds in sulfate deposits ([[Vugs]]) which are thought to be remains of this mineral which have since been dissolved or dehydrated.

Another example is [[Spotted Lake]], which shows a wide variety of minerals, most of them sulfates, with sodium, magnesium and calcium as cations.

Though many of the experiments use these lakes as an analogue for ancient Mars, some researchers also have investigated them as an analogue to explore the possibility of microbes that could inhabit cold magnesium sulfate rich brines in present-day Mars. Some of the microbes isolated have been able to survive the high concentrations of magnesium sulfates found in martian soils, also at low temperatures that may be found on Mars.&lt;ref name="KilmerEberl2014"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3989109|last1=Kilmer|first1=Brian R.|last2=Eberl|first2=Timothy C.|last3=Cunderla|first3=Brent|last4=Chen|first4=Fei|last5=Clark|first5=Benton C.|last6=Schneegurt|first6=Mark A.|title=Molecular and phenetic characterization of the bacterial assemblage of Hot Lake, WA, an environment with high concentrations of magnesium sulphate, and its relevance to Mars|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|volume=13|issue=1|year=2014|pages=69–80|issn=1473-5504|doi=10.1017/S1473550413000268|pmid=24748851|bibcode=2014IJAsB..13...69K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KilmerEberl2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CrislerNewville2012"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3277918|last1=Crisler|first1=J.D.|last2=Newville|first2=T.M.|last3=Chen|first3=F.|last4=Clark|first4=B.C.|last5=Schneegurt|first5=M.A.|title=Bacterial Growth at the High Concentrations of Magnesium Sulfate Found in Martian Soils|journal=Astrobiology|volume=12|issue=2|year=2012|pages=98–106|issn=1531-1074|doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0720|pmid=22248384|bibcode=2012AsBio..12...98C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Searching salt for answers about life on Earth, Mars|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120809151324.htm|website=Science Daily - press release from Wichita State University|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfates (for instance of sodium, magnesium and calcium) are also common in other continental evaporates (such as the salars of the Atacama desert), as distinct from salt beds associated with marine deposits which tend to consist mainly of halites (chlorides).&lt;ref name="BarbieriStivaletta2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbieri|first1=Roberto|last2=Stivaletta|first2=Nunzia|title=Continental evaporites and the search for evidence of life on Mars|journal=Geological Journal|volume=46|issue=6|year=2011|pages=513–524|issn=0072-1050|doi=10.1002/gj.1326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subglacial lakes ==
[[File:Lake Vostok drill 2011.jpg|thumb|Lake Vostok drill 2011]]
Subglacial lakes such as [[Lake Vostok]] may give analogues of Mars habitats beneath ice sheets. In 2001, Duxbury et al. suggested that processes similar to the ones that maintain Lake Vostok liquid could work on Mars.

Sub glacial lakes are kept liquid partly by the pressure of the depth of ice, but that contributes only a few degrees of temperature rise. The main effect that keeps them liquid is the insulation of the ice blocking escape of heat from the interior of the Earth, similarly to the insulating effect of deep layers of rock. As for deep rock layers, they don't require extra geothermal heating below a certain depth.

In the case of Mars, the depth needed for geothermal melting of the basal area of a sheet of ice is 4-6 kilometers. The ice layers are probably only 3.4 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;km in thickness for the north polar cap. However, Duzbury et al. showed that the situation is different if you consider a lake that is already melted. When they applied their model to Mars, they showed that a liquid layer, once melted (initially open to the surface of the ice), could remain stable at any depth over 600 meters even in absence of extra geothermal heating.&lt;ref name="DuxburyZotikov2001"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JE001254/pdf|last1=Duxbury|first1=N.

D.|title=A numerical model for an alternative origin of Lake Vostok and its exobiological implications for Mars|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=106|issue=E1|year=2001|pages=1453&amp;ndash;1462|issn=0148-0227|doi=10.1029/2000JE001254|bibcode=2001JGR...106.1453D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, according to their model, if the polar regions had a subsurface lake perhaps formed originally through friction as a subglacial lake at times of favourable axial tilt, then supplied by accumulating layers of snow on top as the ice sheets thickened, they suggest that it could still be there. If so, it could be occupied by similar lifeforms to those that could survive in Lake Vostok.&lt;ref name="DuxburyZotikov2001" /&gt;

Ground penetrating radar could detect these lakes because of the high radar contrast between water and ice or rock. MARSIS, the ground penetrating radar on ESA's Mars Express is our best instrument for the job. After several searches, it hasn't found anything yet.&lt;ref name="LasueMangold2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lasue|first1=Jeremie|last2=Mangold|first2=Nicolas|last3=Hauber|first3=Ernst|last4=Clifford|first4=Steve|last5=Feldman|first5=William|last6=Gasnault|first6=Olivier|last7=Grima|first7=Cyril|last8=Maurice|first8=Sylvestre|last9=Mousis|first9=Olivier|title=Quantitative Assessments of the Martian Hydrosphere|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=174|issue=1–4|year=2012|page=191|issn=0038-6308|doi=10.1007/s11214-012-9946-5|bibcode=2013SSRv..174..155L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their resolution isn't that great, however, around a kilometer. We can say that Mars doesn't seem to have an equivalent of our Lake Vostok (250&amp;nbsp;km by 50&amp;nbsp;km by 0.43&amp;nbsp;km deep) at present. It could still have small subglacial lakes of up to a kilometer or so in diameter.

== Subsurface life kilometers below the surface ==

Investigations of life in deep mines, and drilling beneath the ocean depths may give an insight into possibilities for life in the Mars Hydrosphere and other deep subsurface habitats, if they exist.

== Alpine and permafrost lichens ==
In high alpine and polar regions, lichens have to cope with conditions of high UV fluxes low temperatures and arid environments. This is especially so when the two factors, polar regions and high altitudes are combined. These conditions occur in the high mountains of Antarctica, where lichens grow at altitudes up to 2,000 meters with no liquid water, just snow and ice. Researchers described this as the most Mars-like environment on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Pierre_de_Vera/publication/258227207_Adaptation_of_an_Antarctic_lichen_to_Martian_niche_conditions_can_occur_within_34_days/links/00b4952e11f3088291000000.pdf|last1=de Vera|first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Schulze-Makuch|first2=Dirk|last3=Khan|first3=Afshin|last4=Lorek|first4=Andreas|last5=Koncz|first5=Alexander|last6=Möhlmann|first6=Diedrich|last7=Spohn|first7=Tilman|title=Adaptation of an Antarctic lichen to Martian niche conditions can occur within 34 days|journal=Planetary and Space Science|volume=98|year=2014|pages=182–190|issn=0032-0633|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2013.07.014|bibcode=2014P&amp;SS...98..182D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''river pocket''' is used in [[Australia]] to refer to an area of land enclosed within the bend of a river, especially where the bend is extended or pronounced and the only road access is along the [[isthmus]].

==Examples==
Examples are [[Fig Tree Pocket, Queensland|Fig Tree Pocket]], [[Long Pocket, Queensland|Long Pocket]], [[Priors Pocket, Queensland|Priors Pocket]], [[Sapling Pocket, Queensland|Sapling Pocket]] and [[Wivenhoe Pocket, Queensland|Wivenhoe Pocket]] all on the [[Brisbane River]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12869">The '''[[toponym]]s of Finland''' result mainly from the legacy left by three linguistic heritages: the [[Finnish language]] (spoken as first language by about 93% of the population), the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish language]] (about 5.5%) and [[Sami languages]] (about 0.03%). Finland’s place names range from those of unknown or unrecognizable origins to more clearly derivable [[onomastics]]. There are both national and international recommendations on how to use the bilingual country's place names in texts written in different languages. In Finland, the [[Research Institute for the Languages of Finland]] and the [[National Land Survey of Finland]] are jointly responsible for the standardization of place names.

==Historical aspects==
A few notable place names – such as a few major hydronyms [[Päijänne]], [[Saimaa]], [[Imatra]] and [[Keitele]] which are thought to be among the oldest toponyms – still lack a sound derivation from existing languages despite of different approaches.{{clarify|date=August 2010}} This has led to the postulation that they may originate from an unknown language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1150 Article in Finnish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031539/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=1150 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A substratum of archaic Sami place names, often fennicized in the course of time, can be found throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotus.fi/files/576/toponymic_guidelines.pdf  page 9]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Finland’s toponyms can be recognized having archaic or dialectal Finnish origins. A Finnish substratum can be deduced in Swedish place names and vice versa in many cases. Major urbanisation started and city rights were granted in Finland when the country was part of Sweden in a situation where Swedish was the de facto only official language though the majority always spoke Finnish dialects as a first language. Therefore, in older foreign writing, many municipal and city names are given only in their Swedish form. Other substrata in Finland’s toponyms include Finnic, Baltic, Germanic and Slavic linguistic influence in several chronological layers.

==Jurisdiction regarding languages in Finland==
Finland, except for the [[Åland islands]], has two official languages: Finnish and Swedish. The Åland islands have a single official language: Swedish. On the mainland, Swedish-speakers are concentrated to the regions [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]], [[Uusimaa]] and around [[Turku]]. [[North Sami]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] and [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] are semi-official in the [[Sami Domicile Area]]. The Language Act of 2003 groups municipalities into three groups: monolingually Finnish, monolingually Swedish and bilingual. The municipality is monolingual, if it has less than 8% of the minority language speakers and if the population of the lingual minority in the municipality is below 3,000. Other communities are bilingual.&lt;ref name="Kielilaki 423/2003"&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2003/20030423 Kielilaki (423/2003)] 5 §. Retrieved 3-8-2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In bilingual municipalities, the Language Act requires that all toponyms have both a Finnish and a Swedish name.&lt;ref name="Kielilaki 423/2003"/&gt; In addition, many monolingually Finnish municipalities have an official Swedish name, and vice versa. The municipalities have the power to decide their own name but they are required to consult with the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland before the official decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950365 Kuntalaki (365/1995)] 5 §. Retrieved 3-8-2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conventions==
These are the current conventions recommended by the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland. The conventions have also been adopted by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names:&lt;ref&gt;TOPONYMIC GUIDELINES FOR MAP EDITORS AND OTHER EDITORS, FINLAND, (v. 4.2, 28 February 2006) [http://www.kotus.fi/files/576/toponymic_guidelines.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Finnish place names are used in the [[Finnic languages]] (such as Finnish and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]). Swedish place names are used in the [[North Germanic languages]] (such as [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]). Sami place names are used in the different Sami languages around northern Fennoscandia.
*In other languages, if that language doesn’t already have an established toponym for the place (very seldom), the choice between Finnish and Swedish toponyms is based on the demographic situation. Finnish place names are used when handling a municipality where Finnish is the majority language (90% of all municipalities,&lt;ref&gt;389 out of 431&lt;/ref&gt; 93% of the cities&lt;ref&gt;106 out of 114&lt;/ref&gt;). Swedish place naming is used when handling a municipality where Swedish is the majority language. Concerning the Sami Homeland, toponyms are written in Finnish and appended with the Sami place names.

The convention concerning street names and traffic signs maintains that the majority language toponym is presented topmost and place names in the minority languages are listed below.

===Possible deviations in the conventions===
A few exonyms (in [[Medieval Latin|Medieval]] or [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]], not in use in Finland or Sweden) exist for Finland’s provincial structures. These include the names of the nine historical provinces (Fi: maakunta, Sw: landskap) that have given names to some of Finland’s current regions (Fi: maakunta, Sw: landskap, altogether 20 as of 1997). These may fall under the category of "already established place names in foreign languages" mentioned in the above recommendations.

The names of the nine historical provinces in Finnish, Swedish and English :

:1. Varsinais-Suomi fi; Egentliga Finland sv; [[Finland Proper]] en 
:2. [[Uusimaa]] fi, en; Nyland sv 
:3. [[Satakunta]] fi, sv, en 
:4. Häme fi; Tavastland sv; [[Tavastia Proper|Tavastia]] en 
:5. [[Savonia (historical province)|Savo]] fi, en; Savolax sv 
:6. Karjala fi; Karelen sv; [[Karelia]] en 
:7. Pohjanmaa fi; Österbotten sv; [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] en 
:8. Lappi fi; Lappland sv; [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] en 
:9. Åland sv, en; Ahvenanmaa fi

===Guidelines for naming new places===
In urban planning, new names are needed for different places. Suburbs, streets, parks and other areas must be named. In bilingual municipalities, the task is complicated by the need to use two different languages in the toponyms. As all municipalities in the Finnish capital region, which is the most swiftly developing area in Finland, are bilingual, the problem of devising good toponyms is not a small task.

The [[Research Institute for the Languages of Finland]] has given guidelines for devising new toponyms. The basic principle is to use toponyms already in use and spell them according to the modern language norms. As the old toponym for a minor place, such as a field, often exist only in one language, they should be translated with care. Only such names which carry an identifiable meaning should be translated directly. If the toponym already exists in both languages, the existing forms should be used. If the translation of the name is unfeasible and there exists no toponym in the other language, then the toponym should be loaned in its original form. Personal names should not be translated. However, if the existing name is unusable in the other language for phonetic or grammatical reasons, a new name may be freely invented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotus.fi/ohjeet/suomen_kielen_lautakunnan_suosituksia/suositukset/ohjeet_kaksikielisen_alueen_kaava-_ja_haja-asutusalueiden_nimien_antamiseen Nimistönsuunnittelu i.e. plan for naming]. Retrieved 2015 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases where two municipalities are fused together, create a special case for the construction of toponyms. There are two simple cases for the name selection:
*smaller municipalities joining a city: the name of the city should be used
*municipalities which have been chapel parishes joining the municipality which has been the mother parish: the name of the historical mother parish should be used.&lt;ref name="kotus.fi"&gt;[http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=509 Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskus. Yhdistyvien kuntien nimet.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013237/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?s=509 |date=2007-09-30 }} 7-12-2006. Retrieved 3-8-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, the toponym should be selected from the historical toponyms of the area. In many cases, there are historical administrative structures that have encompassed the area of the merging municipalities. If such names are unusable, the name of some the most prominent villages in the area should be used. To reduce the possibility of confusion, the new name should not include the name of the province or the region. In no case should the name be made up of two parts, because the use of such name is grammatically difficult in Finnish language. The names of the merger projects or frivolous names should also be avoided at all costs.&lt;ref name="kotus.fi"/&gt;

If the merging municipalities will form a bilingual municipality, the Finnish name chosen for the municipality should be such that a Swedish counterpart can be found without difficulty. The Swedish name of the new municipality should be devised according to the same principles as in other toponymical planning.&lt;ref name="kotus.fi"/&gt;

===Finnish Grammar===

In [[Finnish grammar]], some toponyms receive external locative suffixes, especially those named for bodies of water, as in (river and town Seinäjoki) ''Seinäjoe'''lla''''' (either on river Seinäjoki or in town Seinäjoki. Case of being in or under the river being ''Seinäjoe'''ssa'''''). The rest receive internal locative suffixes, as in ''Helsingi'''ssä''''' (being inflected form of the town, meaning: in Helsinki).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotus.fi/julkaisut/nimijulkaisut/paikannimijulkaisut/kuntien_nimet_ja_niiden_taivutus Examples of inflections of location names in Finnish and in Swedish (noted as "ruots.") where applicable]{{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Can anyone provide a complete list?-- 

--(TL;DR=not going to happen, never for everywhere... I tried searching, that last &lt;ref&gt; there are too many different inflections.) Anyhow long story long:

Hi, I do not think it is applicable, there is 
-more than 180.000 lakes size larger than 500m2, locations&amp;names of those and towns/villages near them inflected, same
-goes for rivers, islands, capes etc. (and ofc locations nearby) as most of them inflect differently,
-some rules (Joroinen-&gt;Joroisissa) are beyond me (I am almost sure it has something to do with those vocals being there, we cannot pronounce it without a more or less special case in naming)
-also there is the naming convention(I changed a dead link in reference to point to new instructions on naming(anything))
-AND on top of it all there is ongoing major reshaping&amp;combining&amp;namechanging of municipalities etc starting at the moment (12/2015-) (this is not the one older renaming &amp; reshaping that is discussed in another location in-text)
-also, a new/not liked name can be freely shaped/changed considering local custom, ancient names etc instructions which are given in another link up there, Nimistönsuunnittelu (I updated, Finnish), after suggested&amp;inspected&amp;tc can be voted on change

But it is simple after you speak just few words in the language, see [[KOTUS]] (KOTUS is both required by law and is really needed) and then see some locations in http://www.kotus.fi/julkaisut/nimijulkaisut/paikannimijulkaisut/kuntien_nimet_ja_niiden_taivutus - it includes Swedish language names where applicable, i.e. where 8% or more speak (first language) Swedish/Finnish or locals want(in very many cases)...). Swedish were in parentheses I seem to recall.

Also even some major town names are going to change now when they join with nearby counties (when it happens, "soon"). OFC mail comes via direct name of the location so inflections not needed there either.

Also, why add more references to KOTUS pages, everyone who understands Finnish/Swedish knows these inflections OR can search KOTUS's site. Foreigners can inflect the few names they need/use or just speak English (mostly understood well). Or use non-inflected versions, we understand, trust me.

Feel free to remove my extra ramblings as required, Suchros --&gt;
