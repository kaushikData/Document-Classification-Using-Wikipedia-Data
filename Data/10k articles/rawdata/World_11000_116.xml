[[File:Virgin Radio office London.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt; No 1 Golden Square with "Virgin Radio" branding, 1993 – 2008.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The [[Broadcasting Act 1990|1990 Broadcasting Act]] allowed for the launch of independent national radio (INR) stations in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Act 1990 |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2771854 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |accessdate=2 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628140547/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2771854 |archivedate=28 June 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ofcom|Radio Authority]] was mandated to award three INR licences, one of which (INR1) had to be for a 'non-pop' station (which was awarded to [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]), and one of which had to be for a predominantly speech-based service (this would be advertised later as INR3 and would be awarded to [[Talksport|Talk Radio]]). The remaining licence was to be open to 'all-comers'. The licences were to be awarded to the highest cash bidder, providing that the applicant met criteria set down in the Broadcasting Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fact Sheet 3: The Radio Authority: Its licences and licensing procedures | publisher = Radio Authority | location = London | url = http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/rau/about-ra/factsheets/fs3.html  | accessdate =2 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110605121120/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/rau/about-ra/factsheets/fs3.html| archivedate= 5 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second national licence, INR2, would take over the 1197&amp;nbsp;kHz and 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz frequencies, which were to be relinquished by [[BBC Radio 3]].&lt;ref name="guardian-19920205"&gt;{{cite news | title = Pop hopefuls go under the hammer and over the top | first = Martin | last = Linton | url = http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_DIGITALARCHIVE&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=GUA/1992/02/05&amp;ChunkNum=-1&amp;ID=Ar00300&amp;PageLabel=3 | work = The Guardian | page = 3 | location = London | date = 5 February 1992 | accessdate =2 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence was advertised in October 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Radio Authority consults on INR opt-outs | publisher = Radio Authority | location = London | url = http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/rau/newsroom/news-release/99/pr094.htm | accessdate =2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five organisations bid: the Independent National Broadcasting Company of Sheffield, which bid £4,010,000 per year; a [[TV-am]]/[[Virgin Group|Virgin]] consortium (£1,883,000); [[Chiltern Radio Network|Chiltern Radio's]] 20/20 Radio (£1,311,000); [[Radio Clyde]]'s Score Radio (£701,000); and a consortium of [[RTL Group|CLT]], [[Harvey Goldsmith]] and [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] (£211,000).&lt;ref name="guardian-19920205" /&gt; The TV-am/Virgin consortium was awarded the licence in April 1992, after the Radio Authority said that it was not satisfied that Independent National Broadcasting would be able to sustain the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = TV-am and Virgin awarded pop radio franchise | first = Georgina | last = Henry | url = http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_DIGITALARCHIVE&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=GUA/1992/04/03&amp;ChunkNum=-1&amp;ID=Ar00209&amp;PageLabel=2 | work = The Guardian | location = London | page = 2 | date = 3 April 1992 | accessdate =2 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, TV-am lost its [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = TV-am gives up hunt for a new business | first = Patrick | last = Hosking | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/tvam-gives-up-hunt-for-a-new-business-1561057.html | work = The Independent | location = London | date = 2 December 1992 | accessdate =8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its stake in the radio station was sold in March 1993&lt;ref name="Guardian-19930419"&gt;{{cite news | title = Sing-along-a-Branson | first = Andrew | last = Culf | url = http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_DIGITALARCHIVE&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=GUA/1993/04/19&amp;ChunkNum=-1&amp;ID=Ar02200&amp;PageLabel=22 | work = The Guardian | location = London | page = 22 | date = 19 April 1993 | accessdate =8 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Apax Partners]], [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan Investment Corporation]] and [[David Frost|Sir David Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Branson takes to the airwaves: Hopes are high as Virgin Radio begins broadcasting. | first = Patrick  | last = Hosking | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/branson-takes-to-the-airwaves-hopes-are-high-as-virgin-radio-begins-broadcasting-patrick-hosking-reports-1458133.html | work = The Independent | location = London | date = 29 April 1993 | accessdate =8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer-1997-04-13"&gt;{{cite news | title = Branson to buy back radio shares | first = Emily | last = Bell | url = http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_DIGITALARCHIVE&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=TOB/1997/04/13&amp;ChunkNum=-1&amp;ID=Ar03706&amp;PageLabel=37 | work = The Observer | location = London | page =  37 | date = 13 April 1997 | accessdate =29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1997, Chris Evans had left his role as presenter of the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] breakfast show as a result of a disagreement between him and the programme controller [[Matthew Bannister]] (Evans had asked for Fridays off to allow more time for him to work on his [[Channel 4]] television show, [[TFI Friday]]).{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=254-258}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Evans severs Radio 1 links after failing to present breakfast show | first = Andrew | last = Culf | url = http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_DIGITALARCHIVE&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=GUA/1997/01/21&amp;ChunkNum=-1&amp;ID=Ar00503&amp;PageLabel=5 | work = The Guardian | location = London | page =  5 | date = 21 January 1997 | accessdate =29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans was keen to return to radio{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=278-284}} and it had been reported that his agent, Michael Foster, had approached [[Matthew Bannister]] to ask if Evans would be allowed to be return to Radio 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Evans wanted Radio 1 show back | first = John | last = Mulholland | url = http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_DIGITALARCHIVE&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=GUA/1997/10/13&amp;ChunkNum=-1&amp;ID=Ar00103&amp;PageLabel=1 | work = The Guardian | location = London | page =  1 | date = 13 October 1997 | accessdate =29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he had gone as far as commencing negotiations to buy Talk Radio.{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=283-284}}

Richard Branson wanted Evans to work for Virgin Radio, so much so that he joined him on a [[Concorde]] flight to New York to try to persuade him to join as the drive time presenter.{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=265-275}}&lt;ref name="Guardian-19971004"&gt;{{cite news | title = Branson woos Evans to Virgin's breakfast slot | first = Kamal | last = Ahmed | url = http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_DIGITALARCHIVE&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=GUA/1997/10/04&amp;ChunkNum=-1&amp;ID=Ar00204&amp;PageLabel=2 | work = The Guardian | location = London | page =  2 | date = 4 October 1997 | accessdate =29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Virgin Radio hired Evans to present the breakfast show, replacing the incumbent Russ 'n' Jono show (presented by [[Russ Williams (DJ)|Russ Williams]] and [[Jonathan Coleman (presenter)|Jonathan Coleman]]). His show started on 13 October 1997, the same day that [[Zoë Ball]] started as Evans' replacement on Radio 1.{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=287-289}} The initial contract would only be for 10 weeks, until the MMC announced its decision on the Capital Radio takeover.&lt;ref name="Guardian-19971004" /&gt; Evans approached David Campbell to discuss buying the radio station and, with Michael Foster's help, they put together a deal to buy it with venture capital supplied by Apax Partners and [[BNP Paribas|Paribas]], with Virgin Group retaining a 20% stake in the business.{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=290-317}} The deal was announced on 8 December 1997, and would see the formation of the Ginger Media Group, an umbrella company overseeing Virgin Radio and producing programmes such as TFI Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chris Evans takes over at Virgin Radio | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/37990.stm | publisher = BBC News | location = London | date = 9 December 1997 | accessdate =29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BBC faces new onslaught as Evans snatches Virgin Radio | first = Simon | last = Beavis | first2 = Chris | last2 = Barrie | url = http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToSaveGifMSIE_DIGITALARCHIVE&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=GUA/1997/12/09&amp;ChunkNum=-1&amp;ID=Ar00201&amp;PageLabel=2 | work = The Guardian | location = London | page =  2 | date = 9 December 1997 | accessdate =29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998–2000: The Ginger Media Group ===
Evans' ownership of Virgin Radio started well, with a breakfast show audience increase of 660,000 to 2.2m in his first three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Evans claims victory in breakfast war | first = Paul | last = McCann | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/evans-claims-victory-in-breakfast-war-1143266.html | work = The Independent | location = London | date = 7 February 1998 | accessdate =29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1998, Chris Evans took a spur of the moment decision one weekend to launch a Saturday afternoon show called Rock 'n' Roll Football, a show that is still broadcast on Absolute Radio.{{sfn|Evans|2010}} From 5 October 1998, Virgin Radio started simulcasts of the breakfast show on [[Sky One]] each morning for an hour between 7.30 and 8.30&amp;nbsp;am. When a track was played on the radio, viewers would see a video at the same time.&lt;ref name="Bowie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A bumper breakfast, with ulcers | first = Hester | last = Lacey | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/a-bumper-breakfast-with-ulcers-1176033.html | work = The Independent | location = London | date = 4 October 1998 | accessdate =29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the new football season in August 1999 saw [[Terry Venables]] join Russ Williams in a show that would precede Rock 'n' Roll Football.&lt;ref name="Bowie" /&gt; At the end of 1999, in response to the TV programme [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The management team at the Ginger Media Group were considering expansion opportunities, including a plan to acquire the [[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] newspaper from [[United Business Media|United News &amp; Media]], and hire [[Piers Morgan]] to edit it. Their plans were stalled, however, when the shareholders got cold feet. Evans wrote in his autobiography that "the management wanted to stick to our original brief of expansion, whereas our investors only cared about extracting the added value."{{sfn|Evans|2010}}

=== 2000–2008: SMG ownership ===
The management team therefore set itself on a strategy to sell the business three years ahead of schedule.{{sfn|Evans|2010}} It hired [[Goldman Sachs]] to run the sale process, and considered a public flotation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Evans ponders float for Ginger | first = Julia | last = Finch | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/aug/20/12 | work = The Guardian | location = London | page =  31 | date = 20 August 1999 | accessdate =30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; before selling to the [[STV Group plc|Scottish Media Group]] (now ''STV Group plc'') for £225&amp;nbsp;million in March 2000. The Scottish Media Group, which owned [[Scottish Television]] and the [[The Herald (Glasgow)|Herald]] newspaper, fought off other bidders including [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]], [[NRJ Radio|NRJ]] and [[Guardian Media Group|Guardian Media]]. Evans personally made £75&amp;nbsp;million out of the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Evans sells up | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/601640.stm | publisher = BBC News | location = London | date = 13 January 2000 | accessdate =29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans was subsequently fired by his new employer in 2001 for failing to report into work for five consecutive days while reportedly partying with his then wife [[Billie Piper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Virgin axes DJ Evans | publisher = BBC News | date = 28 June 2001 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1412225.stm  | accessdate =27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief executive John Pearson, who had been with the station since before launch, resigned in April 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pearson quits as chief of SMG radio, leaving Virgin Radio rudderless | first = Damian | last = Reece | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/pearson-quits-as-chief-of-smg-radio-leaving-virgin-radio-rudderless-543626.html | work = The Independent | location = London | date = 13 October 2004 | accessdate =1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by Fru Hazlitt, who had previously been managing director of [[Yahoo!]] UK and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Virgin Radio hires chief executive to fend off unwanted bidders | first = Saeed | last = Shah | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/virgin-radio-hires-chief-executive-to-fend-off-unwanted-bidders-495411.html | work = The Independent | location = London | date = 19 April 2005 | accessdate =1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June 2006, SMG plc signed a deal with YooMedia to make Virgin Radio available on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. It has always placed a great emphasis on other methods of transmission than medium wave, as the 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency suffers from considerable interference, particularly after dark – BBC Radio 1, which used 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz for its first 11 years on air, moved to higher-quality medium wave frequencies (now used by [[talkSport]]) in 1978 mainly for this reason.

On 1 September 2008 it was announced that Virgin Radio would be rebranded as Absolute Radio at the end of the month (28 September).&lt;ref name="Absolute Radio" /&gt; At the same time some changes to the line-up were made known with [[JK and Joel]], [[Robin Burke]], [[Tony Hadley]] and [[John Osborne (broadcaster)|John Osborne]] leaving the station and [[Allan Lake]], [[Joanna Russell]] (of [[Trent FM]]'s Jo &amp; Twiggy) and [[Tim Shaw (presenter)|Tim Shaw]] joining,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/about/questions.html|title=Listeners' Questions about Absolute Radio|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=3 May 2011|publisher=Virgin Radio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019045517/http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/about/questions.html|archive-date=19 October 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Osborne would return shortly after.
However, listening figures revealed for the final quarter of 2008 revealed that almost 20% of former Virgin Radio listeners had been lost since the rebranding to Absolute Radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/876906/Commercial-radios-share-dips-Q4-2008/ Commercial radio's share dips in Q4 2008] Brand Republic, 29 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, by September 2014, all other London-based [[Bauer Radio|Bauer]] stations permanently moved from Mappin House to a refurbished [[Golden Square|One Golden Square]], creating a new national radio hub.

Owner Bauer Radio announced in July 2015 that Absolute Radio would be taking up the 105.2 FM frequency in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], previously held by [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]].

A year after launch, David Campbell was quoted as saying that "the music policy was wrong, even though Virgin had lots of research to suggest it was doing what listeners said they wanted. We did something we should never do: pursue critical acclaim, playing obscure tracks, gaining the praise of the music press." The station's approach had been to mix in more familiar music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Rock station that is finally on a roll: The wrong music policy and poor reception gave Virgin a shaky first year | first = Maggie | last = Brown | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/media-rock-station-that-is-finally-on-a-roll-the-wrong-music-policy-and-poor-reception-gave-virgin-a-shaky-first-year-reports-maggie-brown-1372663.html | work = The Independent | location = London | date = 27 April 1994 | accessdate =30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fru Hazlitt, when interviewed for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in September 2006, described the type of music the station championed: "It's pretty much mainstream rock festival type music. [[Razorlight]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]]. These bands are becoming some of the biggest in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tuned in to Virgin | work = The Guardian | date = 25 September 2006 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/sep/25/commercialradio.radio | accessdate =27 November 2007 | first=Owen | last=Gibson| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071113140954/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/sep/25/commercialradio.radio| archivedate= 13 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When announcing the rebrand as Absolute Radio on the One Golden Square blog, Clive Dickens, chief operating officer, noted that the station would be "sticking with real music – not manufactured rubbish – and we're building on the amount of live music we do – we're just going to discover more of all of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dickens | first = Clive | title = Absolute Clarity | date = 2 September 2008 | url = http://onegoldensquare.com/2008/09/absolute-clarity-by-clive-dickens/ | accessdate =30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music policy continues to focus on guitar-based rock, mostly British. In a blog post in February 2009, Head of Music James Curran noted that the 30 most played artists in the first four months of Absolute Radio had been: [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Coldplay]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Snow Patrol]], [[Kings of Leon]], [[The Killers]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Travis (band)|Travis]], [[U2]], [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], [[Suede (band)|Suede]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Kasabian]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Stereophonics]], [[Caesars (band)|Caesars]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Nickelback]], [[The Offspring]], [[Aerosmith]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Biffy Clyro]], [[The Beatles]], [[David Bowie]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[The Police]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Curran | first = James | title = Listen to the Music | date = 4 February 2009 | url = http://onegoldensquare.com/2009/02/listen-to-the-music-by-james-curran/ | accessdate =30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Studios ===
Virgin Radio and Absolute Radio broadcast from studios at 1 Golden Square since Virgin Radio's launch in 1993.&lt;ref name="Bowie" /&gt;

=== AM transmission ===
The 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency (247 metres) was used, in selected areas only, by the BBC Light Programme until 1967. It was then used nationally as the original home of BBC Radio 1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Scott |first1= Robin|date= 8 June 1968|title= The British Radio Scene: A Special Report|journal= Billboard|volume= 80 |issue= 23 |page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=30 May 2011|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 22 November 1978, then from 23 November 1978 until 28 February 1992 by BBC Radio 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbceng.info/Technical%20Reviews/dev_am_tx_nw_6a.pdf |title= Development of the BBC A.M.

In a number of areas, particularly where the signals from the main 1215 transmitters overlap with each other, Absolute Radio uses filler transmitters on different frequencies.

=== FM transmission ===

The station is available on 105.8 FM from the [[Crystal Palace transmitting station]] in London and on 105.2 FM in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] from the [[Sutton Coldfield transmitting station]].

The signal from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter is audible throughout a large part of the Midlands, including the counties of [[Staffordshire]], Derbyshire, [[Leicestershire]], Warwickshire and [[Worcestershire]]. It can be heard with fairly decent quality down to [[Gloucester]] on the [[M5 motorway]].

==Life==
She was the daughter of Władysław Rabski and Zuzanna, née Kraushar. She attended the independent ''[[Cecylia Plater-Zyberk]] Secondary Academy for Girls'' in Warsaw. She gained her [[School-leaving certificate]] in 1924 and went on to read law at [[Warsaw Univeristy|Warsaw University]] graduating in 1928. In 1927 she married [[Zbigniew Stypułkowski]]. On completing her [[Pupillage]] in 1934, she opened a legal practice with her husband. With the outbreak of the [[Second world war]], she became involved in the [[Polish underground resistance]]. In March 1940 she was detained for two months in [[Pawiak prison]]. In November 1943 she was again arrested and in March 1944, sent to [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]]. She was liberated in April 1945 and, with several thousand other women inmates, evacuated for convalescence to [[Sweden]], where she remained until 1947.

That same year she left for [[Great Britain]], where she worked in the editorial office of the ''[[Dziennik Polski (United Kingdom)|Dziennik Polski]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=kJP6DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=Aleksandra+Stypu%C5%82kowska&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz0YWD4YHfAhVyqIsKHYOMDFoQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Aleksandra%20Stypu%C5%82kowska&amp;f=false|title=Broadcasting in the UK and US in the 1950s: Historical Perspectives|last=Jamie Medhurst, Siân Nicholas, Tom O’Malley|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became president of the ''Polish Association of former German Political Prisoners and Inmates of Concentration Camps''. In 1952 she moved to [[West Germany]] to work with the [[CIA]]-funded [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Polish Section of Radio Free Europe]]. In 1959 she became an editor and a commentator on the [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] programme, ''"Facts, events and opinions"''. Her voice became one of the most recognisable at the station. In 1974 she retired and returned to London, while continuing to provide political commentary for ''RFE''.

In 1980, she was a co-founder in Britain of ''the Information Centre for Polish Affairs'' with the aims of monitoring [[Human rights abuse]]s and fostering democratic institutions in [[Poland]]. She was its first president. In September 2010, she was posthumously awarded the Commander's Cross with Star [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] "for outstanding services in support of democratic transformation in Poland, for humanitarian aid to Poles during [[martial law]] and for her social activism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prezydent.pl/archiwum-bronislawa-komorowskiego/aktualnosci/ordery-i-odznaczenia/art,839,odznaczenia-za-wspieranie-przemian-demokratycznych.html Odznaczenia za wspieranie przemian demokratycznych].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postanowienie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z dnia 11 grudnia 2009 r. o nadaniu orderów i odznaczeń ({{Monitor Polski|2010|29|390}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

From her marriage she had a son, Andrzej Stypułkowski, born 1929 who also became an émigré political activist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1671">'''Ardericca in Susiana''' (also spelled Arderikka) was an ancient village in [[Cissia (area)|Cissia]] mentioned by [[Herodotus]] (6.119.2). Described as being located about 40 km from [[Susa]], it is noted for being the location where the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] king [[Darius I]] (r. 522-486 BC) settled the inhabitants of [[Eretria]], after the city was taken by his admiral [[Datis]] in 490 BC. The site is commonly identified with the modern-day place of "Kīr-āb", located to the north of Susa. Herodotus further states that the village was famous for a spring located 7 km from it, where salt, oil and [[asphalt]] were produced. He also described it as being a ''stathmos'' ("[[farmstead]]") of Darius I, implying that Ardericca in Susiana was perhaps one of the king's own estates.

'''Bharati''' ([[Hindi]]: भारती) is an [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] research station commissioned by [[India]]. It is India's third Antarctic research facility and one of two active Indian research stations, alongside [[Maitri]]. India's first committed research facility, [[Dakshin Gangotri]], is being used as a supply base. India has demarcated an area beside [[Larsemann Hills]] at 69°S, 76°E for construction. The research station has been operational since 18 March 2012, though it is still being run on trial basis and formal launch is awaited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abhai Mishra &amp; Bhagwati Prasad|url=http://stampsofindia.com/readroom/Bharati.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915014644/http://stampsofindia.com/readroom/Bharati.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 September 2012|publisher=Stamps of India|access-date=11 September 2016|title=Inauguration of India's new Antarctic Station 'Bharati'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Fernandes | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-26/goa/32423797_1_antarctic-treaty-ncaor-larsemann-hills | work=Times Of India | location=Delhi, India | title=India's station in Antarctic operational | date=26 June 2012|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its completion, India has become one of nine nations to have multiple stations within the [[Antarctic Circle]].

The project for setting up of the ground is undertaken by the Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) from the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) for a contract value of ₹ 50 [[crore]] (₹ 500 million).{{fact|date=May 2018}}

High-speed satellite raw data would be beamed in real time from Bharati Station to NRSC (National Remote Sensing Centre) in Hyderabad for processing the images once the project starts functioning.

In 2007, ECIL also established the communication link between Maitri, the second Indian research station in Antarctica and NCAOR. Among others, research on tectonics and geological structures would be undertaken at Bharati Station by Indian scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State of the art Bharati station to come up soon|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/article3374556.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=6 May 2012 | location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|first=Y.|last=Mallikarjun|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Conrad Sophus [[Danneskiold-Samsøe]]''' (29 August 1836 - 1 November 1908), normally referred to as '''Christian Danneskiold-Samsøe''', was a Danish count, landowner and administrative leader of the [[Royal Danish Theatre]].

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Copenhagen]] as the son of Postmaster-General [[Sophus Danneskiold-Samsøe]] and Frederikke Marie Danneskiold-Samsøe née [[Levetzow]]. He completed secondary school in 1855 and became cand. polit. from the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Teater_og_film/Teaterchef/Christian_Danneskiold-Sams%C3%B8e|title=Christian Danneskiold-Samsøe|language=Danish|publisher=[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He headed the court of crown prince Frederik (Frederik VIII) in 1869-76.

He was largely unknown by the general public when he succeeded Edvard Fallesen as head of the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] in August 1904. His appointment was met with skepticism but he soon gained recognition for his work with restoring the economy of the theatre.

==Property==
He owned Annerup in 1863-74, [[Christiansholm, Gentofte Municipality|Christiansholm]] at [[Klampenborg]] in 1863-1900 and [[Nordfeld]], Ålebækgård and Klosterskov in [[Møn]] from 1994.

*  Christian Valdemar Danneskiold-Samsøe (16 February 1864 - 14 March 1931)
* Frederikke Sophie Elisabeth Danneskiold-Samsøe (26 June 1865 - 8 July 1949)
* Elisabeth Danneskiold-Samsøe (28 October 1866 - 1950)
* Ove Danneskiold-Samsøe (22 December 1867 - 8 April 1947=
* Viggo Danneskiold-Samsøe (29 May 1874 - 24 January 1936)

[[File:Coat of arms of Crimean ASSR.svg|left|thumb|196x196px|Crimean ASSR (1938-1945, 1991-92)]]
Both the Ukrainian [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] and the Russian [[Republic of Crimea]] use the same '''coat of arms''' ({{lang-ru|Герб Крыма}}, {{lang-uk|Герб Криму}}).{{#tag:ref|A March 2014 [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262|UN resolution]] confirming Crimea is still part of Ukraine was backed by 100 of the [[United Nations member states]], with only 11 members rejecting it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/ukraine-russia-crimea-resolution-609/ Article on the RT (Russia Today) website]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}, which has been in use since 1992.

==Description==
The coat of arms consists of a red [[Varangians|Varangian shield]] and a silver [[griffin]] passant facing to the [[dexter and sinister|heraldic right]] with an [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] [[pearl]] in its right paw. On either sides of the shield are a white pillar. At the top of the shield sits the rising [[sun]]. Winding around both columns and under the shield rests the [[Flag of Crimea]], a [[blue]]–[[white]]–[[red]] tricolor ribbon, unto which the Motto of Crimea, ''Процветание в единстве'' (translated as ''Prosperity in unity''), is inscribed.

The Varangian shield is symbolic of the fact that the region of Crimea was for a long time a crossing of major trade routes.&lt;ref name="fotw"&gt;[http://www.fotw.net/flags/ua-krim.html#coa fotw.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311111602/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ua-krim.html |date=2007-03-11 }} — Crimea Autonomous Republic (Ukraine)&lt;/ref&gt; The red field of the coat of arms symbolizes the intense [[Crimea#History|history of Crimea]].&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; The griffin is placed on the coat of arms because it is commonly used to represent the territory north of the [[Black Sea]], and is known as the "coat of arms" of [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]] and [[Panticapaeum]], where one can see the griffin on artifacts from the area.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;

Another variation in the symbolism is that the pearl is symbolic of Crimea as a part of [[Earth]], and the griffin as the defender of the young republic.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; The [[pearl]]'s azure is reminiscent of the combined culture of Crimea. The white pillars are said to be reminiscent of the ancient civilizations which inhabited the peninsula. The rising sun is symbolic of prosperity and regeneration.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt;

'''Cypriot–Greek relations''' are the foreign relations between '''[[Cyprus]]''' and '''[[Greece]]'''. Cyprus has an embassy in [[Athens]] and a consulate-general in [[Thessaloniki]]. Greece has an embassy in [[Nicosia]]. Both countries are full members of the [[European Union]], [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)]]. Relations between the two countries have been exceptionally close since antiquity. The Greek Cypriot majority in Cyprus and the ethnic Greek population of Greece share a common ethnicity, heritage, language, and religion, leading to an exceptionally close relationship between the two countries. Traditionally, Greece has been the major export and import partner of Cyprus.

'''High-definition television in Singapore''' is already in "stage conversion".

Although many households in [[Singapore]] own [[HD ready]] or [[Full HD]] television sets some of them are still broadcast in [[SDTV]]. However, these were in stage conversion with the digital television.

== Trial==
On Friday, 1 December 2006 based in Singapore began HDTV trials. Two Singaporean broadcasters were involved, MediaCorp (broadcasting [[High-definition video|HD]] in [[DVB-T]]) and [[StarHub Cable Vision]] ([[DVB-C]]). Both broadcast in [[1080i]], but at 50&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], in line with the traditional [[PAL]] frequency Singapore uses. Triallists were selected from applicants who had applied prior to 22 December 2006 and there are a total of 1000 participants in the trial. These trials closed at the end of 31 December 2007.

==Services==
[[MediaCorp]]'s [[MediaCorp HD5|HD5]] is Singapore's first over-the-air [[HDTV]] channel [[simulcasting]] HD version of [[MediaCorp Channel 5]] programming in 1080i. It is the first terrestrial broadcast HD channel in South East Asia and also first in the world to use [[MPEG-4 AVC]] compression.

[[StarHub TV]] is a Singapore cable television provider currently airs more than 30 HD channels.

[[Singtel TV]] is a Singapore [[IPTV]] service.

In the wake of [[Typhoon Haiyan]], the [[Philippines]] received numerous messages of condolence and offers of assistance from a range of international leaders.

== Supranational bodies ==
The United Nations said it was going to increase critical relief operations as a result of the devastation caused by the typhoon. Its Manila office issued a statement that read, "Access remains a key challenge as some areas are still cut off from relief operations. Unknown numbers of survivors do not have basic necessities such as food, water and medicines and remain inaccessible for relief operations, as roads, airports and bridges were destroyed or covered in wreckage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-09/typhoon-haiyan-nearing-vietnam-after-killing-138-in-philippines.html | title=UN Rushes Aid as Typhoon Haiyan Leaves Philippines Counting Dead | publisher=''[[Bloomberg News]]'' | date=November 10, 2013 | accessdate=November 13, 2013 | author=Yap, Cecilia, Guinto, Joel &amp; Bennett, Simeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations also began relief operations by this time; however, the severe damage to infrastructure hampered efforts to distribute supplies.&lt;ref name="CBSNov10"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/typhoon-haiyan-slams-into-northern-vietnam/ | title=Typhoon Haiyan slams into northern Vietnam | publisher=''[[CBS News]]'' | agency=''[[Associated Press]]'' | date=November 10, 2013 | accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN activated the Cluster System, in which groups of humanitarian organizations (UN and non-UN) work to restore health, shelter, nutrition and economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://philippines.humanitarianresponse.info/system/files/documents/files/OCHA_SitRep22-Haiyan-10-Dec-2103.pdf  | title= Philippines: Typhoon Haiyan Situation Report No. 22 | date=10 December 2013| accessdate=December 12, 2013 | newspaper=[[OCHA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]], which leads the Health Cluster, the largest one, has developed guidance on donations of medicine and healthcare equipment, so that the Philippines receives supplies appropriate for this emergency. According to [[WHO]], many people suffered cuts, wounds, and broken bones during the disaster and others were injured in flooding that followed the typhoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/typhoon-haiyan-20131113/en/index.html | title=Relief arriving in the Philippines, challenges for delivery persist | date=November 15, 2013 | accessdate=November 11, 2013 | work=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpol announced that they would send in Interpol officers from Lyon to help local law enforcement identify any of the corpses that are unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.apa.az/xeber_interpol_sends_expertise_team_for_typhoo_202942.html | title=Interpol sends expertise team for typhoon-stricken Philippines | publisher=''[[Azeri-Press Agency]]'' | date=November 20, 2013 | accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] has spearheaded initiatives among help workers, especially from the [[Department of Health (Philippines)]], in extending Psychological First Aid to people in typhoon-affected areas. WHO Representative in the country Dr [[Julie Hall]] foresees long-lasting effects from the typhoon. She calls for increased preparedness to give support to families and communities for the long-term, citing the need for more trained field workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/philippines/mediacentre/releases/20131216/en/ | title=WHO recommendations for mental health support in emergencies shared with DoH | date=December 16, 2012 | accessdate=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
[[South Africa]] gave humanitarian assistance through sending its delegation composing of medics and aid workers to calamity-affected areas.

==Politics involving aid relief==
The aid contributions of [[China]] and the [[United States]] were given focus with regards to their involvement in the politics of the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/SEA-01-131113.html | title=US gives, China withholds in Philippine crisis | publisher=''[[Asia Times]]'' | date=November 13, 2013 | accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from having the two largest economies in the world, both countries are involved in a complex relationship with the island country. China is currently [[Spratly islands dispute|disputing]] the [[Spratly Islands]] in the [[South China Sea]] with the Philippines while the United States used to be an occupying power and currently has a [[Mutual Defense Treaty (U.S.–Philippines)|mutual defense treaty with the islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2013/11/13/typhoon-haiyan-the-philippines-the-united-states-and-china/ | title=Typhoon Haiyan, the Philippines, the United States, and China | publisher=''[[Council of Foreign Relations]]'' | date=November 13, 2013 | accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] was initially criticized for its meager contribution of US $100,000 to the typhoon victims, which led to commentary about its disputes with the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/11/14/amid-territorial-spat-with-manila-china-paltry-offer-typhoon-aid-threatens/ | title=Amid territorial spat with Manila, China's paltry offer of typhoon aid threatens global image | publisher=''[[Fox News]]'' | date=November 14, 2013 | accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2013, [[Philippines v. China|the Philippines sued China]] over the [[nine-dotted line]]. Commentators attribute this low amount to China's intentions to isolate the Philippines while strengthening its ties with the rest of [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24938874 | title=China's Philippine aid controversy | publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' | date=November 14, 2013 | accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move had mixed reactions from the public of China with some commending its decision while others, such as ''[[The Global Times]]'', insisted that China should be a responsible power. China later increased its contributions to US$1.4 million &lt;ref name="China Increases Aid to Philippines"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://world.time.com/2013/11/13/china-to-philippines-here-have-a-measly-100000-in-aid/ | title=China to Philippines: Here, Have a Measly $100,000 in Aid | publisher=''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' | date=November 13, 2013 | accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sent its naval hospital ship ''[[Peace Ark]]'' for disaster relief."&lt;ref name="peace-ark"/&gt;

The contributions of the [[United States]] was in contrast to that of China. It gave the Philippines an amount of US$20 million worth of aid apart from deploying the [[United States Marines]] in order to assist with the humanitarian operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/521790/20131113/haiyan-super-typhoon-warships-britain-send-philippines.htm#.UoS_mxqpWSo | title=Haiyan: U.S., Britain Send Warships to Philippines as New Weather Disturbance Threatens Relief Operations | publisher=''[[The International Business Times]]'' | date=November 13, 2013 | accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen by observers as part of the Asia pivot that the United States government had previously announced. The Philippine government had been discussing with the U.S. plans regarding the deployment of U.S. military troops within the country. Aid contributions of the U.S. was seen as a sign of goodwill in order to improve relations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''José Carlos Caetano Xavier''' is a Portuguese scientist ([[Marine biology|Marine biologist]]) and [[Antarctica|Polar]] explorer.

==Early life and education==
Xavier graduated from [[University of Algarve]] with a master's degree in Marine Biology in 1997 and earned a Ph.D. from the [[University of Cambridge]] (Queen´s college) in 1999. He has been carrying out [[Antarctic]] research since 1997, on 7 research expeditions (comprising more than 3 years); most recently in 2012.

==Career==
Xavier is a principal investigator of the Institute of Marine Research of the [[University of Coimbra]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ci.uc.pt/imar/unit/people/cvs/cv/j_xavier.php Institute of Marine Research of the University of Coimbra]&lt;/ref&gt;(Portugal) and at the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (Cambridge, UK) collaborating with researchers from more than 15 countries.

He was one of the leading scientists for the implementation of the national research program PROPOLAR and of the educational program LATITUDE60!, during the [[International Polar Year]].

Xavier co-founded the [[Association of Polar Early Career Scientists]] and is also a member of the Education and Outreach sub-committee of the International Polar Year. He is involved in more than 40 educational activities and events, nationally and internationally, giving talks in schools, producing exhibitions and directing educational films, among other activities.

He was involved in the institutional efforts for Portugal to join the Scientific  Committee for Antarctic Research (2006), European Polar Board (2007) and signing the [[Antarctic Treaty]] (2010). He co-led Portugal's polar science, education and outreach activities during the [[International Polar Year]].

===Investigation interests===
In his research areas are Marine Biology, Behavioral Ecology, Oceanography, Modeling, Foraging and Feeding Ecology. Xavier studies the foraging behavior and feeding ecology of top predators (namely [[penguin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[albatross]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;es and [[Seal (mammal)|seals]]) in relation to [[climate change]]. As a marine biologist, his main research areas are focused on understanding [[food web]] dynamics in [[marine ecosystems]]. Xavier studies penguins, albatrosses, seals and other mammals, sharks, conger eels and other fish, turtles, paying special attention to Cephalopods in the diet of top predators.

Sandwiches are a common type of lunch food often eaten as part of a [[packed lunch]]. There are many types of sandwiches, made from a diverse variety of ingredients. The sandwich is the [[namesake]] of [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]], a British statesman.

Major types of sandwich include:
* Two slices of [[bread]] with other ingredients between
* Two halves of a baguette with other ingredients between
* [[Pocket sandwich]]
* [[Open-faced sandwich]]

[[Sandwich cookie]]s and [[ice cream sandwich]]es are generally not considered sandwiches in the sense of a bread-containing food item, but are named by analogy.

| Especially popular where there are large populations of immigrant Italians, these cutlet sandwiches are made with breaded veal or chicken cutlets.  They can be served with [[provolone]] cheese, long hots (chili peppers) and/or sauteed greens ([[spinach]] or [[rapini|broccoli raab]]). Sometimes they are served Parmesan style, with [[tomato sauce]] and [[mozzarella]] and [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan cheese]]. Breaded cutlets ([[schnitzel]]s, [[cotoletta]], or [[escalope]] may have first appeared on the culinary scene with the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic armies]] for conservation purposes. Napoleon offered a monetary reward to the person who developed a method to transport conserved food for a longer amount of time that then could be consumed unspoiled. Although the breading of meat concept was not the winner, it was a culinary development that was quickly adopted in Austria and northern Italy.

|Part of the [[Kashmir conflict]]. Both India and Pakistan claim the former princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], leading to the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1947]]. A UN-mediated ceasefire put a halt to the conflict in January 1949. The UN resolution called for both the countries to demilitarise the region, following which a plebiscite would be held. However, no demilitarisation plan acceptable to both the countries could be agreed. The countries fought two further wars in [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|1971]]. Following the latter war, the countries reached the [[Simla Agreement]], agreeing on a [[Line of Control]] between their respective regions and committing to a peaceful resolution of the dispute through [[India-Pakistan relations|bilateral negotiations]]. An [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|armed insurgency]] broke out in 1989 in the Indian administered part of Kashmir, demanding "independence". Pakistan is [[Pakistan and state sponsored terrorism|believed to provide arms]] and training to the insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;

| [[Tuzla Island]] and [[Strait of Kerch]]; [[Sarych]]
| The conflict arose in 2003 when the Russian authorities started to build a dam towards the island. Since then Ukraine established a border garrison on the island for a closer surveillance. The reason for the conflict is the fact that Tuzla island's strategic location gives Ukraine full rights over the main channel in the Strait of Kerch and, thus, the access to the [[Sea of Azov]]. The conflict is based on the division of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and a lease agreement of the Sevastopol Naval facilities.

==Antarctica==
{{further|Territorial claims of Antarctica}}
The [[Antarctic Treaty System]], formed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of [[Antarctica]] and provides administration for the continent, which is carried out through consultative member meetings. It prevents new territorial claims of all signatories (except U.S and Russia) for as long as the treaty is in force. However, it is not a final settlement; parties can choose to withdraw from the System at any time. Furthermore, only a minority of states have signed it, and it is not formally sanctioned by the [[United Nations]]. Thus, Antarctica remains the only part of the planet any (non-signatory) state can still lay claim to as [[terra nullius]] (on the grounds of it not having been part of any existing state's legal and effective territory).

| Following [[Partition of Bengal (1947)]], the issues of adverse possessions, enclaves and unmarked boundary arose. Inside the main part of [[Bangladesh]], there were 111 Indian enclaves (17,160.63 acres), while inside the main part of [[India]], there were 51 Bangladeshi enclaves (7,110.02 acres). In 1974 Bangladesh approved a proposed treaty, Land Boundary Agreement, to exchange all enclaves within each other's territories, but India did not ratify it. Another agreement was agreed upon in 2011 to exchange enclaves and adverse possessions.  With respect to adverse possessions, India received 2,777.038 acres of land and transferred 2,267.682 acres to Bangladesh. India ratified the agreement by constitutional amendment in May 2015.&lt;ref name="India 2014"&gt;{{cite web | author=India | title=Everything you need to know: Land swap in offing with Bangladesh to end disputes | website=The Indian Express | date=2 December 2014 | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/explained-land-swap-in-offing/ | accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Japan unilaterally proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island in 1845, but its claims were ignored by the Russian Empire. The 1855 Treaty of Shimoda acknowledged that both Russia and Japan had joint rights of occupation to Sakhalin, without setting a definite territorial demarcation. As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers. Attempts by the Tokugawa shogunate to purchase the entire island from the Russian Empire failed, and the new Meiji government was unable to negotiate a partition of the island into separate territories.
In 1875 by the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], Japan agreed to give up its claims on Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of the Kuril Islands.  In 1905 under the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] Japan gained Sakhalin to the 60th parallel, but lost it again in 1945.

| 1821
| 1903
| Disputed between the United States and Canada (then a British Dominion with its foreign affairs controlled from London). The dispute had been going on between the Russian and British Empires since 1821, and was inherited by the United States as a consequence of the Alaska Purchase in 1867. It was resolved by arbitration in 1903 with a delegation that included 3 Americans, 2 Canadians, and 1 British delegate that became the swing vote. By a 4 to 2 vote, the final resolution favored the American position. Canada did not get an outlet from the Yukon gold fields to the sea. The disappointment and anger in Canada was directed less at the United States, and more at the British government for betraying Canadian interests in pursuit of a friendly relationship between Britain and the United States.

During 1749–64, Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] of New Hampshire issued well over a hundred "grants", offering lands for sale west of the river in what would become Vermont. In 1764, King George III attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York. But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth's grants, so local governments and militias resisted New York's rule. In 1777, the politicians of the disputed territory declared it independent of New York, Britain, and New Hampshire, calling it the State of Vermont. Vermont existed for 14 years as an unrecognized de facto independent country, considered by New York to be a district in rebellion. Negotiations between New York and Vermont in 1790 removed impediments to Vermont's [[admission to the Union]] in 1791.

Sverdrup claimed the islands for Norway, but the Norwegian government did not pursue the claim until 1928. At that point, the Norwegian government raised the claim, primarily to use the islands as bargaining chips in negotiations with the [[United Kingdom]] over the status of the Arctic island [[Jan Mayen]] and the Antarctic [[Bouvet Island]]. On November 11, 1930, Norway ceded the Sverdrup Islands to Canada, in exchange for British recognition of Norway's sovereignty over [[Jan Mayen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Berton|title=The Arctic Grail: the Quest for the North West Passage and the North Pole, 1818–1909|year=1988|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-82491-5|page=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Sweden and Finland argued over the control of the Åland Islands (located between Sweden and Finland). The Åland movement (Ålandsrörelsen) wanted Åland to reunite with its old mother country Sweden (Finland and Åland belonged to Sweden before 1809). The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the Åland Islands in 1917 (that was about 96% of the population) - they all supported a union with Sweden. When Finland became independent (December 6, 1917) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the Åland Islands to solve the problem. Finland refused and argued that the Åland Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule. Sweden appealed to the League of Nations referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to. After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the Åland Islands should be made an autonomous territory. The Swedish Prime Minister said he didn’t accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|A dispute between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the British Crown Colony of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain occurred after the volcanic island appeared in 1831. The British were the first to claim the island as part of Malta, and they were followed by the Two Sicilies and France, while Spain expressed their ambitions to control the island. The island disappeared by December 1831 and the dispute stopped. A Sicilian flag was lowered over the now submerged island in 2000 to show Italian claims to the area.

In May 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed the Peace and Friendship Treaty, ruling out Moscow's territorial claims to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Review of Ukraine base lease 'fatal,' Russia warns|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200512/28/eng20051228_231329.html |newspaper=People's Daily|location=Beijing, China|date=28 December 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117111808/http://english.people.com.cn/200512/28/eng20051228_231329.html|archivedate=17 January 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| In 2004 Romania filed a case to [[International Court of Justice]] claiming that Ukraine's Snake Island was an uninhabitable rock under [[UNCLOS]] standards and thus not eligible to carry influence over determination of the maritime boundary between the two states. During the Soviet times the island was a small naval station with a lighthouse. In 2007 the Ukrainian parliament approved an establishment of a small hamlet (settlement) there, ''Bile'', as part of Vylkove city [[Odessa Oblast|Odessa Region]].  The maritime boundary issue was settled by the [[International Court of Justice]] in 2009.

In 1920, Polish General [[Lucjan Zeligowski]] led [[Zeligowski's Mutiny|a coup]] and established the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]] which was annexed to the [[Second Polish Republic]] after the war as part of the historic [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and due to [[Poles in Lithuania|ethnic Poles in the region]]. Lithuania [[Temporary capital of Lithuania|moved its capital]] to [[Kaunas]] while never giving up its claim to Vilnius. The Lithuanians found support in the Soviet Union for their cause signing the [[Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty]] in 1939. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]], the region came under Soviet control and became part of the [[Lithuanian SSR]] after World War II which was followed by a large number of ethnic Poles being deported [[Polish population transfers (1944-1946)|two]] [[Repatriation of Poles (1955-1959)|times]]. Following the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]] the Vilnius region became part of Lithuania again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20040">'''Map database management''' systems are software programs designed to efficiently store and recall spatial information. They are widely used in localization and navigation, especially in automotive applications. Moreover, they are playing an increasingly important role in the emerging areas of [[location-based service]]s, [[active safety]] functions and [[advanced driver-assistance systems]]. Common to these functions is the requirement for an on-board map database that contains information describing the road network.

When designed well, a map database enables the rapid indexing and lookup of a large amount of geographic data.

== Content of a map database ==
[[File:mapmanagement1.gif|frame|right|Figure 1: Features and their respective attributes in a map database]]
Maps are stored as graphs, or two dimensional arrays of objects with attributes of location and category, where some common categories include parks, roads, cities, and the like.

A map database represents a road network along with associated features. Map providers can choose various models of a road network as a basis to formulate a database. Commonly, such a model comprises basic elements (nodes, links and areas) of the road network and properties of those elements (location coordinates, shape, addresses, road class, speed range, etc.). The basic elements are referred to as features and the properties as attributes. Other information associated with the road network is also included, including points of interest, building shapes, and political boundaries. This is shown schematically in the adjacent image. [[Geographic Data Files]] (GDF)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ISO 14825, Intelligent transport systems - Geographic Data Files (GDF) - Overall data specification, first edition 2004, Switzerland, http://www.iso.org&lt;/ref&gt; is a standardized description of such a model.

Each node within a map graph represents a point location of the surface of the Earth and is represented by a pair of [[longitude]] (lon) and [[latitude]] (lat) coordinates. Each link represents a stretch of road between two nodes, and is represented by a line segment (corresponding to a straight section of road) or a curve having a shape that is generally described by intermediate points (called shape points) along the link. However, curves may also be represented by a combination of centroid (point or node), with a radius, and polar coordinates to define the boundaries of the curve. Shape points are represented by lon-lat coordinates as are nodes, but shape points do not serve the purpose of connecting links, as do nodes. Areas are two-dimensional shapes that represent things like parks, cities, blocks and are defined by their boundaries. These are usually formed by a closed [[polygon]], which are shapes that indicated an object over a map has to have a close boundary, meaning the first polygon should be same as a last polygon. (For example, to plot a square object on a map, the polygons are 1,2,3,4,1.)

Another point for validation on data is the [[point in polygon]], which helps in finding points lying outside a polygon. E.g., for a particular lon-lat coordinates in a city, if the point is intersecting the polygon in an odd number, then it is inside the polygon and a valid point; otherwise it is outside the polygon and invalid.

== Interchange format ==
Map providers generally collect, aggregate and supply data in a well-defined and documented file format that is specifically intended for information interchange, e.g. [[Navteq]] uses [[Standard Interchange Format]] (SIF)&lt;ref&gt;Standard Interchange Format (SIF), Navteq, Chicago, Ill, http://www.navteq.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Geographic Data Files|GDF]], while [[Tele Atlas]] uses a proprietary form of GDF.&lt;ref&gt;GDF ASCII Sequential, Tele Atlas, {{cite web |url=http://www.teleatlas.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194617/http://www.teleatlas.com/ |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is usually in a plain-text form ([[ASCII]]) consisting of fields that are easily parsed and interpreted by the various parties who will handle it.  The portable format allows additions, deletions and modifications to be readily performed by simple text-editing programs.

A small number of record types are used to represent the various types of data. Each record type consists of a sequence of fields, which are either fixed length or delimited by a punctuation character such as a comma.  For example, a link entity could be represented by a record of the form:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''type1,label,node1,z1,node2,z2,class,number of shape points,number of lanes,speed'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;where '''type1''' defines this as a link record type and '''label''' serves as an identifier to distinguish this link from all others.  The '''z1''' and '''z2''' fields determine the vertical separation of this link from others sharing the corresponding nodes '''node1''' and '''node2'''.  Thus an overpass to a link, for example, can be represented as not connected to that link. Other record types are used to represent address information, shape-points for a link, cities and states, points of interest (POI’s), etc.

The interchange format for a map database is not organized well for use by a navigation unit during runtime.  Records are in an arbitrary order and therefore difficult to search and data, such as street names and coordinate values, are repeated from record to record.  Consequently, the database content is reorganized into a binary form more suitable for run-time operation.

== Run-time format ==
Runtime formats are typically proprietary, preventing interoperation of maps between different navigation systems.  However a new initiative called [[Navigation Data Standard]] (NDS) is an industry grouping of car manufacturers, navigation system suppliers and map data suppliers whose objective is the standardization of the data format used in car navigation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nds-association.org/|title=Navigation Data Standard|accessdate=2015-02-13|publisher=[http://www.nds-association.org/ NDS e.V.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies involved include [[TomTom]], [[BMW]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Renault]], ADIT, [[Alpine Electronics]], [[Navigon]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[DENSO]], [[Mitsubishi]], Harman Becker, [[Panasonic]], PTV, [[Continental AG]], [[Navteq]] and [[Zenrin]].

The database is reorganized by a navigation provider&lt;ref&gt;Navigon, http://www.navigon.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aisin, http://www.aisin.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denso, http://www.denso-europe.com/Navigation--1002010000000001.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; through a compilation process that includes at least the following five steps:

# Check for network consistency.  For example, ensure that all node pairs that should be connected by a link do have such a link and inversely all node pairs that should not be connected do not have a connecting link.
# Assign identifiers (IDs) to all entities in a systematic manner.
# Apply multiple sets of indices to entities to facilitate searching the database in expected ways.
# Replace multiple occurrences of data items (street names, coordinates, etc.) by indices into tables containing a single copy of each such item.
# Apply other compression techniques to reduce the overall size of the database.

The consistency check of step 1 is usually a very interactive and iterative process that might take weeks to complete.  During this time discrepancies need to be detected, investigated and resolved.

In step 2, IDs are generally assigned sequentially as entities of each type are encountered.  Any changes made to the input database from one version to another will affect the assignment of IDs to all entities.  Consequently, there is little expectation of continuity in the assignment between versions.

In step 3 each applied index allows the database to be quickly searched in a specific manner.  One index set applied to links can be sorted by the alphabetic order of the street names of the links. Another index set applied to links can be sorted according to the nodes to which they are connected to facilitate route planning. Yet another index set applied to nodes can be sorted according to their order of appearance along a road.
In some of these cases a binary search can be performed instead of an exhaustive search and in some cases, a search process can be replaced with a simple table lookup.

== Incremental update ==

For most navigational functions it is important to have in the vehicle an up-to-date map database, and for some functions it is critical, especially those related to active safety.  A common strategy is to transfer update information to the vehicle whenever it becomes available over a wireless channel.  The wireless channel might be bi-directional, such as [[wifi]] and cellular phone, [[broadcast]], such as satellite radio, FM sub-carrier or [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] datacasting, or a combination of both. In any case it would be impractical or extremely inefficient to transmit the entire new database to replace an existing version, since it is likely to be several gigabytes in size.

Instead it is desirable to transfer just that information related to changes made to the existing database.  A major difficulty is that any change made to the content of a map database generally causes changes to all assigned entity IDs and all assigned indices during the compilation process.  These new IDs and indices permeate the entire compiled database so that any collection of increments will likely constitute most of the database.  To overcome this difficulty, three approaches have been taken, which are briefly 1) onboard compiler 2) look-aside store 3) geographical tiles.

=== On-board compiler ===

In this case, basic changes made to the interchange format of the database are transmitted to the vehicle.  Such changes are represented in transactional form consisting of ''additions'', ''deletions'' and ''replacements''.  These changes are applied to the existing onboard database in interchange format.  The interchange format for the onboard database could either be stored separately or generated as needed by “decompiling” the run-time format.  The combined database is then compiled, which involves assigning IDs and applying indices.

This onboard compilation will likely be computationally intensive and require considerable memory.  However, it does not need to be interactive and iterative as does the off-board compilation since consistency checks and resolution will have already been done.  Furthermore, the onboard compilation can be done in the background so computation time is not critical.

=== Look-aside store ===

In this case, basic changes are also transmitted to the vehicle, but are placed into a separate memory location called a ''look-aside store''.  The changes are also represented in transactional form but may appear in any convenient format, which is not necessarily either interchange or run-time.  During operation of the navigation unit, the look-aside store is searched each time the main database is accessed.  Any transactions (changes) that pertain to the accessed data are then applied.

The necessity of examining the look-aside store and applying changes for each database access of course complicates the navigational algorithms and lengthens their computation time.  However, this avoids the need for an onboard compiler.

=== Geographical tiles ===

In this approach, the map database is broken down into relatively small rectangular regions (tiles) that tessellate the map.  The tile size is on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;km on a side. These tiles are compiled separately, so that all IDs and indices are conditioned by the particular tile to which they apply.  The tiles that have changed due to basic entity or attribute changes to the database are transmitted to the vehicle, where they replace the corresponding existing tile.

Replacing tiles is considerably simpler than onboard compilation or employing a look-aside store.  However, it may not be efficient for transmission.  A local change to entities and attributes, regardless of the extent, requires the transmission of the entire containing tile.  Furthermore, there are edge effects in which a change in an entity within one tile affects the entities in neighboring tiles.  It is quite possible that a small number of entity changes will require the transmission of almost all tiles, thereby defeating the purpose of incremental updates.  These problems can be address by selecting the tile size and the frequency of updating.

== Attaching auxiliary data ==

Various navigational functions, involving active safety, driver assistance and location-based services require data that is not considered to be part of a map database and is likely supplied by a vendor other than that of the map provider.  Such data needs to be cross-referenced with the entities and attributes of the main database.  However, since the auxiliary data is not necessarily compiled with the main database some other means is needed to establish cross-referencing, which is referred to as ''attaching'' the auxiliary data. Two common approaches are function-specific referencing tables and generic referencing.

=== Function-specific referencing tables ===
Function-specific referencing tables provide a means for attaching function-specific data to a map-data base produced by any participating supplier.  Such a table is collaboratively produced to support a specific function or class of functions involving location-based service, active-safety or advanced driver assistance. It will generally consist of a list of map elements of a specific type (e.g., links, intersections, point-of-interest locations, etc.) along with identifying attributes (e.g., street names, longitude/latitude coordinates, etc.).  Additionally, each entry in the table is assigned a unique identifier. The set of entries in a table are generally selected, through consensus of all interested parties. As a practical matter the result will represent a small subset of the elements of the given type that are available in the map databases and will consist of those that are more important to the application area. After a table is formulated, it is the task of each participating supplier to determine and cross-reference the elements in their map-database that correspond to the table entries.

[[File:mapmanagement2.gif|frame|right|Figure 2: TMC locations in Metro Detroit]]
A widely used example is the TMC standard for location-code tables for referencing traffic data.  TMC, which stands for [[Traffic Message Channel]],&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14819, prepared by ISO/TC 204 "Intelligent Transport Services", http://www.iso.org&lt;/ref&gt; is part of the [[Radio Data System]] (RDS), which is implemented as a sub-carrier modulation of a commercial FM broadcast signal.  The TMC tables primarily provide references to point locations along major roads corresponding to intersections with other roads.  A table entry identifies a point location using both contextual information (such as, region, road and section of road, name of intersection) and approximate longitude/latitude coordinates.

Identifiers assigned to entries in a table are 16-bit integers and therefore have a range of 65536 values.  This is too few to cover the world, so separate tables are formulated for each country or region of a country.  For a given metropolitan region, only intersections along freeways, arterials and some major roads are included. This is illustrated in the following figure for the Detroit metro area.  The coverage is intended for providing traffic advisory information on high-use roads. Traffic-based route planning, on the other hand, requires coverage of all or almost all major roads and, therefore, is not adequately supported by TMC location code tables as they are currently formulated.

=== Generic referencing ===
Generic referencing is an attempt to attach data to any map database by discovering reference information through a form of map matching.  The function-specific data items are assigned to elements, such as points, links or areas, that likely only approximate the corresponding map elements in a specific map database.  A search of the map database is made for the best fit.  To enhance the search process neighboring elements are strategically appended to each given element to help ensure that the correct solution is found in each case.  For example, if the map element is a link connecting two intersections, then one or both cross streets could be appended for the sake of the search.  Hopefully, this makes an incorrect match unlikely.  Although the procedure is quite heuristic, a proposed standard called Agora outlines the strategy for choosing neighboring elements to append.

==European consortium ''ActMAP'' ==

A European consortium called [http://www.ertico.com/en/subprojects/actmap/objectives__approach/objectives__approach.htm  ''ActMAP''] (Actualize Map)&lt;ref&gt;ActMAP, Ertico, http://www.ertico.com/en/subprojects/actmap/objectives__approach/objectives__approach.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is (in their words) "developing standardised mechanisms to update existing map database content and enable dynamic attachment of information to the digital in-vehicle map". The ActMAP consortium comprises [[ERTICO]] (coordinator), BMW, CRF Fiat Research Centre, DaimlerChrysler, Navigon, Navteq, Tele Atlas, and Siemens VDO Automotive.  They have finished most of their work and published a number of reports, which were submitted to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] committee [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/stdsdevelopment/tclist/TechnicalCommitteeDetailPage.TechnicalCommitteeDetail?TC=204 TC204 WG3] for standardization. Their reports serve as a good starting point and reference for the work of this project.  An important issue their reports address is dealing with the complexity of multiple map suppliers, using proprietary formats, coupled with multiple data suppliers and multiple versions of in-vehicles maps. They resolve this by using an open intermediate map format expressed with [[XML]] and based on the concepts of the ISO standard [[Geographic Data Files|GDF]] 4.0.  All modifications to a supplier's database are first converted to this intermediate format, stored on a server and then converted to each format used within individual vehicles.  They assume that each car has a "baseline" map from a map supplier and that this baseline defines reference identifiers (e.g. map segment ID) for most features to be updated.  For features with no reference identifier in the baseline, they propose using a "generic" reference that is discovered heuristically using map matching as described by a proposed standard called  [http://www.ertico.com/en/activities/completed_projects/agora_website.htm ''AGORA'']

A major issue not directly addressed by ActMAP is that for each new version of a supplier's map database all reference IDs are usually reassigned by a compiling process, which destroys any correspondence with IDs of previous versions.  This seriously interferes with the ability to use incremental updates to generate a new version of a map database from a previous version. Another issue not resolved by ActMAP is the inability to reference and characterize subsections of road segments (for example, curves, hills, maneuver lanes, etc.) in order to update them.

The '''Afghan Ministry of Defense''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]: د افغانستان ملی دفاع وزارت) is an organ of the [[Cabinet of Afghanistan|Government of Afghanistan]], overseeing the [[Afghan Armed Forces]]. Its headquarters is located in [[Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2015/06/12/afghanistan-gets-mini-pentagon-as-troops-struggle/71110264/ |title=Afghanistan gets 'mini-Pentagon' as troops struggle |publisher=Associated Press |date=June 12, 2015 |accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense minister is nominated by the [[President of Afghanistan]] and the [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|National Assembly]] makes the final approval.

One of the functions of the Defense Ministry is the continuance of disarming insurgent groups through programmes such as the [[Afghan New Beginnings Programme]]. These militant groups coalesced from warlords and former army personnel after the collapse of the [[Mohammed Najibullah|Najibullah]] [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|government]] in 1992.

The '''NRJ Group''' (NRJ is an acronym read as ''énergie''  in [[French language|French]], pronounced {{IPA-fr|enɛʁʒi|}}) ({{Euronext|NRG}}) is a [[France|French]] [[multimedia]] group based in [[Paris]]. Its founders are [[Jean-Paul Baudecroux]] and [[Max Guazzini]]. Since its foundation in 1981 as a [[Culture of France|French]] [[pop music]] radio station it has grown and evolved to become the NRJ Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrjgroup.fr/?page=209&amp;lang=gb |title=NRJ Group |publisher=Nrjgroup.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; NRJ is the most popular radio station in France with 6,159,000 listeners daily.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

All stations of NRJ Group carry around 40 minutes every hour of non-stop hits (or sometimes, "10 hits in a row").

NRJ Group currently has 33 FM stations (transmitting through 1260 frequencies) and around 220 internet stations and 12 mobile applications, along with replay TV and a host of other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4481788|title=NRJ Group SA: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Radio Record Group==
The NRJ Group grew from one radio station to a [[brand]] of corporate [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[radio station]]s across Europe. It has stations in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Egypt]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], among others. NRJ plays current and newly released music for young audiences. Their [[slogan]] and promise is "Hit Music Only".

The majority of NRJ-branded stations are operated by the NRJ Group, however some are licensed, such as the Bulgarian version, which is operated by Communicorp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/nrj-music-awards-2010-3639991095|title=New &amp; Used Books Online with Free Shipping {{!}} Better World Books|last=Books|first=Better World|website=Better World Books|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within France the NRJ Group operates four separate radio stations: [[NRJ]], [[Nostalgie]], [[Chérie FM]] and [[Rire &amp; Chansons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrjgroup.fr/ |title=Nrj Group |publisher=Nrjgroup.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also operate the [[NRJ 12]] and [[Chérie 25]] [[digital terrestrial television]] stations, in addition to NRJ Paris and NRJ Hits [[music television]] stations in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2017/08/19/bauer-rumoured-to-eye-nrj-group/|title=Bauer rumoured to eye NRJ Group|date=2017-08-19|work=Broadband TV News|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, NRJ became listed on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]] Secondary Market and has continued to climb, reaching the First Market in 2000 after regrouping all of its assets into the NRJ Group.

In [[French language|French]], the pronunciations of '''NRJ''' and '''Energy''' (''énergie'') are  - almost, except for the first [[vowel]] which is respectively [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|open-mid]] and [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|close-mid]] - identical, and sounds very similar to the [[English language|English]] word [[Energy]].

==International==
With its [[European integration|pan-European]] ''NRJ/ENERGY'' stations, the Paris-based NRJ Group has challenged the European radio market by being significantly different from other market players like the [[Luxembourg]]-based [[RTL Group]] (Antenne Bayern, RTL Berlin, Yorin FM), and [[SBS Discovery Media|SBS Broadcasting]] (Radio 1 Norway, The Voice) or [[Stockholm]]-based [[modern Times Group|MTG]] (P4 Norway, Rix FM, Lugna Favoriter).

Since June 6, 2006 NRJ has been operational in [[Lebanon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrjlebanon.com/ |title=NRJ Lebanon website |publisher=Nrjlebanon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; further expanding its reach and influence. On July 6, 2009, NRJ announced it would license its brand to [[Astral Media]], owner of [[Canada]]'s [[NRJ (Canada)|Énergie]] radio network, consisting of 10 regional stations in [[Quebec]], along with a national broadcast as Énergie&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Satellite Radio in Canada and in the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2009/06/c4281.html NRJ is the new signature of Energie, the number one radio network in Quebec], Astral Media press release, July 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Sirius Canada]] channel would be replaced in 2010 with [[Latitude franco]]). This is the first North American expansion for NRJ.

Since the mid-1990s, NRJ has licensed its 24/7 programming stream out of Paris, to Japan's largest cable system, Usen Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntp.dk/News.377/Radio-NRJ,-France,-expands-its-NTP-audio-routing-system.37.aspx|title=News - NTP Radio NRJ, France, expands its NTP audio routing system|website=www.ntp.dk|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of NRJ's international operations are concentrated on a [[contemporary hit radio]] station (with the same slogan, [[jingles]], sound, etc...) while its competitors tend to create local radio brands with various radio formats, thereby taking advantage of their audience's local identity.

NRJ is today broadcasting in over 20 countries, mainly throughout [[Europe]], but also in [[North America]], [[South America]] and several [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territories]] of [[France]]. The following is a list of current and defunct international stations, including France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRJ - Around The World|url=http://www.nrj.com/|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NRJ also operates four 24-hour hit music television channels, in Lebanon, France, Switzerland, and Belgium.

In order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors NRJ sacrificed improvements in revenues and margins this explains the year-on-year earnings decline experienced in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://online.capitalcube.com/#!/stock/FR/EURONEXT%20PARIS/NRG/Earningsreleaseaol|title=CapitalCube - Fundamental Analysis On Demand|website=online.capitalcube.com|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Tabarin''' was a secret British Antarctic expedition. It was launched in 1943 under the pretence of patrolling the Antarctic from German commerce raiders and U-boats that threatened [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] shipping during the course of [[World War II]]. The expedition resulted in the establishment of a number of bases, thus strengthening British territorial claims to the area. The expedition led to the collection of large amounts of rock, fossil and botanical specimens as well as meteorological, topographical data and glaciological measurements. Following its end in 1946, its mission was continued by the  [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]].

==Background==
Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] shipping across the globe became vulnerable to attacks by [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] [[commerce raiders]] and [[U-boat]]s. The British [[Falkland Islands]] and the waters of the [[Antarctic]] were no exception. On 13 January 1941, [[German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin|German auxiliary cruiser ''Pinguin'']] began terrorizing the unarmed and unescorted Norwegian whaling fleet which had relocated to sub Antarctic waters after having depleted the whale population of the Northern Hemisphere through overexploitation. ''Pinguin'' managed to seize a haul of 20,320 ton of [[whale oil]] from whalers ''Solglimt'', ''[[SS Athenic|Pelagos]]'' and ''Ole Wegger'', making it one of the largest prizes seized by a commerce raider during the war. Once whaler ''Thorshammer'' alerted the British authorities on the Falklands, the armed merchant cruiser [[SS Queen of Bermuda|HMS ''Queen of Bermuda'']] began patrolling the area between South Georgia, the [[South Shetland Islands]] and [[Weddell Sea]]. On 5 March, it visited [[Deception Island]] where its crew set fire to a coal dumps and sabotaged oil tanks, supply and discharge pumps belonging to an abandoned  Norwegian whaling station, to prevent their use as a supply base by the Germans.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=15–19}}

In the meantime, the entry of Japan as another [[Axis powers|Axis]] power into the war through its surprise [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], created a new threat to British oversea possessions. The Falklands were protected by an insufficient force of 330 local volunteers with next to no weapons, making an amphibious Japanese invasion likely. Such an invasion would have made  navigation around Cape Horn untenable and put Allied convoys heading to India and the Middle East in great danger. The war also threatened to reignite the long standing [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]] with neutral Argentina. In January 1942, Argentina's Comisión Nacional del Antártico dispatched [[ARA Primero de Mayo|ARA ''Primero de Mayo'']] to Deception Island, afterwards sailing to the [[Melchior Base#History|Melchior]] Islands, [[Palmer Archipelago]] and [[Winter Island (Antarctica)|Winter Island]]. Argentine flags were raised in the aforementioned locations and all territories south of 60° S and between 25° W and 68.34° W were declared annexed. On 28 January 1943, the [[Colonial Office]] proposed dispatching armed merchant cruiser {{HMS|Carnarvon Castle}} to Deception Island after falsely claiming that a German commerce raider had been spotted in the area. Although  by that time the threat of German commerce raiders had largely subsided, the deliberate ruse was enacted in order to conceal Britain's intentions from the U.S. and counter Argentina's ambitions. Upon reaching Deception Island Carnarvon's crew replaced the Argentinian flag with the Union Jack and placed four British Crown Land signs. A month later Primero de Mayo's men returned the favor. At this point it became obvious that only physical presence could settle the matter.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=19–28}}

==Expedition==
[[File:Deception-Island-location-map.png|thumb|300px|Location of Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands]]
Planning for Operation Bransfield began on 27 May 1943. Named after Antarctic explorer [[Edward Bransfield]] it was quickly changed to Operation Tabarin (after Paris based cabaret [[Bal Tabarin (Paris)|Bal Tabarin]]) so as not to reveal its objectives. Polar experts Neil Mackintosh,  [[James Wordie]] and [[Brian Roberts (polar expert)|Brian Roberts]] took up the planning of the endeavor. Experienced Scottish marine biologist and polar explorer Lieutenant [[James Marr (biologist)|James Marr]] was selected as the head of the expedition. Marr now a Lieutenant Commander flew to [[Iceland]] where he procured Norwegian sealer ''Veslekari'' which was assigned the name HMS ''Bransfield''.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=28–35}}

[[Image:Wfm antarctic peninsula islands.png|thumb|300px|right|Map of [[Trinity Peninsula]] and associated islands, showing Hope Bay (A)]]
''Bransfield'' proved to be unsuitable for the expedition as its freshwater tanks suffered from leaks, troopship HMS ''Highland Monarch'' was therefore selected as the replacement. On 14 December, ''Highland Monarch'' departed from [[Avonmouth]], making stops at [[Gibraltar]] and [[Montevideo]] before reaching [[Port Stanley]]. There the expedition's members reembarked into ''Fitzroy'' and [[RRS William Scoresby|HMS ''William Scoresby'']].{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=38–43}} At 11:00 a.m., 3 February 1944 the expedition landed at [[Port Foster]], Deception Island. Much to the relief of its members the expedition found no signs of Argentinian presence in the port apart from a flag painted on a fuel tank. Orders had previously been issued to avoid confrontation with the Argentinians and the Chileans at all cost. The decrepit whaling station was transformed into Base B where Flett, Matheson, Smith, Layther and Howkins were to continue their work. On 6 February, the remainder of the expedition set course for [[Hope Bay]] where Station A was to be established.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=52–59}}

At 13:00 p.m., 7 February ''William Scoresby'' dropped its anchor {{convert|50|yards}} off Hope Bay.  The following day Marr was informed that ''Fitzroy'' would not be able to proceed to Hope Bay as ice being blown into the area by easterly wind could potentially trap the ship. A plan to reload Fitzroy's cargo into Scoresby was discarded due to the latter's limited capacity. Abandoning Hope Bay on 10 February the two ships pushed south-west along [[Graham Land]] and to [[Port Lockroy]] once heavy fog lifted. Although it was known as a safe harbor, Port Lockroy's location restricted the range of scientific activities that the team intended to perform due to the fact that [[Gerlache Strait]] rarely froze, thus limiting access to the mainland. The ensuing ennui posed the risk of causing the team members to experience [[cabin fever]] as was the case in the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]]. The cargo was unloaded at [[Goudier Island]] the site of the newly established Station A. The first stage of the construction of the main hut christened Bransfield House was completed on 17 February, allowing ''William Scoresby'' and Fitzroy to return to the Falklands.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=60–72}}

On 19 March, Station A was visited by ''William Scoresby'' which brought John Blyth a carpenter from the Falklands who join the team. On 23 March, the Port Lockroy post office began its operation with Farrington acting as censor. Falkland Island stamps overprinted with the inscription "Graham Land, Dependency of" were used. A day earlier four expedition members planted a Union Jack and a British Crown Land sign on  [[Cape Renard]]. On 23 April, the Stanley post office burnt to the ground, with correspondence now passing through Montevideo the expedition's existence came to be known to the outside world. Survey work began in early May with the collection of rock samples from the foot of [[Jabet Peak]] and [[Savoia Peak]]. Lamb collected lichen samples and conducted experiments on the accumulation of snow and subsequent thawing. Lamb discovered a number of lichen species, including ''[[Verrucaria serpuloides]]''  the only known true marine lichen, thus making a considerable contribution to the taxonomy of Antarctic lichens.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=80–90, 106}} Later on Lamb visited Station B collecting specimens of [[amphipoda]], [[ctenophora]], sea urchins, worms and sponges from the beaches and shallow waters of Deception Island. On 18 November, a sledging expedition was launched on [[Wiencke Island]] where bird and lichen specimens were gathered, the former for the needs of the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=117–120}}

On 6 December, ''William Scoresby'' returned to Station B bringing plants native to the Falklands and soil for Lamb to conduct a transplantation experiment. Which ultimately failed due to low humidity and strong winds. On 3 February 1945, ''Fitzroy'' and 550 ton sealer ''Eagle'' arrived at Port Lockroy, with Victor Russell and [[David James (British MP)|David James]], [[Norman Bertram Marshall]], Gordon Lockley, Frank White, Alan Reece, Thomas Donnachie and Norman Layther aboard. Stores, equipment and crew members destined for the erection of an unmanned Base E on [[Stonington Island]] moved into ''Eagle'', others boarded ''William Scoresby'' and ''Fitzroy'' in order to build Station D on Hope Bay.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=125–127, 117}} On 7 February, Marr resigned on account of poor health, later returning to the Falklands, with Taylor replacing him as expedition leader. Taylor abandoned the plan to build the Stonington Island station focusing his attention on Station D. On 13 February, [[Seal Point (Graham Land)|Seal Point]] was selected as the most suitable location for Station D and the first steps for its erection were made, construction was completed on 20 March.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=136–144, 156}} On 23 February, a hut was built on [[Coronation Island]] to reinforce British claims to the area. Later on the British paid the Argentinean meteorological station on [[Laurie Island]] a cordial visit.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=148–149}}

A few fossil specimens were collected at Hope Bay in February, with systematic gathering of [[paleobotanical]] specimens from [[Mount Flora]]'s shale beginning on 8 June.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=166–167}} A sledging expedition from Hope was launched in August. On 29 December, the sledging party returned to Base D, having visited  [[Vortex Island]],  [[Duse Bay]], [[James Ross Island]] and numerous small islands in its vicinity. The trip resulted in 250 kilos of lichen, fossil and rock samples, meteorological and glaciological measurements as well as corrections to [[Otto Nordenskjöld]]'s maps.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=192–205}} On 14 January 1946, ''William Scoresby'', ''Fitzroy'' and 300 ton sealer ''Trepassey''  began evacuating the members of the expedition to the Falklands. On 11 February, those serving in the military boarded {{HMS|Ajax|22}} while the rest sailed home on ''Highland Monarch''.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=208–215}}

==Aftermath==
The end of World War II led to renewed interest in the Antarctic region. The U.S. refused to recognise any foreign territorial claims to Antarctica initiating [[Operation Highjump]]. Argentina and Chile signed the Argentine-Chilean Agreement on Joint Defence of "Antarctic Rights", a defence agreement that envisioned  potential military action over disputed Antarctic lands. Chile organized its [[First Chilean Antarctic Expedition]] in 1947–48. Among other accomplishments, it brought the Chilean president [[Gabriel González Videla]] to personally inaugurate one of its bases, thereby becoming the first head of state to set foot on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Antarctica and the Arctic: The Complete Encyclopedia |volume=1 |first1=David |last1=McGonigal |first2=Lynn |last2=Woodworth |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain on the other hand continued the operation of the bases built during Operation Tabarin, by transferring them to the newly established [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]]. Operation Tabarin veterans Reece,White and Rusell remained at their bases, continuing their work for the FIDS. Participants of Operation Tabarin were awarded the [[Polar Medal]] in 1953.{{sfn|Haddelsey|2014|pp=216–223,230}}

'''Palink''' is the operator of the "IKI" supermarket chain in Lithuania.

== History ==
Palink was founded by the brothers George, Oliver and Nicolas Ortiz.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108310342029695152&lt;/ref&gt; The first store was opened in 1992 in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania.

In 2005 Palink opened its first store in [[Riga]], Latvia.

In 2014 Palink sold all IKI stores in Latvia (51 stores) to local company "Mego", stating that Palink is not interested in investing in Latvia anymore. IKI was 5th largest supermarket chain in Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vz.lt/article/2014/1/17/palink-parduoda-parduotuviu-tinkla-latvijoje „Palink“ parduoda prekybos tinklą Latvijoje] ''Lithuanian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.lv/bizness/uznemumi/mego-perk-iki-veikalu-tiklu-gaida-konkurences-uzraugu-atlauju.d?id=44046807 'Mego' pērk IKI veikalu tīklu; gaida konkurences uzraugu atļauju] ''Latvian''&lt;/ref&gt;

The company currently operates over 240 "Iki", "Iki Cento" and "Iki Express" stores in more than 70 cities and is the second largest retail grocer in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.15min.lt/naujiena/verslas/bendroves/iki-i-tinklo-pletra-pernai-investavo-80-mln-lt-663-398501#ixzz2qVODXf4m&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vivian Helena Pellizari''' is a [[Brazilian nationalism|Brazilian]] [[Antarctic Science|Antarctic scientist]] known for her work on establishing Antarctic microbiology in Brazil. Pellizari is the head of Department of [[Oceanography|Oceanographic Biology]] at [[Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo|Oceanographic Institute of University of São Paulo]].&lt;ref name="IOUSP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.io.usp.br/index.php/institucional/departamentos|title=IOUSP - Departamentos|last=IOUSP|website=www.io.usp.br|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.io.usp.br/index.php/perfil/userprofile/vivianp|title=Vivian Helena Pellizari|website=www.io.usp.br|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Pellizari received her master's degree in 1992 from the [[University of São Paulo]] (USP), Brazil.  At the beginning of her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] she contacted  the Oceanographic Institute at University of São Paulo  with the first proposal to for Brazilian Antarctic Program covering [[microbial ecology]] goals.  She then obtained her PhD in 1996 in [[Microbiology|Biological Sciences (Microbiology)]] from the University of São Paulo.  The title of her [[thesis]] was ''“Phenotypic and molecular aspects of bacteria isolated from the environment and involved in [[biodegradation]] Biphenyls (PCBs)"''. She spent 1 year as a [[postdoctoral researcher]] at Center for Microbial Ecology at [[Michigan State University]] in the Tiedje Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cme.msu.edu/tiedjelab/formerstudents3.shtml|title=Tiedje Labs - Former Students|website=cme.msu.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and impact ==
Pellizari’s research focuses on [[extremophile]]s,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sbmicrobiologia.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/REVISTA-SBM-EDI----O-26-p-site.pdf | title=Microbiologia in foco | language=Brazilian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microbiology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciencia.estadao.com.br/blogs/herton-escobar/projeto-da-nova-base-brasileira-na-antartida-comeca-a-sair-do-papel/|title=Projeto da nova base brasileira na Antártida começa a sair do papel|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Estadao|trans-title=New design for the Brazilian base in Antarctica begins to leave the paper|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usp.br/aun/exibir?id=7718|title=Estudo busca compreender seres que vivem em condições extremas|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.usp.br|publisher=University of Sao Paulo|trans-title=Study seeks to understand beings that live in extreme conditions|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microbial ecology|marine microbial ecology]] in different Antarctic ecosystems.&lt;ref name="valor.com.br"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valor.com.br/cultura/3017318/quatro-dias-na-antartida-o-brasil-que-vive-no-frio|title=Quatro dias na Antártida - O Brasil que vive no frio|last=|first=|date=|website=Valor Econômico|publisher=Valor|trans-title=Four days in Antarctica - Brazil living in cold|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pellizari has also contributed to the formation of new Antarctic research areas in [[Latin America]] including astrobiology,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[genomics]] of extremophiles and molecular microbial ecology. She is part of a [[Consortium|consortia]] addressing the topic Aerobiology Over Antarctica, and was part of the National Institute of Science and technology – [http://www.biologia.ufrj.br/inct-antartico/ Antarctic Environmental Research INCT –APA] and support projects related with Brazilian National Institute of cryospheric science and technology .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearce|first=David A.|last2=Alekhina|first2=Irina A.|last3=Terauds|first3=Aleks|last4=Wilmotte|first4=Annick|last5=Quesada|first5=Antonio|last6=Edwards|first6=Arwyn|last7=Dommergue|first7=Aurelien|last8=Sattler|first8=Birgit|last9=Adams|first9=Byron J.|date=2016-02-16|title=Aerobiology Over Antarctica – A New Initiative for Atmospheric Ecology|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.00016|issn=1664-302X|pmc=4754734|pmid=26909068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrobiobrazil.org/index.php/pt_br/equipe|title=Equipe - Núcleo de Pesquisa em Astrobiologia|website=www.astrobiobrazil.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pellizari is the head of Department of Oceanographic Biology at Oceanographic Institute (IO) of University of São Paulo&lt;ref name="IOUSP"/&gt; and a member of the scientific committee of Center of Antarctica Research (CPA) at University of São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prp.usp.br/nap/lista-de-naps|title=USP - Pró-Reitoria de Pesquisa|website=www.prp.usp.br|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oceanographic Institute was a pioneer in Antarctic expeditions, being part of the Brazilian Antarctic Program since the first expedition in 1982. Pellizari has been part of the program since 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.io.usp.br|title=IOUSP - Oceanografia - Ciências do Mar|website=www.io.usp.br|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first worked in Antarctica in 1997.&lt;ref name="valor.com.br"/&gt;

In 2005, after 6 years in the Antarctic Program she organized a network of microbiologists, called the MicroPolar Network, to improve the microbial ecology research in Antarctica.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admiraltybayasma.aq/doc/permits/2007/vivian%20-%20permit%20aspa%20128.pdf|title=Antarctic Specially Protected Area Permit|last=|first=|date=2007|website=admiraltybayasma.aq|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was created in 2005 under the umbrella of the [[Brazilian Antarctic Program]] (PROANTAR). The MicroPolar Network is coordinated by Pellizari and includes more than 15 professors and their teams from seven different Universities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The MicroPolar Network has generated important survey data on micro organisms adapted to survive in cold, dry, [[oligotroph]]ic ecosystems with great temperature fluctuations, particularly in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] - one of the regions most affected by the effects of climate change.

Pellizari has been a driver in the establishment of scientific networks across Latin America to investigate microbiology (Red Latinoamericana de Microbiologia Antartica) integrating microbiologists from Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbmicrobiologia.org.br/cdlatino/programa04.htm|title=Workshop Microbiologia|last=|first=|date=2012|website=www.sbmicrobiologia.org.br|publisher=|trans-title=Microbiology Workshop|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is active in the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)]] and is the Brazilian delegate of Life Sciences and was the alternate delegate of Brazil in SCAR in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/scar_media/documents/publications/bulletins/Bulletin183.pdf|title=Report of the XXXII SCAR Delegates’ Meeting|last=|first=|date=2012|website=scar.org|publisher=Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was an author of the Antarctic Science Action Plan for Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/scar_media/documents/meetings/33scar2014/33_IP14_Brazilian_Action_Plan.pdf|title=Antarctic Science for Brazil: An action plan for the 2013 – 2022 period|last=|first=|date=2013|website=scar.org|publisher=Brazilian National Committee on Antarctic Research|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is a member of the Technical Scientific Committee of the Integrated ocean Drilling Program within CAPES.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iodp-capes.uff.br/content/comites|title=Comitês|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iodp-capes.uff.br|publisher=IODP|trans-title=Committees|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pellizari has  been involved in the organisation of public outreach events to share information about the Antarctic environment at schools; scientific fairs and public places as parks (Vila Lobos Park) and subways in the city of São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metro.sp.gov.br/noticias/exposicao-de-animais-da-antartica-proporciona-encontro-entre-cientistas-e-usuarios-da-estacao-se-do.fss|title=Exposição De Animais Da Antártica Proporciona Encontro Entre Cientistas E Usuários Da Estação Sé Do Metrô|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.metro.sp.gov.br|publisher=Metrô São Paulo|trans-title=Antarctic Animals Exhibition Provides Meeting Between Scientists and Users of the Metro Station Sé|others=Antarctic Animals Exhibition Provides Meeting Between Scientists and Users of the Metro Station Sé|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
