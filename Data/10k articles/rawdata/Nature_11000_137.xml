'''1,2-Dichlorotetrafluoroethane''', or '''R-114''', also known as '''cryofluorane''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), is a [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) with the molecular formula ClF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl.  Its primary use has been as a [[refrigerant]].  It is a non-flammable gas with a sweetish, [[chloroform]]-like odor with the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] occurring at 145.6&amp;nbsp;°C and 3.26&amp;nbsp;MPa.  When pressurized or cooled, it is a colorless liquid.  It is listed on the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s list of ozone depleting chemicals, and is classified as a [[Montreal Protocol]] Class I, group 1 ozone depleting substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/ods/classone.html|title=Class I Ozone-depleting Substances|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used as a refrigerant, R-114 is classified as a medium pressure refrigerant.

The [[US Navy]] uses R-114 in its [[Chiller|centrifugal chillers]] in preference to [[Trichlorofluoromethane|R-11]] to avoid air and moisture leakage into the system.  While the evaporator of an R-11 charged chiller runs at a vacuum during operation, R-114 yields approximately 0 psig operating pressure in the evaporator.

}}
The '''Atlantic Wall''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Atlantikwall}}) was an extensive system of [[coastal defence and fortification]]s built by [[Nazi Germany]] between 1942 and 1944 along the coast of continental Europe and [[Scandinavia]] as a [[defense (military)|defence]] against an anticipated [[Operation Overlord|Allied invasion]] of [[Nazi-occupied Europe]] from the [[United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]].  The manning and operation of the Atlantic Wall was administratively overseen by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], with some support from [[Luftwaffe]] ground forces.  The [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] maintained  a separate coastal defence network, organised into a number of [[sea defence zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann W. &amp; Hildebrand H., Die Deutsche Kriegsmarine, Verlag Hans-Henning Podzun, Bad Nauheim (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] ordered the construction of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million [[French people|French]] workers were drafted to build it. The wall was frequently mentioned in [[Nazi propaganda]], where its size and strength were usually exaggerated. The fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences.{{efn|The coast defence along the North Cape down to the Spanish border, included artillery pieces and naval guns from 105mm to 406mm and were organised into over 600 batteries. In addition, there were over 250 batteries of guns ranging from 75mm to 90mm, including anti-aircraft artillery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-nHuSIG45WsC&amp;pg=RA1-PT170&amp;lpg=RA1-PT170&amp;dq=how+many+artillery+guns+in+the+atlantic+wall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9IndzBbdJP&amp;sig=8sWbR36yzkeey7LRUAI16Pq0mw0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwB2oVChMIop_j9qagyAIVCZmACh3x2wbG#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20many%20artillery%20guns%20in%20the%20atlantic%20wall&amp;f=false  J.E Kaufmann,''The Atlantic Wall: History and Guide'', 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;}} When the Allies eventually [[Operation Neptune|invaded]] the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all of the nations where it was built, although many structures have fallen into the ocean or have been demolished over the years.

==Background==
{{see also|Causes of World War II}}
World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939, with [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[invasion of Poland]]. Two days later, the [[UK]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] declared war on Germany.{{sfn|Lightning War|2009}} Poland's geographical location, however, prevented the Allies from intervening directly.{{Citation needed||date=October 2016}} Four weeks into the attack, the Germans had successfully occupied Poland.{{sfn|Lightning War|2009}}

Less than a month after this victory, [[Adolf Hitler]] issued a directive stating that Germany must be ready for an offensive through France and the [[Low Countries]].{{sfn|Lightning War|2009}} However, the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at least until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait.{{sfn|Lightning War|2009}} In May 1940, three massive German army groups [[Battle of France|overran]] France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.{{sfn|Lightning War|2009}}

==History==

===Creation===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-295-1596-12, Raversijde, Rommel bei Besichtigung.jpg|thumb|Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] visiting the Atlantic Wall defences near the Belgian port of [[Ostend]], part of the fortifications which today comprise the [[Atlantic Wall Open Air Museum]] at [[Raversijde]]]]

Prior to the Atlantic Wall decision, following a number of [[commando]] raids, on 2 June 1941 [[Adolf Hitler]] asked for maps of the [[Channel Islands]]. These were provided next day and by 13 June Hitler had made a decision. Ordering additional men to the Islands and having decided the defences were inadequate, lacking tanks and [[coastal artillery]], the [[Organisation Todt]] (OT) was instructed to undertake the building of 200-250 strongpoints in each of the larger islands. The plan was finalised by the OT and submitted to Hitler.&lt;ref name="H-FG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festungguernsey.supanet.com/about_us.htm |title=History:Fortifying Guernsey |publisher=Festung Guernsey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409161003/http://www.festungguernsey.supanet.com/about_us.htm |archivedate=9 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original defence order was reinforced with a second dated 20 October 1941, following a Fuhrer conference on 18 October to discuss the engineers assessment of requirements.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Cruickshank |title=The German Occupation of the Channel Islands |publisher=The History Press; New edition (30 Jun. 2004) |ISBN=978-0750937498}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|197}} Referring to the “permanent fortification” of the Islands to make an impregnable fortress to be completed within 14 months.&lt;ref name="WBGOC"&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Bell |title=Guernsey Occupied but never Conquered |publisher=The Studio Publishing Services (2002) |ISBN= 978-0952047933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|448}} ''Festungspionierkommandeur XIV'' was created to command the project of fortifying the Channel Islands.

It was six months later on 23 March 1942 that Hitler issued [[Führer Directive]] No. 40, which called for the creation of an "Atlantic Wall". He ordered naval and submarine bases to be heavily defended. [[Fortification]]s remained concentrated around ports until late in 1943, when defences were increased in other areas.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Robert|2003|pp=196–197}} This decision required the army engineers and the OT to organise quickly. Massive supplies of cement,  steel reinforcing and armour plate would be required and everything would need to be transported.

[[Nazi propaganda]] claimed that the wall stretched from the cape of [[Norway]] down to the [[France–Spain border|Spanish border]].{{sfn|Hakim|1995|p=161}}{{sfn|Darman|2012|pp=8–9}}

===Regelbau===

The ''[[Regelbau]]'' (standard build) system used books of plans for each of over 600 approved types of bunker and casemate, each having a specific purpose, having been updated as enemy constructions were overrun and examined, even testing some to destruction for effectiveness. They incorporated standard features, such as an entrance door at right angles, armoured air intake, {{convert|30|mm|adj=on}} steel doors, ventilation and telephones,&lt;ref name="EG"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernie |last=Gavey |title=German Fortifications of Guernsey |publisher=Guernsey Armouries |ISBN=978-0953163106}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} internal walls being lined with wood, emergency exit system.&lt;ref name="Regelbau"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.regelbau.com/on_regelbau_gb.htm  |title=The Regelbau concept}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were over 200 standardised armour parts.&lt;ref name="JEK"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.E. |last=Kaufmann |display-authors=etal |title=Fortress Third Reich: German Fortifications and Defense Systems in World War II |publisher=Da Capo Press, 2007 |ISBN=9780306816352}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|350}}

The standardisation greatly simplified the manufacture of equipment, the supply of materials and the budgetary and financial control of the construction as well as the speed of planning for construction projects.&lt;ref name=HOT1/&gt;{{rp|50}}

To offset shortages, captured equipment from the French and other occupied armies were incorporated in the defences, casemates designed for non-German artillery, anti tank and machine guns and the use of turrets from obsolete tanks in ''tobrukstand'' pill boxes ([[Defensive fighting position#Tobruk|tobruk pits]]).&lt;ref name=HOT1/&gt;{{rp|51}}

===Organisation Todt===
[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B10467.jpg|thumb|left|A British soldier poses next to the recently captured German 380mm gun Todt Battery at Cap Gris Nez.]]

[[Organisation Todt]] (OT), formed in 1933, had designed the [[Siegfried Line]] during the prewar years along the [[Franco-German border]]. OT was the chief engineering group responsible for the design and construction of the wall's major gun emplacements and fortifications.{{sfn|Hakim|1995|p=161}}{{sfn|The Great Landings|2009}}

The OT supplied supervisors and labour as well as organising supplies, machinery and transport to supplement the staff and equipment of construction companies, many of them were German however construction companies in occupied counties bid for contracts. Companies could apply for OT work or could be conscripted.&lt;ref name=HOT1/&gt;{{rp|53}} Companies failing to complete their work on time, which was always possible as the OT controlled the material and manpower of each firm, could find themselves closed down, or more likely fined, or taken over or merged with another firm to make a more efficient larger unit, successful firms however could make attractive profits.&lt;ref name=HOT1/&gt;{{rp|53–4}}

The OT obtained quotes for necessary works and signed contracts with each construction company setting out the price and terms of the contract, such as  bonus payments for efficiency, including the wage rates and bonus payments for OT workers (which depended on their nationality and skill). There could be several construction companies working on each site.&lt;ref name="HOT1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of the Organisation Todt - part 1 |publisher=Military Intelligence Records Section, London Branch |date=May 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour comprised skilled volunteers, engineers, designers and supervisors, who were paid and treated well.  Second came volunteer workers, often skilled technicians, such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians and metal workers.  Again, these workers were paid, took holidays and were well treated. Next came unskilled forced labour, paid very little and treated quite harshly.  Lastly came effective slave labour, paid little, badly fed and treated very harshly.&lt;ref name=HOT1/&gt;{{rp|75}} The OT ran training courses to improve labour skills.&lt;ref name=HOT1/&gt;{{rp|18}}

Massive numbers of workers were needed.  The [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] imposed a compulsory labour system, drafting some 600,000 French workers to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian, and French coasts facing the [[English Channel]].{{sfn|The Great Landings|2009}} Efficiency of the OT decreased in late 1943 and 1944 as a result of manpower pressures, fuel shortages and the bombing of worksites, such as [[V-weapons]] sites, where some volunteer workers refused to work in such dangerous areas.&lt;ref name=HOT1/&gt;{{rp|50}}

OT Cherbourg in January 1944 dealt with 34 companies with 15,000 workers and 79 sub contractors. Daily, weekly and monthly reports showing progress, work variations, material used, stocks of material, labour hours used per skill type, the weather, equipment inventory and quality, level of supervision, employee absences, staffing levels, deaths and problems experienced all had to be filed with the OT.&lt;ref name=HOT1/&gt;{{rp|57}}

===British attacks===
Throughout most of 1942–43, the Atlantic Wall remained a relaxed front for the [[Axis powers|Axis]] troops manning it, with only two large-scale British attacks. [[Operation Chariot]], launched near [[St Nazaire]] in March 1942, successfully destroyed German pumping machinery for, and severely damaged, the Normandie dry dock and installations.{{sfn|Mountbatten|2007|p=72}} The second attack was the [[Dieppe Raid]], launched near the French port of [[Dieppe]] in August 1942 to test the German defences and provide combat experience for [[Canada|Canadian]] troops. The Germans were defeated at St. Nazaire, but had little difficulty in repulsing the attack at Dieppe, where they inflicted heavy casualties.  Although the Dieppe raid was a disaster for the Allies, it alarmed Hitler, who was sure an Allied invasion in the West would shortly follow.{{sfn|Overlord|2009}} Following Dieppe, Hitler gave Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], the overall German [[Commander-in-Chief]] in the West, 15 further divisions to shore up the German positions.{{sfn|Overlord|2009}}

===Reorganisation===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-297-1716-28, Im Westen, Belgien-Frankreich, Atlantikwall.jpg|thumb|left|German soldiers placing landing craft obstructions, 1943]]
Early in 1944, with an Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, [[Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]] was assigned to improve the wall's defences.{{sfn|Darman|2012|pp=8–9}}{{sfn|Overlord|2009}} Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them.{{sfn|Overlord|2009}} Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], and it had left a profound impression on him.{{sfn|Overlord|2009}} He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before it could make a difference.{{sfn|Overlord|2009}} Under his direction, hundreds of [[reinforced concrete]] [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] were built on the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, [[antitank guns]], and light and heavy artillery. [[Land mine]]s and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches, and underwater obstacles and [[naval mine]]s were placed in waters just offshore.{{sfn|Assault Plan}} The intent was to destroy the Allied [[landing craft]] before they could unload on the beaches.{{sfn|Assault Plan}}

===D-Day===
[[File:Batterie Longues-sur-Mer bunker gun 2.jpg|thumb|One of the casemates of the [[Longues-sur-Mer battery]] in Normandy, destroyed by naval gunfire during the [[Normandy landings|Allied landings]] ]]
By the time of the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion]], the Germans had laid almost six million mines in Northern France.{{sfn|Darman|2012|pp=8–9}} More gun emplacements and minefields extended inland along roads leading away from the beaches.{{sfn|Darman|2012|pp=8–9}} In likely landing spots for [[military glider|gliders]] and [[paratroop|parachutists]], the Germans emplanted slanted poles with sharpened tops, which the troops called ''[[Rommelspargel]]'' ("Rommel's Asparagus").{{sfn|Ambrose|1994|pp=221–222}} Low-lying river and [[estuary|estuarine]] areas were intentionally flooded.{{sfn|Overlord|2009}} Rommel believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped on the beach, declaring, "It is absolutely necessary that we push the British and Americans back from the beaches. Afterwards it will be too late; the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive."{{sfn|Assault Plan}}

==Channel Islands==

The [[Channel Islands]] [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|were heavily fortified]], particularly the island of [[Alderney]], which is closest to Britain. Hitler had decreed that one-twelfth of the steel and concrete used in the Atlantic Wall should go to the Channel Islands, because of the propaganda value of controlling British territory.{{sfn|Stephenson|Taylor|2013|pp=11–12}} The islands were some of the most densely fortified areas in Europe, with a host of [[Hohlgangsanlage tunnels, Jersey|Hohlgangsanlage tunnels]], [[casemates]], and [[Battery Lothringen|coastal artillery positions]].{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=197}}

However, as the Channel Islands lacked strategic significance, the Allies bypassed them when they invaded Normandy. As a result, the German garrisons stationed on the islands did not surrender until 9 May 1945—one day after [[Victory in Europe Day]]. The garrison on Alderney did not surrender until 16 May. Because most of the German garrisons surrendered peacefully, the Channel Islands are host to some of the best-preserved Atlantic Wall sites.{{sfn|Stephenson|Taylor|2013|pp=64–65}}

The commander in Guernsey produced books giving detailed pictures, plans and descriptions of the fortifications in their island, ''Festung Guernsey''.

==Fortresses==
{{See also|Festung Norwegen}}
Many major ports and positions were incorporated into the Atlantic Wall, receiving heavy fortifications. Hitler ordered all positions to fight to the end, and some of them remained in German hands until [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's unconditional surrender]]. Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarines after being surrounded by Allied Forces. The defenders of these positions included [[Wehrmacht foreign volunteers and conscripts|foreign volunteers]] and [[Waffen-SS]] troops.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Robert|2003|p=252}}

==Preservation==

===France===

Immediately after the war, there was little interest in preserving the wall due to the negative memories associated with the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation]]. One of the best preserved parts is the [[Todt Battery]]. In 2011, renewed efforts to preserve the wall were spearheaded by organisations in Germany, the [[Netherlands]], and the United Kingdom. Some of the beach fortifications have toppled or are underwater, while the ones further inland are still mainly exist due to their location.{{sfn|Hitler's Atlantic Wall}}

Many French construction companies benefited financially from helping construct the Atlantic wall; these companies were not penalised during the post war period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prieur |first=Jerome |title=Le Mur Atlantique |date=2010 |ISBN=978-2207108802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question has been raised over whether France should declare the wall a National Monument to ensure it is preserved; however no government so far has envisaged this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-10632543 |title=Hitler's Atlantic Wall: Should France preserve it? |publisher=BBC |date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elsewhere===

Although the [[defensive wall]] was never fully completed, many bunkers still exist near [[Ostend]], [[Channel Islands]], [[Scheveningen]], [[Den Haag]], [[Katwijk]], and in [[Scandinavia]].{{sfn|Williamson|2012|pp=7–8}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3035">The '''Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain Province''' is a [[coastal plain]] [[floristic province]] within the [[North American Atlantic Region]], a [[floristic region]] within the [[Holarctic Kingdom]]. It lies to the east and south of the [[Appalachian Province]], from southern Nova Scotia to northeastern Mexico. The narrow coastal strip in New England widens in New Jersey to a broad plain through the Delmarva Peninsula, Virginia, the Carolinas, southern Georgia, and much of Florida. Along the [[Mississippi Embayment]], the province stretches up to the confluence of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers in [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thorne |first=Robert F. |title=''[[Flora of North America]]''|volume=[http://floranorthamerica.org/Volume/V01/index Volume 1: Introduction] |chapter=Chapter 6: Phytogeography of North America North of Mexico |chapter-url=http://floranorthamerica.org/Volume/V01/Chapter06 |date=2009-07-16 |access-date=2017-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825023206/http://floranorthamerica.org/Volume/V01/Chapter06 |archive-date=2017-08-25 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province can be further subdivided into the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] and [[Gulf coastal plain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ecological Subregions of the United States (WO-WSA-5) | date = July 1994 | author = W.

[[File:Thessaly.jpg|thumb|350px|Map showing ancient Thessaly. Azorus is shown to the top centre in the [[Tripolis (Perrhaebia)|Perrhaebian Tripolis]].]]
'''Azorus''' or '''Azoros''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄζωρος}} or Ἀζώριον&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ptolemy|3.13.42}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a town and [[polis]] (city-state)&lt;ref name=Poleis&gt;{{cite book|author= Mogens Herman Hansen &amp; Thomas Heine Nielsen |title= An inventory of archaic and classical poleis|year= 2004|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 0-19-814099-1|chapter= Thessaly and Adjacent Regions|pages= 721-722}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Perrhaebia]] in [[ancient Thessaly]] situated at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]]. Azorus, with the two neighbouring towns of [[Pythion|Pythium]] and [[Doliche (Thessaly)|Doliche]], formed a [[Tripolis (Perrhaebia)|Tripolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|42.53, 44.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Roman–Seleucid War]], the Tripolis was ravaged by an army of the [[Aetolian League]] in the year 191&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|36.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Third Macedonian War]] the three towns surrendered to the army of [[Perseus of Macedon]] in the year 171&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|42.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that same year the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] reconquered the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|42.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 169&amp;nbsp;BCE troops arrived from the Roman consul [[Quintus Marcius Philippus (consul 186 BC)|Quintus Marcius Philippus]] who camped between Azorus and Doliche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Polybius|28.13.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|44.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three cities minted a common coin with the inscription "ΤΡΙΠΟΛΙΤΑΝ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Mogens Herman Hansen &amp; Thomas Heine Nielsen |title= An inventory of archaic and classical poleis|year= 2004|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 0-19-814099-1|chapter= Thessaly and Adjacent Regions|pages= 721-722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the foreground and background, and between the varying [[wikt:texture|textures]] represented by the stalks and the leaves, gave scope to the painter to demonstrate his or her mastery with an inkpot and a brush.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/large88.html |title=Ink Bamboo |work=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bamboo painter often inscribes a [[poem]] that accompanies the painting and further elucidates the motif. The poem is often an integral part of the work as a whole. A viewer of the work can compare the calligraphy of the poem with the calligraphy of the painting, as both are typically inscribed with the same brush and reflect a similar mood and state of awareness.  

A standard primer on classical East Asian bamboo painting is [[Hu Zhengyan]]'s "Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy" (1633).  Because of the volume of bamboo works painted over time, the production of a work of ink bamboo became one of the standard subjects to which an East Asian student could be set in a competitive [[Imperial examination|examination]].&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt;

==Appreciation==
From the days of their common origin, Chinese painting and Chinese writing have been allied arts. They use the same equipment and share aims, techniques, and standards. Ever since the beginning, bamboo has been written and also been painted in the same manner, in other words, a work depicting bamboo is both a painting and a piece of calligraphy. There are so-called “bamboo painters” who all their lives paint only bamboo.  The bamboo is strong, upright, and dependable. He may bend with the wind, the storm and the rain, but he never breaks. He is a true gentleman of courage and endurance (Ju 1989). 

{{blockquote|The first principle of bamboo composition is, the four parts of the plant should be considered in the following order: stem, knot, branches and leaves. If the basic rule is not followed, time and effort will be wasted and the picture will never be completed.” This is the beginning of the early Book of Bamboo, a part of the Mustard Seed Garden manual of painting which was prepared and published by Chinese master in the year 1701 A.D. No bamboo painting is a photographic copy of some bamboo at some particular place, seen from a particular angle; instead it is a suggestion of the true essence of the bamboo, an expression of the qualities of a true Chinese gentleman, whom the bamboo symbolizes (Ju 1989).}}

[[Image:Wen Tong Babmbuk.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Example of ink bamboo painting by [[Wen Tong]], c. 1060.]]
The [[bamboo]] plant came under close observation by many Asians because of its persistence and vegetative productivity. The plant was especially appreciated by men and women educated in the tradition of [[Confucius]]. It came to be seen as an exemplar of [[De (Chinese)|moral force]], and appreciating the bamboo was seen as an act of [[Chun Tzu|self-cultivation]]. It was said of the ink bamboo painter [[Wen Tong]] that "there are whole bamboos in his heart" (胸有成竹).

[[Bamboo]] is not exclusive to the '''[[Four Gentlemen|Four Noble Kind]]''' group. It also belongs to a distinct group where it openly fraternizes with [[pine trees]] and [[Prunus mume|plum blossoms]]. Collectively, they are called the '''[[Three Friends of Winter]]''' because [[bamboo]] and [[pine]] do not wither on winter days and the plum blossoms starts blooming during the cold season. 

Bamboo also exhibits a certain visual appeal on educated people because its [[silhouette]] cast by either the sun or moon on the paper windows of a Chinese house produced a poetic effect. Its straight stalk was the symbol of the sage, in that adversity could always bend it but it could never break it. The inner region of the bamboo stalk symbolizes the void that must be established in one's mind before thinking of useful ideas. To put it in simpler terms, one should always have clarity of mind when dealing with things to avoid chaos and to achieve desired results.

On the technical area, one needed to be an expert with the brush in order to execute perfectly cylindrical, smooth and hard [[internodes]], and thin, translucid, nervous leaves placed in various perspectives. One should also have a keen talent in identifying where to place dark [[Lightness (color)|tones]] and light tones in the painting. 

These characteristics are enough to validate that bamboo is a complete subject because it portrays lasting values one needed to get on with life and it commands a truly talented painter to create varying tones that never repeat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5637">'''Birdsall Parmenas Briscoe''' (June 10, 1876 - 1971) was an American architect active in Texas, especially in [[Houston]]. He was known as "Birdsall Briscoe" or "Birdsall P. Briscoe". Several of his works have been listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] for their architecture.

==Early life==
Briscoe was born on June 10, 1876, in [[Harrisburg, Texas]], as son of Andrew Birdsall and Annie Frances (Paine) Briscoe. [[Andrew Briscoe]] was a grandfather and [[John Richardson Harris]], founder of Harrisburg, was a great-grandfather. His parents owned a ranch near [[Goliad, Texas]]. He left the area to attend a San Antonio Academy, a preparatory school in San Antonio, Texas. He matriculated at Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas.&lt;ref name=HTO&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Stephen|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbrbw |title=Briscoe, Birdsall Parmenas |publisher=Texas State Historical Association|access-date=October 17, 2018|date=September 26, 2016|series=Texas Handbook Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Briscoe trained as an architect under C. Lewis Wilson and Lewis Sterling Green, while later forming a three-year partnership with Green. He opened his own practice in 1912.&lt;ref name=HTO/&gt; He shared an office in downtown Houston with fellow architect, Maurice P. Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of John F. Staub: Houston and the South|last=Barnstone|first=Howard|year=1979|location=Austin|publisher=University of Texas University Press|ISBN=0-292-74012-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected by the [[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks Company]] as one of three architects to design nine model homes in the nascent subdivision.&lt;ref&gt;Barnstone (1979), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

While still working outside of a partnership, Briscoe designed three homes in the [[private place|private]] street subdivision of [[Courtlandt Place, Houston]]. He completed the [[J. J. Carroll House]], the [[W. T. Carter Jr. House]], and the [[Courtlandt Place, Houston#Judson Taylor House|Judson L. Taylor House]] before [[World War I]]. All three are listed on the [[National Register for Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nris&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won commissions for two homes in Houston for [[William Lockhart Clayton]], both of which are historic landmarks. The first was the Georgian-Revival home sited on a whole city block in the Southmore Addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Clayton-House-edit.pdf|work=Houston History Magazine|title=Clayton House: Profile of a Home and the Family who Built It|first=Alex|last=Colvin|access-date=October 17, 2018|volume=13|issue=3|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, Briscoe completed the [[William L. Clayton Summer House]] (NRHP-listed) in [[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks]], the first property to be developed in the subdivision.&lt;ref name=AHC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.houstontx.gov/planning/HistoricPres/landmarks/08PL72_Wm_Clayton_Summer_House_3376_Inwood.pdf|title=Protected Landmark Designation Report: William L. Clayton Summer House|access-date=October 17, 2018|publisher=Archaeological &amp; Historical Commission, City of Houston|date=October 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Briscoe's work can also be found in the [[Broadacres Historic District]] in Houston. He designed four houses on South Boulevard with his partner Sam H. Dixon Jr. Two of these {{emdash}} the Clarence L. Carter and Walter H. Walne houses {{emdash}} employed prominent bays to create an asymmetrical medieval motif. The partners built a federal-style house for William D. Cleveland Jr. and a Spanish-style house for John F. Dickson Jr. They severed the partnership in 1926, after which Briscoe designed another four houses in Broadacres as a sole-practitioner. The first of these, the Cotswold-style Bettie G. Lester House on North Boulevard, marks a transition in Briscoe's work. He built an Italian villa for Burdine Clayton Anderson, then two more homes on North Boulevard, one for Robert W. Wier, and another for Edmond Pincoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/NR/pdfs/80004128/80004128.pdf|pages=10{{endash}}11|access-date=October 18, 2018|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory—Nomination Form: Broadacres Historic District|date=February 8, 1980|publisher=United States Department of the Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Briscoe served as associate architect to John F. Staub in the development of [[Bayou Bend]], a sprawling mansion sited on a fourteen-acre lot in River Oaks. The home was built between 1926 and 1928 under the consultation of [[Ima Hogg]], who lived there with her brothers, Will and Mike. Hogg bequeathed the estate to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], which operates the property as a museum annex for the Bayou Bend Collection of decorative arts. Bayou Bend is NRHP-listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BAYOU BEND|last=Fox|first=Stephen|series=Texas Handbook Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|access-date=October 18, 2018|date=July 21, 2016|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lbb01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Briscoe was a veteran of the [[Spanish-American War]] and [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=HTO/&gt;

==Death==
Briscoe died on September 19, 1971 in Houston. He was interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Goliad.&lt;ref name=HTO/&gt;

'''''Blackfish''''' is a 2013 American [[documentary film]] directed by [[Gabriela Cowperthwaite]]. It concerns [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]], an [[orca]] held by [[SeaWorld Orlando|SeaWorld]] &lt;nowiki/&gt; and the controversy over [[captive killer whales]]. The film premiered at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, 2013, and was picked up by [[Magnolia Pictures]] and [[CNN Films]] for wider release. It was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Documentary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2014/film/documentary |title=Documentary in 2014 |website=BAFTA.org |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] |access-date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Dawn Brancheau - Riders on the Storm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dawn Brancheau]] at SeaWorld Orlando in 2006.]]
The documentary concerns the captivity of Tilikum, an orca involved in the deaths of three individuals, and the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/28/blackfish-review | title = ''Blackfish'' – review | first= Philip | last=French | work= [[The Observer]] | location = UK | date=July 27, 2013 | accessdate= March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coverage of Tilikum includes his capture in 1983 off the coast of [[Iceland]] and his purported harassment by fellow [[captive orcas]] at [[Sealand of the Pacific]]. Cowperthwaite argues these incidents contributed to the [[orca's aggression]]. 

The film includes a [[testimonial]] from Lori Marino, director of science with the [[Nonhuman Rights Project]]. Cowperthwaite also focuses on [[SeaWorld]]'s claims that lifespans of orcas in captivity are comparable to those in the wild,&lt;ref name=seaworldletter /&gt; typically 30 years for males and 50 years for females,&lt;ref name=noaa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/killerwhale.htm |title=Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] Office of Protected Fisheries |accessdate=December 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210151801/http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/killerwhale.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim the film argues is false.&lt;ref name="LAT1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-sundance-blackfish-20130125,0,2675298.story|title='Blackfish' has SeaWorld in hot water|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 25, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people interviewed include former SeaWorld trainers, such as [[John J. Hargrove|John Hargrove]], who describe their experiences with Tilikum and [[List of captive orcas|other captive whales]].

The documentary reports that the whales have experienced extreme stress when their offspring were captured in the wild or when separated after breeding at water parks. The film features footage of attacks on trainers by Tilikum and other captive whales as well as interviews with witnesses.

Cowperthwaite began work on the film after the February 2010 death of Tilikum's trainer [[Dawn Brancheau]] and in response to the claim that the orca had targeted Brancheau because she had worn her hair in a ponytail.&lt;ref name="IWI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-interview-blackfish-director-gabriela-cowperthwaite-discusses-suffering-orcas-trainer-death-and-why-seaworld-hasnt-seen-the-movie|title=Sundance Interview: 'Blackfish' Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite Discusses Suffering Orcas, Trainer Death, and Why SeaWorld Hasn't Seen the Movie|first=Eric|last=Kohn|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|date=January 26, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191859/http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-interview-blackfish-director-gabriela-cowperthwaite-discusses-suffering-orcas-trainer-death-and-why-seaworld-hasnt-seen-the-movie | archivedate=October 29, 2013| deadurl =no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowperthwaite argued that this claim had been conjecture and that "there had to be more to this story".&lt;ref name="IWI"/&gt;

===Box office===
In release for 14 weeks, the film earned $2,073,582 at the North American domestic box office.&lt;ref name="box_office_mojo" /&gt;

===Response from trainers===
After the film's release, former SeaWorld trainer Bridgette Pirtle said the final film was "a complete '180' from what was originally presented to me."&lt;ref name=blackfishexposed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://micechat.com/53915-blackfish-exposed/ | first= Eric | last = Davis | publisher = MiceChat.com | title =Blackfish Exposed by Former SeaWorld Trainer |date =January 9, 2014 |accessdate =January 13, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141109231445/http://micechat.com/53915-blackfish-exposed/ | archivedate=November 9, 2014| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier statements, Pirtle praised the film's direction and supported its message.&lt;ref name=pirtinter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/politics/op-ed-sean-hannity-s-debate-on-orca-bill-evolves-into-full-on-bashing/article/380187 | first= Elizabeth | last = Batt | publisher = Digital Journal | title =Op-Ed: Sean Hannity's 'debate' on orca bill evolves into full-on bashing|date =April 9, 2014 |accessdate =August 20, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141109231536/http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/politics/op-ed-sean-hannity-s-debate-on-orca-bill-evolves-into-full-on-bashing/article/380187 | archivedate=November 9, 2014| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Simmons, one of Tilikum's first trainers, believed few of his interview comments were used "because the things I said flew in the face of the movie's clear agenda. What I contributed did not support Gabriela or Tim Zimmerman's intent with the film."&lt;ref name=moreblackfishbacklash&gt;{{cite web|url =http://micechat.com/54370-blackfish-backlash/ |title =More Blackfish Backlash – Tilikum's Trainer Dives In| first= Eric | last = Davis | publisher = MiceChat.com |date =January 13, 2014 |accessdate =January 13, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141110000311/http://micechat.com/54370-blackfish-backlash/ | archivedate=November 10, 2014| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Scarpuzzi, the vice president for zoological operations and trainer for SeaWorld San Diego, says the film uses Brancheau's death and gruesome details to "not inform the public, but, rather regrettably, because of the desire to sensationalize." He states, "We have altered how we care for, display and train these extraordinary animals. We have changed the facilities, equipment and procedures at our killer whale habitats. The care and educational presentation of these animals at SeaWorld has been made safer than ever. Does ''Blackfish'' inform its viewers of that fact? No, it does not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/23/opinion/seaworld-blackfish-controversy/| first= Michael | last = Scarpuzzi | publisher = CNN.com | title =Blackfish film ignores SeaWorld's benefits to conservation, research |date =October 28, 2013 |accessdate =December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the family of the late trainer Dawn Brancheau said neither they nor the foundation named after her were affiliated with the film, and that they did not believe it accurately reflected Brancheau or her experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia|first=Jason|title=Family of Dawn Brancheau chastises 'Blackfish'|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-dawn-brancheau-blackfish-statement-20140121,0,4328894.story|accessdate=January 23, 2014|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2013, the ''[[Orlando Business Journal]]'' posted a poll asking if ''Blackfish'' had changed readers' opinions on SeaWorld. The majority of votes stated that the film had not. It was later found that 180 out of 328 votes (55%) originated from a single SeaWorld-hosted IP address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/blog/2014/01/somethings-fishy-with-this.html?ana=twt&amp;r=full | title=Something's fishy with this SeaWorld/'Blackfish' poll | work= [[Orlando Business Journal]] | date= January 2, 2014 | accessdate= August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SeaWorld defended the voting, stating that "each of the votes that came from a SeaWorld domain were cast by team members who are passionate about the incredible work SeaWorld does and the experiences our parks provide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/03/seaworld-blackfish-poll-rigged-ip-address_n_4537254.html | title=SeaWorld-Owned IP Address Linked To Majority Of Votes In Newspaper's 'Blackfish' Poll: Report | publisher= Huffington Post | date= January 3, 2014 | accessdate= August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SeaWorld also created a section of its website titled "Truth About Blackfish," addressing the claims stated above and highlighting what it considered other problems with the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/SeaWorld-posts-videos-in-response-to-Blackfish-5242426.php |last=Parker |first=Kolten |title=SeaWorld posts videos in response to 'Blackfish' documentary | work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] | date=February 17, 2014| accessdate= February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="propaganda" /&gt;

SeaWorld announced afterward it had suffered a $15.9 million loss, which CEO James Atchison attributed in part to high ticket prices and poor weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-29/seaworld-slump-raises-a-question-is-shamu-too-sad-or-too-expensive |last= Stock |first= Kyle |title=SeaWorld's Slump Raises a Question: Is Shamu Too Sad, or Too Expensive? |publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=August 29, 2013 | archivedate= October 5, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131005053217/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-29/seaworld-slump-raises-a-question-is-shamu-too-sad-or-too-expensive | deadurl =no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bomb Damage in London, England, April 1945 CH15118.jpg|thumb|Bomb damage to the [[City of London]] in 1945]]
A '''bombsite''' is the wreckage that remains after a bomb has destroyed a building or other structure.

==World War II bombsites==
After [[World War II]] many [[Europe]]an cities remained severely damaged from bombing. [[London]] and other British cities which had suffered the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] were pock-marked with bombsites, vacant lots covered in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Many postwar children in urban areas shared a common memory of playing their games and riding their bicycles across these desolate environments.&lt;ref&gt;

In London, [[Liverpool]], [[Bristol]], etc., across the channel in [[Berlin]] and other places these sites were constant reminders of the death and destruction of the war. This was a contributory factor to the European [[Social psychology|psycho-sociological]] outlook of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;

==In literature and media==
The rubble of [[Vienna|Viennese]] bombsites and the remnants of the city's battered infrastructure serve as a backdrop to much of the action in the movie ''[[The Third Man (film)|The Third Man]]'', written by [[Graham Greene]], an author who would return to this bombsite motif again in his 1954 short story "[[The Destructors]]".

==Etymology==
The word ''catgut'' may have been an abbreviation of the word "cattlegut".  Alternatively, it may derive by [[folk etymology]] from ''kitgut'' or ''kitstring''—the word ''kit'', meaning [[fiddle]], having at some point been confused with the word ''kit'' for a young cat;  The word kit, being derived from fiddle in Welsh, a  language whose native speakers are very musical. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbMCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA811&amp;lpg=PA811 |title=Therapeutic Gazette |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common uses==
===Stringed instruments===
[[File:Violino classico, dettaglio.JPG|thumb|Catgut violin strings]]For a long time, catgut was the most common material for the [[strings (music)|strings]] of [[harp]]s, [[lute]]s, [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, and [[double basses]],  [[acoustic guitars]] and other [[String instrument|stringed musical instruments]], as well as older marching [[snare drum]]s.  Most musical instruments produced today use strings with cores made of other materials, generally [[steel]] or synthetic [[polymer]]. Gut strings are the natural choice for many classical and baroque string players,{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} and gut strings are still most commonly preferred in concert-tension [[Pedal harp|pedal/grand]] and some [[Harp#Folk.2C lever.2C and Celtic instruments|lever harp]]s because they give a richer, darker sound as well as withstanding high tension within low alto, tenor, and high-bass ranges.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Many acoustic guitarists moved away from gut strings in the early 1900s when the [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company]] introduced steel strings, which gave greater volume to the guitar. "The demand for steel came from ensemble players, who couldn't make themselves heard clearly without it."&lt;ref&gt;de Ste. Croix, Philip, editor  - The Complete Guitar Encyclopedia, New York: Parragon Books, 2014, pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years the majority of Martin guitars were made with steel strings to accommodate the demand. After World War II, most classical and flamenco guitarists switched from catgut to the new nylon strings for their greater smoothness, durability, and stability of intonation.

Before 1900, the best strings for [[musical instruments]] were reputedly from [[Italy]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Musicians believed the best were from Naples, though Rome and other Italian cities also produced excellent strings. Today high quality gut strings are produced mostly in Italy, Germany, and the United States. They are also made elsewhere, for example in India and Morocco, for local use.

===Sutures===
[[Catgut suture]] was once a widely used material in [[surgery|surgical]] settings. There is debate about whether to continue using catgut in a medical setting, since [[cotton]] is usually cheaper and wounds closed with either cotton or synthetic threads are less prone to [[infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,791344,00.html |title=Cotton vs Catgut |publisher=Time.com |date=1944-02-07 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catgut sutures remain in use in developing countries where they are locally less expensive and easier to obtain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Catgut treated with chromium salts, known as chromic catgut, is also used in surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Start |first1=N J |last2=Armstrong |first2=A M |last3=Robson |first3=W J |title=The use of chromic catgut in the primary closure of scalp wounds in children. |journal=Archives of Emergency Medicine |date=1989 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=216–219 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1285609/ |accessdate=3 September 2018 |issn=0264-4924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tennis racquets===
Natural gut is still used as a high-performance [[Strings (tennis)|string]] in [[tennis racquet]]s, although it had more popularity in the past and is being displaced by synthetic strings.

==Production==
To prepare catgut, workers clean the small intestines, free them from any fat, and [[steeping|steep]] them in water. Then they scrape off the external membrane with a blunt knife, and steep the intestines again for some time in [[potassium hydroxide]]. Then they smooth and equalize the intestines by drawing them out. Lean animals yield the toughest gut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/home-improvement/workshop/Workshop-Companion/Catgut.html |title=Workshop Companion |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, they twist the prepared gut strands together to make string. String diameter is determined by the thickness of the individual guts, and by the number used. A thin string, such as a violin E, uses only three or four guts, whereas a double bass string may use twenty or more. After twisting and drying, workers polish the strings to the required diameter.

Before the twentieth century, the strings were simply rubbed with an abrasive to smooth them. Today they are generally ground down to the desired diameter using a [[Centerless grinding|centerless grinder]].  After drying and polishing, workers bleach and disinfect the strings using [[sulfur dioxide]], dye them if necessary, and sort them into sizes.

Catgut sutures are normally treated with a [[Tanning (leather)#Chrome tanning|chromium salt]] solution to resist body enzymes, to slow the absorption process, and are called catgut chromic sutures—whereas untreated catgut sutures are called catgut plain sutures.&lt;ref name=CatgutTypes&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Catgut Sutures|url=http://www.dolphinsutures.com/resources/information-on-catgut|publisher=Dolphin Sutures|accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5757">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Crataeis''' (Κραται-ίς, -ίδος, alt. '''Crataiis''') is, by some accounts, the mother of [[Scylla]]. In [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Circe]] tells [[Odysseus]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:12.111-12.152 12.124&amp;ndash;126].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Nay, row past with all thy might, and call upon Crataiis, the mother of Scylla, who bore her for a bane to mortals. Then will she keep her from darting forth again." (Translation by A. T. Murray)

Several authors follow Homer in assigning Crataeis as the mother of Scylla, see  [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D13%3Acard%3D705 13.749]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg002.perseus-eng1:e.7.20 E7.20];  [[Servius]] on [[Virgil]] ''[[Aeneid]]'' 3.420; and schol. on [[Plato]], [[Republic]] 588c.&lt;ref&gt;Other accounts give other parents for Scylla, for discussions of the parentage of Scylla, see Fowler 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=scd8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32], Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA134 p. 134]; Gantz, pp. 731&amp;ndash;732; and Frazer's note to Apollodorus, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg002.perseus-eng1:e.7.20 E7.20].&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Homer nor Ovid mention a father for Scylla, but Apollodorus says that the father was either Trienus ([[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]?) or Phorcus (a variant of [[Phorkys]]), similarly the Plato scholiast, perhaps following Apollodorus, gives the father as Tyrrhenus or Phorcus, while [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] on Homer, ''Odyssey'' 12.85 gives the father as Triton.

Other authors have [[Hecate]] as Scylla's mother. The Hesiodic ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]'' gives Hecate and [[Phorbas]] as the parents of Scylla,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]'' fr. 262 MW = Most [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/hesiod-other_fragments/2007/pb_LCL503.277.xml 200].&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Acusilaus]] says that Scylla's parents were Hecate and Phorkys (so also schol. ''[[Odyssey]]'' 12.85).&lt;ref&gt;[[Acusilaus]]. fr. 42 Fowler (Fowler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=scd8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32]).&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps trying to reconcile these conflicting accounts, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] says that Crataeis was another name for Hecate, and that she and Phorcys were the parents of Scylla.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/argonautica00apoluoft#page/350/mode/2up 4. 828&amp;ndash;829 (pp. 350&amp;ndash;351)].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Semos of Delos (''FGrHist'' 396 F 22) says that Crataeis was the daughter of Hecate and Triton, and mother of Scylla by Deimos. [[Stesichorus]] (alone) names Lamia as the mother of Scylla, possibly the  [[Lamia (daughter of Poseidon)|Lamia]] who was the daughter of [[Poseidon]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Stesichorus]], [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/stesichorus_i-fragments/1991/pb_LCL476.133.xml?result=1&amp;rskey=vkJkZt F220 ''PMG'' (Campbell, pp. 132&amp;ndash;133)].&lt;/ref&gt; while according to [[Hyginus]], Scylla was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html 151].&lt;/ref&gt;

As originally proposed in 1980 by a team of scientists led by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and his son [[Walter Alvarez]], it is now generally thought that the K–Pg extinction was caused by the impact of a [[Chicxulub impactor|massive comet or asteroid]] {{convert|10|to|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide,&lt;ref name="AGU-20140409"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sleep |first1=Norman H. |last2=Lowe |first2=Donald R. |title=Scientists reconstruct ancient impact that dwarfs dinosaur-extinction blast |url=https://news.agu.org/press-release/scientists-reconstruct-ancient-impact-that-dwarfs-dinosaur-extinction-blast/ |date=9 April 2014 |journal=[[American Geophysical Union]] |accessdate=30 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39922998 |title=Dinosaur asteroid hit 'worst possible place' |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=15 May 2017 |website=[[BBC News Online]] |access-date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 66 million years ago,&lt;ref name="Renne2013"/&gt; which devastated the global environment, mainly through a lingering [[impact winter]] which halted [[photosynthesis]] in [[plant]]s and [[plankton]].&lt;ref name="Alvarez" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vellekoop |first1=J. |last2=Sluijs |first2=A. |last3=Smit |first3=J. |last4=Schouten |first4=S. |last5=Weijers |first5=J.

==Microbiota==
The K–Pg boundary represents one of the most dramatic turnovers in the [[fossil record]] for various [[calcareous]] [[nanoplankton]] that formed the [[calcium]] deposits for which the Cretaceous is named. The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pospichal, J.J. |title=Calcareous nannofossils and clastic sediments at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, northeastern Mexico |year=1996 |journal=Geology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=255–258 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/3/255 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0255:CNACSA&gt;2.3.CO;2 |bibcode=1996Geo....24..255P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bown, P |year=2005 |title=Selective calcareous nannoplankton survivorship at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary |journal=Geology |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=653–656 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/8/653 |doi=10.1130/G21566.1 |bibcode=2005Geo....33..653B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions than by a decrease in [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bambach, R.K. |author2=Knoll, A.H. |author3=Wang, S.C. |title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity |journal=Paleobiology |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=522–542 |year=2004 |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0522:OEAMDO&gt;2.0.CO;2 |url=http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/4/522 |issn=0094-8373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The K–Pg boundary record of [[dinoflagellate]]s is not so well understood, mainly because only [[microbial cyst]]s provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, which likely causes diversity to be underestimated.&lt;ref name="MacLeod" /&gt; Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gedl, P. |title=Dinoflagellate cyst record of the deep-sea Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary at Uzgru, Carpathian Mountains, Czech Republic |journal=Special Publications of the Geological Society of London |year=2004 |volume=230 |pages=257–273 |doi=10.1144/GSL.SP.2004.230.01.13 |bibcode=2004GSLSP.230..257G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extinction patterns==
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=left}} The K–Pg extinction event was severe, global, rapid, and selective, eliminating a vast number of species. Based on marine fossils, it is estimated that 75% or more of all species were made extinct.&lt;ref name="Jablonski1994"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jablonski, D. |year=1994 |title=Extinctions in the fossil record (and discussion) |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] B |volume=344 |issue=1307 |pages=11–17 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1994.0045 |last2=Chaloner |first2=W.

The event appears to have affected all continents at the same time. Non-avian dinosaurs, for example, are known from the [[Maastrichtian]] of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weishampel, D.

Similarly, fossil pollen shows devastation of the plant communities in areas as far apart as New Mexico, Alaska, China, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Nichols, D. J 2008" /&gt;

Despite the event's severity, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different [[clade]]s. Species that depended on [[photosynthesis]] declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the [[solar energy]] reaching the ground. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups.&lt;ref name="autogenerated347"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilf P. |author2=Johnson, K.R. |year=2004 |title=Land plant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous: A quantitative analysis of the North Dakota megafloral record |journal=Paleobiology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=347–368 |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0347:LPEATE&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=0094-8373}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omnivores]], [[insectivores]], and [[carrion]]-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources.

In [[stream]] [[Biocoenosis|communities]], few animal groups became extinct because such communities rely less directly on food from living plants and more on detritus washed in from the land, protecting them from extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Major extinctions of land-dwelling vertebrates at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, eastern Montana |author1=Sheehan, Peter M. |author2=Fastovsky, D.E. |year=1992 |journal=Geology |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=556–560 |url=http://www.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/georef/1992034409 |accessdate=2007-06-22 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020&lt;0556:MEOLDV&gt;2.3.CO;2 |bibcode=1992Geo....20..556S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the [[Pelagic zone|water column]] than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on [[primary production]] from living phytoplankton, while animals on the [[ocean floor]] always or sometimes feed on detritus.&lt;ref name="MacLeod" /&gt; [[Coccolithophorids]] and [[mollusk]]s (including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, [[freshwater snail]]s, and [[mussel]]s), and those organisms whose [[food chain]] included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses.

[[Radiolaria]] have left a geological record since at least the [[Ordovician]] times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary.

Numerous species of [[benthic]] foraminifera became extinct during the event, presumably because they depend on organic debris for nutrients, while [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in the ocean is thought to have decreased.

There is significant variation in the fossil record as to the extinction rate of [[marine invertebrates]] across the K–Pg boundary. The apparent rate is influenced by a lack of fossil records, rather than extinctions.&lt;ref name="MacLeod" /&gt;

[[Ostracod]]s, a class of small [[crustacean]]s that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits in a variety of locations. A review of these fossils shows that ostracod diversity was lower in the Paleocene than any other time in the Cenozoic. Current research cannot ascertain, however, whether the extinctions occurred prior to, or during, the boundary interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Coles, G P |author2=Ayress, M A |author3=Whatley, R C |year=1990 |contribution=A comparison of North Atlantic and 20&amp;nbsp;Pacific deep-sea Ostracoda |title=Ostracoda and Global Events |pages=287–305 |editor1=Whatley, R C |editor2=Maybury, C |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |isbn=978-0-442-31167-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Late Maastrichtian and Danian Ostracode Faunas from Northern Alaska: Reconstructions of Environment and Paleogeography |author1=Brouwers, E M |author2=De&amp;nbsp;Deckker, P. |year=1993 |journal=PALAIOS |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=140–154 |doi=10.2307/3515168 |jstor=3515168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous [[Scleractinia]] [[coral]] genera failed to cross the K–Pg boundary into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow [[tropical]] waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the [[photic zone]]) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary.

Except for [[nautiloid]]s (represented by the modern order [[Nautilida]]) and [[coleoid]]s (which had already [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] into modern [[octopus|octopodes]], [[squid]]s, and [[cuttlefish]]) all other species of the [[mollusca]]n class [[Cephalopoda]] became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These included the ecologically significant [[belemnoidea|belemnoids]], as well as the [[ammonoids]], a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled cephalopods. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving nautiloids, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event. The ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K–Pg extinction event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ward, P D |author2=Kennedy, W J |author3=MacLeod, K G |author4=Mount, J F |year=1991 |title=Ammonite and inoceramid bivalve extinction patterns in Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sections of the Biscay region (southwestern France, northern Spain) |journal=Geology |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1181–1184 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/12/1181 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019&lt;1181:AAIBEP&gt;2.3.CO;2 |bibcode=1991Geo....19.1181W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harries PJ, Johnson KR, Cobban WA, Nichols DJ |year=2002 |title=Marine Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary section in southwestern South Dakota: Comment and Reply |journal=Geology |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=954–955 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030&lt;0955:MCTBSI&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=0091-7613 |bibcode=2002Geo....30..954H |last2=Johnson |last3=Cobban |last4=Nichols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 35% of [[echinoderm]] genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although [[taxon|taxa]] that thrived in low-latitude, shallow-water environments during the late Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate.

There are substantial fossil records of [[Gnathostomata|jawed fishes]] across the K–Pg boundary, which provide good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates. While the deep sea realm was able to remain seemingly unaffected, there was an equal loss between the open marine apex predators and the [[durophagous]] [[demersal]] feeders on the continental shelf.

Within [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]], approximately 7 out of the 41 families of [[Neoselachii|neoselachians]] (modern [[sharks]], skates, and rays) disappeared after this event and [[Batoidea|batoids]] (skates and rays) lost nearly all the identifiable species, while more than 90% of [[teleostei|teleost fish]] (bony fish) families survived.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Neoselachian (Chondrichthyes, Elasmobranchii) Diversity across the Cretaceous–Tertiary Boundary |last1=Kriwet |first1=Jürgen |last2=Benton |first2=Michael J. |date=2004 |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=214 |issue=3 |pages=181–194 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.02.049 |pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=C |year=1993 |contribution=Osteichthyes: Teleostei |title=The Fossil Record |volume=2 |editor=Benton, M J |publisher=Springer |pages=621–656 |isbn=978-0-412-39380-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Maastrichtian age, 28&amp;nbsp;shark families and 13&amp;nbsp;batoid families thrived, of which 25 and 9, respectively, survived the K-T boundary event. 47 of all neoselachian genera cross the K/T boundary, with 85% being sharks.

There is evidence of a mass extinction of bony fishes at a fossil site immediately above the K–Pg boundary layer on [[Seymour Island]] near Antarctica, apparently precipitated by the K–Pg extinction event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zinsmeister, W J |date=1 May 1998 |title=Discovery of fish mortality horizon at the K–T boundary on Seymour Island: Re-evaluation of events at the end of the Cretaceous |url=http://jpaleontol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/3/556?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;author1=zinsmeister&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;field_name=fulltext&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;fdate=7/1/1927&amp;tdate=7/31/2007&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT |accessdate=2007-08-27 |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=556–571}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the marine and freshwater environments of fishes mitigated environmental effects of the extinction event.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;

===Terrestrial invertebrates===
[[Insect]] damage to the fossilized leaves of [[flowering plant]]s from fourteen sites in North America was used as a proxy for insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction. Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity.

Due to the wholesale destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, there was a proliferation of [[saprotrophic]] organisms, such as [[fungus|fungi]], that do not require [[photosynthesis]] and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, initially ferns and other ground-level plants, returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vajda, V |author2=McLoughlin, S |year=2004 |title=Fungal proliferation at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary |journal=Science |url=http://www.geol.lu.se/personal/VIV/Vajda%20&amp;McLoughlin%202004.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070926154715/http://www.geol.lu.se/personal/VIV/Vajda%20&amp;McLoughlin%202004.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-26 |format=PDF |volume=303 |pages=1489–1490 |doi=10.1126/science.1093807 |accessdate=2007-07-07 |pmid=15001770 |issue=5663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two species of fern appear to have dominated the landscape for centuries after the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/05/dinosaurs-asteroid-birds-forests-fires-paleontology-science/ How Did Dino-Era Birds Survive the Asteroid 'Apocalypse'?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polyploidy]] appears to have enhanced the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.&lt;ref name="Fawcett2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fawcett |first1=J.

====Birds====
Most paleontologists regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs (see [[Origin of birds]]). It is thought that all non-[[Aves|avian]] [[theropod]]s became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as [[enantiornithes|enantiornithines]] and [[hesperornithes|hesperornithiforms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hou, L |author2=Martin, M |author3=Zhou, Z |author4=Feduccia, A |year=1996 |title=Early Adaptive Radiation of Birds: Evidence from Fossils from Northeastern China |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5290 |pages=1164–1167 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5290.1164 |pmid=8895459 |bibcode=1996Sci...274.1164H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and [[ratite]] bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Definitive fossil evidence for the extant avian radiation in the Cretaceous |author1=Clarke, J A |author2=Tambussi, C P |author3=Noriega, J I |author4=Erickson, G M |author5=Ketcham, R A |year=2005 |journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7023 |pages=305–308 |doi=10.1038/nature03150 |pmid=15662422 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..305C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K–Pg boundary.

Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;

====Non-avian dinosaurs====
[[Image:Tyrannosaurus Rex Holotype.jpg|thumb|alt=Tyrannosaurus skeleton in museum display|''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' was among the dinosaurs living on Earth before the extinction.]]
Excluding a [[Paleocene dinosaurs|few controversial claims]], scientists agree that all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during the last few million years of the Cretaceous, and it may be that the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options.&lt;ref name="AF04"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Archibald |last1=David |first2=David |last2=Fastovsky |editor=Weishampel, David B |editor2=Dodson, Peter |editor3=Osmólska, Halszka |title=The Dinosauria |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-24209-8 |pages=672–684 |chapter=Dinosaur extinction |chapterurl=http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/archibald/ArchFast.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;

The growing consensus about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see [[physiology of dinosaurs|dinosaur physiology]]) helps to understand their full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the [[crocodilia]]ns. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while endothermic ("warm-blooded") animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died,&lt;ref name="autogenerated347" /&gt; while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ocampo, A |author2=Vajda, V |author3=Buffetaut, E |chapter=Unravelling the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–T) turnover, evidence from flora, fauna and geology in biological processes associated with impact events |editor1=Cockell, C |editor2=Gilmour, I |editor3=Koeberl, C |title=Biological Processes Associated with Impact Events |publisher=SpringerLink |year=2006 |pages=197–219 |isbn=978-3-540-25735-6 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vw75014157p2p278/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the extinction occurred gradually or suddenly has been debated, as both views have support from the fossil record. A study of 29&amp;nbsp;fossil sites in Catalan [[Pyrenees]] of Europe in 2010 supports the view that dinosaurs there had great diversity until the asteroid impact, with more than 100 living species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rieraa, V |author2=Marmib, J |author3=Omsa, O |author4=Gomez, B

The results of this study, which were based on estimated real global biodiversity, showed that between 628 and 1,078&amp;nbsp;non-avian dinosaur species were alive at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] and underwent sudden extinction after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Le&amp;nbsp;Loeuff, J |year=2012 |title=Paleobiogeography and biodiversity of Late Maastrichtian dinosaurs: How many dinosaur species became extinct at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary? |journal=Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France |volume=183 |issue=6 |pages=547–559 |doi=10.2113/gssgfbull.183.6.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, interpretation based on the fossil-bearing rocks along the [[Red Deer River]] in Alberta, Canada, supports the gradual extinction of non-avian dinosaurs; during the last 10&amp;nbsp;million years of the Cretaceous layers there, the number of dinosaur species seems to have decreased from about 45 to approximately 12.

K–Pg boundary mammalian species were generally small, comparable in size to [[rat]]s; this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;

== Evidence ==
=== North American fossils ===
[[File:Hell Creek.jpg|thumb|alt=aerial view of canyon with mesas and creek in background|Hell Creek Formation]]
In North American terrestrial sequences, the extinction event is best represented by the marked discrepancy between the rich and relatively abundant late-Maastrichtian [[palynomorph]] record and the post-boundary fern spike.&lt;ref name="Vajdaetal" /&gt;

At present the most informative sequence of dinosaur-bearing rocks in the world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late [[Maastrichtian]]-age [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[Montana]]. Comparison with the older [[Judith River Formation]] ([[Montana]]) and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] ([[Alberta]]), which both date from approximately 75&amp;nbsp;Ma, provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10&amp;nbsp;million years of the Cretaceous. However, these fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.&lt;ref name="AF04" /&gt;

The middle–late Campanian formations show a greater diversity of dinosaurs than any other single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'', and ''[[Torosaurus]]'',&lt;ref name="Dodson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Dodson |title=The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |location=Princeton, NJ |pages=279–281 |isbn=978-0-691-05900-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests food was plentiful immediately prior to the extinction.

In addition to rich dinosaur fossils, there are also plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are [[angiosperm]] pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Online guide to the continental Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary in the Raton basin, Colorado and New Mexico |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |year=2004 |url=http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/kt/stop2b.html |doi= |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925223706/http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/kt/stop2b.html |archivedate=2006-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smathers, G A |author2=Mueller-Dombois D |year=1974 |title=Invasion and Recovery of Vegetation after a Volcanic Eruption in Hawaii |series=Scientific Monograph |volume=5 |publisher=United States National Park Service |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/science/5/contents.htm |accessdate=2007-07-09 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marine fossils ===
The mass extinction of marine plankton appears to have been abrupt and right at the K–Pg boundary.&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pope KO, D'Hondt SL, Marshall CR |year=1998 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/19/11028 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.19.11028 |title=Meteorite impact and the mass extinction of species at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary |journal=PNAS |volume=95 |issue=19 |pages=11028–11029 |pmid=9736679 |pmc=33889 |bibcode=1998PNAS...9511028P}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammonite]] genera became extinct at or near the K–Pg boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–Pg boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall CR, Ward PD |year=1996 |title=Sudden and Gradual Molluscan Extinctions in the Latest Cretaceous of Western European Tethys |journal=Science |volume=274 |issue=5291 |pages=1360–1363 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5291.1360 |pmid=8910273 |bibcode=1996Sci...274.1360M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further analysis shows that several processes were in progress in the late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K–Pg boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2&amp;nbsp;million years ago, which is very near the time of the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, but the water temperature decreased, causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keller |first1=Gerta |title=The end-cretaceous mass extinction in the marine realm: Year 2000 assessment |journal=Planetary and Space Science |date=July 2001 |volume=49 |issue=8 |pages=817–830 |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(01)00032-0 |bibcode=2001P&amp;SS...49..817K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duration ==
The rapidity of the extinction is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes imply a rapid extinction over a relatively short period (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others imply longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the [[Signor–Lipps effect]]; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most [[extinction|extinct]] [[species]] probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the Earth |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=1982 |contribution=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns, and catastrophes in the fossil record |volume=Special Publication 190 |location=Boulder, Colorado |pages=291–296 |oclc=4434434112 |last2=Lipps |first2=J H |last1=Signor III |first1=P W |editor=Silver, L T |editor2=Schultz, P H |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efz87W88HawC&amp;pg=291 |isbn=978-0-8137-2190-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it.&lt;ref name="MacLeod" /&gt; The sedimentation rate and thickness of K–Pg clay from three sites suggest rapid extinction, perhaps less than ten thousand years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Short Duration of the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary Event: Evidence from Extraterrestrial Helium-3 |last1=Mukhopadhyay |first1=S. |displayauthors=etal |date=2001 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.291.5510.1952 |pmid= 11239153|access-date= |volume=291 |issue=5510 |pages=1952–1955|bibcode=2001Sci...291.1952M|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/36545/7/Mukhopad3.sup.pdf |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one site in the Denver Basin of Colorado, the ‘fern spike’ lasted about one thousand years (no more than 71&amp;nbsp;thousand years); the earliest Cenozoic mammals appeared about 185&amp;nbsp;thousand years (no more than 570&amp;nbsp;thousand years) after the K–Pg boundary layer was deposited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clyde |first1=William C. |last2=Ramezani |first2=Jahandar |last3=Johnson |first3=Kirk R. |last4=Bowring |first4=Samuel A. |last5=Jones |first5=Matthew M. |title=Direct high-precision U–Pb geochronology of the end-Cretaceous extinction and calibration of Paleocene astronomical timescales |date=15 October 2016 |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=452 |pages=272–280 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2016.07.041|bibcode=2016E&amp;PSL.452..272C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of [[Nobel Prize]]–winning physicist [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], his son geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], and chemists [[Frank Asaro]] and [[Helen Michel]] discovered that [[sedimentary]] layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a [[concentration]] of [[iridium]] many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20&amp;nbsp;times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in [[crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] because it is a [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile elements|siderophile element]] which mostly sank along with [[iron]] into [[Structure of the Earth#Core|Earth's core]] during [[planetary differentiation]]. As iridium remains abundant in most [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth at the time of the K–Pg boundary.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction |author1=Alvarez, L W |author2=Alvarez, W |author3=Asaro, F |author4=Michel, H V |year=1980 |journal=Science |volume=208 |issue=4448 |pages=1095–1108 |doi=10.1126/science.208.4448.1095 |pmid=17783054 |bibcode=1980Sci...208.1095A|url=https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/EART_206/09-0305/Alvarez%20et%2080%20Science%20208-1095.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an [[impact event]], but this was the first hard evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de&amp;nbsp;Laubenfels, M W |title=Dinosaur extinction: One more hypothesis |journal=Journal of Paleontology |pages=207–218 |year=1956 |volume=30 |issue=1 |jstor=1300393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research identified the giant [[Chicxulub crater]], buried under [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]] on the coast of [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]], as the source of the K–Pg boundary clay. Identified in 1990&lt;ref name="Hildebrand, A.

In a 2013 paper, [[Paul Renne]] of the [[Berkeley Geochronology Center]] dated the impact at {{val|66.043|0.011}}&amp;nbsp;million years ago, based on [[argon–argon dating]].

=== Effects of impact ===
In {{date|March 2010}}, an international panel of 41&amp;nbsp;scientists reviewed 20&amp;nbsp;years of scientific literature and endorsed the asteroid hypothesis, specifically the Chicxulub impact, as the cause of the extinction, ruling out other theories such as massive [[volcanism]]. They had determined that a {{convert|10|to|15|km|mi|adj=on}} asteroid hurtled into Earth at [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]] on Mexico's [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. The collision would have released the same energy as {{convert|100|TtTNT|ZJ|lk=on}} – more than a billion times the energy of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref name="Schulte10" /&gt;

The Chicxulub impact caused a global catastrophe. Some of the phenomena were brief occurrences immediately following the impact, but there were also long-term geochemical and climatic disruptions that devastated the ecology.

The reentry of ejecta into Earth's atmosphere would include a brief (hours long) but intense pulse of [[infrared|infrared radiation]], cooking exposed organisms.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt; A paper in 2013 by a prominent modeler of [[nuclear winter]] suggested that, based on the amount of soot in the global debris layer, the entire terrestrial [[biosphere]] might have burned, implying a global soot-cloud blocking out the sun and creating a nuclear winter effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Robertson, D.S. |author2=Lewis, W.M. |author3=Sheehan, P.M. |author4=Toon, O.B. |year=2013 |title=K/Pg extinction: Re-evaluation of the heat/fire hypothesis |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is debated, however, with opponents arguing that local ferocious fires, probably limited to North America, fall short of global [[firestorm]]s. This is the "[[nuclear winter#Potential climatic precedents|Cretaceous-Palaeogene firestorm debate]]".

Aside from the hypothesized fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have created a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for up to a year, inhibiting photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Pope"/&gt; The asteroid hit an area of carbonate rock containing a large amount of combustible hydrocarbons and sulphur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Kunio |last1=Kaiho |first2=Naga |last2=Oshima |year=2017 |title=Site of asteroid impact changed the history of life on Earth: The low probability of mass extinction |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |at=Article number 14855 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14199-x |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-14199-x|bibcode=2017NatSR...714855K }}&lt;/ref&gt; much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting [[sulfuric acid]] [[aerosol]]s into the [[stratosphere]], which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused acid rain.&lt;ref name="Pope"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n4/abs/ngeo2095.html |title=Production of sulphate-rich vapour during the Chicxulub impact and implications for ocean acidification |last=Ohno |first1=S. |displayauthors=etal |date=2014 |journal=Nature Geoscience |doi=10.1038/ngeo2095 |access-date=22 January 2014 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=279–282|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..279O }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that grow shells of [[calcium carbonate]].

If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the {{chem|CO|2}} content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary [[greenhouse effect]] once the dust clouds and aerosol settled, and, this would have exterminated the most vulnerable organisms that survived the period immediately after the impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Energy, volatile production, and climatic effects of the Chicxulub Cretaceous/Tertiary impact |author1=Pope, K.O. |author2=Baines, K.H. |author3=Ocampo, A.C. |author4=Ivanov, B.A. |year=1997 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=102 |issue=E9 |pages=21645–21664 |doi=10.1029/97JE01743 |pmid=11541145 |bibcode=1997JGR...10221645P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Chicxulub crater drilling project===
{{main|Chicxulub crater}}
In 2016, a scientific drilling project obtained deep [[rock core]] samples from the [[peak ring]] around the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact crater]]. The discoveries confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had been shocked by immense pressure and melted in just minutes from its usual state into its present form. Unlike sea-floor deposits, the peak ring was made of granite originating much deeper in the earth, which had been ejected to the surface by the impact. [[Gypsum]] is a [[sulfate]]-containing rock usually present in the shallow seabed of the region; it had been almost entirely removed, vaporized into the atmosphere. Further, the event was immediately followed by a [[megatsunami]]&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;A ''[[megatsunami]]'' is a massive movement of sea waters, which can reach inland tens or hundreds of kilometers.&lt;/ref&gt; sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring.

These findings strongly support the impact's role in the extinction event. The impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile-wide (193&amp;nbsp;km) peak ring, to melt, shock, and eject deep granite, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted for a long time.  This  worldwide dispersal of dust and sulfates would have affected climate catastrophically, led to large temperature drops, and devastated the [[food chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/updated-drilling-dinosaur-killing-impact-crater-explains-buried-circular-hills |title=Updated drilling: Dinosaur-killing impact crater explains buried circular hills |magazine=Science Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/science/chicxulub-crater-dinosaur-extinction.html |title=Chicxulub crater dinosaur extinction |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative hypotheses ==
Although the concurrence of the end-Cretaceous extinctions with the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis, some scientists continue to support other contributing causes: volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events. The end-Cretaceous event is the only [[mass extinction]] known to be associated with an impact, and other large impacts, such as the [[Manicouagan reservoir]] impact, do not coincide with any noticeable extinction events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brannen|first= Peter|date= 2017|title= The Ends of the World: Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans, and Our Quest to Understand Earth's Past Mass Extinctions|url= |location= |publisher= Harper Collins|page= 336|isbn= 9780062364807|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deccan Traps ===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] --&gt;
{{Main|Deccan Traps}}
Before 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&amp;nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|Mya]] and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over a period of only 800,000 years spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller G, Adatte T, Gardin S, Bartolini A, Bajpai S |title=Main Deccan volcanism phase ends near the K–T boundary: Evidence from the Krishna-Godavari Basin, SE India |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.015 |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=268 |pages=293–311 |bibcode=2008E&amp;PSL.268..293K |issue=3–4 |last2=Adatte |last3=Gardin |last4=Bartolini |last5=Bajpai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and [[aerosol]]s cleared from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid eruption of the Deccan flood basalts at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary |author=Duncan RA, Pyle DG |year=1988 |journal=Nature |volume=333 |pages=841–843 |doi=10.1038/333841a0 |issue=6176 |bibcode=1988Natur.333..841D |last2=Pyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A volcanic eruption|last = Courtillot|first = Vincent|date = 1990|journal = Scientific American|doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1090-85|pmid = 11536474|access-date = |pages = 85–92|volume = 263|issue = 4|bibcode = 1990SciAm.263d..85C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (d. 1988) replied that [[paleontologists]] were being misled by [[Signor–Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. Even Walter Alvarez acknowledged that other major changes may have contributed to the extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alvarez |first=W |title=T. rex and the Crater of Doom |year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01630-6 |pages=130–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining these theories, some geophysical models suggest that the impact contributed to the Deccan Traps.
These models, combined with high-precision radiometric dating, suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, as well as eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6256/76.short |title=State shift in Deccan volcanism at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, possibly induced by impact |last=Renne |first1=P.

=== Multiple impact event ===
Other crater-like topographic features have also been proposed as impact craters formed in connection with Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction. This suggests the possibility of near-simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object similar to the [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9|Shoemaker–Levy 9]] impact with [[Jupiter]]. In addition to the {{convert|180|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Chicxulub Crater]], there is the {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Boltysh crater]] in [[Ukraine]] ({{val|65.17|0.64|u=Ma}}), the {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Silverpit crater]] in the [[North Sea]] ({{val|59.5|14.5|u=Ma}}) possibly formed by [[bolide]] impact, and the controversial and much larger {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Shiva crater]]. Any other craters that might have formed in the [[Tethys Ocean]] would have been obscured by the  northward tectonic drift of Africa and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mullen L |date=October 13, 2004 |title=Debating the Dinosaur Extinction |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/1243/debating-the-dinosaur-extinction |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mullen L |date=October 20, 2004 |title=Multiple impacts |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/1253/multiple-impacts |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullen Shiva"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mullen L |date=November 3, 2004 |title=Shiva: Another K–T impact? |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/1281/shiva-another-k-t-impact |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chatterjee 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chatterjee |first=Sankar |authorlink=Sankar Chatterjee |date=August 1997 |chapter=Multiple Impacts at the KT Boundary and the Death of the Dinosaurs |title=30th International Geological Congress |volume=26 |issue= |pages=31–54 |id= |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=3IORF1Ei3LIC&amp;pg=PA31 |quote= |isbn=978-90-6764-254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maastrichtian sea-level regression ===
There is clear evidence that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the [[Mesozoic]] era. In some [[Maastrichtian]] [[Faunal stage|stage]] rock layers from various parts of the world, the later layers are terrestrial; earlier layers represent shorelines and the earliest layers represent seabeds. These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with [[Orogeny|mountain building]], therefore the likeliest explanation is a ''regression'', a drop in sea level. There is no direct evidence for the cause of the regression, but the currently accepted explanation is that the [[plate tectonics|mid-ocean ridges]] became less active and sank under their own weight.&lt;ref name="MacLeod" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abrupt deep-sea warming at the end of the Cretaceous |journal=Geology |year=1998 |first1=Liangquan |last1=Li |first2=Gerta |last2=Keller |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=995–998 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/11/995 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026&lt;0995:ADSWAT&gt;2.3.CO;2 |bibcode=1998Geo....26..995L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe regression would have greatly reduced the [[continental shelf]] area, the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a ''marine'' mass extinction; however, this change would not have sufficed to cause the extinction of the ammonites. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's [[albedo]] and increasing global temperatures.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;

Marine regression also resulted in the loss of [[epeiric sea]]s, such as the [[Western Interior Seaway]] of North America. The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing [[coastal plain]]s that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]. Another consequence was an expansion of [[freshwater]] environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to [[freshwater]] [[vertebrates]], those that prefer [[ocean|marine]] environments, such as [[shark]]s, suffered.&lt;ref name="AF04" /&gt;

=== Multiple causes ===
Proponents of multiple causation view the suggested single causes as either too small to produce the vast scale of the extinction, or not likely to produce its observed taxonomic pattern.&lt;ref name="AF04" /&gt; In a review article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky discussed a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, [[marine regression]], and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, as the largest vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, [[Particle|particulate]] materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then  an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains.

Recent work led by Sierra Peterson at Seymour Island, Antarctica, showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.&lt;ref name="Petersen, Sierra V. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petersen Sierra V., Dutton Andrea, Lohmann Kyger C. | year = 2016 | title = End-Cretaceous extinction in Antarctica linked to both Deccan volcanism and meteorite impact via climate change | url = | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 12079 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms12079 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...712079P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team analyzed combined extinction patterns using a new clumped isotope temperature record from a hiatus-free, expanded K-Pg boundary section. They documented a 7.8±3.3&amp;nbsp;°C warming synchronous with the onset of Deccan Traps volcanism and a second, smaller warming at the time of meteorite impact. They suggest local warming may have been amplified due to simultaneous disappearance of continental or sea ice. Intra-shell variability indicates a possible reduction in seasonality after Deccan eruptions began, continuing through the meteorite event. Species extinction at Seymour Island occurred in two pulses that coincide with the two observed warming events, directly linking the end-Cretaceous extinction at this site to both volcanic and meteorite events via climate change.&lt;ref name="Petersen, Sierra V. 2016"/&gt;

== Recovery and radiation ==
The K–Pg extinction had a profound effect on the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|evolution of life on Earth]]. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of [[adaptive radiation]]s in the Paleogene.&lt;ref name="Alroy, J. 1999" /&gt; The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alroy J |title=Cope's rule and the dynamics of body mass evolution in North American fossil mammals |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5364 |pages=731–4 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9563948 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5364.731 |url= http://doc.rero.ch/record/20309/files/PAL_E4068.pdf|accessdate= |bibcode=1998Sci...280..731A|format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups also underwent major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, [[Neoaves]] appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary.&lt;ref name="Feduccia, A. 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ericson, P G |author2=Anderson, C L |author3=Britton, T |displayauthors=etal |title=Diversification of Neoaves: integration of molecular sequence data and fossils |journal=Biol. Lett. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=543–7 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17148284 |pmc=1834003 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They even produced giant, flightless forms, such as the herbivorous ''[[Gastornis]]'' and [[Dromornithidae]], and the predatory [[Phorusrhacidae]]. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes may have led to the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas.&lt;ref name="Longrich, N. R. 2012" /&gt; On land, [[Titanoboa|giant boid]] and enormous [[Madtsoiidae|madtsoiid]] snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant [[sea snakes]] radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively,&lt;ref name="Friedman, M. 2010" /&gt; filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps to take the place of leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, [[Termitidae]], also appear to have risen in importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grimaldi, David A. |title=Evolution of the Insects |publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr (E) |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-511-12388-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''drumlin''', from the [[Irish Gaelic|Irish]] word ''droimnín'' ("littlest ridge"), first recorded in 1833, and in the classical sense is an elongated [[hill]] in the shape of an inverted spoon or half-buried egg&lt;ref&gt;Menzies(1979) quoted in Benn, D.I. &amp; Evans, D.J.A. 2003 ''Glaciers &amp; Glaciation'', Arnold, London (p431) {{ISBN|0-340-58431-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed by [[glacier|glacial]] ice acting on underlying unconsolidated [[till]] or ground [[moraine]].

==Morphology==

Drumlins occur in various shapes and sizes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037073810000849|title=The planar shape of drumlins|doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.01.008|volume=232|pages=119–129|journal=Sedimentary Geology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155742/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037073810000849|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=|bibcode=2010SedG..232..119S}}&lt;/ref&gt; including symmetrical (about the long axis), spindle, parabolic forms, together with transverse asymmetrical forms; their long axis is parallel to the direction of movement of the formative flow at the time of formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spagnolo | first1 = M. | last2 = Clark | first2 = C.D. | last3 = Hughes | first3 = A.L.C. | last4 = Dunlop | first4 = P. | last5 = Stokes | first5 = C.R. | year = 2010 | title = The planar shape of drumlins | url = | journal = [[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]] | volume = 232 | issue = | pages = 119–129 | doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2010.01.008| bibcode = 2010SedG..232..119S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drumlins are typically {{convert|1|to(-)|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, less than {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and between {{convert|300|to(-)|600|m|ft}} wide. Drumlins generally have a length:width ratio of between 1:2 and 1:3.5,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} with the questionable assumption that more elongate forms correspond to faster ice motion. That is, since ice flows in laminar flow, the resistance to flow is frictional and depends on area of contact; elongate, subglacial landforms produced by ice would represent relatively slow flow rates.

==Occurrence==
Drumlins and drumlin clusters are glacial landforms composed primarily of glacial [[till]]. They form near the margin of glacial systems, and within zones of fast flow deep within [[ice sheet]]s, and are commonly found with other major glacially-formed features (including [[tunnel valley]]s, [[esker]]s, scours, and exposed bedrock [[erosion]]).&lt;ref name=shaw1984&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = J. | last2 = Kvill | first2 = D. | title = A glaciofluvial origin for drumlins of the Livingstone Lake area, Saskatchewan | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 21 | issue = 12 | pages = 1442–1459 | year = 1984 | doi = 10.1139/e84-150|bibcode = 1984CaJES..21.1442S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drumlins are often in [[drumlin field]]s of similarly shaped, sized and oriented hills. Many [[Pleistocene]] drumlin fields are observed to occur in a fan-like distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patterson | first1 = C.J. | last2 = Hooke | first2 = R.L. | year = 1995 | title = Physical environment of drumlin formation | url = | journal = Journal of Glaciology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 30–38 | bibcode = 1995JGlac..41...30P | doi = 10.1017/S0022143000017731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Múlajökull]] drumlins of [[Hofsjökull]] are also arrayed in a splayed fan distribution around an arc of 180°.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

== Composition ==

Drumlins may comprise layers constituting [[clay]], [[silt]], sand, [[gravel]] and [[boulder]]s in various proportions – perhaps, indicating that material was repeatedly added to a core, which may be of [[rock (geology)|rock]] or [[glacial till]]. Alternatively, drumlins may be residual, with the landforms resulting from erosion of material between the landforms.  The [[Dilatancy (granular material)|dilatancy]] of glacial till was invoked as a major factor in drumlin formation.&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, I.J., Unwin, D.J. 1968. The formation and shape of drumlins and their distribution and orientation in drumlin fields. Journal of Glaciology 7, 377-390&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, drumlin fields include drumlins made up entirely of hard bedrock (e.g. [[granite]] or well-[[Limestone|lithified limestone]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lesemann, J., Brennand, T.A., 2009. Regional reconstruction of subglacial hydrology and glaciodynamic behaviour along the southern margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in British Columbia, Canada and Northern Washington State, USA. Quaternary Science Reviews 28, 2420–2444.&lt;/ref&gt;  These drumlins cannot be explained by the addition of soft-sediment to a core. Thus, accretion and erosion of soft-sediment by processes of subglacial deformation do not present unifying theories for all drumlins—some are composed of residual bedrock.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Formation ==
Conventional models of drumlin formation fall into two camps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X15300842|title=Automated drumlin shape and volume estimation using high resolution LiDAR imagery (Curvature Based Relief Separation): A test from the Wadena Drumlin Field, Minnesota|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.07.020|volume=246|pages=589–601|journal=Geomorphology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924164711/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X15300842|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=|bibcode=2015Geomo.246..589Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''constructional'', in which they form as sediment is manipulated into shape, for example via subglacial deformation; and ''remnant/erosional'', which proposes that drumlins form by erosion of material from an unconsolidated bed (reference).  A hypothesis that catastrophic sub-glacial floods form drumlins by deposition or erosion challenges conventional explanations for drumlins.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, J., 2002. The meltwater hypothesis for subglacial bedforms. Quaternary International 90, 5-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes deposition of glaciofluvial sediment in cavities scoured into a glacier bed by subglacial meltwater and remnant ridges left behind by erosion of soft-sediment or hard-rock by turbulent meltwater. This hypothesis requires huge, subglacial meltwater floods, each of which would raise sea-level by tens of centimetres in a few weeks. Studies of erosional forms in bedrock at French River, Ontario, Canada provide evidence for such floods.

These formed through a progression of subglacial depositional and erosional processes, with each horizontal till bed within the drumlin created by an individual surge of the glacier.&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1130/G31371.1 | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M.

However, it does not provide a unifying explanation of all drumlins. For example, drumlin fields including drumlins composed entirely of hard bedrock  cannot be explained by deposition and erosion of unconsolidated beds.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  As well, hairpin scours around many drumlins are best explained by the erosive action of horseshoe vortices around obstacles in a turbulent boundary layer.&lt;ref&gt;Paik, J., Escauriaza, C.,  Sotiropoulos, F., 2007.

Erosion under a glacier in the immediate vicinity of a drumlin can be on the order of a meter's depth of sediment per year, with the eroded sediment forming a drumlin as it is repositioned and deposited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = C.

==Soil development on drumlins==
Recently formed drumlins often incorporate a thin "A" [[soil horizon]] (often referred to as  "'topsoil'" which accumulated after formation) and a thin "Bw" horizon (commonly referred to as "'subsoil'"). The "C" horizon, which shows little evidence of being affected by soil forming processes (weathering), is close to the surface, and may be at the surface on an eroded drumlin. Below the C horizon the drumlin consists of multiple beds of till deposited by lodgment and bed deformation. On drumlins with longer exposure (e.g. in the Lake Ontario drumlin field in New York State) soil development is more advanced, for example with the formation of clay-enriched "Bt" horizons.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

'''Energy markets''' are [[commodity market]]s that deal specifically with the trade and supply of [[Energy (society)|energy]]. Energy market may refer to an [[electricity market]], but can also refer to other sources of energy. Typically [[energy development]] is the result of a government creating an [[energy policy]] that encourages the development of an [[energy industry]] in a [[competitive]] manner.

Until the 1970s when energy markets underwent dramatic changes, they were characterised by [[monopoly]]-based organisational structures.&lt;ref name="esmr"&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy Security: Managing Risk in a Dynamic Legal and Regulatory Environment |last=Andrei |first=Konoplyanik |chapter=International Energy Markets |editor-first=Barry |editor-last=Barton |year=2004 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0199271615 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKsTFgArP50C |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the world's petroleum reserves were controlled by the [[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]].  Circumstances changed considerably in [[1973 world oil market chronology|1973]] as the influence of [[OPEC]] grew and the repercussions of the [[1973 oil crisis]] affected global energy markets.

==Liberalization and regulation==
Energy markets have been liberalized in some countries; they are regulated by national and international authorities (including liberalized markets) to protect [[consumer right]]s and avoid [[oligopoly|oligopolies]]. Regulators includes the [[Australian Energy Market Commission]] in [[Australia]], the [[Energy Market Authority]] in [[Singapore]], the [[Energy Community]] in Europe, replacing the [[South-East Europe Regional Energy Market]] and the [[Nordic energy market]] for [[Nordic countries]]. Members of the [[European Union]] are required to liberalize their energy markets.

Regulators seek to discourage [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of prices, reform markets if needed, and search for evidence of [[anti-competitive behavior]] such as the formation of a [[monopoly]].

Due to the [[oil price increases since 2003|increase in oil price since 2003]] and the increase of [[speculation]], energy markets are being reviewed and by 2008, several conferences were organized to address the energy market sentiments of petroleum importing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jcQ3Vn4nmwZPvNIj64wVTTSZOq_A |title=EU leaders split on how to tackle soaring oil prices |publisher=Afp.google.com |accessdate=2008-06-20 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220223832/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jcQ3Vn4nmwZPvNIj64wVTTSZOq_A |archivedate=2008-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, the markets are being reformed by the introduction of harmonized and all-Russian consumer prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barentsobserver.com/murmansk-struggles-with-higher-electricity-prices.4493743-16149.html |title=Murmansk struggles with higher electricity prices|publisher=Barentsobserver.com |accessdate=2008-06-20 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and past energy usage in the United States==
[[File:A1 Houston Office Oil Traders on Monday.jpg|thumb|US energy market [[trading room]], 2004]]
The United States currently uses over four trillion kilowatt-hours per year in order to fulfill its energy needs. Data given by the [[United States Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) shows a steady growth in energy usage dating back to 1990, which showed the United States used around 3 trillion kilowatt hours of energy that year. Traditionally, the energy sources used to fulfill the United States energy needs have been oil, coal, [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], [[renewable energy]], and [[natural gas]]. The breakdown of each of these fuels as a percentage of the overall consumption in the year 1993, according to the data given by the EIA is as follows; coal was 53%, nuclear energy was 19%, natural gas was 13%, renewable energy was 11%, and oil provided 4% of the overall energy needs. In the most recent year where data was analyzed, 2011, the breakdown was as follows; coal was 42%, nuclear was 19%, natural gas was 25%, renewable energy was 13% and oil dropped down to 1%. These figures show a dramatic drop in energy from coal, and a significant increase in both natural gas as well as renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;Electricity Generation. (Dec. 5, 2012). Retrieved from www.eia.gov/forecasts.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
According to the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) data from 2006, hydroelectric power accounted for most of the renewable energy production in the United States. However, increasing government funding, grants, and incentives have been drawing many companies towards the biofuel, wind, and solar energy production industries.

==Moving towards renewable energy==
In recent years, there has been a movement towards renewable and sustainable energy in the United States. This has been caused by many factors, including the threat of climate change, cost, government funding, tax incentives, and potential profits in the energy market of the United States. According to the most recent projections by the EIA out to the year 2040, the renewable energy industry will be growing from providing 13% of the power in the year 2011 to 16% in 2040. This is equivalent to 32% of the overall growth during this time period. This large increase has the potential to be very lucrative for companies wishing to tap into the renewable energy market in the United States. 
	
This movement towards renewable energy has also been affected by the stability of the global market. Recent economic instability in countries in the Middle East and elsewhere has driven American companies to further develop American dependence on foreign sources of energy, such as oil. The long term projections by the United States Energy Information Administration for renewable energy capacity in the United States is also sensitive to factors such as the cost of domestic oil and natural gas production, prices, and availability.

==Renewable energy sources==
Currently, the majority of the United States’ renewable energy production comes from hydroelectric power, solar power, and wind power. According to the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], the cost of wind power doubled between the years of 2002 to 2008. However, since then, the prices of wind power have declined by 1/3, on average. Various factors have been contributing to the decline in the cost of wind power, such as government subsidies, tax breaks, technological advancement, and the cost of  oil and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;Wind Power Economics: Past, Present, and Future Trends. (Nov. 23, 2011). Retrieved from energy.gov&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
[[Hydroelectric power in the United States|Hydroelectric power]] has been the most predominant source of renewable energy for quite some time due to the fact that it has been proven to be reliable and has been in use for quite some time. This source of energy has provided the majority of renewable energy and has been a significant source of overall energy production in the United States.  The problem with traditional hydroelectric power has been the requirement of damming rivers and other sources of water.  The problem created by damming is that the natural environment of the area is disrupted due to the formation of a lake caused by the damming of the water source. This creates uproar by environmentalists and a large obstacle to clear before being able to build a [[hydroelectric plant]]. However, new forms of hydroelectric power that harness wave energy from the oceans have been in development in recent years. Although these power sources still need much development before they become economically viable, they do have potential to become significant sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Hydroelectric Power Water Use. (Feb 14, 2013). Retrieved from www.ga.water.usgs.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[wind energy]] and [[solar energy]] have made the largest steps towards significant energy production in the United States. These sources have little impact on the environment and have the highest potential of renewable energy sources used today. Advances in technology, government tax rebates, subsidies, grants, and economic need have all lead to huge steps towards the usage of sustainable wind and solar energy today.

==Energy market in the U.S.==
The energy industry is the third-largest industry in the United States.&lt;ref name="eius"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://selectusa.commerce.gov/industry-snapshots/energy-industry-united-states |title=The Energy Industry in the United States |work=commerce.gov |publisher=USA Government |accessdate=28 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This market is expected to have an investment of over $700 billion over the next two decades according to selectusa. This allows for large amount of advancement in technological development in the near future. There are also many federal resources enticing both domestic and foreign companies to send investments towards the renewable energy industry in the United States. These federal resources include the Department of Energy Loan Guarantee, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, the Smart Grid Stimulus Program, as well as an Executive Order on Industrial Energy Efficiency. All these programs allow for a very lucrative investment for companies wishing to compete in the energy industry in the United States. With the advancement of technology in recent years, harnessing the power of wind, solar, and hydroelectric resources in the United States will become the focus of the United States’ shift towards alternative energy. This should also drive down the prices of oil due to a decrease in demand. There are more incentives now than ever before to develop these technologies and bring them into greater use.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Industry in the United States.

'''Enthalpy''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|θ|əl|p|i|audio=en-US-enthalpy.ogg}}, a property of a [[thermodynamic system]], is equal to the system's [[internal energy]] plus the product of its pressure and volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/enthalpy |title=Oxford Living Dictionaries |accessdate=2018-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817085918/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/enthalpy |archivedate=2016-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/html/E/E02141.html |title=IUPAC Gold Book. Enthalpy, H |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For processes at constant pressure, the heat absorbed or released equals the change in enthalpy.

The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the [[joule]]. Other historical conventional units still in use include the [[British thermal unit|British thermal unit (BTU)]] and the [[calorie]].

Enthalpy comprises a system's [[internal energy]], which is the energy required to create the system, plus the amount of [[work (physics)|work]] required to make room for it by displacing its [[environment (systems)|environment]] and establishing its volume and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark W. |last=Zemansky |date=1968 |title=Heat and Thermodynamics |chapter=Chapter 11 |edition=5th |page=275 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthalpy is defined as a [[state function]] that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy, pressure, and volume. It is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] quantity.

Enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of [[energy transfer]]. At constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work.

The total enthalpy, ''H'', of a system cannot be measured directly. The same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, Δ''H''. The Δ''H'' is a positive change in [[endothermic]] reactions, and negative in heat-releasing [[exothermic]] processes.

'''For processes under constant pressure''', Δ''H'' is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] p ΔV done by the system on its surroundings (which is &gt; 0 for an expansion and &lt; 0 for a contraction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. J. |last1=Van Wylen |first2=R. E. |last2=Sonntag |date=1985 |title=Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics |chapter=Section 5.5 |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-471-82933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed or released by the system through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer. Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure usually refer to [[standard state]]: most commonly 1 bar pressure. Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see [[standard state]]), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

Enthalpy of [[ideal gas]]es and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure, unlike [[entropy]] and [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]]. Real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses.

==History==
The word ''enthalpy'' was coined relatively late, in the early 20th century, in analogy with the 19th-century terms ''[[energy]]'' (introduced in its modern sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1802) and ''[[entropy]]'' (coined in analogy to ''energy'' by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865).
It uses the root of Greek {{lang|grc|θάλπος}} "warmth, heat"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qa%2Flpos&amp;la=greek&amp;can=qa%2Flpos0&amp;prior=qalpno/s#lexicon θάλπος] in ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
where ''energy'' has {{lang|grc|ἔργον}} "work" and ''entropy'' {{lang|grc|τροπή}} "transformation", by analogy expressing the idea of "heat-content" where energy refers to "work-content" and entropy to "transformation-content".
The term does in fact stand in for the older term "heat content",&lt;ref&gt;Howard (2002) quotes [[J. R. Partington]] in ''An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry'' (1949) as saying that the function ''H'' was "usually called the heat content".&lt;/ref&gt; 
a term which is now mostly deprecated as misleading, as  {{mvar|dH}} refers to the amount of heat absorbed in a process at constant pressure only,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ignacio |last1=Tinoco, Jr. |first2=Kenneth |last2=Sauer |first3=James C. |last3=Wang |date=1995 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=41 |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=978-0-13-186545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
but not in the general case (when pressure is variable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Keith J.|last1=Laidler |authorlink=Keith J. Laidler |first2=John H. |last2=Meiser |date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] used the term "a heat function for constant pressure" for clarity.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''The Collected Works of J. Willard Gibbs, Vol. I'' do not contain reference to the word enthalpy, but rather reference the "heat function for constant pressure". See: {{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduction of the concept of "heat content" {{mvar|H}} is associated with [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron]] and [[Rudolf Clausius]] ([[Clausius–Clapeyron relation]], 1850).

The term ''enthalpy'' first appeared in print in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Dalton, ''Proc. K. Akad. Wetens. Amsterdam'' 11 (1909), p. 863.&lt;/ref&gt; It is attributed to  [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who most likely introduced it orally the year before, at the first meeting of the Institute of Refrigeration in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Laidler|first1= Keith|authorlink= Keith J.

It gained currency only in the 1920s, notably with the ''[[enthalpy–entropy chart|Mollier Steam Tables and Diagrams]]'', published in 1927.

Until the 1920s, the symbol {{mvar|H}} was used, somewhat inconsistently, for "heat" in general. 
The definition of {{mvar|H}} as strictly limited to enthalpy or "heat content at constant pressure" was formally proposed by Alfred W. Porter in 1922.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;

==Formal definition==
The enthalpy of a thermodynamic system is defined as&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"&gt;{{cite book|first=E. A. |last=Guggenheim |title=Thermodynamics |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zumdahl, Steven S.|chapter=Thermochemistry|title=Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=978-0-547-12532-9|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114034015/http://books.google.com/books?id=LLWkH82PNbYC&amp;pg=PA243|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + p V,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''H'' is the enthalpy of the system,
:''U'' is the [[internal energy]] of the system,
:''p'' is the [[pressure]] of the system,
:''V'' is the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] of the system.
Enthalpy is an [[extensive property]]. This means that, for homogeneous systems, the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to introduce the [[specific enthalpy]] ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''m''}}, where ''m'' is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''n''}}, where ''n'' is the number of moles (''h'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are [[intensive properties]]). For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_k H_k,&lt;/math&gt;

where the label ''k'' refers to the various subsystems. In case of continuously varying ''p'', ''T'' or composition, the summation becomes an integral:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \int \rho h \, dV,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the density.

The enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function ''H''(''S'',''p'') of the entropy ''S'' and the pressure ''p'', and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows. We start from the [[first law of thermodynamics]] for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q - \delta W.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''δQ''  is a small amount of heat added to the system, and ''δW'' a small amount of work performed by the system. In a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place, so the [[second law of thermodynamics]] gives {{nowrap|''δQ'' {{=}} ''T&amp;thinsp;dS''}}, with ''T'' the [[absolute temperature]] of the system. Furthermore, if only ''pV'' work is done, {{nowrap|1=''δW'' = ''p&amp;thinsp;dV''}}. As a result,

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\,dS - p\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Adding ''d''(''pV'') to both sides of this expression gives

:&lt;math&gt;dU + d(pV) = T\,dS - p\,dV + d(pV),&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;d(U + pV) = T\,dS + V\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;dH(S,p) = T\,dS + V\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

==Other expressions==
The above expression of ''dH'' in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers. However, there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure:&lt;ref name="Guggenheim" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;dH = C_p\,dT + V(1 - \alpha T)\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the heat capacity at constant pressure and ''α'' is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_p.&lt;/math&gt;

With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V'' are known as functions of ''p'' and ''T''.

Note that for an [[ideal gas]], ''αT''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref group=note&gt;&lt;math&gt;\alpha T=\frac{T}{V}\left(\frac{\partial (\frac{n R T}{P})}{\partial T}\right)_p = \frac{nRT}{PV} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;dH = C_p\,dT.&lt;/math&gt;

In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the [[chemical potential]] and the number of particles of various types. The differential statement for ''dH'' then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;dH = T\,dS + V\,dp + \sum_i \mu_i\,dN_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the chemical potential per particle for an ''i''-type particle, and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as {{nowrap|''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;''dn''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (with ''dn''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the number of moles of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the molar chemical potential) or as {{nowrap|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''dm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (with ''dm''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the mass of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the specific chemical potential).

==Physical interpretation==
The ''U'' term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and the ''pV'' term as the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] that would be required to "make room" for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, ''n'' [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of a gas of [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V'' at [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[temperature]] ''T'', is created or brought to its present state from [[absolute zero]], energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy ''U'' plus ''pV'', where ''pV'' is the [[Work (physics)|work]] done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.

In basic [[physics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. |last=Reif |title=Statistical Physics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=London |date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=C. |last1=Kittel |first2=H. |last2=Kroemer |title=Thermal Physics |publisher=Freeman |location=London |date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In basic [[chemistry]], experiments are often conducted at constant [[atmospheric pressure]], and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that Δ''H'' is the expression chosen for the [[heat of reaction]].

For a [[heat engine]] a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Physik|last=Bartelmann|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2015|isbn=978-3-642-54617-4|location=|pages=1106–1108|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dH=\delta Q-\delta W&lt;/math&gt; 
where the work W done by the engine is: 
:&lt;math&gt;W=-\oint pdV&lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship to heat ==
In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems: {{nowrap|1=''dU'' = ''δQ'' − ''δW''}}. We apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called ''pV'' work, given by {{nowrap|''p&amp;thinsp;dV''}} (where here ''p'' is the pressure at the surface, ''dV'' is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work ''δW′'', such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction. So we write {{nowrap|1=''δW'' = ''p&amp;thinsp;dV'' + ''δW′''}}. In this case the first law reads:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q - p\,dV - \delta W',&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;dH = \delta Q + V\,dp - \delta W'.&lt;/math&gt;

From this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added [[heat]]:

:&lt;math&gt;dH = \delta Q,&lt;/math&gt;

provided that the system is under [[isobaric system|constant pressure]] (''dp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (''δW'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ebbing|first1=Darrel|last2=Gammon|first2=Steven|title=General Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=978-0-538-49752-7|page=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114033110/http://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&amp;pg=PA231|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from "nothingness"; the mechanical work required, ''pV'', differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the [[thermodynamic system]].

[[Energy]] must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure ''p'' remains constant; this is the ''pV'' term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy, ''U'', which includes [[activation energy|activation energies]], ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''pV''. For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the ''pV'' work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.

For a simple system, with a constant number of particles, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rathakrishnan|title=High Enthalpy Gas Dynamics|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd.|isbn=9781118821893|date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat of reaction===
{{Main|Standard enthalpy of reaction}}
The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly, the ''enthalpy change'' of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = H_\mathrm{f} - H_\mathrm{i},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:Δ''H'' is the "enthalpy change",
:''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the products),
:''H''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the reactants).

For an [[exothermic reaction]] at constant [[pressure]], the system's change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction, including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings.  In a similar manner, for an [[endothermic]] reaction, the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy ''absorbed'' in the reaction, including the energy ''lost by'' the system and ''gained'' from compression from its surroundings. If Δ''H'' is positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants.  On the other hand, if Δ''H'' is negative, the reaction is exothermic, that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith J. |last=Laidler |first2=John H.|last2=Meiser|date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the definition of enthalpy as &lt;math&gt;H = U + pV,&lt;/math&gt; the enthalpy change at constant pressure &lt;math&gt;\Delta H = \Delta U + p \Delta V.&lt;/math&gt; However for most chemical reactions, the work term &lt;math&gt;p \Delta V&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than the internal energy change &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; which is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;\Delta H.&lt;/math&gt;  As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g), &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; = –566.0 kJ and &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt; = –563.5 kJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ralph H. |last=Petrucci |first2=William S.|last2=Harwood |first3=F. Geoffrey|last3=Herring |date=2002 |title=General Chemistry |edition=8th |pages=237–8 |isbn=978-0-13-014329-7|publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often loosely described as reaction energies and analyzed in terms of [[bond energy|bond energies]].

===Specific enthalpy===
The specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as ''h'' = {{sfrac|''H''|''m''}} where ''m'' is the mass of the system. The [[SI unit]] for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram. It can be expressed in other specific quantities by {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''u'' + ''pv''}}, where ''u'' is the specific [[internal energy]], ''p'' is the pressure, and ''v'' is [[specific volume]], which is equal to {{sfrac|''ρ''}}, where ''ρ'' is the [[density]].

===Enthalpy changes===
An enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction. It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the [[Product (chemistry)|products]], and the initial enthalpy of the system, i.e. the reactants. These processes are reversible{{why|date=March 2015}} and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change.

A common standard enthalpy change is the [[enthalpy of formation]], which has been determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]. The following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.

When used in these recognized terms the qualifier ''change'' is usually dropped and the property is simply termed ''enthalpy of 'process'''. Since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters, or [[standard conditions]], including: 
* A [[temperature]] of 25&amp;nbsp;°C or 298.15&amp;nbsp;K,
* A [[pressure]] of one atmosphere (1&amp;nbsp;atm or 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa),
* A [[concentration]] of 1.0&amp;nbsp;M when the element or compound is present in solution,
* Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. [[standard state]].
For such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term ''standard'', e.g. ''standard enthalpy of formation''.

Chemical properties:
* [[Enthalpy of reaction]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of substance reacts completely.
* [[Enthalpy of formation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a compound is formed from its elementary antecedents.
* [[Enthalpy of combustion]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a substance burns completely with oxygen.
* [[Enthalpy of hydrogenation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts completely with an excess of hydrogen to form a saturated compound.
* [[Enthalpy of atomization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to atomize one mole of compound completely.
*[[Enthalpy of neutralization]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of water is formed when an acid and a base react.
* Standard [[Enthalpy of solution]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a solute is dissolved completely in an excess of solvent, so that the solution is at infinite dilution.
* Standard enthalpy of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)]], defined as the enthalpy change required to denature one mole of compound.
* [[Hydration energy|Enthalpy of hydration]], defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of gaseous ions are completely dissolved in water forming one mole of aqueous ions.

* [[Enthalpy of vaporization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between liquid and gaseous states.
* [[Enthalpy of sublimation]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and gaseous states.
* [[Lattice enthalpy]], defined as the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic compound into separated gaseous ions to an infinite distance apart (meaning no force of attraction).
* [[Enthalpy of mixing]], defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substances.

===Open systems===
In [[thermodynamic]] [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]], matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \delta Q + dU_\text{in} - dU_\text{out} - \delta W,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; is the average internal energy entering the system, and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is the average internal energy leaving the system.

[[Image:First law open system.svg|250px|thumb|right|During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady, continuous]] operation, an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added]]

The region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a [[control volume]], and it may or may not correspond to physical walls.  If we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid.  There are then two types of work performed: ''flow work'' described above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called ''pV work''), and ''shaft work'', which may be performed on some mechanical device.

These two types of work are expressed in the equation

: &lt;math&gt;\delta W = d(p_\text{out}V_\text{out}) - d(p_\text{in}V_\text{in}) + \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields:

: &lt;math&gt;dU_\text{cv} = \delta Q + dU_\text{in} + d(p_\text{in}V_\text{in}) - dU_\text{out} - d(p_\text{out}V_\text{out}) - \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of enthalpy, ''H'', permits us to use this [[thermodynamic potential]] to account for both internal energy and ''pV'' work in fluids for open systems:

: &lt;math&gt;dU_\text{cv} = \delta Q + dH_\text{in} - dH_\text{out} - \delta W_\text{shaft}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons), we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of time derivatives it reads:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_k \dot Q_k + \sum_k \dot H_k - \sum_k p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} - P,&lt;/math&gt;

with sums over the various places ''k'' where heat is supplied, matter flows into the system, and boundaries are moving. The ''Ḣ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' terms represent enthalpy flows, which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\dot H_k = h_k\dot m_k = H_m\dot n_k,&lt;/math&gt;

with ''ṁ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' the mass flow and ''ṅ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' the molar flow at position ''k'' respectively. The term {{sfrac|''dV''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;|''dt''}} represents the rate of change of the system volume at position ''k'' that results in ''pV'' power done by the system. The parameter ''P'' represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be e.g. electric power produced by an electrical power plant.

Note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet.{{clarify|reason=This new type of energy, kinetic energy, was not mentioned before. Is it part of U? Does it need to be conserved, or just the net flow across boundary be zero?|date=March 2015}} Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] operation of a device (''see [[turbine]], [[pump]], and [[engine]]''), the average {{sfrac|''dU''|''dt''}} may be set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average [[Power (physics)|power]] generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:

:&lt;math&gt; P = \sum_k \left\langle \dot Q_k \right\rangle
+ \sum_k \left\langle \dot H_k \right\rangle
- \sum_k \left\langle p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} \right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[angle bracket]]s denote time averages. The technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems, as formulated above.

==Diagrams==

The red dome represents the two-phase region with the low-entropy side the saturated liquid and the high-entropy side the saturated gas. The black curves give the ''T''–''s'' relation along isobars. The pressures are indicated in bar. The blue curves are isenthalps (curves of constant enthalpy). The values are indicated in blue in kJ/kg. The specific points '''a''', '''b''', etc., are treated in the main text.]]

The enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as ''h''–''T'' diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures, and ''h''–''p'' diagrams, which give ''h'' as function of ''p'' for various ''T''. One of the most common diagrams is the temperature–specific entropy diagram (''T''–''s''-diagram). It gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.

===Some basic applications===
The points '''a''' through '''h''' in the figure play a role in the discussion in this section.
:'''a''': ''T'' = 300&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.85&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 461&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''b''': ''T'' = 380&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 2&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.85&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 530&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''c''': ''T'' = 300&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 200&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 5.16&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 430&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''d''': ''T'' = 270&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.79&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 430&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''e''': ''T'' = 108&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 13&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 3.55&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 100&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 13&amp;nbsp;bar);
:'''f''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 3.75&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 100&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg;
:'''g''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 2.83&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 28&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 1&amp;nbsp;bar);
:'''h''': ''T'' = 77.2&amp;nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&amp;nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 5.41&amp;nbsp;kJ/(kg&amp;nbsp;K), ''h'' = 230&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated gas at 1&amp;nbsp;bar);

===Throttling===
{{main|Joule–Thomson effect}}
[[File:Schematic of throttling.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a throttling in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''ṁ''.]]

One of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process, also known as [[Joule–Thomson effect|Joule-Thomson expansion]]. It concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure. This process is very important, since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators, where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator. It is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers.

For a steady state flow regime, the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle) has to be constant. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the mass flow is constant, the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same:

:&lt;math&gt;h_1 = h_2,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ''T''–''s'' diagram above. Point '''c''' is at 200&amp;nbsp;bar and room temperature (300&amp;nbsp;K). A Joule–Thomson expansion from 200&amp;nbsp;bar to 1&amp;nbsp;bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg isenthalps and ends in point '''d''', which is at a temperature of about 270&amp;nbsp;K. Hence the expansion from 200&amp;nbsp;bar to 1&amp;nbsp;bar cools nitrogen from 300&amp;nbsp;K to 270&amp;nbsp;K. In the valve, there is a lot of friction, and a lot of entropy is produced, but still the final temperature is below the starting value!

Point '''e''' is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with {{nowrap|1=''h'' = 100 kJ/kg}}. It corresponds roughly with {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 13 bar}} and {{nowrap|1=''T'' = 108 K}}. Throttling from this point to a pressure of 1&amp;nbsp;bar ends in the two-phase region (point '''f'''). This means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter, the enthalpy in '''f''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the enthalpy in '''g''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''g'''&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by the liquid fraction in '''f''' (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) plus the enthalpy in '''h''' (''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''h'''&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by the gas fraction in '''f''' {{nowrap|(1 − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. So

:&lt;math&gt; h_\mathbf{f} = x_\mathbf{f} h_\mathbf{g} + (1 - x_\mathbf{f})h_\mathbf{h}.&lt;/math&gt;

With numbers: {{nowrap|1=100 = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt; × 28 + (1 − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;) × 230}}, so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''f'''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.64. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64%.

===Compressors===
{{main|Gas compressor}}
[[File:Schematic of compressor.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a compressor in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''ṁ''. A power ''P'' is applied and a heat flow ''Q̇'' is released to the surroundings at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

A power ''P'' is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is [[adiabatic]], the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in the ''T''–''s'' diagram. For example, compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point '''a''') to 2 bar (point '''b''') would result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, heat exchange, e.g. by cooling water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The average heat flow to the surroundings is ''Q̇''. Since the system is in the steady state the first law gives

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\dot Q + \dot m h_1 - \dot m h_2 + P.&lt;/math&gt;

The minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible. In that case the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for open systems gives

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\frac{\dot Q}{T_\mathrm{a}} + \dot m s_1 - \dot m s_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating ''Q̇'' gives for the minimal power

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = h_2 - h_1 - T_\mathrm{a}(s_2 - s_1).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, compressing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of nitrogen from 1&amp;nbsp;bar to 200&amp;nbsp;bar costs at least {{nowrap|1=(''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''h''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;) − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''s''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. With the data, obtained with the ''T''–''s'' diagram, we find a value of {{nowrap|1=(430 − 461) − 300 × (5.16 − 6.85) =}} 476&amp;nbsp;kJ/kg.

The relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2(dh - T_\mathrm{a}\,ds).&lt;/math&gt;

With {{nowrap|1=''dh'' = ''T''&amp;thinsp;''ds'' + ''v''&amp;thinsp;''dp''}}, this results in the final relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2 v\,dp.&lt;/math&gt;

{{Global surveillance}}

The '''FISA Improvements Act''' is a proposed act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.1631:|title=S.1631 -- FISA Improvements Act of 2013 (Placed on Calendar Senate - PCS)|publisher=Library of Congress (THOMAS)|date=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], Chair of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]].  Prompted by the disclosure of [[National Security Agency|NSA]] surveillance by [[Edward Snowden]], it would establish the surveillance program as legal, but impose some limitations on availability of the data.  Opponents say the bill would codify warrantless access to many communications of American citizens for use by domestic law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Spencer Ackerman in Washington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/feinstein-bill-nsa-warrantless-searches-surveillance |title=Feinstein promotes bill to strengthen NSA's hand on warrantless searches &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In the wake of the [[Edward Snowden|Snowden disclosures]], [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] and many lawmakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/obama-nsa-review-quest-public-trust-204947298--politics.html|title=For Obama, NSA review a quest for public trust|author=Julie Pace|date=2014-01-16|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/26/senate-change-nsa-program/2877899/|title=Lawmakers debate how to change NSA surveillance program|author=Kevin Johnson|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  believed that restoration of public trust would require legislative changes.  More than 20 bills have been written with the goal of reining in government surveillance powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/10/29/sensenbrenner_and_leahy_s_usa_freedom_act_seeks_to_curb_nsa_domestic_spying.html|title=U.S. Lawmakers Launch Assault on NSA Domestic Snooping|publisher=Slate|author=Ryan Gallagher|date=2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein, long described as a staunch defender of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), announced that a "total review of all intelligence programs is necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131028/15370525042/feinstein-never-upset-about-spying-american-public-is-furious-about-nsa-spying-foreign-leaders.shtml |title=Five Reactions To Dianne Feinstein Finally Finding Something About The NSA To Get Angry About |publisher=Techdirt |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=61f9511e-5d1a-4bb8-92ff-a7eaa5becac0 |title=Feinstein Statement on Intelligence Collection of Foreign Leaders - Press Releases - News Room - United States Senator Dianne Feinstein |publisher=Feinstein.senate.gov |date=2012-12-05 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130816/02462124204/ |title=How Could Dianne Feinstein Not Have Seen The Report Laying Out NSA Abuses? |publisher=Techdirt |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill was introduced by Feinstein on October 31, 2013.  Amendments were offered and rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131115/17113325262/senate-intelligence-committee-rejects-bunch-attempts-to-amend-dianne-feinsteins-fake-nsa-reform-bill.shtml |title=Senate Intelligence Committee Rejects A Bunch Of Attempts To Amend Dianne Feinstein's Fake NSA Reform Bill |publisher=Techdirt |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same day it was introduced, the bill passed the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] by a vote of 11-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3aa4ed70-e80b-4c2b-afd6-dc2e5bc75a7b |title=Senate Intelligence Committee Approves FISA Improvements Act - Press Releases - News Room - United States Senator Dianne Feinstein |publisher=Feinstein.senate.gov |date=2012-12-05 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The committee's report on the bill was published on November 12.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;sid=cp11305RrJ&amp;r_n=sr119.113&amp;dbname=cp113&amp;sel=DOC&amp; |title=Committee Reports - 113th Congress (2013-2014) - Senate Report 113-119 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinstein issued a press release saying that the bill would impose restrictions on how data is collected, including prohibiting bulk collection of the content of communications, and place a limit of five years on retention of the data.  It would make unauthorized access to data obtained under the FISA orders punishable by ten years in prison.  The bill would make the [[FISA court]] require "reasonable articulable suspicion" of association with international terrorism before records are reviewed.  It also would set limits on the number of people with access to the data, and set limits on the number of "hops" (contact intermediaries) that can be searched.  It would require the NSA to make an annual report of the number of queries made and the number of FBI investigations or probable cause orders issued.  The bill would also require intelligence agencies to report violations of law to Congress, require a review once per by the Attorney General of collection procedures, and permit the FISA court to invite independent [[amicus curiae]] perspectives on cases.  It would  require [[Senate confirmation]] of appointments of the [[Director of the National Security Agency|NSA director]] and [[NSA Inspector General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3aa4ed70-e80b-4c2b-afd6-dc2e5bc75a7b|title=Senate Intelligence Committee Approves FISA Improvements Act|date=2013-10-31|author=Dianne Feinstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MSNBC]] reported that the bill "purports to ban the NSA's controversial bulk collection of communications records under Section 215 of the [[Patriot Act]]" but "basically allows the NSA to continue bulk collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Serwer |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/fisa-215-feinstein-nsa |title=Feinstein gives the NSA what it wants |publisher=MSNBC |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koebler |first=Jason |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-nsas-biggest-supporter-is-worried-about-drone-privacy-issues |title=The NSA's Biggest Supporter Is Worried About Drone Privacy Issues &amp;#124; Motherboard |publisher=Motherboard.vice.com |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feinstein defended data collection in her press release, saying that "The threats we face—from terrorism, proliferation and cyber attack, among others—are real, and they will continue. Intelligence is necessary to protect our national and economic security, as well as to stop attacks against our friends and allies around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/11/senate-intelligence-approves-new-surveillance-rules/71162/|title=Senate Intelligence Approves New Surveillance Rules|date=2013-11-01|publisher=The Wire|author=Brian Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

===Senate Intelligence Committee===
The Senate Intelligence Committee report recommended the bill, saying that the program was "an effective counterterrorism tool" and "was determined by the Department of Justice in two Administrations and by at least fifteen different judges serving on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to be lawful."  While noting that the committee had encountered inadvertent violations of the law, the majority reported "It remains the case that, through seven years of oversight of this metadata program under Section  215, the Committee has not identified a single case in which a government official engaged in a willful effort to circumvent  or violate Section 215 in the conduct of the bulk telephone metadata program."  The committee endorsed measures to codify and enhance privacy protections, saying these measures "could not have been enacted absent the declassification of lawful intelligence activities that were, until recently, properly classified, as to do so would have revealed the programs to our adversaries and thereby compromised their effectiveness."  However, it condemned the disclosures and said that the leaks "have not exposed government wrongdoing."&lt;ref name=committee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.congress.gov/congressional-report/113th-congress/senate-report/119/1|title=S. Rept. 113-119 - FISA Improvements Act of 2013|date=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a minority view attached to the report, Senators [[Ron Wyden]], [[Mark Udall]], and [[Martin Heinrich]] wrote "this bill would codify the government's authority to collect the phone records of huge numbers of law-abiding Americans, and also to conduct warrantless searches for individual Americans' phone calls and emails. We respectfully but firmly disagree with this approach."

According to ''The Guardian'', Section 6 of the Act "blesses" such a procedure, permitting intelligence agencies to search "the contents of communications" collected overseas for U.S. persons provided that the purpose pertained to "foreign intelligence information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/feinstein-bill-nsa-warrantless-searches-surveillance|title=Feinstein promotes bill to strengthen NSA's hand on warrantless searches|publisher=The Guardian|author=Spencer Ackerman|date=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The provision was also criticized by Senator [[Ron Wyden]], who said that the bill "would give intelligence agencies wide latitude to conduct warrantless searches for American phone calls and emails", instead supporting the [[USA Freedom Act]] by Senators [[Patrick Leahy]] and [[F.

'''Flood geology''' (also '''creation geology''' or '''diluvial geology''') is the attempt to interpret and reconcile [[geology|geological features]] of the Earth in accordance with a literal belief in the [[Genesis flood narrative|global flood]] described in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[s:Bible (Wikisource)/Genesis#Chapter 6|6–8]]. In the early 19th century, [[Diluvium|diluvial]] geologists hypothesized that specific surface features were evidence of a worldwide flood which had followed earlier [[Era (geology)|geological eras]]; after further investigation they agreed that these features resulted from local floods or [[glacier]]s. In the 20th century, [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationists]] revived flood geology as an overarching concept in their opposition to [[evolution]], assuming a recent six-day Creation and cataclysmic geological changes during the Biblical Deluge, and incorporating creationist explanations of the [[Stratigraphy|sequence of rock strata]].

In the early stages of [[History of geology|development of the science of geology]], fossils were interpreted as evidence of past flooding. The "theories of the Earth" of the 17th century proposed mechanisms based on natural laws, within a timescale set by the [[Ussher chronology|biblical chronology]]. As modern [[geology]] developed, geologists found evidence of [[Geologic time scale|an ancient Earth]], and evidence inconsistent with the notion that the Earth had developed in a series of cataclysms, the most recent of which could be attributed to the Genesis flood. In early 19th-century Britain, "Diluvialism" attributed [[landform]]s and surface features such as beds of gravel and [[Glacial erratic|erratic boulders]] to the destructive effects of this supposed global Deluge, but by 1830 geologists increasingly found that the evidence only showed relatively local floods. Attempts were made by so-called [[scriptural geologist]]s to give primacy to literal Biblical explanations, but they lacked background in geology and were marginalised by the scientific community, as well as having little influence on the church.

Flood geology was revived as a field of study within [[creation science]], which is a part of [[young Earth creationism]].{{sfn|Parkinson|2004|pp=24–27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2009}} They were first known as flood geologists. Then, in about 1970, they renamed themselves "scientific creationists" or "young-earth creationists".&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=10}}
Proponents hold to a literal reading of [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Genesis#6|Genesis 6–9]] and view its passages to be [[Historicity (Bible Studies)|historically accurate]], using the Bible's internal chronology to place the Flood and the story of [[Noah's Ark]] within the last five thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;Carol A.

==The great flood in the history of geology==
[[File:Noahs Ark.jpg|thumb|Animals boarding Noah's ark (Edward Hicks) 1846 painting]] 
{{main|History of geology}}

In pre-Christian times, [[fossil]]s found on land were thought by Greek philosophers, including [[Xenophanes]], [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] and [[Aristotle]], to be evidence that the sea had in past ages covered the land. Their concept of vast time periods in an eternal cosmos was rejected by early Christian writers as incompatible with their belief in Creation by God. Among the church fathers, [[Tertullian]] spoke of fossils demonstrating that mountains had been overrun by water without explicitly saying when. [[Chrysostom]] and [[Augustine]] believed that fossils were the remains of animals that were killed and buried during the brief duration of the Biblical [[Genesis flood narrative|Genesis Flood]], and later [[Martin Luther]] viewed fossils as having resulted from the Flood.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=28–30, 63}}{{sfn|Berry|2003|p=5}}

Other scholars, including [[Avicenna]], thought fossils were produced in the rock by "petrifying virtue" acting on "seeds" of plants and animals. In 1580 [[Bernard Palissy]] speculated that fossils had formed in lakes, and [[natural history|natural historians]] subsequently disputed the alternatives. [[Robert Hooke]] made empirical investigations, and doubted that the numbers of fossil shells or depth of shell beds could have formed in the one year of Noah's Flood. In 1616 [[Nicolas Steno]] showed how chemical processes changed organic remains into stone fossils. His fundamental principles of [[stratigraphy]] published in 1669 established that rock strata formed horizontally and were later broken and tilted, though he assumed these processes would occur within 6,000 years including a worldwide Flood.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=48–56}}

===Theories of the Earth===
In his influential ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' of 1644, [[René Descartes]] applied his mechanical [[physical law]]s to envisage swirling particles forming the Earth as a layered sphere. This [[natural philosophy]] was recast in Biblical terms by the theologian [[Thomas Burnet]], whose ''Sacred Theory of the Earth'' published in the 1680s proposed complex explanations based on natural laws, and explicitly rejected the simpler approach of invoking [[miracle]]s as incompatible with the methodology of [[natural philosophy]] (the precursor to science). Burnet maintained that less than 6,000 years ago the Earth had emerged from chaos as a perfect sphere, with paradise on land over a watery abyss. This crust had dried out and cracked, and its collapse caused the Biblical Deluge, forming mountains as well as underground caverns where the water retreated. He made no mention of fossils, but inspired other diluvial theories that did.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=62–65}}{{sfn|Gould|1982}}

In 1695, [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]]'s ''An Essay Toward a Natural History of the Earth'' viewed the Genesis Flood as dissolving rocks and earth into a thick slurry which caught up all living things, and when the waters settled formed strata according to the [[specific gravity]] of these materials, including fossils of the organisms. When it was pointed out that lower layers were often less dense and forces that shattered rock would destroy organic remains, he resorted to the explanation that a divine miracle had temporarily suspended gravity. [[William Whiston]]'s ''New Theory of the Earth'' of 1696 combined scripture with [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] to propose that the original chaos was the atmosphere of a [[comet]] with the days of Creation each taking a year, and the Genesis Flood had resulted from a second comet. His explanation of how the Flood caused mountains and the fossil sequence was similar to Woodward's. [[Johann Jakob Scheuchzer]] wrote in support of Woodward's ideas in 1708, describing some fossil vertebrae as bones of sinners who had perished in the Flood. A skeleton found in a quarry was described by him in 1726 as ''[[Andrias scheuchzeri|Homo diluvii testis]]'', a giant human testifying to the Flood. This was accepted for some time, but in 1812 it was shown to be a prehistoric salamander.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=65–68}}

===Beginnings of modern geology===
The modern science of [[geology]] developed in the 18th century, the term "geology" itself was popularised by the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of 1751.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Steno's categorisation of strata was expanded by several geologists, including [[Johann Gottlob Lehmann (scientist)|Johann Gottlob Lehmann]] who believed that the oldest mountains had formed early in the Creation, and categorised as ''Flötz-Gebürge'' stratified mountains with few ore deposits but with thin layers containing fossils, overlain by a third category of superficial deposits. In his 1756 publication he identified 30 different layers in this category which he attributed to the action of the Genesis Deluge, possibly including debris from the older mountains. Others including [[Giovanni Arduino (geologist)|Giovanni Arduino]] attributed secondary strata to natural causes: [[Georg Christian Füchsel]] said that geologists had to take as standard the processes in which nature currently produces solids, "we know no other way", and only the most recent deposits could be attributed to a great Flood.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=71–74}}

Lehman's classification was developed by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] who thought that rock strata had been deposited from a primeval global ocean rather than by Noah's Flood, a doctrine called [[Neptunism]]. The idea of a young Earth was further undermined in 1774 by [[Nicolas Desmarest]], whose studies of a succession of extinct volcanoes in Europe showed layers which would have taken long ages to build up. The fact that these layers were still intact indicated that any later Flood had been local rather than universal. Against Neptunism, [[James Hutton]] proposed an indefinitely old cycle of eroded rocks being deposited in the sea, consolidated and heaved up by volcanic forces into mountains which in turn eroded, all in natural processes which continue to operate.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|pp=74–89}}

===Catastrophism and diluvialism===
The first professional geological society, the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]] of London, was founded in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/gsl/society/bicentenary|title=The Geological  Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, geologists were convinced that an immense time had been needed to build up the huge thickness of rock [[stratum|strata]] visible in quarries and cliffs, implying extensive pre-human periods. Most accepted a basic [[Geologic time scale#History and nomenclature of the time scale|time scale]] classifying rocks as primitive, transition, [[Mesozoic|secondary]], or [[Tertiary era|tertiary]]. Several researchers independently found that strata could be identified by characteristic [[fossil]]s: secondary strata in southern England were mapped by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] from 1799 to 1815.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

====Cuvier and Jameson====
[[Georges Cuvier]], working with [[Alexandre Brongniart]], examined tertiary strata in the region around Paris. Cuvier found that fossils identified rock formations as alternating between marine and  terrestrial deposits, indicating "repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea" which he identified with a long series of sudden catastrophes which had caused [[extinction]]s.{{sfn|Young|1995}} In his 1812 ''Discours préliminaire'' to his ''Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupeds'' put forward a synthesis of this research into the long prehistoric period, and a historical approach to the most recent catastrophe. His historical approach tested empirical claims in the Biblical text of Genesis against other ancient writings to pick out the "real facts" from "interested fictions". In his assessment, [[Moses]] had written the account around 3,300 years ago, long after the events described. Cuvier only discussed the Genesis Flood in general terms, as the most recent example of "an event of an universal catastrophe, occasioned by an irruption of the waters" not set "much further back than five or six thousand years ago". The historical texts could be loosely related to evidence such as overturned strata and "heaps of ''debris'' and rounded pebbles". An English translation was published in 1813 with a preface and notes by [[Robert Jameson]], [[Regius Professor]] of [[Natural history|Natural History]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He began the preface with a sentence which ignored Cuvier's historical approach and instead deferred to [[revelation]]:{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=181–183}} 
{{quote|"Although the Mosaic account of the creation of the world is an inspired writing, and consequently rests on evidence wholly independent of human observation and experience, still it is interesting, and in many respects important, to know that it coincides with the various phenomena observable in the mineral kingdom."{{sfn|Herbert|2005|p=183}}{{sfn|Haldane|1816|pp=168–169}}}}
This sentence was removed after the second edition, and Jameson's position changed as shown by his notes in successive editions, but it influenced British views of Cuvier's concept.{{sfn|Herbert|2005|p=183}} In 1819 [[George Bellas Greenough]], first president of [[Geological Society of London|The Geological Society]], issued ''A Critical Examination of the First Principles of Geology'' stating that unless [[Glacial erratic|erratic boulders]] deposited hundreds of miles from their original sources had been moved by seas, rivers, or collapsing lakes, "the only remaining cause, to which these effects can be ascribed, is a Debacle or Deluge."{{sfn|Young|1995}}

====Buckland and the English school of geologists====
Conservative geologists in Britain welcomed Cuvier's theory to replace [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Werner]]'s [[Neptunism]], and the [[Church of England]] clergyman [[William Buckland]] became the foremost proponent of Flood geology as he sought to get the new science of geology accepted on the curriculum of the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1818 he was visited by Cuvier, and in his inaugural speech in 1819 as the first professor of geology at the university he defended the subject against allegations that it undermined religion.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=116}} His speech, published as ''Vindiciae Geologicae; or, The Connexion of Geology with Religion Explained'', equated the last of a long series of catastrophes with the Genesis Flood, and said that "the grand fact of an universal deluge at no very remote period is proved on grounds so decisive and incontrovertible, that, had we never heard of such an event from Scripture, or any other, authority, Geology of itself must have called in the assistance of some such catastrophe, to explain the phenomena of diluvian action which are universally presented to us, and which are unintelligible without recourse to a deluge exerting its ravages at a period not more ancient than that announced in the Book of Genesis." The evidence he proposed included erratic boulders, extensive areas of [[gravel]], and [[landforms]] which appeared to have been scoured by water.{{sfn|Young|1995}}{{sfn|Buckland|1820|pp=23–24}}

This inaugural address influenced the geologists [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] and [[William Phillips (geologist)|William Phillips]]. In their 1822 book on ''Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales'' Conybeare referred to the same features in an introduction about the relationship between geology and religion, describing how a deluge causing "the last great geological change to which the surface of our planet appears to have been exposed" left behind the debris (which he named in [[Latin]] ''[[Diluvium]]'') as evidence for "that great and universal catastrophe to which it seems most properly assignable". In 1823 Buckland published his detailed account of "Relics of the Flood", ''Reliquiae Diluvianae;'' or, ''Observations on the Organic Remains Contained in Caves, Fissures, and Diluvial Gravel and on Other Geological Phenomena Attesting the Action of an Universal Deluge'', incorporating his research suggesting that animal fossils had been dragged into the [[Kirkdale Cave]] by [[hyena]]s then covered by a layer of red mud washed in by the Deluge.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

Buckland's views were supported by other Church of England clergymen naturalists: his Oxford colleague [[Charles Daubeny]] proposed in 1820 that the volcanoes of the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] showed a sequence of lava flows from before and after the Flood had cut valleys through the region.{{sfn|Young|1995}} In an 1823 article "On the deluge", [[John Stevens Henslow]], professor of mineralogy at the [[University of Cambridge]], affirmed the concept and proposed that the Flood had originated from a comet, but this was his only comment on the topic. [[Adam Sedgwick]], [[Woodwardian Professor of Geology]] at Cambridge,  presented two supportive papers in 1825, "On the origin of alluvial and diluvial deposits", and "On diluvial formations". At this time, most of what Sedgwick called "The English school of geologists" distinguished superficial deposits which were "diluvial", showing "great irregular masses of sand, loam, and coarse gravel, containing through its mass rounded blocks sometimes of enormous magnitude" and supposedly caused by "some great irregular inundation", from "alluvial" deposits of "comminuted gravel, silt, loam, and other materials" attributed to lesser events, the "propelling force" of rivers, or "successive partial inundations".{{sfn|Henslow|1823|p=344–348}}{{sfn|Herbert|1991|pp=171–172}}

In America, [[Benjamin Silliman]] at [[Yale University|Yale College]] spread the concept, and in an 1833 essay dismissed the earlier idea that most stratified rocks had been formed in the Flood, while arguing that surface features showed "wreck and ruin" attributable to "mighty floods and rushing torrents of water". He said that "we must charge to moving waters the undulating appearance of stratified sand and gravel, often observed in many places, and very conspicuously in the plain of New Haven, and in other regions of Connecticut and New England", while both "bowlder stones" and sandy deserts across the world could be attributed to "diluvial agency".{{sfn|Young|1995}}

====Criticisms and retractions: the downfall of Diluvialism====
Other naturalists were critical of Diluvialism: the [[Church of Scotland]] pastor [[John Fleming (naturalist)|John Fleming]] published opposing arguments in a series of articles from 1823 onwards. He was critical of the assumption that fossils resembling modern tropical species had been swept north "by some violent means", which he regarded as absurd considering the "unbroken state" of fossil remains. For example, fossil [[mammoth]]s demonstrated adaptation to the same northern climates now prevalent where they were found. He criticized Buckland's identification of red mud in the Kirkdale cave as diluvial, when near identical mud in other caves had been described as fluvial.{{sfn|Young|1995}} While Cuvier had reconciled geology with a loose reading of the Biblical text, Fleming argued that such a union was "indiscreet" and turned to a more literal view of Genesis:{{sfn|Herbert|2005|p=186}}
{{quote|But if the supposed impetuous torrent excavated valleys, and transported masses of rocks to a distance from their original repositories, then must the soil have been swept from off the earth to the destruction of the vegetable tribes. Moses does not record such an occurrence. On the contrary, in his history of the dove and the olive-leaf plucked off, he furnishes a proof that the flood was not so violent in its motions as to disturb the soil, nor to overturn the trees which it supported.{{sfn|Herbert|2005|p=186}}}}

When Sedgwick visited Paris at the end of 1826 he found hostility to Diluvialism: [[Alexander von Humboldt]] ridiculed it "beyond measure", and [[Constant Prévost|Louis-Constant Prévost]] "lectured against it". In the summer of 1827 Sedgwick and [[Roderick Murchison]] travelled to investigate the geology of the [[Scottish Highlands]], where they found "so many indications of ''local diluvial'' operations" that Sedgwick began to change his mind about it being worldwide. When [[George Poulett Scrope]] published his investigations into the Auvergne in 1827, he did not use the term "diluvium". He was followed by Murchison and [[Charles Lyell]] whose account appeared in 1829. All three agreed that the valleys could well have been formed by rivers acting over a long time, and a deluge was not needed. Lyell, formerly a pupil of Buckland, put strong arguments against diluvialism in the first volume of his ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' published in 1830, though suggesting the possibility of a deluge affecting a region such as the low-lying area around the [[Caspian Sea]]. Sedgwick responded to this book in his presidential address to the Geological Society in February 1830, agreeing that diluvial deposits had formed at differing times. At the society a year later, when retiring from the presidency, Sedgwick described his former belief that "vast masses of diluvial gravel" had been scattered worldwide in "one violent and transitory period" as "a most unwarranted conclusion", and therefore thought "it right, as one of my last acts before I quit this Chair, thus publicly to read my recantation." However, he remained convinced that a flood as described in Genesis was not excluded by geology.{{sfn|Young|1995}}{{sfn|Herbert|1991|pp=171–174}}{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=186–188}}

One student had seen the gradual abandonment of diluvialism: [[Charles Darwin]] had attended Jameson's geology lectures in 1826, and at Cambridge became a close friend of Henslow before learning geology from Sedgwick in 1831.  At the outset of the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' voyage]] Darwin was given a copy of Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'', and at the first landfall began his career as a geologist with investigations which supported Lyell's concept of slow uplift while also describing loose rocks and gravel as "part of the long disputed Diluvium". Debates continued over the part played by repeated exceptional catastrophes in geology, and in 1832 [[William Whewell]] dubbed this view [[catastrophism]], while naming Lyell's insistence on explanations based on current processes [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=70, 152–156, 185}}

Buckland, too, gradually modified his views on the Deluge. In 1832 a student noted Buckland's view on cause of diluvial gravel, "whether is Mosaic inundation or not, will not say". In a footnote to his ''[[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' of 1836, Buckland backed down from his former claim that the "violent inundation" identified in his ''Reliquiae Diluvianae'' was the Genesis flood:{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=185, 408}}  
{{quote|it seems more probable, that the event in question, was the last of the many geological revolutions that have been produced by violent irruptions of water, rather than the comparatively tranquil inundation described in the Inspired Narrative. It has been justly argued, against the attempt to identity these two great historical and natural phenomena, that, as the rise and fall of the waters of the Mosaic deluge are described to have been gradual and of short duration, they would have produced comparatively little change on the surface of the country they overflowed.{{sfn|Buckland|1836|pp=94–95}}}}

For a while, Buckland had continued to insist that ''some'' geological layers were related to the Great Flood, but grew to accept the idea that they represented multiple inundations which occurred well before humans existed. In 1840 he made a field trip to Scotland with the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] geologist [[Louis Agassiz]], and became convinced that the "diluvial" features which he had attributed to the Deluge had, in fact, been produced by ancient [[ice age]]s. Buckland became one of the foremost champions of Agassiz's theory of glaciations, and diluvialism went out of use in geology. Active geologists no longer posited sudden ancient catastrophes with unknown causes, and instead increasingly explained phenomena by observable processes causing slow changes over great periods.{{sfn|Imbrie|Imbrie|1986|p=40}}{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|p=99}}

===Scriptural geologists, and later commentary ===
[[Scriptural geologist]]s were a heterogeneous group of writers in the early nineteenth century, who claimed "the primacy of [[Biblical literalism|literalistic]] biblical [[exegesis]]" and a short [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth]] time-scale. Their views were marginalised and ignored by the [[scientific community]] of their time.{{sfn|Rudwick|1988|pp=42–44}}{{sfn|Rudwick|2008|p=84, "But since [[William Henry Fitton]] and other geologists regarded [scriptural geology] as scientifically worthless…"}}{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=168}} They generally lacked any background in geology, and had little influence even in church circles.{{sfn|Piccardi|2007|p=46}}{{sfn|Livingstone|Hart|Noll|1999|pp=186–187}}

Many quoted out of date geological writings. Among the most prominent, [[Granville Penn]] argued in 1822 that "mineral geology" rejected revelation, while true "Mosaical geology" showed that God had created primitive rock formations directly, in correspondence with the laws which God then made to produce subsequent effects. A first revolution on the third day of creation deepened the oceans so water rushed in, and in the Deluge 1,656 years afterwards a second revolution sank land areas and raised the sea bed to cause a swirling flood which moved soil and fossil remains into stratified layers, after which God created new vegetation. As Genesis appeared to show that the rivers of Eden had survived this catastrophe, he argued that the verses concerned were an added "parenthesis" which should be disregarded. In 1837 [[George Fairholme]] expressed disappointment about disappearing belief in the deluge, and about Sedgwick and Buckland recanting diluvialism, while putting forward his own ''New and Conclusive Physical Demonstrations'' which ignored geological findings to claim that strata had been deposited in a quick continuous process while still moist.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

Geology was popularized by several authors. [[John Pye Smith]]'s lectures published in 1840 reconciled an extended time frame with Genesis by the increasingly common [[Gap creationism|gap theology]] or [[Day-age creationism|day-age theology]], and said it was likely that the gravel and boulder formations were not "diluvium", but had taken long ages predating the creation of humans. He reaffirmed that the Flood was historical as a local event, something which the 17th century theologians [[Edward Stillingfleet]] and [[Matthew Poole]] had already suggested on a purely Biblical basis. Smith also denounced the "fanciful" writings of the scriptural geologists. [[Edward Hitchcock]] sought to ensure that geological findings could be corroborated by scripture, and dismissed the scriptural geology of Penn and Fairholme as misrepresenting both scripture and the facts of geology. He noted the difficulty of equating a violent deluge with the more tranquil Genesis account. [[Hugh Miller]] supported similar points with considerable detail.{{sfn|Young|1995}}

Little attention was paid to Flood geology over the rest of the 19th century, its few supporters included the author [[Eleazar Lord]] in the 1850s and the Lutheran scholar [[Carl Friedrich Keil]] in 1860 and 1878. The visions of [[Ellen G. White]] published in 1864 formed [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] views, and influenced 20th century creationism.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|p=119}}

==Creationist flood geology==
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], led by [[Ellen G. White]], took a six-day creation literally, and put her prolific [[Inspiration of Ellen G. White|"inspired" writings]] on a level with the Bible. Her visions of the flood and its aftermath, published in 1864, described a catastrophic deluge which reshaped the entire surface of the Earth, followed by a powerful wind which piled up new high mountains, burying the bodies of men and beasts. Buried forests became coal and oil, and where God later caused these to burn, they reacted with limestone and water to cause "earthquakes, volcanoes and fiery issues".{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=73–74}}{{sfn|White|1864|pp=[http://www.gilead.net/egw/books/spiritual-gifts/Spiritual_Gifts._Volume_3/index.htm?http&amp;url=www.gilead.net/egw/books/spiritual-gifts/Spiritual_Gifts._Volume_3/11_After_the_Flood.htm 64–89]}}

===George McCready Price===
[[Ellen G. White]]'s visions prompted several books by one of her followers, [[George McCready Price]], leading to the 20th-century revival of flood geology.{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|p=119}} After years selling White's books door-to-door, Price took a one-year teacher-training course and taught in several schools. When shown books on evolution and the [[Biostratigraphy|fossil sequence]] which contradicted his beliefs, he found the answer in White's "revealing word pictures" which suggested how the fossils had been buried. He studied textbooks on geology and "almost tons of geological documents", finding "how the actual facts of the rocks and fossils, ''stripped of mere theories'', splendidly refute this evolutionary theory of the invariable order of the fossils, ''which is the very backbone of the evolution doctrine''". In 1902 he produced a manuscript for a book proposing geology based on Genesis, in which the sequence of fossils resulted from the different responses of animals to the encroaching flood. He agreed with White on the origins of coal and oil, and conjectured that mountain ranges (including the [[Alps]] and [[Himalaya]]) formed from layers deposited by the flood which had then been "folded and elevated to their present height by the great lateral pressure that accompanied its subsidence". He then found a report describing [[Unconformity#Paraconformity| paraconformities]] and a paper on [[thrust fault]]s. He concluded from these "providential discoveries" that it was impossible to prove the age or overall sequence of fossils, and included these points in his self-published paperback of 1906, ''Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory''. His arguments continued this focus on disproving the sequence of strata, and he ultimately sold more than 15,000 copies of his 1923 college textbook ''The New Geology''.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 73–78}}{{sfn|Price|1926}}

Price increasingly gained attention outside [[Adventism|Adventist]] groups, and in the [[creation–evolution controversy]] other leading [[Christian fundamentalism |Christian fundamentalists]] praised his opposition to evolution - though none of them followed his young Earth arguments, retaining their belief in the [[Gap creationism |gap]] or in the [[Day-age creationism |day-age interpretation of Genesis]]. Price corresponded with [[William Jennings Bryan]] and was invited to be a witness in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, but declined as he was teaching in England and opposed to teaching Genesis in public schools as "it would be an infringement on the cardinal American principle of [[Separation of church and state in the United States| separation of church and state]]". Price returned from England in 1929 to rising popularity among fundamentalists as a scientific author.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 97–100}} In the same year his former student [[Harold W. Clark]] self-published the short book ''Back to Creationism'', which recommended Price's flood geology as the new "science of creationism", introducing the label "[[creationism]]" as a replacement for "anti-evolution" of "Christian Fundamentals".&lt;ref name="Antievolutionists and Creationists"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.counterbalance.net/history/anticreat-body.html | title= History Topic: Antievolutionists and Creationists | first= Ron| last= Numbers | publisher= counterbalance | accessdate= 2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Price and [[Dudley Joseph Whitney]] (a rancher who had co-founded the Lindcove Community Bible Church, and now followed Price) founded the ''Religion and Science Association'' (RSA). They aimed to resolve disagreements among fundamentalists with "a harmonious solution" which would convert them all to flood geology. Most of the organising group were Adventists, others included conservative Lutherans with similarly literalist beliefs. [[Bryon C. Nelson]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)| Norwegian Lutheran Church of America]] had included Price's geological views in a 1927 book, and in 1931 published ''The Deluge Story in Stone: A History of the Flood Theory of Geology'', which described Price as the "one very outstanding advocate of the Flood" of the century. The first public RSA conference in March 1936 invited various fundamentalist views, but opened up differences between the organisers on the antiquity of creation and on life before [[Adam]]. The RSA went defunct in 1937, and a dispute continued between Price and Nelson, who now viewed Creation as occurring over 100,000 years previously.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=102–}}

In 1938 Price, with a group of Adventists in Los Angeles, founded what became the ''Deluge Geology Society'' (DGS), with membership restricted to those believing that the [[creation week]] comprised "six literal days, and that the Deluge should be studied as the cause of the major geological changes since creation". Not all DGS-adherents were Adventists; early members included the [[Independent Baptist]] [[Henry M. Morris]] and the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri Lutheran]] [[Walter E. Lammerts]]. The DGS undertook field-work: in June 1941 their first ''Bulletin'' hailed the news that the [[Paluxy River]] [[dinosaur]] trackways in Texas appeared to include human footprints. Though Nelson had advised Price in 1939 that this was "absurd" and that the difficulty of human footprints forming during the turmoil of the deluge would "knock the Flood theory all to pieces", in 1943 the DGS began raising funds for "actual excavation" by a Footprint Research Committee of members including the consulting geologist [[Clifford L. Burdick]]. Initially they tried to keep their research secret from "unfriendly scientists". Then in 1945, to encourage backing, they announced giant human footprints, allegedly defeating "at a single stroke" the theory of evolution. The revelation that locals had carved the footprints, and an unsuccessful field trip that year, failed to dampen their hopes. However, by then doctrinal arguments had riven the DGS. The most extreme dispute began in late 1938 after Harold W. Clark observed deep drilling in oil fields and had discussions with practical geologists which dispelled the belief that the fossil sequence was random, convincing him that the evidence of thrust faults was "almost incontrovertible". He wrote to Price, telling his teacher that the "rocks do lie in a much more definite sequence than we have ever allowed", and proposing that the fossil sequence was explained by ecological zones before the flood. Price reacted with fury, and despite Clark emphasising their shared belief in literal recent Creation, the dispute continued. In 1946 Clark set out his views in a book, ''The New Diluvialism'', which Price denounced as ''Theories of Satanic Origin''.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 102–135}}

In 1941 [[F. Alton Everest]] co-founded the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) as a less confrontational forum for [[Evangelicalism |evangelical]] scientists. Some deluge geologists, including Lammerts and Price, urged close cooperation with the DGS, but Everest began to see their views as presenting an "insurmountable problem" for the ASA. In 1948 he requested [[J. Laurence Kulp]], a geologist in fellowship with the [[Plymouth Brethren]], to explore the issue. At the convention that year, Kulp examined [[Hominidae |hominid]] antiquity demonstrated by [[radiocarbon dating]].{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 158–165}}{{sfn|Yang|1993}} At the 1949 convention a paper by Kulp was presented, giving a detailed critique of ''Deluge Geology'', which he said had "grown and infiltrated the greater portion of fundamental Christianity in America primarily due to the absence of trained Christian geologists". Kulp demonstrated that "major propositions of the theory are contraindicated by established physical and chemical laws". He focused on "four basic errors" commonly made by flood geologists:

* saying that geology was the same as evolution
* assuming "that life has been on the earth only for a few thousand years, [and] therefore the flood ''must'' account for geological strata"
* misunderstanding "the physical and chemical conditions under which rocks are formed"
* ignoring recent discoveries such as radiometric dating that undermined their assumptions

Kulp accused Price of ignorance and deception, and concluded that "this unscientific theory of flood geology has done and will do considerable harm to the strong propagation of the gospel among educated people". Price said nothing during the presentation and discussion. When invited to speak, he "said something very brief which missed what everyone was waiting for". Further publications made the ASA's opposition to flood geology clear.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp= 165–169}}{{sfn|Kulp|1950|pp= 1–15}}

===Morris and Whitcomb===
In 1942, [[Henry M. Morris]] was persuaded by Irwin A. Moon's ''Sermons from Science'' of the importance of harmonising science and the Bible, and was introduced to the concepts of a vapor canopy causing the Flood, and its geological effects. About a year later he found [[George McCready Price]]'s ''New Geology'' a "life-changing experience", and joined the  ''Deluge Geology Society''. His book ''That You Might Believe'' for college students included Price's flood geology, and was published in 1946.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=192–197}}

Morris had joined the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) in 1949, and in the summer of 1953 he made a presentation on ''The Biblical Evidence for a Recent Creation and Universal Deluge'' at their annual conference, held at the [[Grace Theological Seminary]]'s campus. He impressed a graduate student there, [[John C. Whitcomb, Jr.]] who was teaching Old Testament and Hebrew. To Whitcomb's distress, Morris was "politely denounced" by the ASA members at the presentation.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=187, 197}}

In 1955 the ASA held a joint meeting with the [[Evangelical Theological Society]] (ETS) at the same campus, and there was considerable discussion about ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture'' (1954) by theologian [[Bernard Ramm]]. This book dismissed flood geology as typifying the "ignoble tradition" of fundamentalism, and said that Price could not be taken seriously, as he lacked the necessary competence, training and integrity. Instead, Ramm proposed what he called [[progressive creationism]] in which the Genesis days were pictorial images revealing a process that had taken place over millions of years. Ramm's views were praised by ASA scientists, but the ETS theologians were unwilling to follow Ramm.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=184–189}}

This encouraged Whitcomb to make his doctoral dissertation a response to Ramm and a defence of Price's position. He systematically asked evangelical professors of apologetics, archaeology and the Old Testament about creation and the flood, and in October told Morris that Ramm's book had been sufficient incentive for him to devote his dissertation to the topic. In 1957 Whitcomb's 450 page dissertation, "The Genesis Flood", was completed, and he promptly began summarising it for a book. [[Moody Publishers]] responded positively and agreed with him that chapters on scientific aspects should be carefully checked or written by someone with a PhD in science, but Whitcomb's attempts to find someone with a doctorate in geology were unsuccessful. Morris gave helpful advice, expressing concern that sections were too closely based on Price and [[Immanuel Velikovsky|Velikovsky]] who were "both considered by scientists generally as crackpots". Morris produced an outline of his planned three chapters, and in December 1957 agreed to co-author the book.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=188–192}}

Morris completed his draft in early 1959. His intended 100 pages grew to almost 350, around twice the length of Whitcomb's eventual contribution. Whitcomb raised concerns that "For many people, our position would be somewhat discredited" by prominent references to "Price and Seventh-Day Adventism", and these were deleted. By early 1960 they were impatient at delays when [[Moody Publishers]] had misgivings about the length and literal views of the book, and they went along with [[Rousas Rushdoony]]'s recommendation of a small Philadelphia publishers.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=191–192, 197–199}}

====''The Genesis Flood''====
''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' by Whitcomb and Morris was published by the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company of Philadelphia in February 1961. Their premise was that the Bible is infallible, "the basic argument of this volume is that the Scriptures are true." For Whitcomb, Genesis described a worldwide Flood which covered all the high mountains, Noah's ark with capacity equivalent to eight freight trains, flood waters from a canopy and the deeps, and subsequent dispersal of animals from Ararat to all the continents via land bridges. He disputed the views published by [[Arthur Custance]] and [[Bernard Ramm]]. Morris then confronted readers with the dilemma of whether to believe Scripture or accept the interpretations of trained geologists, and instead of the latter proposed "a new scheme of historical geology" true both to Scripture and to God's work revealed in nature. This was essentially Price's ''The New Geology'' updated for the 1960s, though with few direct references to Price.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=200–201}}

Like Price before him, Morris argued that most fossil bearing [[stratum|strata]] had been formed during the global Deluge, disputing [[uniformitarianism]], multiple [[ice age]]s, and the [[Geologic record|geologic column]]. He explained the apparent [[Biostratigraphy|fossil sequence]] as the outcome of marine organisms dying in the slurry of sediments in early stages of the Flood, moving currents sorting object by size and shape, and the mobility of vertebrates allowing them to initially escape the floodwaters. He cited [[Walter E. Lammerts|Lammerts]] in support of Price's views about the [[thrust fault]] at [[Chief Mountain]] disproving the sequence. 
The book went beyond Price in some areas. Morris extended the six day creation from the Earth to the entire universe, and said that death and decay had only begun with the [[Fall of Man]], which had therefore introduced [[entropy]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. He proposed that a vapor canopy, before providing water for the Flood, created a mild even climate and shielded the Earth from [[cosmic rays]] so [[radiocarbon dating]] would not work. He cited [[Clifford L. Burdick]]'s testimony that some of the [[Paluxy River]] dinosaur trackways overlapped human footprints, but Burdick failed to confirm this and the section was removed from the third edition.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=202–204}}

===Creation Research Society===
In a 1957 discussion with Whitcomb, [[Walter E. Lammerts]] suggested an "informal association" to exchange ideas, and possibly research, on flood geology. Morris was unavailable to get things started, then around 1961 [[Wiliam J. Tinkle]] got in touch, and they set about recruiting others. They had difficulty in finding supporters with scientific qualifications. The Creation Research Committee of ten they put together on 9 February 1962 had varying views on the age of the Earth, but all opposed evolution. They then succeeded in recruiting others into what became the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) in June 1963, and grew rapidly. Getting an agreed statement of belief was problematic, they affirmed that the Bible was "historically and scientifically true in the original autographs" so that "the account of origins in Genesis is a factual presentation of simple historical truths" and "The great flood described in Genesis, commonly referred to as the Noachian Flood, was an historic event worldwide in its extent and effect", but to Morris's disappointment they did not make flood geology mandatory. They lacked a qualified geologist, and Morris persuaded the group to appoint [[Clifford L. Burdick]] as their only [[Earth science|Earth scientist]], overcoming initial concerns raised by Lammerts. The CRS grew rapidly, with an increasing proportion of the membership adhering to strict young Earth flood geology.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=214–215, 222–233}}

The resources of the CRS for its first decade went into publication of the CRS ''Quarterly'', and a project to publish a creationist school book. Since the 1920s most U.S. schools had not taught pupils about evolution, but [[Sputnik]] exposed apparent weaknesses of U.S. science education and the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] produced textbooks in 1963 which included the topic. When the [[Texas Education Agency]] held a hearing in October 1964 about adopting these textbooks, creationist objectors were unable to name suitable creationist alternatives. Lammerts organised a CRS textbook committee which lined up a group of authors, with John N. Moore as senior editor bringing their contributions together into a suitable textbook.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=238–240}}

=== Creation science ===
{{main|Creation science}}
The teaching of evolution, reintroduced in 1963 by the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] textbooks, was prohibited by laws in some states. These bans were contested; the ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' case which began late in 1965 was decided in 1968 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruling that such laws violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=238–239, 241}}

Some creationists thought a legal [[Abington School District v. Schempp|decision requiring religious neutrality in schools]] should shield their children from teachings hostile to their religion; Nell. J. Segraves and Jean E. Sumrall (a friend of Lammerts who was also associated with the [[Creation Research Society]] and the Bible-Science Association) petitioned the [[California State Board of Education]] to require that school biology texts designate evolution a theory. In 1966 [[Max Rafferty]] as [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction]] suggested that they demand equal time for creation, as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] allowed teachers to mention religion as long as they did not promote specific doctrines. Their first attempt failed, but in 1969 controversy arose over a proposed ''Science Framework for California Schools''. Anticipating success, they and others in the Bible-Science Association formed ''Creation Science, Inc.'', to produce textbooks. A compromise acceptable to Segraves, Sumrall and the Board was suggested by [[Vernon L. Grose]], and the revised 1970 ''Framework'' included "While the Bible and other philosophical treatises also mention creation, science has independently postulated the various theories of creation. Therefore, creation in scientific terms is not a religious or philosophical belief." The result kept school texts free of creationism, but downgraded evolution to mere speculative theory.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=243–244}}

Creationists reacted to the California developments with a new confidence that they could introduce their ideas into schools by minimizing biblical references. [[Henry M. Morris]] declared that "Creationism is on the way back, this time not primarily as a religious belief, but as an alternative scientific explanation of the world in which we live." In 1970 ''Creation Science, Inc.'', combined with a planned studies center at [[San Diego Christian College|Christian Heritage College]] as the Creation-Science Research Center. Morris moved to [[San Diego]] to become director of the center and academic vice-president of the college. In the fall he presented a course at the college on "Scientific Creationism", the first time he is known to have used the term in public. (Two years later, the Creation-Science Research Center split with part becoming the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) led by Morris.){{sfn|Numbers|1993|p=244}}

The Creation Research Society (CRS) had found schoolbook publishers reluctant to take on their textbook, and eventually the Christian publishing company [[Zondervan]] brought out ''Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity'' in 1970. The ten thousand copies printed sold out within a year, and they produced 25,000 as the second impression, but hardly any public schools adopted the book. A preface by Morris claimed that there were two philosophies of creation, "the doctrine of evolution and the doctrine of special creation", attempting to give both equal validity.{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=238–241}} The book mostly covered uncontroversial details of biology, but asserted that these were correctly seen as "God's creation" or "divine creation", and presented biblical creation as the correct scientific view. A chapter on "Weaknesses of Geologic Evidence" disputed evolutionary theories while asserting a "fact that most fossil material was laid down by the flood in Noah's time". Another chapter disputed evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="TOA Hendren"&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hendren/hendren_v_campbell.html ''Hendren v. Campbell'': Decision Against a Creationist Textbook], [[Nick Matzke]], [[TalkOrigins Archive]], 20 August 2006.  Accessed 27 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Creation Research Society Quarterly'' for September 1971 Morris introduced the "[[false dilemma|two-model approach]]" asserting that evolution and creation were both equally scientific and equally religious, and soon afterwards he said they were "competing scientific hypotheses". For the third printing of ''Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity'' in 1974, the editor John N. Moore added a preface setting out this approach as "the two basic viewpoints of origins", the "evolution model" and the "creation model". When an [[Indiana]] school decided to use the book as their biology text, the ''[[Hendren v. Campbell]]'' district court case banned its use in public schools as infringing the Establishment Clause. Judge Michael T. Dugan, II, described it as "a text obviously designed to present ''only'' the view of Biblical Creationism in a favorable light", contravening the constitution by promotion of a specific sectarian religious view.&lt;ref name="TOA Hendren" /&gt;{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=239–245}}

As a tactic to gain the same scientific status as evolution, flood geology proponents had effectively relabeled the Bible-based flood geology of [[George McCready Price]] as "creation science" or "scientific creationism" by the mid 1970s. At the CRS board meeting in the Spring of 1972, members were told to start using "scientific creationism", a phrase used interchangeably with "creation science"; Morris explained that preferences differed, though neither was ideal as "one simple term" could not "identify such a complex and comprehensive subject."  In the 1974 ICR handbook for high-school teachers titled ''Scientific Creationism'', Morris used the two-model approach to support his argument that creationism could "be taught without reference to the book of Genesis or to other religious literature or to religious doctrines", and in public schools only the "basic scientific creation model" should be taught, rather than biblical creationism which "would open the door to wide interpretations of Genesis" or to non-Christian [[Cosmogony|cosmogonies]]. He did not deny having been influenced by the Bible. In his preface to the book dated July 1974, Morris as editor outlined how the "Public School Edition" of the book evaluated evidence from a "strictly scientific point of view" without "reference to the Bible or other religious literature", while the "General Edition" was "essentially identical" except for an additional chapter on "Creation according to Scripture" that "places the scientific evidence in its proper biblical and theological context."{{sfn|Numbers|1993|pp=242–246}}{{sfn|Morris|1974|p=}}

The main ideas in creation science are: the belief in "creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''" (Latin: out of nothing); the conviction that the Earth was created within the last 6,000 years; the belief that mankind and other life on Earth were created as distinct fixed "baraminological" ''kinds''; and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]] which completely covered the entire Earth.&lt;ref name=ag&gt;{{cite court | litigants = Edwards v.

==Creationist arguments for a global flood ==

=== Fossils ===
The [[geologic timescale|geologic column]] and the [[fossil]] record are used as major pieces of evidence in the modern scientific explanation of the development and [[evolution]] of life on Earth as well as a means to establish the [[age of the Earth]]. [[Young Earth Creationists]] such as Morris and Whitcomb in their 1961 book, ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'', say that the age of the fossils depends on the amount of time credited to the geologic column, which they ascribe to be about one year. Some flood geologists dispute geology's assembled global geologic column since index fossils are used to link geographically isolated strata to other strata across the map.  Fossils are often dated by their proximity to strata containing index fossils whose age has been determined by its location on the geologic column. Oard{{sfn|Oard|Reed|2006|p=99}} and others say that the identification of fossils as index fossils has been too error-prone for index fossils to be used reliably to make those correlations, or to date local strata using the assembled geologic scale.

Other creationists accept the existence of the geological column and believe that it indicates a sequence of events that might have occurred during the global flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://answersingenesis.org/geology/geologic-time-scale/geologic-column/|title=Geologic Column|website=Answers in Genesis|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institute for Creation Research]] creationists such as Andrew Snelling, Steven A. Austin and [[Kurt Wise]] take this approach, as does Creation Ministries International. They cite the [[Cambrian explosion]] — the appearance of abundant fossils in the upper [[Ediacaran]] (Vendian) Period and lower [[Cambrian Period]]  — as the pre-Flood/Flood boundary,{{sfn|Hunter|2000|pp=60–74}} the presence in such sediments of fossils that do not occur later in the geological record as part of a pre–flood biota that perished{{sfn|Wise|1995|pp=216–222}} and the absence of fossilized organisms that appear later (such as [[angiosperm]]s and [[mammal]]s) as due to erosion of sediments deposited by the flood as waters receded off the land.{{sfn|Austin|Baumgardner|Humphreys|Snelling|1994}} Creationists say that [[Fossilization#Rarity of fossils|fossilization]] can only take place when the organism is buried quickly to protect the remains from destruction by scavengers or decomposition.{{sfn|Whitcomb|Morris|1961|pp=128–129}} They say that the fossil record provides evidence of a single cataclysmic flood and not of a series of slow changes accumulating over millions of years.{{sfn|Brown|2008|p=}}

Flood geologists have proposed numerous hypotheses to reconcile the sequence of fossils evident in the fossil column with the literal account of Noah's flood in the Bible. Whitcomb and Morris proposed three possible factors:

# hydrological, whereby the relative buoyancies of the remains (based on the organisms' shapes and densities) determined the sequence in which their remains settled to the bottom of the flood-waters
# ecological, suggesting organisms living at the ocean bottom succumbed first in the flood and those living at the highest altitudes last
# anatomical/behavioral, the ordered sequence in the fossil column resulting from the very different responses to the rising waters between different kinds of organisms due to their diverse mobilities and original habitats.{{sfn|Gould|1984|p=132}}  In a scenario put forth by Morris, the remains of marine life settled to the bottom first, followed by the slower-moving lowland reptiles, and culminating with humans, whose superior intelligence and ability to flee enabled them to reach higher elevations before the flood waters overcame them.{{sfn|Schadewald|1982|pp=12–17}}

Some creationists believe that [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[coal]] deposits formed rapidly in sedimentary layers as volcanoes or flood waters flattened forests and buried the debris.  They believe the vegetation decomposed rapidly into oil or coal due to the heat of the subterranean waters as they were unleashed from the Earth during the flood or by the high temperatures created as the remains were compressed by water and sediment.{{sfn|Snelling|2006}}

[[creationism|Creationists]] continue to search for evidence in the natural world that they consider consistent with the above description, such as evidence of rapid formation. For example, there have been claims of raindrop marks and water ripples at layer boundaries, sometimes associated with the claimed fossilized footprints of men and dinosaurs walking together. Such footprint evidence has been debunked{{sfn|Schadewald|1986|pp=1–9}} and some have been shown to be fakes.{{sfn|Kuban|1996}}

=== Widespread flood stories ===
:see [[List of flood myths]]
Proponents of Flood Geology state that "native global flood stories are documented as history or legend in almost every region on earth". "These flood tales are frequently linked by common elements that parallel the biblical account including the warning of the coming flood, the construction of a boat in advance, the storage of animals, the inclusion of family, and the release of birds to determine if the water level had subsided." They suggest that "the overwhelming consistency among flood legends found in distant parts of the globe indicates they were derived from the same origin, but oral transcription has changed the details through time".{{sfn|Northwest Creation Network}}

Anthropologist Patrick Nunn rejects this view and highlights the fact that much of the human population lives near water sources such as rivers and coasts, where unusually severe floods can be expected to occur occasionally and will be recorded in tribal mythology.{{sfn|Nunn|2001|pp125-138}}

== Proposed mechanisms of flood geology ==
[[George McCready Price]] attempted to fit a great deal of earth's geological history into a model based on a few accounts from the Bible. Price's simple model was used by Whitcomb and Morris initially but they did not build on the model in the 60s and 70s.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|p=1342}} However, a rough sketch of a creationist model could be constructed from creationist publications and debate material.{{sfn|Awbrey|1980|p=1}} Recent creationist efforts attempt to build complex models that incorporate as much scientific evidence as possible into the Biblical narrative. Some scientific evidence used for these models was formerly rejected by creationists. These models attempt to explain continental movements in a short time frame, the order of the fossil record, and the [[Pleistocene]] ice age.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|p=1341}}

=== Runaway subduction ===
In the 60s and 70s a simple creationist model proposed that, "The Flood split the land mass into the present continents."{{sfn|Awbrey|1980|p=1}} Steve Austin and other creationists proposed a preliminary model of catastrophic plate tectonics (CPT) in 1994.{{sfn|Austin|Baumgardner|Humphreys|Snelling|Vardiman|Wise|1994}} Their work built on earlier papers by [[John Baumgardner]] and [[Russell Humphreys]] in 1986.{{sfn|Baumgardner|1986}}{{sfn|Humphreys|1986}} Baumgardner proposed a model of mantle convection that allows for runaway subduction and Humphrey associated mantle convection with rapid magnetic reversals in earth history. Baumgardner's proposal holds that the rapid plunge of former oceanic plates into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] (caused by an unknown trigger-mechanism) increased local mantle pressures to the point that its viscosity dropped several magnitudes according to known properties of mantle silicates.  Once initiated, sinking plates caused the spread of low viscosity throughout the mantle resulting in runaway mantle-convection and catastrophic [[tectonic]] motion which dragged continents across the surface of the earth. Once the former ocean plates, which are thought to be denser than the mantle, reached the bottom of the mantle an equilibrium resulted.  Pressures dropped, viscosity increased, runaway mantle-convection stopped, leaving the surface of the earth rearranged.  Proponents point to subducted slabs in the mantle which are still relatively cool, which they regard as evidence that they have not been there for millions of years which would result in temperature equilibration.{{sfn|Baumgardner|2003}}

Given that conventional [[plate tectonics]] accounts for much of the geomorphic features of continents and oceans, it is natural that creationists would seek to develop a high speed version of the same process. CPT explains many geological features, provides mechanisms for the Biblical flood, and minimizes appeals to miracles.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|p=1348}}

Some prominent creationists (Froede, Oard, Read) oppose CPT for various technical reasons. One main objection is that the model assumes the super continent [[Pangaea]] was intact at the initiation of the year-long flood. The CPT process then tore Pangaea apart creating the current configuration of the continents. But the breakup of Pangaea started early in the [[Mesozoic]], meaning that CPT only accounts for part of the entire [[Phanerozoic]] geological record. CPT in this form only explains part of the geological column that flood geology normally explains. Modifying the CPT model to account for the entire Phanerozoic including multiple [[Wilson Cycle]]s would complicate the model considerably.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|pp=1348–1349}}

Other objections of CPT include the amount of heat produced for the rapid plate movements, and the fact that the cooling of hot oceanic plates and the raising of continental plates would take a great deal of time and require multiple small scale catastrophes after the flood ended. The original CPT proposal of Austin and others in 1994 was admittedly preliminary but the major issues have not been solved.{{sfn|Heaton|2008|pp=1349–1350}}

The vast majority of geologists regard the hypothesis of catastrophic plate tectonics as pseudoscience; they reject it in favor of the conventional geological theory of plate tectonics. It has been argued that the tremendous release of energy necessitated by such an event would boil off the Earth's oceans, making a global flood impossible.{{sfn|Wise|1998|pp=160–173}} Not only does catastrophic plate tectonics lack any plausible [[Geophysics|geophysical]] mechanism by which its changes might occur, it also is contradicted by considerable geological evidence (which is in turn consistent with conventional plate tectonics), including:{{sfn|Isaak|2007|p=173 [http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD750.html Creationist claim CD750]}}

* The fact that a number of volcanic [[island#Oceanic islands|oceanic island]] chains, such as the [[Hawaiian islands]], yield evidence of the ocean floor having moved over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hot-spots]]. These islands have widely ranging ages (determined via both [[radiometric dating]] and relative [[erosion]]) that contradict the catastrophic tectonic hypothesis of rapid development and thus a similar age.
* Radiometric dating and [[sedimentation]] rates on the [[ocean floor]] likewise contradict the hypothesis that it all came into existence nearly contemporaneously.
* Catastrophic tectonics does not allow sufficient time for [[guyot]]s to have their peak eroded away (leaving these [[seamount]]s' characteristic flat tops).
* Runaway subduction does not explain the kind of [[continental collision]] illustrated by that of the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] and [[Eurasian Plate]]s. (For further information see [[Orogeny]].)

Conventional plate tectonics accounts for the geological evidence already, including innumerable details that catastrophic plate tectonics cannot, such as why there is gold in California, silver in Nevada, salt flats in Utah, and coal in Pennsylvania, without requiring any extraordinary mechanisms to do so.{{sfn|Isaak|2007|p=173 [http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD750.html Creationist claim CD750]}}{{sfn|McPhee|1998}}

=== Vapor/water canopy ===
Isaac Vail (1840–1912), a [[Quaker]] schoolteacher, in his 1912 work ''The Earth's Annular System'', extrapolated from the [[nebular hypothesis]] what he called the annular system of earth history, with the earth being originally surrounded by rings resembling [[Saturn's rings|those of Saturn]], or "canopies" of [[water vapor]]. Vail hypothesised that, one by one, these canopies collapsed on the Earth, resulting in fossils being buried in a "succession of stupendous cataclysms, separated by unknown periods of time". The Genesis flood was thought to have been caused by "the last remnant" of this vapor. Although this final flood was geologically significant, it was not held to account for as much of the fossil record as [[George McCready Price]] had asserted.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|pp=347–348}} 

Vail's ideas about geology appeared in [[Charles Taze Russell]]'s ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'' and subsequently in [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]]'s ''Creation'' of 1927 and later publications.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|pp=347–348}}&lt;ref name="Penton1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. James Penton|title=Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38SYXalMLeQC|year=1997|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-7973-2|pages=196–197, 429–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] physicist Robert W. Woods also proposed a vapor canopy,{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=501. (footnote 47)}} before ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' gave it prominent and repeated mention in 1961.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=229}}

Though the vapor-canopy theory has fallen into disfavour among most creationists, Dillow in 1981 and Vardiman in 2003 attempted to defend the idea.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://answersingenesis.org/home/area/tools/flood-waters.asp Noah’s Flood – Where did the water come from?"] ''Answers in Genesis, 2014.'' Retrieved 4 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dillow|1981}}{{sfn|Vardiman|2003}} Among its more vocal adherents, controversial Young Earth Creationist [[Kent Hovind]] uses it as the basis for his eponymous [[Kent Hovind#The "Hovind Theory"|"Hovind Theory"]]. Jehovah's Witnesses propose as the water source of the deluge a "heavenly ocean" that was over the earth from the second creative day until the Flood.&lt;ref&gt;Insight into the Scriptures Volume 1 (1988) pg 609–612: http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200001150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern geology and flood geology ==
[[File:Hutton Unconformity , Jedburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|In the 18th century, finds such as [[Hutton's Unconformity]] showing layers tilted, eroded, and overlaid, demonstrated the "abyss of time" in the [[geologic time scale]].]]
Modern geology, its sub-disciplines and other scientific disciplines utilize the [[scientific method]] to analyze the geology of the earth. The key tenets of flood geology are refuted by scientific analysis and do not have any standing in the [[scientific community]].{{sfn|Young|1995}}{{sfn|Isaak|2006}}{{sfn|Morton|2001}}{{sfn|Isaak|2007|p=173}}{{sfn|Stewart|2010|p=123}} Modern [[geology]] relies on a number of established principles, one of the most important of which is [[Charles Lyell]]'s principle of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. In relation to geological forces it states that the shaping of the Earth has occurred by means of mostly slow-acting forces that can be seen in operation today. By applying these principles, geologists have determined that the Earth is approximately [[Age of the Earth|4.54 billion years old]]. They study the [[lithosphere]] of the Earth to gain information on the history of the planet. Geologists divide [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] into [[Eon (geology)|eons]], [[Era (geology)|eras]], [[Period (geology)|periods]], [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]], and [[faunal stages]] characterized by well-defined breaks in the [[fossil record]] (see [[Geologic time scale]]).{{sfn|Lutgens|Tarbuck|Tasa|2005}}{{sfn|Tarbuck|Lutgens|2006}}  In general, there is a lack of any evidence for any of the above effects proposed by flood geologists and their claims of fossil layering are not taken seriously by scientists.{{sfn|Isaak|1998}}

===Erosion===
[[File:Siccar point SE cliff.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Unconformity|angular unconformity]] found by [[James Hutton]] in 1788 at [[Siccar Point]] demonstrated the time taken for erosion of tilted rock and deposition of overlying layers.]]
The global flood cannot explain geological formations such as [[Unconformity|angular unconformities]], where [[sedimentary rock]]s have been tilted and eroded then more sedimentary layers deposited on top, needing long periods of time for these processes. There is also the time needed for the erosion of valleys in sedimentary rock mountains. In another example, the flood, had it occurred, should also have produced large-scale effects spread throughout the entire world. Erosion should be evenly distributed, yet the levels of erosion in, for example, the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]] differ significantly.{{sfn|Isaak|1998}}

===Geochronology===
[[File:CarmelHdgd.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Jurassic]] carbonate hardground shows generations of [[oysters]] and extensive [[bioerosion]], features incompatible with the conditions and timing postulated for the Flood.{{sfn|Morton|2001}}]]
[[File:CalciteAragonite.jpg|thumb|right|The alternation of calcite and aragonite seas through [[geologic time]].{{sfn|Sandberg|1983|pp=19–22}}]]
[[Geochronology]] is the science of determining the [[absolute dating|absolute]] age of rocks, fossils, and sediments by a variety of techniques. These methods indicate that the Earth as a whole is about 4.54 billion years old, and that the strata that, according to flood geology, were laid down during the Flood some 6,000 years ago, were actually deposited gradually over many millions of years.

===Paleontology===
If the flood were responsible for fossilization, then all the animals now fossilized must have been living together on the Earth just before the flood. Based on estimates of the number of remains buried in the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo fossil formation]] in [[Africa]], this would correspond to an abnormally high density of vertebrates worldwide, close to 2100 per acre.{{sfn|Schadewald|1982|pp=12–17}}
Creationists argue that evidence for the [[Geologic time scale|geological column]] is fragmentary, and all the complex layers of chalk occurred in the approach to the 150th day of Noah's flood.{{sfn|Wilson|2001}}{{sfn|Mathews|2009}} However, the entire geologic column is found in several places, and shows multiple features, including evidence of erosion and burrowing through older layers, which are inexplicable on a short timescale. Carbonate hardgrounds and the fossils associated with them show that the so-called flood sediments include evidence of long hiatuses in deposition that are not consistent with flood dynamics or timing.{{sfn|Morton|2001}}

===Geochemistry===
Proponents of Flood Geology are also unable to account for the alternation between [[calcite sea]]s and [[aragonite sea]]s through the Phanerozoic.  The cyclical pattern of [[carbonate hardgrounds]], calcitic and aragonitic ooids, and calcite-shelled fauna has apparently been controlled by [[seafloor spreading]] rates and the flushing of seawater through [[hydrothermal vent]]s which changes its Mg/Ca ratio.{{sfn|Stanley|Hardie|1999|pp1-7}}

===Sedimentary rock features ===
Phil Senter's 2011 article, "The Defeat of Flood Geology by Flood Geology", in the journal ''[[National Center for Science Education|Reports of the National Center for Science Education]]'', discusses "sedimentologic and other geologic features that Flood geologists have identified as evidence that particular strata cannot have been deposited during a time when the entire planet was under water ... and distribution of strata that predate the existence of the Ararat mountain chain." These include continental basalts, terrestrial tracks of animals, and marine communities preserving multiple in-situ generations included in the rocks of most or all Phanerozoic periods, and the basalt even in the younger Precambrian rocks. Others, occurring in rocks of several geologic periods, include lake deposits and eolian (wind) deposits. Using their own words, Flood geologists find evidence in every Paleozoic and Mesozoic period, and in every epoch of the Cenozoic period, indicating that a global flood could not have occurred during that interval.&lt;ref name="Defeat of Flood Geology by Flood Geology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/article/view/44/36 |title=The Defeat of Flood Geology by Flood Geology  |author=Phil Senter |authorlink= |date=2011 |format= |work= Vol 31, No 3 |publisher=  Reports of the National Center for Science Education|pages=   |quote= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8324">[[File:Tesla Powerwall Render.svg|thumb|A render of a type of home battery.]]
'''Home energy storage''' devices store [[electricity]] locally, for later consumption. At their heart are batteries, typically [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] or [[VRLA battery|lead-acid]], and intelligent [[software]]. An [[energy storage]] technology, they are downstream relatives of battery-based [[grid energy storage]] and support the concept of [[distributed generation]]. When paired with on-site generation, they can virtually eliminate blackouts in an [[off-the-grid]] lifestyle.

==Operating modes==
===On-site generation===
The stored energy commonly originates from on-site [[photovoltaic system|solar photovoltaic]] panels, generated during daylight hours, and the stored electricity consumed after sundown, when domestic energy [[peak demand|demand peaks]] in homes unoccupied during the day.

[[Electric vehicles]] (EVs) used during weekdays, needing recharging overnight, are a good fit with home energy storage in homes with solar panels and low daylight-hour electrical consumption. EV manufacturers [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[Mercedes-Benz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spector|first1=Julian|title=Mercedes-Benz Launches a US Energy Storage Company|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/mercedes-benz-launches-a-u.s.-energy-storage-company|website=Greentech Media|publisher=[[Wood Mackenzie]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BMW]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moloughney|first1=Tom|title=BMW Announces Home Energy Storage System Utilizing i3 Battery Packs|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2016/06/22/bmw-announces-home-energy-storage-system-using-i3-battery-packs/|website=cleantechnica|publisher=Sustainable Enterprises Media|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nissan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muoio|first1=Danielle|title=Nissan could rival Tesla with its new at-home battery|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/nissan-releases-xstorage-at-home-battery-2016-5?r=US&amp;IR=T|website=Business Insider|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE|Axel Springer]]|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BYD Company|BYD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYD unveils its B-BOX energy storage system in the uk|url=http://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/news/byd_unveils_its_b_box_energy_storage_system_in_the_uk|website=Solar Power Portal|publisher=Henley Media|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; market own-brand home energy storage devices to their customers, with Tesla's [[Tesla Powerwall|Powerwall]] enjoying significant media exposure.

===Differential tariffs and smart meters===
The units can also be programmed to exploit a [[differential tariff]], that provide lower priced energy during hours of low demand - seven hours from 12:30am in the case of Britain’s [[Economy 7]] tariff - for consumption when prices are higher.

Smart tariffs, stemming from the increasing prevalence of [[smart meters]], will increasingly be paired with home energy storage devices to exploit low off-peak prices, and avoid higher-priced energy at times of peak demand.

==Advantages==
===Overcoming grid losses===
Transmission of electrical power from [[power station]]s to [[Center of population|population centres]] is inherently inefficient, due to [[Electric power transmission#Losses|transmission losses]] in electrical grids, particularly within power-hungry dense [[conurbation]]s where power stations are harder to site. By allowing a greater proportion of on-site generated electricity to be consumed on-site, rather than exported to the energy grid, home energy storage devices can reduce the inefficiencies of grid transport.

===Energy grid support===
Home energy storage devices, when connected to a server via the [[internet]], can theoretically be ordered to provide very short-term services to the energy grid:-
* Reduced peak hour demand stress - provision of short-term [[demand response]] during periods of peak demand reducing the need to inefficiently standing up of short generation assets like [[diesel generators]].
* Frequency correction - the provision of ultra short-term corrections, to keep [[utility frequency|mains frequency]] within the tolerances required by regulators (e.g. 50Hz or 60Hz +/- n%).

===Reduced reliance on fossil fuels===
Due to the above efficiencies, and their ability to boost the amount of solar energy consumed on-site, the devices reduce the amount of power generated using [[fossil fuels]], namely [[natural gas]], [[coal]], [[oil]] and [[diesel fuel|diesel]].

==Disadvantages==
===Environmental impact of batteries===
Lithium-ion batteries, a popular choice due to their relatively high [[cycle durability|charge cycle]] and lack of [[memory effect]], are difficult to [[Recycling|recycle]].

Lead-acid batteries are relatively easier to recycle and, due to the high resale value of the [[lead]], 99% of those sold in the US get recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recycling Rate Study|url=http://batterycouncil.org/?RecylingStudy|publisher=Battery Council International (BCI)|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have much shorter useful lives than a lithium-ion battery of a similar capacity, due to having a lower [[cycle durability|charge cycle]], narrowing the environmental-impact gap. In addition, lead is a [[toxic heavy metal]] and the [[sulphuric acid]] in the [[electrolyte]] has a high environmental impact.

====Second life for EV batteries====
To offset the environmental impact of batteries, some manufacturers extend the useful life of used batteries taken from electric vehicles at the point where the cells won't sufficiently hold charge. Though considered end of life for electric vehicles, the batteries will function satisfactorily in home energy storage devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaines|first1=Linda|title=The future of automotive lithium-ion battery recycling: Charting a sustainable course|journal=Sustainable Materials and Technologies|volume= 1–2|issue=December 2014|pages=Pages 2–7|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214993714000037|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers supporting this include Nissan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibbs|first1=Nick|title=Nissan gives Leaf batteries a 'second life' as home energy storage units|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20160510/ANE/160519985/nissan-gives-leaf-batteries-a-second-life-as-home-energy-storage-units|website=Automotive News Europe|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMW&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pyper|first1=Julia|title=BMW Is Turning Used i3 Batteries Into Home Energy Storage Units|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/bmw-is-turning-used-i3-batteries-into-home-energy-storage-units|website=Greentech Media|publisher=[[Wood Mackenzie]]|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Powervault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Life Batteries for Domestic Electricity Storage - International Feasibility Study|url=http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=132553|website=Gateway to Research|publisher=[[Research Councils UK]]|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Salt water batteries====
Home Energy Storage devices can be paired with [[Salt water battery|salt water batteries]], which have a lower environmental impact due to their lack of [[toxic heavy metal]] and ease of [[Recycling|recyclability]].

'''''Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio''''' is a two volume book of scientific illustrations published by subscription between the years 1879 and 1886.&lt;ref name="Women's History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smithsonianlibraries.si.edu/smithsonianlibraries/2009/03/womens-history-month-genevieve-estelle-jones.html |title=Women's History Month: Genevieve Estelle Jones |author=Elizabeth Periale |date=March 29, 2009 |work=Smithsonian Libraries Blog |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was conceived by [[Genevieve Estelle Jones]], who began work on the book in 1877 and was initially its principal illustrator.  The book was completed by Jones's family after her death from [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=‘America’s Other Audubon’ |author=Azadeh Ensha |url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/now-reading-americas-other-audubon/ |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=May 9, 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Jones accompanied her father, Dr. Nelson Jones, as he visited patients.  As they traveled, the two would collect birds' eggs and nests for the family's natural history cabinet.  Jones developed an interest in ornithology.  When Jones and her father acquired a nest of a [[Baltimore oriole]], Jones searched for a book to use to research and identify it and was surprised that one did not exist.  Her brother, Howard, later commented that if she would paint the images for such a book he would collect them for her.&lt;ref name="Kiser Essay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/nestsandeggs/essay.htm |title=Illustrations of Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio: Essay |author=Joy M. Kiser |year=2004 |work=Smithsonian INstitution Libraries On Display: Illustrations of the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1876, Jones viewed [[James Audubon]]'s ''[[The Birds of America]]'' at the [[Centennial Exposition|World's Fair]] in [[Philadelphia]] and was inspired to undertake the project.&lt;ref name="Trinity"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaimowitz |first1=Jeffrey |year=2009 |title=The Watkinson Library Receives Two Stunning Gifts |journal=News from the Libraries at Trinity College |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=1 |publisher=Trinity College |doi= |url=http://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=libnews&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fq%3DGenevieve%2BJones%252C%2Bbirds%2Bohio%2Bworld%2527s%2Bfair%26btnG%3D%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%252C9#search=%22Genevieve%20Jones%2C%20birds%20ohio%20worlds%20fair%22 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial installment of the book was extremely well received.  Ornithologist [[Elliott Coues]], writing in ''Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithology Club'', wrote that "there has been nothing since Audubon in the way of pictorial illustrations of American Ornithology to compare with the present work - nothing to claim the union of an equal degree of artistic skill and scientific accuracy."  Naturalist [[William Brewster (ornithologist)|William Brewster]] called her illustration of the nest of the Wood Thrush a "perfect masterpiece."&lt;ref name="Kiser Essay"/&gt;

Jones's family collaborated to complete the book after Jones's death.  Jones's mother, Virginia Jones, took over first the coloring and then the actual drawing of the illustrations.  Dr. Howard Jones wrote the accompanying text, as well as collecting the specimens featured in the illustrations.  Jones's father, Dr. Nelson Jones, who had written the original prospectus for the piece, covered most of the costs of its continued publication.&lt;ref name="Kiser Essay"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6051">'''Iusaaset''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|s|æ|s|ɛ|t}};{{fact|date=September 2015}} "the great one who comes forth") or '''Iusaas''' ({{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|j|uː|s|ə|s}}){{fact|date=September 2015}} is a primordial goddess in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. In Egyptian texts, she is described as "[[Mother goddess|the grandmother of all of the deities]]".{{fact|date=May 2018}} This allusion is without any reference to a grandfather, so there might have been a very early, but now lost, [[myth]] with [[parthenogenesis]] as the means of the birth of the deities from the region where her cult arose near the delta of the [[Nile]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} There are many alternative spellings of her name, including ''Iusaaset'', ''Iusaas'', ''Juesaes'', ''Ausaas'', and ''Jusas'', as well as in [[Greek language|Greek]] '''[[Saosis]]''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|eɪ|ˈ|oʊ|s|ᵻ|s}}.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Art==
In Ancient Egyptian art, Iusaaset appears as a woman wearing the vulture crown of [[Mut]], another mother goddess, topped with the [[solar disk]] between cow horns, the headdress of [[Hathor]]. She carries an [[ankh]] in one hand and a [[was sceptre]] in the other, and sometimes her crown bore a [[uraeus]] ([[Egyptian cobra]]), representing the goddess [[Wadjet]]. The [[Egyptian vulture]] that made up her crown symbolised the goddess [[Nekhbet]], the other one of the [[Two Ladies]] protecting Egypt, alongside Wadjet. The Egyptian vulture was also thought to reproduce though parthenogenesis, which might be the basis for a similar view about the motherhood of Iusaaset. The vultures were also considered extremely good mothers, protecting their chicks at any cost, so it is not surprising that mother goddesses like Nekhbet, Iusaaset and Mut were portrayed as or with them.

[[Image:Iusaaset - 83d40m - 4wki.JPG|thumb|278px|left|The grandmother of the deities, Iusaaset, shown with her Egyptian vulture crown with horns, the solar disk and the uraeus]]

Because of Iusaaset’s link to the vulture and uraeus, it can be assumed that she links together both upper and lower Egypt, much like the goddess [[Mut]], with whom she is closely associated.

Although her origins are unclear, Iusaaset seems to be attested quite early in the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Egyptian pantheon]], being associated with creation in general and the creation of the deities in particular. Many myths relate that she was seen as the mother of the first deities and the grandmother of the following deities, having ''watched over'' the birth of the ones that were her grandchildren. She remained a primary deity in the pantheon throughout all eras of the culture, even through the Persian, Hykso, Greek, and Roman occupations, and regardless of changes in the specific myths.

== Association with acacia tree==
Iusaaset was associated with the [[acacia]] tree,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://henadology.wordpress.com/theology/netjeru/iusaas/|title=Iusâas|date=2009-03-23|work=Henadology|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Unreliable source?|date=January 2016}} considered the ''[[tree of life]]'' by the Egyptians. The oldest known acacia tree was situated just north of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], which therefore became identified as the birthplace of the deities. Iusaaset was said to own this tree, just as [[Osiris]] owned the sacred [[willow]]. The acacia tree was renowned for its strength, [[Hardiness (plants)|hardiness]], [[Pharmaceutical chemistry|medical properties]], and [[Eating|edibility]]. Many useful applications gave it a central importance in Egyptian culture.

== Changes in myths ==
One belief, particularly prominent in Heliopolis, held that Iusaaset and [[Atum]] were the parents of [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]], the first deities.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; In this myth she was often described as the [[shadow]], sister, or wife of Atum. In later periods, other goddesses also became associated with Atum,&lt;ref name="W152"&gt;Richard Wilkinson: ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. London, Thames and Hudson, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-500-05120-7}}, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; and one variant even relates that he gave birth to the deities himself,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Complete Gods and Goddesses, pp. 18, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; although that variant seems to have been rejected by most cultural and religious centres.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

During the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], the Egyptians believed that Atum lifted the dead pharaoh's soul from the tomb to the starry heavens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html#Atum Information about Atem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220200810/http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; associating him with the heavens, and in particular the greatest heavenly object in Egyptian thought: the [[Sun]]. By the time of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], the myth of Atum had merged with that of [[Ra]], who was likewise described as a [[creator deity]] and a [[solar deity]] as his cult arose.&lt;ref name="Hart Ra"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses |last=Hart |first=George |year=1986 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Inc. |location=London, England |isbn=0-415-05909-7 |pages=179–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their two identities were joined together to form [[Atum-Ra]]. After they were combined, Ra came to be seen as the sun at midday and Atum as the sun when it sets in the west (depicted as an old man leaning on his staff), while [[Khepri]] was seen as the sun when it was rising. 

In these later times Iusaaset was sometimes described as the [[Eye of Ra]], associating her with other so-called Eye goddesses such as Hathor, [[Sekhmet]] and [[Bastet|Bast]].

'''Jet streams''' are fast flowing, narrow, meandering [[thermal wind|air current]]s in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheres]] of some planets, including [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/jet-stream/?ar_a=1 | title =Jet stream | author =''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' | publisher =nationalgeographic.com | date =July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, the main jet streams are located near the altitude of the [[tropopause]] and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a [[meander]]ing shape. Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet.

The strongest jet streams are the '''polar jets''', at {{convert|9|-|12|km|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and the higher altitude and somewhat weaker '''subtropical jets''' at {{convert|10|-|16|km|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Northern Hemisphere]] and the [[Southern Hemisphere]]  each have a polar jet and a subtropical jet. The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]] and their intervening [[ocean]]s, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles [[Antarctica]] all year round.

Jet streams are the product of two factors: the atmospheric heating by [[solar radiation]] that produces the large-scale [[atmospheric circulation|Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley]] circulation cells, and the action of the [[Coriolis force]] acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's [[Planet#Rotation|rotation]] on its axis. On other planets, [[internal heat]] rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[University of Illinois]] | url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/cyc/upa/jet.rxml | title=Jet Stream | accessdate=4 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other jet streams also exist. During the Northern Hemisphere summer, easterly jets can form in tropical regions, typically where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes. Low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States.  There are also jetstreams in the [[thermosphere]].

Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in [[weather forecasting]]. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic [[North Atlantic Tracks]] are one example of how airlines and [[air traffic control]] work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. [[Clear-air turbulence]], a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are narrow belts.

Polar jet streams are typically located near the 250 [[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] (about 1/4 atmosphere) pressure level, or {{convert|7|to|12|km|mi}} above [[sea level]], while the weaker subtropical jet streams are much higher, between {{convert|10|and|16|km|mi}}. Jet streams wander laterally dramatically, and have large changes in their altitude.

The polar and subtropical jets merge at some locations and times, while at other times they are well separated.

==Cause==
[[File:Earth Global Circulation - en.svg|thumb|250x250px|Highly idealised depiction of the global circulation. The upper-level jets tend to flow latitudinally along the cell boundaries.]]
{{See also|Extratropical cyclone|Thermal wind}}

In general, winds are strongest immediately under the [[tropopause]] (except locally, during [[tornado]]es, [[tropical cyclone]]s or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference caused by the density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the [[Coriolis effect]] and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.&lt;ref name="Stimac"&gt;John P. Stimac. [http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~cfjps/1400/pressure_wind.html Air pressure and wind.] Retrieved on 8 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

All these facts are consequences of the [[thermal wind]] relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on the mass of the parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as [[hydrostatic]]. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as [[geostrophic]]. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.&lt;ref name="Stimac"/&gt;

===Polar jet stream===
The thermal wind relation does not explain why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor that contributes to the creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high latitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the [[frontogenesis]] process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.&lt;ref name="GOMdef"/&gt;

===Subtropical jet===
A second factor which contributes to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical [[Hadley cell]] and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is slight. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the [[Coriolis force]] (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased westward component of the winds&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndon State College]] Meteorology.

===Other planets===
[[Jupiter]]'s atmosphere has multiple jet streams, caused by the convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells are driven by internal heating.&lt;ref name="ROBROY"&gt;Robert Roy Britt. [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/jupiter_sidebar_000209.html et Streams On Earth and Jupiter.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724112429/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/jupiter_sidebar_000209.html |date=24 July 2008 }} Retrieved on 4 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology. In models, as one increases the planetary radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of jet streams decreases.

==Some effects==

===Hurricane protection===
[[File:Jet Stream Rigs Apart Flossie 2.jpg|thumb|left|250px| Note the large band of moisture that developed East of Hawaii Island that came from the hurricane.]]
The subtropical jet stream rounding the base of the mid-oceanic upper trough is thought {{citation needed|date=June 2017}} to be one of the reasons most of the Hawaiian Islands have been resistant to the long [[list of Hawaii hurricanes]] that have approached. For example, when [[Hurricane Flossie (2007)]] approached and dissipated just before reaching landfall, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) cited vertical [[wind shear]] as evidenced in the photo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2007.php NOAA Overview of Hurricane Flossie]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
On Earth, the northern polar jet stream is the most important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles [[Antarctica]] and sometimes the southern tip of [[South America]]. The term ''jet stream'' in these contexts thus usually implies the northern polar jet stream.

===Unpowered aerial attack===
Near the end of [[World War II]] the Japanese [[fire balloon]] was designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the [[Pacific Ocean]] to reach the west coast of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. They were relatively ineffective as weapons, but they were used in one of the few [[American Theater (1939–1945)#Fire balloon attacks|attacks on North America during World War II]], causing six deaths and a small amount of damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/docs/air/avfusen.html The Fire Balloons]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of ENSO===
[[File:El nino north american weather.png|thumb|right|250 px|Impact of El Niño and La Niña on North America]]
{{Main|Effects of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in the United States}}
[[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) influences the average location of upper-level jet streams, and leads to cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature across North America, as well as affecting [[tropical cyclone]] development across the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins.

===Dust Bowl===
Evidence suggests the jet stream was at least partly responsible for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s [[Dust Bowl]] in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping [[rain]] onto the [[Great Plains]]. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Weather at About.com.

==Longer-term climatic changes==
Climate scientists have hypothesized that the jet stream will gradually weaken as a result of [[global warming]]. Trends such as [[Arctic sea ice decline]], reduced snow cover, [[evapotranspiration]] patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Walsh|title=Polar Vortex: Climate Change Might Just Be Driving the Historic Cold Snap|url=http://science.time.com/2014/01/06/climate-change-driving-cold-weather/|publisher=[[TIME]]|date=January 6, 2014|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedlander|first=Blaine|title=Arctic ice loss amplified Superstorm Sandy violence|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/03/arctic-ice-loss-amplified-superstorm-sandy-violence|accessdate=January 7, 2014|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSMonitor&gt;{{cite news|last=Spotts|first=Pete|title=How frigid 'polar vortex' could be result of global warming (+video)|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2014/0106/How-frigid-polar-vortex-could-be-result-of-global-warming-video|accessdate=January 8, 2014|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Since 2007, and particularly in 2012 and early 2013, the jet stream has been at an abnormally low latitude across the UK, lying closer to the [[English Channel]], around 50°N rather than its more usual north of Scotland latitude of around 60°N.{{failed verification|date=June 2016}} However, between 1979 and 2001, it has been found that the average position of the jet stream has been moving northward at a rate of {{convert|2.01|km|mi}} per year across the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Across North America, this type of change could lead to drier conditions across the southern tier of the United States and more frequent and more intense [[tropical cyclone]]s in the tropics. A similar slow poleward drift was found when studying the [[Southern Hemisphere]] jet stream over the same time frame.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]].

==Other upper-level jets==

===Polar night jet===
The polar-night jet stream forms mainly during the winter months when the nights are much longer, hence [[polar night]]s, in their respective hemispheres at around 60° latitude. The polar night jet moves at a greater height of about {{convert|80000|ft|m}} than it does during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Jet Streams around the World| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/jetstreams_world.shtml | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these dark months the air high over the poles becomes much colder than the air over the Equator. This difference in temperature gives rise to extreme air pressure differences in the stratosphere, which, when combined with the Coriolis effect, create the polar night jets, that race eastward at an altitude of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Jet Stream| url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF6/640.html |last=Gedney | first=Larry | publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Note to other editors: Observe that "80,000 feet" (BBC source) and "30 miles" (Alaska source) are incompatible. Any ideas? --&gt; The [[polar vortex]] is circled by the polar night jet. The warmer air can only move along the edge of the polar vortex, but not enter it. Within the vortex, the cold polar air becomes increasingly cold with neither warmer air from lower latitudes nor energy from the Sun during the [[polar night]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stat.osu.edu/~sses/collab_ozone_split_background.php |title=2002 Ozone-Hole Splitting – Background |publisher=Ohio State University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621115326/http://www.stat.osu.edu/~sses/collab_ozone_split_background.php |archivedate=21 June 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valley exit jet===
A [[valley exit jet]] is a strong, down-valley, elevated air current that emerges above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach a maximum of 20&amp;nbsp;m/s (45&amp;nbsp;mph or 72&amp;nbsp;km/h) at a height of 40–200 m above the ground. Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation, but are significantly weaker.

They are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal mountain wind systems, such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.&lt;ref&gt;Whiteman, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8521">{{short description|A wave in the ocean or atmosphere that balances Coriolis force against a topographic boundary such as a coastline}}
A '''Kelvin wave''' is a [[wave]] in the ocean or atmosphere that balances the Earth's [[Coriolis force]] against a [[topographic]] boundary such as a coastline, or a [[waveguide]] such as the equator. A feature of a Kelvin wave is that it is [[Dispersion (water waves)|non-dispersive]], i.e., the [[phase speed]] of the wave crests is equal to the [[Group velocity|group speed]] of the [[wave energy]] for all frequencies. This means that it retains its shape as it moves in the alongshore direction over time.

A Kelvin wave ([[fluid dynamics]]) is also a long scale perturbation mode of a [[vortex]] in [[superfluid]] dynamics; in terms of the meteorological or oceanographical derivation, one may assume that the meridional velocity component vanishes (i.e. there is no flow in the north–south direction, thus making the [[momentum]] and [[continuity equation]]s much simpler). This wave is named after the discoverer, [[Lord Kelvin]] (1879).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Thomson |first=W. ([[Lord Kelvin]]) | year=1879 | title=On gravitational oscillations of rotating water | journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh | volume=10 | pages=92–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-283522-3 | last = Gill | first = Adrian E. | title = Atmosphere–ocean dynamics | series = International Geophysics Series | volume = 30 | year = 1982 | pages = 378–380
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coastal Kelvin wave==

In a stratified ocean of mean depth ''H'', free waves propagate along coastal boundaries (and hence become trapped in the vicinity of the coast itself) in the form of internal Kelvin waves on a scale of about 30&amp;nbsp;km.  These waves are called coastal Kelvin waves, and have propagation speeds of approximately 2 m/s in the ocean.  Using the assumption that the cross-shore velocity ''v'' is zero at the coast, ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, one may solve a frequency relation for the [[phase speed]] of coastal Kelvin waves, which are among the class of waves called boundary waves, [[edge wave]]s, trapped waves, or surface waves (similar to the [[Lamb waves]]).&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;Gill, Adrian E., 1982: ''Atmosphere–Ocean Dynamics,'' International Geophysics Series, Volume 30, Academic Press, 662 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ([[linearisation|linearised]]) [[primitive equations]] then become the following:

* the [[continuity equation]] (accounting for the effects of horizontal convergence and divergence):

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = \frac{-1}{H} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

* the ''u''-momentum equation (zonal wind component):

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = - g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + f v&lt;/math&gt;

* the ''v''-momentum equation (meridional wind component):

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = - g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} - f u.&lt;/math&gt;

If one assumes that the [[Coriolis coefficient]] ''f'' is constant along the right boundary conditions and the zonal wind speed is set equal to zero, then the primitive equations become the following:

* the continuity equation:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = \frac{-1}{H} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

* the ''u''-momentum equation:

::&lt;math&gt;g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = f v&lt;/math&gt;

* the ''v''-momentum equation:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = - g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution to these equations yields the following phase speed: ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''gH'', which is the same speed as for shallow-water gravity waves without the effect of Earth’s rotation.&lt;ref name="Holton"&gt;Holton, James R., 2004: ''An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology''.  Elsevier Academic Press, Burlington, MA, pp. 394–400.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that for an observer traveling with the wave, the coastal boundary (maximum amplitude) is always to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere (i.e. these waves move equatorward – negative phase speed – on a western boundary and poleward – positive phase speed – on an eastern boundary; the waves move cyclonically around an ocean basin).&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

The equatorial zone essentially acts as a waveguide, causing disturbances to be trapped in the vicinity of the Equator, and the equatorial Kelvin wave illustrates this fact because the Equator acts analogously to a topographic boundary for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, making this wave very similar to the coastally-trapped Kelvin wave.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;  The primitive equations are identical to those used to develop the coastal Kelvin wave phase speed solution (U-momentum, V-momentum, and continuity equations) and the motion is unidirectional and parallel to the Equator.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;  Because these waves are equatorial, the [[Coriolis parameter]] vanishes at 0 degrees; therefore, it is necessary to use the equatorial [[beta plane]] approximation that states: 

::&lt;math&gt;f = \beta y,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β'' is the variation of the Coriolis parameter with latitude.  This equatorial beta plane assumption requires a geostrophic balance between the eastward velocity and the north-south pressure gradient.  The phase speed is identical to that of coastal Kelvin waves, indicating that the equatorial Kelvin waves propagate toward the east without dispersion (as if the earth were a non-rotating planet).&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;  For the first [[baroclinic]] mode in the ocean, a typical phase speed would be about 2.8 m/s, causing an equatorial Kelvin wave to take 2 months to cross the Pacific Ocean between New Guinea and South America; for higher ocean and atmospheric modes, the phase speeds are comparable to fluid flow speeds.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;  

When the motion at the Equator is to the east, any deviation toward the north is brought back toward the Equator because the [[Coriolis force]] acts to the right of the direction of motion in the Northern Hemisphere, and any deviation to the south is brought back toward the Equator because the Coriolis force acts to the left of the direction of motion in the Southern Hemisphere. Note that for motion toward the west, the Coriolis force would not restore a northward or southward deviation back toward the Equator; thus, equatorial Kelvin waves are only possible for eastward motion (as noted above). Both atmospheric and oceanic equatorial Kelvin waves play an important role in the dynamics of [[El Nino-Southern Oscillation]], by transmitting changes in conditions in the Western Pacific to the Eastern Pacific.

There have been studies that connect equatorial Kelvin waves to coastal Kelvin waves.  Moore (1968) found that as an equatorial Kelvin wave strikes an "eastern boundary", part of the energy is reflected in the form of planetary and gravity waves; and the remainder of the energy is carried poleward along the eastern boundary as coastal Kelvin waves.  This process indicates that some energy may be lost from the equatorial region and transported to the poleward region.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

Equatorial Kelvin waves are often associated with anomalies in surface wind stress. For example, positive (eastward) anomalies in wind stress in the central Pacific excite positive anomalies in 20°C isotherm depth which propagate to the east as equatorial Kelvin waves.

==Discovery and observation==
The existence of a [[photometry (astronomy)|photometrically]] confirmable concentration of dust at the libration (Lagrangian) points was predicted by Josef Witkowski in 1956 (1951? {{cn|date=October 2018}}).&lt;ref name="BEA"&gt;{{cite book |author=Trimble, Virginia |title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers: Kordylewski, Kazimierz

In 1967, [[J. Wesley Simpson]] made observations of the clouds using the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]].
&lt;!-- They were detected by the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory 6]] spacecraft in 1975. --&gt;

In October 2018, the existence of the Kordylewski clouds was reported to have been confirmed,&lt;ref name="EA-20181026" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MN-RAS-20181111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MN-RAS-20190101" /&gt; even though, earlier, in 2009, the Japanese [[Hiten]] space probe, which passed through the libration points to detect trapped dust particles, did not find an obvious increase in dust levels above the density in surrounding space.&lt;ref name=Laufer/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASAHiten&gt;

The Kordylewski clouds are a very faint phenomenon, comparable to the brightness of the [[gegenschein]].&lt;ref name=Covington&gt;{{cite book  | last = Covington  | first = Michael A.  | title = Astrophotography for the Amateur  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]  | date = 1999  | pages = 32–33  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZT0ja5EM358C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=%22kordylewski+cloud%22  | isbn = 0-521-62740-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are very difficult to observe from Earth&lt;ref name=Laufer/&gt; but may be visible to the unaided eye in an exceptionally dark and clear night sky.&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt; Most claimed observations have been made from deserts, at sea, or from mountains.&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt; The clouds appear somewhat redder than the gegenschein, indicating that they may be made of a different kind of particle.&lt;ref name=Laufer/&gt;

The Kordylewski clouds are located near the {{L4}} and {{L5}} [[Lagrange point]]s of the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name=Laufer/&gt; They are about 6 degrees in [[angular diameter]].&lt;ref name=Laufer/&gt; The clouds can drift up to 6 to 10 degrees from those points.&lt;ref name=Covington/&gt; Other observations suggest they move around the libration points in ellipses of about 6 by 2 degrees.&lt;ref name=Laufer/&gt;

[[File:Mangroves in Kannur, India.jpg|thumb|Mangroves are adapted to saline conditions]]

A '''mangrove''' is a shrub or small tree that grows in coastal [[saline water|saline]] or [[brackish water]]. The term is also used for tropical coastal vegetation consisting of such species.  Mangroves occur worldwide in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropics]], mainly between latitudes [[25th parallel north|{{formatnum:25}}°&amp;nbsp;N]] and [[25th parallel south|{{formatnum:25}}°&amp;nbsp;S]]. The total mangrove forest area of the world in 2000 was {{convert|137,800|km2}}, spanning 118 countries and territories.&lt;ref name="Giri2010"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2010 |title= Status and distribution of mangrove forests of the world using earth observation satellite data |journal= [[Global Ecology and Biogeography]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=154–159 |doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00584.x |last1=Giri |first1=C. |last2=Ochieng |first2=E. |last3=Tieszen |first3=L.L. |last4=Zhu |first4=Z. |last5=Singh |first5=A. |last6=Loveland |first6=T. |last7=Masek |first7=J. |lastauthoramp=yes |last8=Duke |first8=N. |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/referata/arq/2010_09_Marilia/Giri_etal_2010.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangroves are salt-tolerant trees, also called [[halophyte]]s, and are adapted to life in harsh coastal conditions. They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex [[root]] system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action. They are adapted to the low oxygen (anoxic) conditions of waterlogged mud.

The word is used in at least three senses: (1) most broadly to refer to the habitat and entire plant assemblage or ''mangal'',&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;Hogarth, Peter J. (1999) ''The Biology of Mangroves'' Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, {{ISBN|0-19-850222-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2012}} for which the terms ''mangrove forest [[biome]]'', and ''mangrove swamp'' are also used, (2) to refer to all trees and large shrubs in the mangrove swamp, and (3) narrowly to refer to the mangrove [[Family (biology)|family]] of plants, the [[Rhizophoraceae]], or even more specifically just to mangrove trees of the genus ''[[Rhizophora]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The mangrove biome, or mangal, is a distinct saline [[woodland]] or [[shrubland]] habitat characterized by [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional]] coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure [[seawater]] (3 to 4%), to water concentrated by [[evaporation]] to over twice the [[salinity]] of ocean seawater (up to 9%).&lt;ref name=NHMI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |title=Morphological and Physiological Adaptations: Florida mangrove website |publisher=Nhmi.org |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204222702/http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathias /&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term "[[wikt:mangrove#English|mangrove]]" comes to English from Spanish (perhaps by way of Portuguese), and is likely to originate from [[Guaraní language|Guarani]]. It was earlier "mangrow" (from Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|mangue}}'' or Spanish ''{{lang|es|mangle}}''), but this word was corrupted via [[folk etymology]] influence of the word "[[Grove (nature)|grove]]".

==Ecology==
[[File:World map mangrove distribution.jpg|thumb|The world's mangrove forests in 2000]]
Mangrove swamps (mangals) are found in tropical and subtropical [[tidal]] areas. Areas where mangals occur include [[estuary|estuaries]] and marine shorelines.&lt;ref name=Mathias/&gt;

The [[intertidal]] existence to which these trees are adapted represents the major limitation to the number of species able to thrive in their habitat. High tide brings in salt water, and when the tide recedes, solar evaporation of the seawater in the soil leads to further increases in salinity. The return of tide can flush out these soils, bringing them back to salinity levels comparable to that of seawater.

At low tide, organisms are also exposed to increases in temperature and desiccation, and are then cooled and flooded by the tide. Thus, for a plant to survive in this environment, it must tolerate broad ranges of salinity, temperature, and moisture, as well as a number of other key environmental factors—thus only a select few species make up the mangrove tree community.

About 110 species are considered "mangroves", in the sense of being a tree that grows in such a saline swamp,&lt;ref name="Mathias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/index.html |title=Mangal (Mangrove). '&amp;#39;World Vegetation'&amp;#39;. Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden, University of California at Los Angeles |publisher=Botgard.ucla.edu |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209010910/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/index.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though only a few are from the mangrove plant genus, ''Rhizophora''. However, a given mangrove swamp typically features only a small number of tree species. It is not uncommon for a mangrove forest in the Caribbean to feature only three or four tree species. For comparison, the tropical rainforest biome contains thousands of tree species, but this is not to say mangrove forests lack diversity. Though the trees themselves are few in species, the ecosystem that these trees create provides a home (habitat) for a great variety of other species.

Mangrove plants require a number of physiological adaptations to overcome the problems of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxia]], high [[salinity]] and frequent tidal [[inundation]]. Each species has its own solutions to these problems; this may be the primary reason why, on some shorelines, [[Rhizophora|mangrove tree species]] show distinct zonation. Small environmental variations within a mangal may lead to greatly differing methods for coping with the environment. Therefore, the mix of species is partly determined by the tolerances of individual species to physical conditions, such as tidal inundation and salinity, but may also be influenced by other factors, such as [[predation]] of plant seedlings by crabs.

Once established, mangrove roots provide an oyster habitat and slow water flow, thereby enhancing sediment deposition in areas where it is already occurring. The fine, anoxic sediments under mangroves act as sinks for a variety of [[Heavy metals|heavy (trace) metals]] which [[colloidal particle]]s in the sediments have scavenged from the water. Mangrove removal disturbs these underlying sediments, often creating problems of trace metal contamination of seawater and [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

Mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during [[hurricanes]]), and tsunamis.&lt;ref name="Mazda-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Mazda|first1=Y.|last2=Kobashi|first2=D.|last3=Okada|first3=S.|year=2005|title=Tidal-Scale Hydrodynamics within Mangrove Swamps|url=|journal=Wetlands Ecology and Management | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 647–655 | doi=10.1007/s11273-005-0613-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danielsen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1118387 |pmid=16254180 |title=The Asian Tsunami: A Protective Role for Coastal Vegetation |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5748 |pages=643 |year=2005 |last1=Danielsen |first1=F |last2=Sørensen |first2=M.

Mangrove swamps' effectiveness in terms of erosion control can sometimes be overstated. Wave energy is typically low in areas where mangroves grow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baird |first1=Andrew |date=26 December 2006 |title=False Hopes and Natural Disasters |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/opinion/26baird.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; so their effect on erosion is measured over long periods.&lt;ref name="Massel" /&gt; Their capacity to limit high-energy wave erosion is in relation to events such as storm surges and tsunamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.008 |pmid=15964259 |title=How effective were mangroves as a defence against the recent tsunami? |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=R443–7 |year=2005 |last1=Dahdouh-Guebas |first1=F |last2=Jayatissa |first2=L.P |last3=Di Nitto |first3=D |last4=Bosire |first4=J.O |last5=Lo Seen |first5=D |last6=Koedam |first6=N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique ecosystem found in the intricate mesh of mangrove [[root]]s offers a quiet marine region for young organisms.&lt;ref name=BOS&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00227-010-1588-0 |pmid=24391259 |pmc=3873073 |title=Ontogenetic habitat shift, population growth, and burrowing behavior of the Indo-Pacific beach star, Archaster typicus (Echinodermata; Asteroidea) |journal=Marine Biology |volume=158 |issue=3 |pages=639–648 |year=2010 |last1=Bos |first1=Arthur R |last2=Gumanao |first2=Girley S |last3=Van Katwijk |first3=Marieke M |last4=Mueller |first4=Benjamin |last5=Saceda |first5=Marjho M |last6=Tejada |first6=Rosie Lynn P }}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where roots are permanently submerged, the organisms they host include [[algae]], [[barnacle]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, and [[bryozoan]]s, which all require a hard surface for anchoring while they filter feed. [[Shrimp]]s and [[Thalassinidea|mud lobsters]] use the muddy bottoms as their home.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encarta]] Encyclopedia 2005''. "Seashore", by [[Heidi Nepf]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mangrove crab]]s munch on the mangrove leaves, adding nutrients to the mangal muds for other bottom feeders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00442-001-0847-7 |pmid=28547499 |bibcode=2002Oecol.131....1S |title=Paradoxical selective feeding on a low-nutrient diet: Why do mangrove crabs eat leaves? |journal=Oecologia |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2002 |last1=Skov |first1=Martin W |last2=Hartnoll |first2=Richard G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least some cases, export of carbon fixed in mangroves is important in coastal food webs.

Mangrove plantations in [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[India]] host several commercially important species of fishes and crustaceans. Despite restoration efforts, developers and others have removed over half of the world's mangroves in recent times.

Mangrove forests can decay into peat deposits because of fungal and bacterial processes as well as by the action of [[termite]]s.  It becomes peat in good geochemical, sedimentary and tectonic conditions.&lt;ref name="Vane"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ggge.20194 |title=Degradation of mangrove tissues by arboreal termites (Nasutitermes acajutlae) and their role in the mangrove C cycle (Puerto Rico): Chemical characterization and organic matter provenance using bulk δ13C, C/N, alkaline CuO oxidation-GC/MS, and solid-state |journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=3176 |year=2013 |last1=Vane |first1=Christopher H |last2=Kim |first2=Alexander W |last3=Moss-Hayes |first3=Vicky |last4=Snape |first4=Colin E |last5=Diaz |first5=Miguel Castro |last6=Khan |first6=Nicole S |last7=Engelhart |first7=Simon E |last8=Horton |first8=Benjamin P |bibcode=2013GGG....14.3176V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature of these deposits depends on the environment and the types of mangrove involved. In Puerto Rico the red ([[Rhizophora mangle]]), white ([[Laguncularia racemosa]]) and black ([[Avicennia germinans]]) mangroves occupy different ecological niches and have slightly different chemical compositions so the carbon content varies between the species as well between the different tissues of the plant e.g. leaf matter vs roots.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

In Puerto Rico there is a clear succession of these three trees from the lower elevations which are dominated by red mangroves to farther inland with a higher concentration of white mangroves.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt; Mangrove forests are an important part of the cycling and storage of carbon in tropical coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt; Using this it is possible to attempt to reconstruct the environment and investigate changes to the coastal ecosystem for thousands of years by using sediment cores.&lt;ref name="versteegh"&gt;Versteegh, G. J. M., et al. (2004). "Taraxerol and Rhizophora pollen as proxies for tracking past mangrove ecosystems." Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 68(3): 411–422.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an additional complication is the imported marine organic matter that also gets deposited in the sediment due to tidal flushing of mangrove forests.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

In order to understand peat formation by mangroves, it is important to understand the conditions they grew in, and how they decayed.  Termites are an important part of this decay, and so an understanding of their action on the organic matter is crucial to the chemical stabilization of mangrove peats.&lt;ref name=Vane /&gt;

Mangroves are an important source of [[blue carbon]]. Globally, mangroves stored 4.19 Pg of carbon in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Stuart E.|last2=Friess|first2=Daniel A.|date=2018-02-26|title=Global carbon stocks and potential emissions due to mangrove deforestation from 2000 to 2012|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0090-4|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=8|issue=3|pages=240–244|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0090-4|issn=1758-678X|bibcode=2018NatCC...8..240H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two percent of global mangrove carbon was lost between 2000 and 2012, equivalent to a maximum potential of 316,996,250 t of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Biology==
Of the recognized 110 mangrove species, only about 54 species in 20 genera from 16 [[Family (biology)|families]] constitute the "true mangroves", species that occur almost exclusively in mangrove habitats.&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; Demonstrating [[convergent evolution]], many of these species found similar solutions to the tropical conditions of variable salinity, tidal range (inundation), [[Anaerobic environment|anaerobic]] soils and intense sunlight. Plant biodiversity is generally low in a given mangrove.&lt;ref name="Mathias" /&gt; The greatest biodiversity occurs in the mangal of [[New Guinea]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/distribution_of_coral_mangrove_and_seagrass_diversity/ |title=Distribution of coral, mangrove and seagrass diversity |publisher=Maps.grida.no |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305202831/http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/distribution_of_coral_mangrove_and_seagrass_diversity |archivedate=2010-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptations to low oxygen===
[[File:Mangrove.jpg|thumb|A red mangrove, ''Rhizophora mangle''.]]
[[File:Mangroves.jpg|thumb|Above and below water view at the edge of the mangal.]]
[[Rhizophora mangle|Red mangroves]], which can survive in the most inundated areas, prop themselves above the water level with stilt roots and can then absorb air through pores in their bark ([[lenticel]]s). [[Avicennia germinans|Black mangroves]] live on higher ground and make many [[pneumatophore]]s (specialised root-like structures which stick up out of the soil like straws for breathing) which are also covered in [[lenticel]]s.

These "breathing tubes" typically reach heights of up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm, and in some species, over 3 m. The four types of pneumatophores are stilt or prop type, snorkel or peg type, knee type, and ribbon or plank type. Knee and ribbon types may be combined with buttress roots at the base of the tree. The roots also contain wide [[aerenchyma]] to facilitate transport within the plants.

===Limiting salt intake===
[[File:Saltcrystals on avicennia marina var resinifera leaves.JPG|thumb|Salt crystals formed on grey mangrove leaf.]]
Red mangroves exclude salt by having significantly impermeable roots which are highly [[suberin|suberised]] (impregnated with suberin), acting as an ultra-filtration mechanism to exclude [[sodium]] [[salts]] from the rest of the plant. Analysis of water inside mangroves has shown 90% to 97% of salt has been excluded at the roots. In a frequently cited concept that has become known as the "sacrificial leaf", salt which does accumulate in the shoot (sprout) then concentrates in old leaves, which the plant then sheds. However, recent research suggests the older, yellowing leaves have no more measurable salt content than the other, greener leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=L. Joseph |year=2010 |title=Sacrificial leaf hypothesis of mangroves |url=http://www.glomis.com/ej/pdf/EJ_8-4.pdf |work=ISME/GLOMIS Electronic Journal |publisher=GLOMIS |accessdate=21 January 2012 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red mangroves can also store salt in cell [[vacuole]]s. As seen in the photograph on the right, white or grey mangroves can secrete salts directly; they have two salt glands at each leaf base (correlating with their name—they are covered in white salt crystals).

===Limiting water loss===
Because of the limited fresh water available in salty intertidal soils, mangroves limit the amount of water they lose through their leaves. They can restrict the opening of their [[stomata]] (pores on the leaf surfaces, which exchange [[carbon dioxide]] gas and water vapour during photosynthesis). They also vary the orientation of their leaves to avoid the harsh midday sun and so reduce evaporation from the leaves. Anthony Calfo, a noted [[aquarium]] author, observed anecdotally a red mangrove in captivity only grows if its leaves are misted with fresh water several times a week, simulating frequent tropical rainstorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2004-12/ac/feature/index.php |title=Calfo, Anthony (2006). '&amp;#39;Mangroves for the Marine Aquarium'&amp;#39; |publisher=Reefkeeping.com |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrient uptake===
Because the soil is perpetually waterlogged, little free oxygen is available. Anaerobic [[bacteria]] liberate [[nitrogen]] gas, soluble ferrum ([[iron]]), inorganic [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfide]]s and [[methane]], which make the soil much less nutritious.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Pneumatophores ([[aerial root]]s) allow mangroves to absorb gases directly from the atmosphere, and other nutrients such as [[iron]], from the inhospitable soil. Mangroves store gases directly inside the roots, processing them even when the roots are submerged during high tide.

===Increasing survival of offspring===
[[File:Plody mangrovnika (Rhizophora mangle).jpg|thumb|Red mangrove seeds [[viviparity|germinate while still on the parent tree]].]]

In this harsh environment, mangroves have evolved a special mechanism to help their offspring survive. Mangrove [[seed]]s are buoyant and are therefore suited to water dispersal. Unlike most plants, whose seeds germinate in soil, many mangroves (e.g. [[Rhizophora mangle|red mangrove]]) are [[Vivipary|viviparous]], whose seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree. Once germinated, the seedling grows either within the fruit (e.g. ''[[Aegialitis]]'', ''[[Avicennia]]'' and ''[[Aegiceras]]''), or out through the fruit (e.g. ''[[Rhizophora]]'', ''[[Ceriops]]'', ''[[Bruguiera]]'' and ''[[Nypa (genus)|Nypa]]'') to form a [[propagule]] (a ready-to-go seedling) which can produce its own food via [[photosynthesis]].

The mature propagule then drops into the water, which can transport it great distances. Propagules can survive desiccation and remain dormant for over a year before arriving in a suitable environment. Once a propagule is ready to root, its density changes so the elongated shape now floats vertically rather than horizontally. In this position, it is more likely to lodge in the mud and root. If it does not root, it can alter its density and drift again in search of more favorable conditions.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The following listing (modified from Tomlinson, 1986) gives the number of species of mangroves in each listed plant genus and family. Mangrove environments in the Eastern Hemisphere harbor six times as many species of trees and shrubs as do mangroves in the New World. Genetic divergence of mangrove lineages from terrestrial relatives, in combination with fossil evidence, suggests mangrove diversity is limited by evolutionary transition into the stressful marine environment, and the number of mangrove lineages has increased steadily over the Tertiary with little global extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ricklefs, R.

{{further|List of mangrove ecoregions}}

Mangroves can be found in over 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The largest percentage of mangroves is found between the 5° N and 5° S latitudes. Approximately 75% of world’s mangroves are found in just 15 countries. Asia has the largest amount (42%) of the world’s mangroves, followed by Africa (21%), North/Central America (15%), Oceania (12%) and South America (11%).&lt;ref name="Giri2010" /&gt;

===Africa===
There are important mangrove swamps in [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and [[Madagascar]], with the latter even admixing at the coastal verge with [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|dry deciduous forests]].

Nigeria has Africa's largest mangrove concentration, spanning 36,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

There are mangroves off the east coast of [[South Africa]] extending as far south as the Tylomnqa River (33°13'26.1"S 27°34'50.2"E). Some mangrove stands exist in the [[St Lucia, KwaZulu-Natal|St Lucia]] [[estuary]] within [[iSimangaliso Wetland Park]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Americas===
Mangroves live in many parts of the tropical and subtropical coastal zones of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].

[[Colombia]] possesses large mangrove forests on both its Caribbean and Pacific coasts.

The Mangrove forests of [[Suriname]] have a height of 20–25 m and are found mainly in the coastal area. There are six types of mangroves, namely two types of parwa or black mangroves, three types of red mangroves (mangro) and a small mangrove species (white mangrove, akira or tjila).&lt;ref&gt;Environmental statistics of Suriname 2014. http://www.statistics-suriname.org/index.php/statistieken/downloads/category/34-milieu-publicatie-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sundarbans in the [[Ganges]]-[[Brahmaputra]] delta extend from the [[Hooghly River]] in [[West Bengal]] to the [[Baleswar River]] in [[Bangladesh]], covering an area of about {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. This area comprises closed and open mangrove forests, agriculturally used land, [[mudflat]]s and barren land. It is intersected by [[tidal]] streams and channels. Four protected areas in the Sundarbans, viz [[Sundarbans National Park]], [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans West]], [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans South]] and [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|Sundarbans East]] Wildlife Sanctuaries are enlisted as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. [[Biodiversity]] includes at least 27 mangrove species, 40 mammal, 35 reptile and 260 bird species. More than 2.5 million people are estimated to live in the vicinity of the Sundarbans, making them one of the world's most densely populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Giri, C., Pengra, B., Zhu, Z., Singh, A. and Tieszen, L.

{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
It is the largest mangroves region and the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the world.
Sundri (''[[Heritiera fomes]]'') trees provide durable hard timber. Palm, coconut, keora, agar, also grow in some parts of the delta. India's mangrove forests are habitat for [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus''), turtles, and snakes. This region is part of the Great Sundarbans and covers a National Park, Tiger reserve and a Biosphere Reserve.&lt;ref name="walkthroughindiaTop5_wetland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkthroughindia.com/walkthroughs/top-5-largest-wetland-and-ramsar-sites-in-india/|title=Largest Wetland and Ramsar Sites in India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sundarbans was designated a Ramsar site on May 21, 1992. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a protective flood barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around [[Kolkata]] against the result of cyclone activity. 
Sundarbans is home to many different species of birds, mammals, insects, reptiles and fish. It is estimated that there may be found more than 120 species of fish and over 260 species of birds and more than fifty species of reptiles and eight amphibians.

====India====
As per the ISFR 2017 report, the total area of mangrove cover of India is 4921&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, (181&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; positively changed with respect to 2015 mangrove cover assessment)  which contributes 3.3% to the global mangrove cover.&lt;ref name="fsi.nic.in"&gt;http://fsi.nic.in/isfr2017/isfr-mangrove-cover-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The deltas of the [[Ganges]], [[Mahanadi River Delta|Mahanadi]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]], and [[Kaveri]] rivers contain mangrove forests.

====Indo-Malaya Ecozone====
Mangroves occur on Asia's south coast, throughout the Indian subcontinent, in all [[Southeast Asia]]n countries, and on islands in the Indian Ocean, [[Persian gulf]], [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], [[South China Sea]], [[East China Sea]] and the Pacific.

The mangal is particularly prevalent in the deltas of large Asian rivers. The [[Sundarbans]] is the largest mangrove forest in the world, located in the Ganges River delta in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]], [[India]].

The Pichavaram mangroves in [[Tamil Nadu]] is India's one of the largest mangrove forests. The [[Bhitarkanika Mangroves]] Forest of Odisha, by the Bay of Bengal, is India's second largest mangrove forest.{{Citation needed|reason=claim|date=September 2014}} Other major mangals occur on the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] and the [[Gulf of Kutch]] in Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mangroveindia.org/ Mangroves of India] – URL retrieved November 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vietnam]], mangrove forests grow along the southern coast, including two forests: the [[Can Gio Mangrove Forest]] [[biosphere reserve]] and the [[U Minh Thuong National Park|U Minh mangrove forest]] in the sea and coastal region of [[Kiên Giang Province|Kiên Giang]], [[Cà Mau Province|Cà Mau]] and [[Bạc Liêu Province|Bạc Liêu]] provinces.

The mangrove forests of Kompong Sammaki in [[Cambodia]] are of major ecological and cultural importance, as the human population relies heavily on the crabs and fish that live in the roots.

The three most important mangrove forests of [[Taiwan]] are: [[Tamsui River]] in Taipei, Jhonggang River in Miaoli and the [[Sihcao Wetlands]] in [[Tainan]]. According to research, four main types of mangrove exist in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fan |first1=K.C. |title=Mangroves in Taiwan: current status and restoration projects. |url=http://bft.cirad.fr/cd/BFT_273_43-54.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some places have been developed as scenic areas, such as the [[Timber rafting|log raft]] routes in Sihcao.

=====Indonesia=====
In the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]], mangroves occur around much of [[Western New Guinea|Papua province]], [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and the surrounding islands. Further north, they are found along the coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Indonesia has around 9.36 million hectares of mangrove forests, but 48% is categorized as 'moderately damaged' and 23% as 'badly damaged'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/07/71-indonesian-mangrove-forests-damaged-minister.html |title=71% of Indonesian mangrove forests damaged: minister |work=The Jakarta Post |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118061854/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/07/71-indonesian-mangrove-forests-damaged-minister.html |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
[[File:GWR 2013- Certificate.jpg|thumb|upright|The Guinness World Record certificate of achievement to Sindh Forest Department, Govt of Sindh, Pakistan]]
Pakistani mangroves are located mainly along the [[Indus River Delta|delta]] of the [[Indus River]] (the [[Indus River Delta-Arabian Sea mangroves]] [[ecoregion]]). Major mangrove forests are found on the coastline of the provinces of [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]].

In [[Karachi]], land reclamation projects have led to the cutting down of mangrove forests for commercial and urban development. On 22 June 2013, Sindh Forest Department, Govt. of Sindh, Pakistan, with the help of 300 local coastal volunteer planters set the Guinness World Record by planting 847,250 mangrove saplings at Kharo Chan, Thatta, Sindh, Pakistan in a little over 12 hours. This is the highest number of saplings planted within a day under the Guinness World Record category of "Maximum Number of Trees Planted in a Day".

Sindh Forest Department, Government of Sindh Mangrove has played pioneer role for the conservation and protection of the mangroves in the Indus Delta since late 1950s when it was handed over the areas. A breakthrough success is the re-introduction of ''[[Rhizophora mucronata]]'' into the Indus Delta, which had become extinct there. More recently, a threatened mangrove shrub, ''[[Ceriops tagal]]'', has also been successfully re-introduced. A third species, ''[[Aegiceras corniculatum]]'', is under trials at the nursery stage.

A gigantic initiative is under in the Sindh, Pakistan, to rehabilitate the degraded and blank mangrove mudflats. Since 2010 alone, around 55,000 Hectares of such area has been planted and rehabilitated. During this period, through concerted efforts and a rigorous conservation policy adopted by the Sindh Forest Department, Govt. of Sindh and the federal govt. a mangrove resource base of 150,000 plus Hectares has been created, with the support of local coastal communities. International organizations like IUCN and WWF are also playing critical role to support this initiative of the government. Other achievements include: (1) Declaring all the mangrove forests in the Indus Delta as Protected Forests in December 2010; Constitution of a Mangrove Conservation Committee at the provincial level which includes all stakeholders as members and overall awareness of the importance of mangroves and its ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Mangrove Planting"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pakagri.blogspot.com/2013/06/by-planting-750000-mangroves-pakistan.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130624220628/http://pakagri.blogspot.com/2013/06/by-planting-750000-mangroves-pakistan.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 June 2013 | title=By planting 750,000 mangroves, Pakistan claims new world record.  | date=22 June 2013 | publisher=[[Express Tribune]] |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
Mangrove forests are present in [[Iran]] between 25°11′N to 27°52′N, in the northern parts of the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Sea of Oman]]. Pockets of the biome extend (from southwest to southeast) along the shores of the maritime provinces [[Bushehr]], [[Hormozgan]], and [[Sistan and Balouchestan]].

Forests on and near the island of [[Qeshm]] in the Persian Gulf are dominated by the species ''[[Avicennia marina]]'', known locally as the "hara" or "harra" tree, and cover an area of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km by 20&amp;nbsp;km. This area is protected as the UNESCO [[Mangrove forests of Qeshm|Hara Biosphere Reserve]], where commercial use is restricted to fishing (mainly [[shrimp]]), tourist boat trips, and limited mangrove cutting for animal feed.

====Middle East====
Oman, near Muscat, supports large areas of mangroves, in particular at Shinas, Qurm Park and Mahout Island. In Arabic, mangrove trees are known as ''qurm'', thus the mangrove area in Oman is known as Qurm Park. A small mangrove area is present in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Mangroves are also present extensively in neighbouring Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Rouphael, Tony ;Turak, Emre and Brodie, Jon (1992) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090919204110/http://www.actfr.jcu.edu.au/idc/groups/public/documents/journal_article/jcudev_015628.pdf "Chapter 3: Seagrasses and Mangroves of Yemen's Red Sea"] In DouAbal, A. et al. (editors) (1992) ''Protection of Marine Ecosystems of the Red Sea Coast of Yemen'' Global Environment Facility, United Nations Development Programme, New York, pp. 41–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangrove is also widely seen in Tarut Island, east of Qatif in Saudi Arabia. In addition, large forest of mangrove surround the coast to the south of Qatif (Siahat Beach). Nonetheless, because of sea land re-claiming the mangrove is being cut down which makes lots of sea fish losses their natural habitats.

The mangrove forests that cover thousands of hectares of land along the UAE shoreline form an integral part of its coastal ecosystem. The [[Environment Agency Abu Dhabi|Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD)]] is currently working on rehabilitation, conservation and protection of mangrove forests in seven key sites in Abu Dhabi including: Saadiyat Island, Jubail Island, Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve (which also comprises famous Bu Tinah Island), Bu Syayeef Protected Area, Ras Gharab, the Eastern Corniche and Ras Ghanada.

====New Zealand====
[[New Zealand]] also has mangrove forests extending to around 38°S (similar to Australia's latitudinal limit): the southernmost examples are at [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan Harbour]] (37°48′S) on the west coast and Ohiwa Harbour (near [[Opotiki]], 38°00′S) on the east coast.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
''[[Avicennia marina]] australasica'' is the only mangrove in New Zealand.

Adequate data are only available for about half of the global area of mangroves. However, of those areas for which data has been collected, it appears that 35% of the mangroves have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) ''Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Synthesis'' (p.2) Island Press, Washington, DC.

Grassroots efforts to save mangroves from development are becoming more popular as their benefits become more widely known. In the [[Bahamas]], for example, active efforts to save mangroves are occurring on the islands of [[Bimini]] and [[Great Guana Cay]]. In [[Trinidad and Tobago]] as well, efforts are underway to protect a mangrove threatened by the construction of a steelmill and a port.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In Thailand, community management has been effective in restoring damaged mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/thailand-mangrove-restoration-community-management.html |title=Thailand – Trang Province – Taking Back the Mangroves with Community Management &amp;#124; The EcoTipping Points Project |publisher=Ecotippingpoints.org |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within northern Ecuador mangrove regrowth is reported in almost all estuaries and stems primarily from local actors responding to earlier periods of deforestation in the Esmeraldas region.&lt;ref name="mingaonline.uach.cl"/&gt;

Mangroves have been reported to be able to help buffer against [[tsunami]], [[cyclone]]s, and other storms. One village in [[Tamil Nadu]] was protected from tsunami destruction—the villagers in [[Naluvedapathy]] planted 80,244 saplings to get into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. This created a kilometre-wide belt of trees of various varieties. When the tsunami struck, much of the land around the village was flooded, but the village itself suffered minimal damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treecouncil.org.uk |title=Tree News, Spring/Summer 2005, Publisher Felix Press |publisher=Treecouncil.org.uk |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforestation==
[[File:Mangroves of Bohol.png|thumb|Mangroves in [[Bohol]], Philippines.]]

In some areas, mangrove reforestation and [[mangrove restoration]] is also underway. Red mangroves are the most common choice for cultivation, used particularly in [[marine aquariums]] in a [[sump]] to reduce [[nitrates]] and other [[nutrients]] in the water. Mangroves also appear in home [[aquariums]], and as ornamental plants, such as in [[Japan]].

In Senegal, [[Haïdar El Ali]] has started the {{Il|fr|Oceanium de Dakar}} project, which (amongst others) focuses on reforesting several areas with mangroves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanium.blogspot.com/ |title=Oceanium de Dakar |publisher=Oceanium.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-26 |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manzanar Mangrove Initiative is an ongoing experiment in [[Arkiko]], [[Eritrea]], part of the Manzanar Project founded by [[Gordon H. Sato]], establishing new mangrove plantations on the coastal [[mudflat]]s. Initial plantings failed, but observation of the areas where mangroves did survive by themselves led to the conclusion that nutrients in water flow from inland were important to the health of the mangroves. Trials with the Eritrean Ministry of Fisheries followed, and a planting system was designed to provide the nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron missing from seawater.&lt;ref name="NatGeo2007-02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SocWetlandSci"/&gt;

The propagules are planted inside a reused galvanized steel can with the bottom knocked out; a small piece of iron and a pierced plastic bag with fertilizer containing nitrogen and phosphorus are buried with the propagule. {{As of|2007}}, after six years of planting, 700,000 mangroves are growing; providing stock feed for sheep and habitat for oysters, crabs, other bivalves, and fish.&lt;ref name="NatGeo2007-02"&gt;{{cite web

==National studies==
In terms of local and national studies of mangrove loss, the case of Belize's mangroves is illustrative in its contrast to the global picture. A recent, satellite-based study&lt;ref name="maps.cathalac.org"/&gt;—funded by the World Wildlife Fund and conducted by the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC)—indicates Belize's mangrove cover declined by a mere 2% over a 30-year period. The study was born out of the need to verify the popular conception that mangrove clearing in Belize was rampant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ambergriscaye.com/pages/town/art/Pelican_Review.pdf |title=Pelican_Cays_Review |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the assessment showed, between 1980 and 2010, under {{convert|4,000|acre|km2}} of mangroves had been cleared, although clearing of mangroves near Belize's main coastal settlements (e.g. [[Belize City]] and San Pedro) was relatively high. The rate of loss of Belize's mangroves—at 0.07% per year between 1980 and 2010—was much lower than Belize's overall rate of forest clearing (0.6% per year in the same period).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servir.net/servir_bz_forest_cover_1980-2010.pdf Cherrington, E.A., Ek, E., Cho, P., Howell, B.F., Hernandez, B.E., Anderson, E.R., Flores, A.I., Garcia, B.C., Sempris, E., and D.E.

A '''marine chemist''' is an [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]], [[occupational safety and health]] professional who is a trained professional who is responsible for ensuring that repair and construction of marine vessels can be made in safety whenever those repairs might result in fire, explosion, or exposure toxic vapors or chemicals. By virtue of his or her training, experience, and education, the Marine Chemist is uniquely qualified as a specialist in confined space safety and atmospheric sampling or monitoring. 

Why do we need Marine Chemist? Lets take a moment to examine that question. Basic ship design... open decks and enclosed spaces for cargoes... has remained basically unchanged for decades. Structural materials and methods have changed, but in principle, the basic design concept has been the same for centuries. Today's cargoes, however, have shifted to a greater number of toxic substances. That has added the health concern of toxicity to the existing safety concerns of fire and explosion, not just during a voyage, but even when a vessel is in a shipyard for routine maintenance and repair.

In 1963, the National Fire Protection Association [[National Fire Protection Association]] assumed jurisdiction over the Marine Chemist program. The NFPA continues to oversee the profession which is based on the NFPA Standard 306: Standard for Control of Gas Hazards on Vessels.

National Communication reports are often several hundred pages long and represent the most standardized and comparable documents on the climate policies of different countries. The [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions|(Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions]] (NDCs) that form the basis of the Paris Agreement are shorter and less specific about how reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contributions|date=2018-04-28|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contributions&amp;oldid=838683547|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Communications are therefore the key documents on the climate policies of the world's countries.

Although President Donald Trump has [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|declared that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement]], this cannot be effectuated until the day after the 2020 presidential election in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|date=2018-09-28|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement&amp;oldid=861612921|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, the United States will be obliged to continue reporting under the Paris Agreement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31935">In [[theoretical physics]], '''negative mass''' is matter whose [[mass]] is of opposite sign to the mass of normal matter, e.g. −1&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/negative-mass-object-washington-state-physics-isaac-newton-upside-down-a7693701.html "Scientists observe liquid with 'negative mass', which turns physics completely upside down"], ''The Independent'', April 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fluid-negative-mass-1.4073937 "Scientists create fluid that seems to defy physics:'Negative mass' reacts opposite to any known physical property we know"], ''CBC'', April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Such matter would violate one or more [[energy condition]]s and show some strange properties, stemming from the ambiguity as to whether attraction should refer to force or the oppositely oriented acceleration for negative mass. It is used in certain speculative [[hypothesis]], such as on the construction of traversable [[wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Initially, the closest known real representative of such exotic matter is a region of [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] density produced by the [[Casimir effect]].

[[General relativity]] describes [[gravity]] and the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] for both positive and [[negative energy]] particles, hence negative mass, but does not include the other [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]]. On the other hand, the [[Standard Model]] describes [[elementary particle]]s and the other fundamental forces, but it does not include gravity. A unified theory that explicitly includes gravity along with the other fundamental forces may be needed for a better understanding of the concept of negative mass.

==In general relativity==
Negative mass is any region of space in which for some observers the mass density is measured to be negative. This could occur due to a region of space in which the stress component of the Einstein [[stress–energy tensor]] is larger in magnitude than the mass density. All of these are violations of one or another variant of the positive [[energy condition]] of Einstein's general theory of relativity; however, the positive energy condition is not a required condition for the mathematical consistency of the theory.

===Inertial versus gravitational mass===

Ever since [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] first formulated his theory of [[gravity]], there have been at least three conceptually distinct quantities called [[mass]]:
*[[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass ''m'' that appears in Newton's second law of motion, '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;thinsp;'''a'''
*“active” [[gravitational mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass that produces a gravitational field that other masses respond to 
*“passive” gravitational mass &amp;ndash; the mass that responds to an external gravitational field by accelerating.

Einstein’s [[equivalence principle]] postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass. The law of [[Momentum|conservation of momentum]] requires that active and passive gravitational mass be identical. All experimental evidence to date has found these are, indeed, always the same. In considering negative mass, it is important to consider which of these concepts of mass are negative. In most analyses of negative mass, it is assumed that the equivalence principle and conservation of momentum continue to apply, and therefore all three forms of mass are still the same.

In his 4th-prize essay for the 1951 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition, [[Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger]] considered the possibility of negative mass and how it would behave under gravitational and other forces.&lt;ref name="Luttinger 1951"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luttinger |first=J. M. |year=1951 |title=On "Negative" mass in the theory of gravitation |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5852e579be659442a01f27b8/t/5873dc04d1758eea4b41c720/1483987972731/luttinger.pdf |journal=Awards for Essays on Gravitation |publisher=Gravity Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, following Luttinger's idea, [[Hermann Bondi]] suggested in a paper in ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' that mass might be negative as well as positive.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.423 |title=Negative Mass in General Relativity |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=423 |year=1957 |last1=Bondi |first1=H. |bibcode=1957RvMP...29..423B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that this does not entail a logical contradiction, as long as all three forms of mass are negative, but that the assumption of negative mass involves some counter-intuitive form of motion. For example, an object with negative inertial mass would be expected to accelerate in the opposite direction to that in which it was pushed (non-gravitationally).

There have been several other analyses of negative mass, such as the studies conducted by R. M. Price,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=R. M.|title=Negative mass can be positively amusing|journal=Am. J. Phys.|date=1993|volume=61|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1119/1.17293 |url=http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ccline/courses/resources/wp/pdf/AJP000216.pdf|bibcode = 1993AmJPh..61..216P }}&lt;/ref&gt; however none addressed the question of what kind of energy and momentum would be necessary to describe non-singular negative mass. Indeed, the Schwarzschild solution for negative mass parameter has a naked singularity at a fixed spatial position. The question that immediately comes up is, would it not be possible to smooth out the singularity with some kind of negative mass density. The answer is yes, but not with energy and momentum that satisfies the [[Energy condition#Dominant energy condition|dominant energy condition]]. This is because if the energy and momentum satisfies the dominant energy condition within a spacetime that is asymptotically flat, which would be the case of smoothing out the singular negative mass Schwarzschild solution, then it must satisfy the positive energy theorem, i.e. its [[ADM formalism|ADM mass]] must be positive, which is of course not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shoen|first1=R.|last2=Yao|first2=S.-T.|title=On the proof of the positive mass conjecture in general relativity|journal=Commun. Math. Phys.|date=1979|volume=65|pages=45–76 |url=http://www.doctoryau.com/papers/PositiveMassConjecture.pdf|bibcode = 1979CMaPh..65...45S |doi = 10.1007/BF01940959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witten|first1=Edward|title=A new proof of the positive energy theorem|journal=Comm.

===Runaway motion===
Although no particles are known to have negative mass, physicists (primarily [[Hermann Bondi]] in 1957,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; [[William B.

Forward]]&lt;ref name="Forward 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2514/3.23219| title = Negative matter propulsion| journal = Journal of Propulsion and Power| volume = 6| pages = 28| year = 1990| last1 = Forward | first1 = R. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have been able to describe some of the anticipated properties such particles may have. Assuming that all three concepts of mass are equivalent the gravitational interactions between masses of arbitrary sign can be explored, based on the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[equivalence principle]]:

* Positive mass attracts both other positive masses and negative masses.
* Negative mass repels  both other negative masses and positive masses.

For two positive masses, nothing changes and there is a gravitational pull on each other causing an attraction. Two negative masses would repel because of their negative inertial masses. For different signs however, there is a push that repels the positive mass from the negative mass, and a pull that attracts the negative mass towards the positive one at the same time.

Hence Bondi pointed out that two objects of equal and opposite mass would produce a constant acceleration of the system towards the positive-mass object,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; an effect called "runaway motion" by Bonnor who disregarded its physical existence, stating: 
{{Centered pull quote
 |I regard the runaway (or self-accelerating) motion […] so preposterous that I prefer to rule it out by supposing that inertial mass is all positive or all negative.
|author= William B. Bonnor
|source=in ''Negative mass in general relativity''.&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;}}

Such a couple of objects would accelerate without limit (except relativistic one); however, the total mass, momentum and energy of the system would remain 0.

This behavior is completely inconsistent with a common-sense approach and the expected behaviour of 'normal' matter; but is completely mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or [[conservation of energy|energy]]. If the masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, then the momentum of the system remains zero if they both travel together and accelerate together, no matter what their speed:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{sys} = mv + (-m)v = \big(m+(-m)\big)v = 0\times v = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

And equivalently for the [[kinetic energy]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{k,sys} = \tfrac12 mv^2 + \tfrac12(-m)v^2 = \tfrac12\big(m+(-m)\big)v^2 = \tfrac12(0)v^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

However, this is perhaps not exactly valid if the energy in the gravitational field is taken into account.

Forward extended Bondi's analysis to additional cases, and showed that even if the two masses {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(−)&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(+)&lt;/sup&gt;}} are not the same, the conservation laws remain unbroken. This is true even when relativistic effects are considered, so long as inertial mass, not rest mass, is equal to gravitational mass.

This behaviour can produce bizarre results: for instance, a gas containing a mixture of positive and negative matter particles will have the positive matter portion increase in [[temperature]] without bound. However, the negative matter portion gains negative temperature at the same rate, again balancing out. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] pointed out other implications of Forward's analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=G.|last= Landis|title=Comments on Negative Mass Propulsion|journal=J. Propulsion and Power|volume= 7|issue= 2|pages= 304 |year=1991|doi=10.2514/3.23327}}&lt;/ref&gt; including noting that although negative mass particles would repel each other gravitationally, the [[electrostatic force]] would be attractive for like [[charge (physics)|charges]] and repulsive for opposite charges.

Forward used the properties of negative-mass matter to create the concept of diametric drive, a design for [[spacecraft propulsion]] using negative mass that requires no energy input and no [[Working mass|reaction mass]] to achieve arbitrarily high acceleration.

Forward also coined a term, "nullification", to describe what happens when ordinary matter and negative matter meet: they are expected to be able to cancel out or nullify each other's existence. An interaction between equal quantities of positive mass matter (hence of positive energy {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and negative mass matter (of negative energy {{math|−''E'' {{=}} −''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) would release no energy, but because the only configuration of such particles that has zero momentum (both particles moving with the same velocity in the same direction) does not produce a collision, all such interactions would leave a surplus of momentum, which is classically forbidden. So once this runaway phenomenon has been revealed, the [[scientific community]] considered negative mass could not exist in the universe.

===Arrow of time and energy inversion===
In 1970, [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] demonstrated, through the complete [[Poincaré group]] of dynamic [[group theory]], that reversing the energy of a particle (hence its mass, if the particle has one) is equal to reversing its [[arrow of time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |date=1970 |title=Structure des Systèmes Dynamiques |trans-title=Structure of Dynamic Systems |url=http://www.jmsouriau.com/structure_des_systemes_dynamiques.htm |location=Paris |publisher=Dunod |page=199 |language=French |issn=0750-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |title=Structure of Dynamical Systems |chapter=A mechanistic description of elementary particles: Inversions of space and time |location=Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-4612-6692-1 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0281-3_14 |url=http://ayuba.fr/souriau/Souriau-time-energy-mass-inversion.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe according to [[general relativity]] is a [[Riemannian manifold]] associated to a [[metric tensor]] solution of Einstein’s field equations. In such a framework, the runaway motion prevents the existence of negative matter.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;

Some [[bimetric theory|bimetric theories]] of the universe propose that two [[multiverse|parallel universes]] instead of one may exist with an opposite arrow of time, linked together by the [[Big Bang]] and interacting only through [[gravitation]].&lt;ref name="Sakharov 1980"&gt;A.D.

According to group theory, the matter of the [[Topological conjugacy|conjugated]] metric would appear to the matter of the other metric as having opposite mass and arrow of time (though its [[proper time]] would remain positive). The coupled metrics have their own [[geodesic]]s and are solutions of two coupled field equations:&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10509-014-2106-5 |title=Negative mass hypothesis in cosmology and the nature of dark energy |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=354 |issue=2 |pages=611 |year=2014 |last1=Petit |first1=J.

The [[Post-Newtonian expansion|Newtonian approximation]] then provides the following interaction laws:
* Positive mass attracts positive mass.
* Negative mass attracts negative mass.
* Positive mass and negative mass repel each other.
Those laws are different to the laws described by Bondi and Bonnor, and solve the runaway paradox. The negative matter of the coupled metric, interacting with the matter of the other metric via gravity, could be an alternative candidate for the explanation of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]] and [[accelerating universe]].&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petit 2014b" /&gt;

===In Gauss's law of gravity===
In [[electromagnetism]] one can derive the energy density of a field from [[Gauss's law]], assuming the curl of the field is 0. Performing the same calculation using [[Gauss's law for gravity]] produces a negative energy density for a gravitational field.

===Gravitational interaction of antimatter===
{{Main|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}
The overwhelming consensus among physicists is that [[antimatter]] has positive mass and should be affected by gravity just like normal matter. Direct experiments on neutral [[antihydrogen]] have not been sensitive enough to detect any difference between the gravitational interaction of antimatter, compared to normal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms2787 |pmid=23653197 |pmc=3644108 |title=Description and first application of a new technique to measure the gravitational mass of antihydrogen |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |pages=1785 |year=2013 |last1=Amole |first1=C. |last2=Ashkezari |first2=M.

[[Bubble chamber]] experiments provide further evidence that antiparticles have the same inertial mass as their normal counterparts. In these experiments, the chamber is subjected to a constant magnetic field that causes charged particles to travel in [[Helix|helical]] paths, the radius and direction of which correspond to the ratio of electric charge to inertial mass. Particle–antiparticle pairs are seen to travel in helices with opposite directions but identical radii, implying that the ratios differ only in sign; but this does not indicate whether it is the charge or the inertial mass that is inverted. However, particle–antiparticle pairs are observed to electrically attract one another. This behavior implies that both have positive inertial mass and opposite charges; if the reverse were true, then the particle with positive inertial mass would be repelled from its antiparticle partner.

==Experimentation==
Physicist Peter Engels and a team of colleagues at [[Washington State University]] claimed to have observed negative mass behavior in rubidium atoms. On 10 April 2017 Engels team created negative "effective" mass by reducing the temperature of rubidium atoms to near [[absolute zero]], generating a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. By using a laser-trap, the team were able to reverse the spin of some of the rubidium atoms in this state, and observed that once released from the trap, the atoms expanded and displayed properties of negative mass, in particular accelerating towards a pushing force instead of away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39642992|title=Physicists observe 'negative mass'|date=2017-04-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301 |pmid=28452531 |title=Negative-Mass Hydrodynamics in a Spin-Orbit–coupled Bose–Einstein Condensate |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=118 |issue=15 |pages=155301 |year=2017 |last1=Khamehchi |first1=M. A. |last2=Hossain |first2=Khalid |last3=Mossman |first3=M. E. |last4=Zhang |first4=Yongping |last5=Busch |first5=Th. |last6=Forbes |first6=Michael Mcneil |last7=Engels |first7=P. |bibcode=2017PhRvL.118o5301K |arxiv=1612.04055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This kind of negative effective mass is analogous to the well-known apparent negative effective mass of electrons in the upper part of the dispersion bands in solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=N. W.|last2=Mermin|first2=N. D.|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Saunders College|location=Philadelphia|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither case is negative mass for the purposes of the [[stress–energy tensor]].

Some recent work with [[metamaterial]]s suggests that some as-yet-undiscovered composite of superconductors, metamaterials and normal matter could exhibit signs of negative effective mass in much the same way as low temperature alloys melt at below the melting point of their components or some semiconductors have negative differential resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2014.10.036 |title=Novel negative mass density resonant metamaterial unit cell |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=379 |pages=33 |year=2015 |last1=Cselyuszka |first1=Norbert |last2=Sečujski |first2=Milan |last3=Crnojević-Bengin |first3=Vesna |bibcode=2015PhLA..379...33C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In quantum mechanics==
In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]]'s theory of [[elementary particle]]s, now part of the [[Standard Model]], already included negative solutions.&lt;ref name="Dirac 1928"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0023 |title=The Quantum Theory of the Electron |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |volume=117 |issue=778 |pages=610 |year=1928 |last1=Dirac |first1=P. A. M. |bibcode=1928RSPSA.117..610D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Standard Model]] is a generalization of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and negative mass is already built into the theory.

[[Mike Morris (physicist)|Morris]], [[Kip Thorne|Thorne]] and Yurtsever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 |pmid=10038800 |title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1446–1449 |year=1988 |last1=Morris |first1=Michael S. |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |last3=Yurtsever |first3=Ulvi |bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the quantum mechanics of the [[Casimir effect]] can be used to produce a locally mass-negative region of space–time. In this article, and subsequent work by others, they showed that negative matter could be used to stabilize a [[wormhole]]. Cramer ''et al.'' argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by negative-mass loops of [[cosmic string]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/9409051 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.51.3117 |title=Natural wormholes as gravitational lenses |journal=Physical Review D |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=3117 |year=1995 |last1=Cramer |first1=John G. |last2=Forward |first2=Robert L. |last3=Morris |first3=Michael S. |last4=Visser |first4=Matt |last5=Benford |first5=Gregory |last6=Landis |first6=Geoffrey A. |bibcode=1995PhRvD..51.3117C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] has proved that [[negative energy]] is a necessary condition for the creation of a [[closed timelike curve]] by manipulation of gravitational fields within a finite region of space;&lt;ref name="futureofspacetime"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hawking | first = Stephen | title = The Future of Spacetime | publisher = W. W. Norton |year= 2002 | pages = 96 | isbn = 0-393-02022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this proves, for example, that a finite [[Tipler cylinder]] cannot be used as a [[Time travel|time machine]].

===Schrödinger equation===
For energy eigenstates of the [[Schrödinger equation]], the wavefunction is wavelike wherever the particle's energy is greater than the local potential, and exponential-like (evanescent) wherever it is less. Naively, this would imply kinetic energy is negative in evanescent regions (to cancel the local potential). However, kinetic energy is an operator in [[quantum mechanics]], and its expectation value is always positive, summing with the expectation value of the potential energy to yield the energy eigenvalue.

For wavefunctions of particles with zero rest mass (such as [[photon]]s), this means that any evanescent portions of the wavefunction would be associated with a local negative mass–energy. However, the Schrödinger equation does not apply to massless particles; instead the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] is required.

==In special relativity==
{{See also|Exotic matter|Faster-than-light}}
One can achieve a negative mass independent of [[negative energy]]. According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], mass {{mvar|m}} is in proportion to energy {{mvar|E}} and the coefficient of proportionality is {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Actually, {{mvar|m}} is still equivalent to {{mvar|E}} although the coefficient is another constant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Wang, Z.Y, Wang P.Y, Xu Y.R.| date=2011 | title=Crucial experiment to resolve Abraham–Minkowski Controversy | journal=Optik | volume=122 | pages=1994–1996 | doi=10.1016/j.ijleo.2010.12.018 | issue= 22| bibcode=2011Optik.122.1994W | arxiv=1103.3559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as {{math|−''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a [[negative energy]] because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E&amp;=-mc^2&gt;0 \\
m&amp;= -\frac{E}{c^2}&lt;0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Under the circumstances,

:&lt;math&gt;dE=F\,ds=\frac{dp}{dt}\,ds=\frac{ds}{dt}\,dp=v\,dp=v\,d(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

and so,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-c^2\,dm&amp;=v\,d(mv) \\
-c^2(2m)\,dm&amp;=2mv\,d(mv) \\
-c^2\,d(m^2)&amp;=d(m^2v^2) \\
-m^2c^2&amp;=m^2v^2+C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When {{math|''v'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt;C=-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-m^2c^2&amp;=m^2v^2-m_0^2c^2 \\
m&amp;=\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}} is [[invariant mass]] and [[invariant energy]] equals {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}}. The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable.

From the above relation,

:&lt;math&gt;p=mv= \frac{m_0 v}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[negative momentum]] is applied to explain [[negative refraction]], the [[inverse Doppler effect]] and the [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] observed in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is also negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V.

[[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressure]] exists in [[dark energy]] too. Using these above equations, the [[energy–momentum relation]] should be

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Planck–Einstein relation]] {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''ħω''}} and [[de Broglie]]'s {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, we obtain the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_\mathrm{p}^2\,, \quad \left(E_0=\hbar\omega_\mathrm{p}=-m_0c^2&gt;0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the wave consists of a stream of particles whose [[energy–momentum relation]] is &lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt; ([[wave–particle duality]]) and can be excited in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The velocity of such a particle is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and range is from zero to infinity

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&lt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&lt;c \\
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&gt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&gt;c
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[kinetic energy]] is also negative

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_\mathrm{k} &amp;= E-E_0 \\
&amp;=-mc^2-\left(-m_0 c^2\right) \\
&amp;=-\frac{m_0c^2}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} + m_0 c^2 \\
&amp;= m_0 c^2 \left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\right)&lt;0\,, \quad \left(\mbox{where }m_0&lt;0\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, [[negative kinetic energy]] exists in some models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Caldwell|first=R. R.|title=A phantom menace?

A '''nutrient cycle''' (or '''ecological recycling''') is the movement and exchange of [[organic matter|organic]] and [[inorganic]] matter back into the [[Productivity (ecology)|production]] of matter. Energy flow is a unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of [[mineral nutrients]] is cyclic. Mineral cycles include the [[carbon cycle]], [[sulfur cycle]], [[nitrogen cycle]], [[water cycle]], [[phosphorus cycle]], [[oxygen cycle]], among others that continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into [[Productivity (ecology)|productive]] ecological nutrition.

[[File:Nutrient cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|A nutrient cycle of a typical terrestrial ecosystem.]]

There is much overlap between the terms for the [[biogeochemical cycle]] and nutrient cycle. Most textbooks integrate the two and seem to treat them as synonymous terms.&lt;ref name="Levin09"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levin|first1=Simon A|last2=Carpenter|first2=Stephen R|last3=Godfray|first3=Charles J|last4=Kinzig|first4=Ann P|last5=Loreau|first5=Michel|last6=Losos|first6=Jonathan B|last7=Walker|first7=Brian|last8=Wilcove|first8=David S|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|date=27 July 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12839-9|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MS-vfT89QMC&amp;pg=PA330 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms often appear independently. Nutrient cycle is more often used in direct reference to the idea of an intra-system cycle, where an ecosystem functions as a unit. From a practical point, it does not make sense to assess a terrestrial ecosystem by considering the full column of air above it as well as the great depths of Earth below it. While an ecosystem often has no clear boundary, as a working model it is practical to consider the functional community where the bulk of matter and energy transfer occurs.&lt;ref name="Bormann67"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bormann | first1=F.

Ecosystems are capable of complete recycling. Complete recycling means that 100% of the waste material can be reconstituted indefinitely. This idea was captured by [[Howard T. Odum]] when he penned that "it is thoroughly demonstrated by ecological systems and geological systems that all the chemical elements and many organic substances can be accumulated by living systems from background crustal or oceanic concentrations without limit as to concentration so long as there is available solar or another source of potential energy"&lt;ref name="Odum91"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=H.

Ecosystems execute closed loop recycling where demand for the nutrients that adds to the growth of [[biomass]] exceeds supply within that system. There are regional and spatial differences in the rates of growth and exchange of materials, where some ecosystems may be in nutrient debt (sinks) where others will have extra supply (sources). These differences relate to climate, topography, and geological history leaving behind different sources of parent material.&lt;ref name="Bormann67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="van Noordwijk99"&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | title=Nutrient cycles and nutrient budgets in global agro-ecosystems | editor1-last=Smaling | editor1-first=E. | editor2-last=Oenema | editor2-first=O. | editor3-last=Fresco | editor3-first=L. | chapter=Nutrient cycling in ecosystems versus nutrient budgets in agricultural systems | pages=1–26 | place=Wallingford, UK | publisher=CAB International | url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Publications/files/bookchapter/BC0104-04/BC0104-04-1.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of a food web, a cycle or loop is defined as "a directed sequence of one or more links starting from, and ending at, the same species."&lt;ref name="Cohen89"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Roughgarden | editor1-first=J. | editor2-last=May | editor2-first=R.

A large fraction of the elements composing living matter reside at any instant of time in the world’s biota. Because the earthly pool of these elements is limited and the rates of exchange among the various components of the biota are extremely fast with respect to geological time, it is quite evident that much of the same material is being incorporated again and again into different biological forms.

These activities transport nutrients into the [[soil|mineral layers of soil]]. Worms discard wastes that create [[worm castings]] containing undigested materials where bacteria and other decomposers gain access to the nutrients. The earthworm is employed in this process and the production of the ecosystem depends on their capability to create feedback loops in the recycling process.&lt;ref name="Barot06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barot | first1=S. | last2=Ugolini | first2=A. | last3=Brikci | first3=F.

[[Shellfish]] are also ecosystem engineers because they: 1) Filter suspended particles from the water column; 2) Remove excess nutrients from coastal bays through [[denitrification]]; 3) Serve as natural coastal buffers, absorbing wave energy and reducing erosion from boat wakes, sea level rise and storms; 4) Provide nursery habitat for fish that are valuable to coastal economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/oceanscoasts/howwework/shellfish-habitat.xml? |title=Oceans and Coasts Shellfish Reefs at Risk: Critical Marine Habitats |author=[[The Nature Conservancy]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004110843/http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/oceanscoasts/howwework/shellfish-habitat.xml |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nutrient cycling has a historical foothold in the writings of [[Charles Darwin]] in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms. Darwin wrote about "the continued Following the Greeks, the idea of a hydrological cycle (water is considered a nutrient) was validated and quantified by [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] in 1687.

===Variations in terminology===
In 1926 [[Vladimir Vernadsky|Vernadsky]] coined the term '''[[biogeochemistry]]''' as a sub-discipline of [[geochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Gorham91"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gorham | first1=E. | title=Biogeochemistry: Its origins and development | journal=Biogeochemistry | volume=13 | issue=3 | pages=199–239 | year=1991 | url=http://www.soils.wisc.edu/soils/courses/451/01.%20Gorham%201991.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00002942}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term '''nutrient cycle''' pre-dates biogeochemistry in a pamphlet on silviculture in 1899: "These demands by no means pass over the fact that at places where sufficient quantities of humus are available and where, in case of continuous decomposition of litter, a stable, nutrient humus is present, considerable quantities of nutrients are also available from the biogenic ''nutrient cycle'' for the standing timber.&lt;ref name="Silvilculture99"&gt;{{citation | title=Pamphlets on silviculture | volume=41 | year=1899 | publisher=The University of California | url=https://books.google.com/?id=2oc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22nutrient+cycle%22&amp;dq=%22nutrient+cycle%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} In 1898 there is a reference to the '''nitrogen cycle''' in relation to [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="RBGKew98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Springer on behalf of Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | title=The advances made in agricultural chemistry during the last twenty-five years | journal=Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (Royal Gardens, Kew) | volume=1898 | issue=144 | pages=326–331 | year=1898 | jstor=4120250 | doi=10.2307/4120250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses and variations on the terminology relating to the process of nutrient cycling appear throughout history:

*The term '''mineral cycle''' appears early in a 1935 in reference to the importance of minerals in [[plant physiology]]: "...ash is probably either built up into its permanent structure, or deposited in some way as waste in the cells, and so may not be free to re-enter the ''mineral cycle''."&lt;ref name="Penston35"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Penston | first=N.

*The term '''nutrient recycling''' appears in a 1964 paper on the food ecology of the wood stork: "While the periodic drying up and reflooding of the marshes creates special survival problems for organisms in the community, the fluctuating water levels favor rapid ''nutrient recycling'' and subsequent high rates of primary and secondary production"&lt;ref name="Kahl64"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kahl | first1=M.

*The term '''natural cycling''' appears in a 1968 paper on the transportation of leaf litter and its chemical elements for consideration in fisheries management: "Fluvial transport of tree litter from drainage basins is a factor in ''natural cycling'' of chemical elements and in degradation of the land."&lt;ref name="Slack68"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Slack | first1=K.

*The term '''ecological recycling''' appears in a 1968 publication on future applications of ecology for the creation of different modules designed for living in extreme environments, such as space or under sea: "For our basic requirement of recycling vital resources, the oceans provide much more frequent ''ecological recycling'' than the land area. Fish and other organic populations have higher growth rates, vegetation has less capricious weather problems for sea harvesting."&lt;ref name="McHale68"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McHale | first1=J. | title=Toward the future | journal=Design Quarterly | volume=72 | issue=72 | pages=3–31 | year=1968 | jstor=4047350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The term '''bio-recycling''' appears in a 1976 paper on the recycling of organic carbon in oceans: "Following the actualistic assumption, then, that biological activity is responsible for the source of dissolved organic material in the oceans, but is not important for its activities after death of the organisms and subsequent chemical changes which prevent its ''bio-recycling'', we can see no major difference in the behavior of dissolved organic matter between the prebiotic and post-biotic oceans."&lt;ref name="Nissenbaum76"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nissenbaum | first1=A. | title=Scavenging of soluble organic matter from the prebiotic oceans | journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres | volume=7 | issue=4 | pages=413–416 | doi=10.1007/BF00927936 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l37x7632v6767192/ | bibcode=1976OrLi....7..413N| year=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|414}}

Water is also a nutrient.&lt;ref name="Martina88"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Martina | first1=M. M. | last2=Hoff | first2=M.

A. B. | last2=Bras | first2=R.

However, authors tend to refer to natural, organic, ecological, or bio-recycling in reference to the work of nature, such as it is used in organic farming or ecological agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="Larsson10" /&gt;

'''Obsidian''' is a naturally occurring [[volcanic glass]] formed as an [[extrusive rock|extrusive]] [[igneous rock]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Rafferty (August 2011). Rocks. The Rosen Publishing Group. pp. 97–. {{ISBN|978-1-61530-492-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I-science I' 2006 Ed. Rex Bookstore, Inc. pp. 127–. {{ISBN|978-971-23-4399-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsidian is produced when [[felsic]] [[lava]] extruded from a [[volcano]] cools rapidly with minimal [[crystal growth]]. It is commonly found within the margins of [[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] lava flows known as obsidian flows, where the chemical composition (high [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] content) induces a high degree of [[viscosity]] and [[polymerization]] of the lava. The inhibition of [[atomic diffusion]] through this highly viscous and polymerized lava explains the lack of crystal growth. Obsidian is hard and [[Brittleness|brittle]] and therefore [[Fracture (mineralogy)#Conchoidal fracture|fractures]] with very sharp edges. In the past it was used to manufacture cutting and piercing tools and it has been used experimentally as surgical [[scalpel]] blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brian Cotterell|author2=Johan Kamminga|title=Mechanics of pre-industrial technology: an introduction to the mechanics of ancient and traditional material culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-xOM8y6Uc8C&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=9 September 2011|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42871-2|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrusive formation of obsidian may occur when felsic lava cools along the edges of a dike.

Obsidian is [[mineral]]-like, but not a true mineral because as a glass it is not [[crystal]]line; in addition, its composition is too variable to be classified as a mineral. It is sometimes classified as a [[mineraloid]].&lt;ref name="HandbookSoil"&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of Soil Sciences: Properties and Processes (Second Edition) | publisher=CRC Press | author=Pan Ming Huang, Yuncong Li, Malcolm E. Sumner (editors) | year=2012 | location=Boca Raton | pages=20–24 | isbn=978-1-4398-0306-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though obsidian is usually dark in color, similar to [[mafic]] rocks such as [[basalt]], obsidian's composition is extremely [[felsic]]. Obsidian consists mainly of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[silicon dioxide]]), usually 70% or more. Crystalline rocks with obsidian's composition include [[granite]] and [[rhyolite]]. Because obsidian is [[Metastability|metastable]] at the Earth's surface (over time the glass becomes fine-grained mineral crystals), no obsidian has been found that is older than [[Cretaceous]] age. This breakdown of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water. Having a low water content when newly formed, typically less than 1% water by weight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.em.gov.bc.ca/mining/GeolSurv/MetallicMinerals/MineralDepositProfiles/profiles/r12.htm |title=Perlite – Mineral Deposit Profiles |publisher=B.C.

Pure obsidian is usually dark in appearance, though the color varies depending on the presence of impurities. Iron and other transition elements may give the obsidian a dark brown to black color. Very few samples are nearly colorless. In some stones, the [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]] of small, white, radially clustered crystals of [[cristobalite]] in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern (''snowflake obsidian''). Obsidian may contain patterns of gas bubbles remaining from the lava flow, aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled. These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden sheen (''sheen obsidian''). An [[iridescence|iridescent]], rainbow-like sheen (''rainbow obsidian'') is caused by inclusions of [[magnetite]] [[nanoparticle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nadin |first=E. |year=2007 |title= The secret lives of minerals |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |issue=1 |pages=10-20 |url= http://www.its.caltech.edu/~chima/publications/Secret_Lives_of_Minerals.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithic analysis can be instrumental in understanding prehispanic groups in Mesoamerica. A careful analysis of obsidian in a culture or place can be of considerable use to reconstruct commerce, production, distribution and thereby understand economic, social and political aspects of a civilization.

[[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]ns' [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|use of obsidian]] was extensive and sophisticated; including carved and worked obsidian for [[tool]]s and decorative objects.  Mesoamericans also made a type of [[sword]] with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body. Called a ''[[macuahuitl]]'', the weapon was capable of inflicting terrible injuries, combining the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated weapon.

Native American people traded obsidian throughout the Americas. Each [[volcano]] and in some cases each volcanic eruption produces a distinguishable type of obsidian, making it possible for archaeologists to trace the origins of a particular artifact. Similar tracing techniques have allowed obsidian to be identified in Greece also as coming from [[Milos]], [[Nisyros]] or [[Gyali]], islands in the [[Aegean Sea]].

Obsidian can be used to make extremely sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type of [[glass knife]] made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for [[scalpel]] blades, although this is not approved by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use on humans.

Opponents of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] have accused the faith's followers of various political crimes, such as [[dual loyalty]] and being involved with foreign or hostile powers. These accusations (together with others with a more theological bent) are used to justify [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution of this religious minority]].&lt;ref name="ganea103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keddie151"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keddie|1995|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of government and clergy-led [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution of the Bahá'ís]], [[Iran]]ian government officials and others have claimed that Bahá'ís have had ties to foreign powers, and were agents of Russian imperialism, British colonialism, American expansionism and Zionism, as well as being responsible for the policies of the previous [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] of Iran.&lt;ref name="un294"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghanea|2003|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These accusations against the Bahá'í have been disputed, and described as based on misconceived,&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1993|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; or exaggerated interpretations of historical fact.&lt;ref name="lifting"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|Shubart|1995|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tavakoli200"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tavakoli-Targhi|2008|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, taught that Bahá'ís are to be loyal to one's government, not be involved in politics, and to obey the laws of the country they reside in.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= government, Bahá'í attitude towards |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] and its predecessor, the [[Bábism|Bábí religion]], originated in nineteenth century Persia, arousing considerable opposition, initially on purely theological and doctrinal grounds;&lt;ref name="momen70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1981|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was seen as threat to established power and authority.&lt;ref name="momen71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1981|pp=71–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, two years after the [[execution of the Báb]], a fringe element in the Bábí community made an unskilled plot against the Shah, [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]], in retaliation for the Báb's execution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Xl9py3z5w The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al Din Shah in 1852: Millennialism and violence], by Moojan Momen, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_attempted_assassination_shah The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al Din Shah in 1852: Millennialism and Violence], by Moojan Momen, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religio 12-1"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Momen | first = Moojan | title =Millennialism and Violence: The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah of Iran by the Babis in 1852 | journal =Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions | volume =12 | issue =1 | pages =57–82 | date =August 2008 | url = | jstor =10.1525/nr.2008.12.1.57 | doi =10.1525/nr.2008.12.1.57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Bahá'u'lláh condemned the plan strongly, and renounced the movement's early anti-Qajar stance, on August 15, 1852 the radicalized Bábís attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'-allah | first = Juan | last = Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1892 |year = 1988 |title = Epistle to the Son of the Wolf |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-182-5 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/ESW/esw-1.html.iso8859-1#pg20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, and that Bahá'u'lláh had not participated in the assassination attempt, the entire Bábí community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand Bábís followed.&lt;ref name="balyuzi72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time [[Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar]] always remained suspicious of the Bábís and Baha'is and viewed them as agitators similar to the European anarchists.&lt;ref name="amanat2008_177"&gt;{{Harvnb|Amanat|2008|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar|Shah of Iran]] and the Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Abdülaziz|‘Abdu’l-‘Aziz]], successively exiled [[Bahá'u'lláh]] from Iran to Baghdad, Constantinople, and eventually to the fortress of [[Acre (Israel)|Acre]] for lifetime incarceration.&lt;ref name="buck"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christopher |last=Buck |title=Islam and Minorities: The Case of the Bahá'ís | journal = Studies in Contemporary Islam | volume = 5 | issue = 1 |pages=83–106 | year =2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, there was growing dissension within the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] state, and in an effort to draw public attention away from the government and instead toward the evils of the 'devious sect', charges of subversion and conspiracy against the Bábís and Bahá'ís increased.&lt;ref name="amanat2008_177" /&gt;

In the early 20th century, the Bahá'ís were seen as being non-conformist in a society looking for unanimity and fearful of losing its perceived unique Shi'a culture due to threats from outside its boundaries.&lt;ref name="amanat2008_180"&gt;{{Harvnb|Amanat|2008|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s the clerical and governmental groups started stating that the religion was entirely manufactured by colonialists and imperialists to destroy the "unity of the Muslim nation" and that those who did not share the beliefs of the Muslim nation were agents of foreign powers.&lt;ref name="tavakoli202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tavakoli-Targhi|2008|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s critics of the Bahá'í Faith increasingly used charges of spying, and of connections to foreign powers rather than simply labelling Bahá'ís as [[heretics]].&lt;ref name="amanat2008_171"&gt;{{Harvnb|Amanat|2008|pp=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new charges helped define a new 'other' and reaffirmed a threatened Shi'i self.&lt;ref name="amanat2008_171"/&gt; This new attitude towards the Bahá'ís was now not confined to the clerics, but was also rampant among the secular Iranian middle-class.&lt;ref name="amanat2008_171"/&gt; In the 1970s accusations of Bahá'ís being numerous in the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah's]] regime surfaced, as well as there being a perception that Bahá'ís were generally better off than the rest of the population.&lt;ref name="chehabi_190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chehabi|2008|pp=190–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chehabi notes that while the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith mitigate against a preferential attachment of Bahá'ís to Iran, Iran is seen by Bahá'ís as the "Cradle of the Cause" to which it owes a degree of affection by Bahá'ís worldwide.&lt;ref name="chehabi_190"/&gt;

Since the founding of [[Israel]], there have also been many accusations of Bahá'ís being associated with [[Zionism]], largely on the grounds that the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] is located in current-day Israel, although this is an historic accident, rather than the result of deliberate action by the Baha'is.&lt;ref name="chehabi_190"/&gt; The Bahá'í World Centre has its historical origins in the area that was at the time part of Ottoman Syria. This dates back to the 1850s and 1860s and the repeated forced exiles of Baha'i leaders.

===Since the Iranian revolution===
After the overthrow of the [[Shah]] during the [[Iranian revolution]], the Islamic regime targeted the Bahá'ís in Iran, since they held a deep hostility toward them as they saw them as [[infidels]].&lt;ref name="sanasarian114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanasarian|2000|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; As nationalism grew in Iran, Bahá'ís were viewed as unpatriotic and linked to foreign elements.&lt;ref name="sanasarian115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanasarian|2000|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the Bahá'ís were accused of being anti-Islamic, agents of Zionism, friends of the Shah's regime, and being engaged with the US and British governments.&lt;ref name="sanasarian115"/&gt; The [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of Iran, both privately and publicly, addressed the charges against them point by point, but received no response to their rebuttal.&lt;ref name="sanasarian115"/&gt;

In January 1980 with the election of President [[Bani Sadr]] and the continuing anti-Bahá'í sentiment, the Bahá'í Faith was officially described by the government as a political movement against the Iranian revolution and Islam.&lt;ref name="sanasarian116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanasarian|2000|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the revolution, Bani Sadr had connected the universal message of the Bahá'í Faith with Western [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name="sanasarian116"/&gt; In February 1980, the Iranian ambassador to the [[United Nations]] stated that Bahá'ís were [[SAVAK]] agents and repeated the cleric's charges; only later when he broke with the regime in 1982 did he recant his previous statements.&lt;ref name="sanasarian116"/&gt;

By 1981, however, revolutionary courts no longer couched the execution of Bahá'ís with political terms, and they instead cited only religious reasons.&lt;ref name="ganea103"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghanea|2003|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also documents were given out to Bahá'ís that if they would publicly embrace [[Islam]], that their jobs, pensions and property would be reinstated.  These documents were shown to the United Nations as evidence that the Iranian government was using the political accusations as a front to the real religious reason for the persecution of the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="ganea103"/&gt;

In 1983, Iran's prosecutor general once again stated that the Bahá'ís were not being persecuted because of their religious belief, but that instead they were spies, and that they were funnelling money outside the country.&lt;ref name="sanasarian119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanasarian|2000|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Iran, once again, addressed the issues raised by the prosecutor point by point; [http://info.bahai.org/article-1-8-3-19.html the letter] was sent to various government agencies. The letter acknowledged that funds were being sent abroad as Bahá'í contributions to the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh|shrines]] and [[Shrine of the Báb|holy places]], but denied all other points, and asked for proof of the charges.&lt;ref name="sanasarian119"/&gt; No response was obtained from the government to this letter. The clerics continued to persecute the Bahá'ís and charged the Bahá'ís with "crimes against God" and Zionism.&lt;ref name="sanasarian119"/&gt;

In 1983 to a report to the Human Rights Commission of the [[United Nations]] the official view of the Islamic Republic was published in a twenty-page document; the document stated that [[United Kingdom|British]] encouraged the Bahá'í Faith in Iran, and that it was not a religion, but a political entity created by colonial powers, that there was a link between the Bahá'í Faith and Zionism and [[SAVAK]]. The United Nations [[Human Rights Commission]] Sub-Commission Expert Mr. Eide stated that the publication provided by the Iranian government "recalled the publications disseminated in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, which had contributed to severe prejudice costing the lives of hundreds of thousands of peoples. The Sub-Commission should be on guard against any recurrence of such campaigns".&lt;ref name="ganea114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghanea|2003|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iranian government's statement was not accepted by the United Nations as the United Nations had received no evidence from the Iranian government regarding its claims.&lt;ref name="sanasarian121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanasarian|2000|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ganea109111"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghanea|2003|pp=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representative from Germany stated that "the documents concerning the Bahá'ís showed that the latter were persecuted, not for criminal offences, but simply for their religious beliefs".&lt;ref name="ganea112"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghanea|2003|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian delegate dismissed the text of the Commission's resolution, and persecution of the Bahá'ís continued.&lt;ref name="ganea113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghanea|2003|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the Iranian government again gave a statement to the United Nations stating that since the administrative centre of the Bahá'í Faith is located in [[Israel]], it is directly controlled by Zionist forces,&lt;ref name="ganea132"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghanea|2003|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] has its historical origins in the area that was once Ottoman Syria.&lt;ref name="buck" /&gt; In the late 1990s during [[Muhammad Khatami]]'s presidency, the name-calling and outrageous accusations did not end, and with the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in 2005, the frequency and intensity of these accusations has increased.&lt;ref name="sanasarian_2008-157"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanasarian|2008|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian and British ties==
During the 19th century, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] had firm control over India; at the same time [[Russia]] had been expanding south and east into the Caucasus and Central Asia toward India, and a rivalry started between Britain and Russia over territorial and political control in Central Asia. The middle zone of land that was located between India and Russian holdings, included Persia, and was a highly coveted region, where both Russia and Britain worked to gain influence.&lt;ref name="amanat23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Amanat|1989|pp=23–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The support of the United Kingdom during the [[Constitutional Revolution]], the [[Anglo-Russian convention]] which solidified boundaries that identified control between Britain and Russia in Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet, the occupation of Iranian territory during the [[First World War]] by the UK, Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]], as well as the [[Pahlavī dynasty#Establishment|coup d'état of 1921]] which was backed by the British, all encouraged the development of antagonism to these foreign powers.&lt;ref name="ashraf"&gt;{{cite web | first = Ahmad | last = Ashraf | url = http://www.iranian.com/May96/Opinion/Conspiracy.html | title = Conspiracy theories and the Persian Mind | accessdate = 2008-07-13 | year = 1997 | publisher = Iranian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim clerics and other anti-Bahá'í groups connected the Bahá'í Faith, and its predecessor the Bábí movement, to the external governments of Britain and Russia to project the mistrust of these two latter groups onto the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="chehabi_186"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chehabi|2008|pp=186–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ashraf"/&gt;

===Russian ties===
In [[God Passes By]], [[Shoghi Effendi]] alludes to the protection [[Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov|the Russian ambassador]] gave Bahá'u'lláh on different occasions, first after the attempted assassination of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] and again after the decision to exile Bahá’u’lláh from Iran, expressing his "desire to take Bahá’u’lláh under the protection of his government, and offered to extend every facility for His removal to Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |page=71 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-6.html#pg71 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Effendi 1944 106"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |page=106 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-6.html#pg106 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Súriy-i-Haykal (Tablet of the Temple)|Súriy-i-Haykal]], Bahá’u’lláh included the Lawh-i-Malik-i-Rús, praising Czar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in these terms: "when this Wronged One was sore-afflicted in prison, the minister of the highly esteemed government (of Russia)—may God, glorified and exalted be He, assist him!—exerted his utmost endeavor to compass My deliverance. Several times permission for My release was granted. Some of the ‘ulamás of the city, however, would prevent it. Finally, My freedom was gained through the solicitude and the endeavor of His Excellency the Minister. …His Imperial Majesty, the Most Great Emperor—may God, exalted and glorified be He, assist him!—extended to Me for the sake of God his protection—a protection which has excited the envy and enmity of the foolish ones of the earth."&lt;ref name="Effendi 1944 106"/&gt;  When Bahá’u’lláh and his family traveled from Iran to Baghdad subsequent to his exile in 1853, they were accompanied by a representative of the Russian legation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nabíl-i-Zarandí |authorlink=Nabíl-i-A`zam |origyear=1890 |year=1932 |title=The Dawn-Breakers: Nabíl’s Narrative |edition=Hardcover |editor=Shoghi Effendi (translator) |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-900125-22-5 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/nz/DB/ | chapter = Chapter XXVI Attempt on the Shah's Life, and its Consequences | chapter-url = http://bahai-library.com/books/dawnbreakers/chapters/26.html#650  |page=650 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the faith base much of their amplification and exaggeration of these "ties" on a document, allegedly a "memoir" of Dolgorukov (also known as [[Dolgoruki]]), who was the Russian ambassador to Persia from 1846 to 1854.&lt;ref name="chehabi_186"/&gt;&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|1973|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memoir states that Dolgorukov created the Bábí and Bahá'í religions so as to weaken Iran and Shi'a Islam.&lt;ref name="chehabi_186"/&gt; The document was first published in 1943 in [[Persian language|Persian]] in [[Mashhad]], and shortly thereafter published again in Tehran with some of the most glaring errors corrected. The book still, however, contains so many historical errors that it is inconceivable that it is genuine.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;

The memoir states that Dolgorukov used to attend gatherings of Hakím Ahmad Gílání, where he would meet [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. However, Gílání died in 1835, three years before Dolgorukov's arrival in the Persia. There are numerous other errors relating to the dates and times of events that the memoir describes; the memoir describes events after the death of personages, or when the people involved were young children, or when they were in different parts of the world.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolgorukov actually only became aware of the Bábí movement in 1847, three years after it started, and his dispatches show that he was initially afraid of the movement spreading into the [[Caucasus]], and asked that the [[Báb]] be moved away from the Russian border.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  In 1852, after a failed assassination attempt against the Shah for which the entire Bábí community was blamed, many Bábís, including Bahá'u'lláh, who had no role in the attempt and later severely condemned it, were arrested in a sweep.&lt;ref name="balyuzi77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bahá'u'lláh was jailed by the Shah, his family went to Mírzá Majid Ahi who was married to a sister of Bahá'u'lláh,&lt;ref name="balyuzi99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was working as the secretary to the Russian Legation in Tehran. Bahá'u'lláh's family asked Mírzá Majid to go to Dolgorukov and ask him to intercede on behalf of Bahá'u'lláh, and Dolgorukov agreed.&lt;ref name="balyuzi99"/&gt;

The memoirs, however, extend this assistance to all facets of Bahá'u'lláh's life. In one edition of the memoir, Dolgorukov is said to have provided money for Bahá'u'lláh to build a house in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], but Dolgorukov died in 1867, before Bahá'u'lláh arrived in Acre. Thus newer editions of the memoir state that Dolgorukov sent money for a house to be built in [[Edirne]].&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt; As Dolgorukov left the Russian diplomatic service in 1854 and died in 1867, he was unable to interact with Bahá'u'lláh in the manner in which the memoir states.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;

===British ties===

[[File:Abdulbaha knighting.jpg|thumb]]

There have also been claims that the Bábí movement was started by the British, and that the Bahá'í Faith has ties to [[British imperialism]]; the connection to the British, however, has also been supported by false evidence.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt; Firaydun Adamiyyat, in a biography on Nasser-al-Din Shah's first Prime Minister [[Amir Kabir]], stated that [[Mulla Husayn]], the Báb's first disciple, was really a British agent who was recruited by [[Arthur Conolly]], a British intelligence officer, explorer and writer. Adamiyyat states that the evidence of such an accusation appears in Conolly's book ''Journey to the North of India Overland from England through Russia, Persia, and Affghaunistaun'', but no mention of Mulla Husayn or the Báb appears in the book. In later editions of Adamiyyat's biography on Amir Kabir, the fabrication has been removed.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;

Accusations of ties to the British also arise from the [[knighthood|knighting]] in 1920 of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], then head of the religion, by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://adibflash.googlepages.com/Ayam_Javabiye_Velvelehdarshahr_4.pdf | title = Clamour in the City, Part 4, Version 1.2 | pages = 180–182|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Harry Luke|Harry Charles Luke]], an official in the British [[Colonial Office]] who served as assistant Governor of Jerusalem, `Abdu'l-Bahá "on the 4th December, 1919, was created by King [[George V]] a K.B.E. for valuable services rendered to the British Government in the early days of the Occupation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Luke |first= Harry Charles | authorlink= Harry Luke |date= August 23, 1922 |title= The Handbook of Palestine |url= http://www.bahai-library.com/luke_handbook_palestine |location= London |publisher= Macmillan and Company |page= 59 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a recent PhD, however, `Abdu'l-Bahá, received this award in recognition of his "humanitarian work in Palestine" during the war, especially his distribution of grain from his personal supply, which averted a famine in Northern Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/69065/3/Yazdani_Mina_20116_PhD_thesis.pdf Religious Contentions in Modern Iran, 1881-1941], by Mina Yazdani, PhD, Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations, University of Toronto, 2011, pp. 190-191, 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blomfield |first=Lady |origyear=1940 |year=1967 |title=The Chosen Highway |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust | page= 210| chapter= Part III: `Abdu'l-Bahá |chapter-url= http://bahai-library.com/blomfield_chosen_highway&amp;chapter=3  |location=London, UK |id= |url=http://bahai-library.com/blomfield_chosen_highway}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ceremonially knighted on April 27, 1920, an event which was prominently reported in the ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' as "a most wonderful celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= The Knighting of `Abdu'l-Bahá |url= https://bahai.works/File:SW_v13no11pg10.png |newspaper= Star of the West |page= 298 | volume= 13| issue= 11 |location= |date= February 1923  |access-date= December 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'ís and political activity in the Ottoman Empire==
During this period, `Abdu'l-Bahá communicated with a number of different actors who were civilian, parliamentarians of the [[Young Turk]]s, opposed to the reign of [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdul Hamid II]], including [[Namık Kemal]], [[Ziya Pasha]] and [[Midhat Pasha]], in an attempt to disseminate Bahá'í thought into their political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alkan |first= Necati |date= 2011  |title= Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule | chapter= The Young Turks and the Bahá'ís in Palestine  |chapter-url=  http://bahai-library.com/alkan_young_turks_palestine | editor1-last= Ben-Bassat | editor1-first= Yuval |editor2-last= Ginio |editor2-first= Eyal |publisher= I.B.Tauris  |page= 262 |isbn= 978-1848856318}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized Bahá'ís "seek freedom and love liberty, hope for equality, are well-wishers of humanity and ready to sacrifice their lives to unite humanity" but on a more broad approach than the Young Turks. Favorable relations included [[Abdullah Cevdet]], one of the founders of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], who would go on trial for defense of Bahá'ís in a periodical he founded.  Abdullah Cevdet considered the Bahá'í Faith an intermediary step between Islam and the ultimate abandonment of religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hanioğlu |first= M.

‛Abdu'l-Bahá also had contact with military leaders as well, including such individuals as [[Bursalı Mehmet Tahir Bey]] and Hasan Bedreddin. The latter, who was involved in the overthrow of [[Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan Abdülaziz]], is commonly known as Bedri Paşa or Bedri Pasha and is referred to in Persian Bahá'í sources as Bedri Bey (Badri Beg). He was a Bahá'í who translated ‛Abdu’l-Baha's works into French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alkan |first= Necati |date= 2011 |title= Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule | chapter= The Young Turks and the Bahá'ís in Palestine |chapter-url= http://bahai-library.com/alkan_young_turks_palestine | editor1-last= Ben-Bassat | editor1-first= Yuval |editor2-last= Ginio |editor2-first= Eyal |publisher= I.B.Tauris |page= 266 |isbn= 978-1848856318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá also met [[Muhammad Abduh]], one of the key figures of [[Islamic Modernism]] and the [[Salafi movement]], in Beirut, at a time when the two men were both opposed to the Ottoman ''[[ulama]]'' and shared similar goals of religious reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Scharbrodt |first= Oliver  |date= 2008 |title= Islam and the Bahá'í Faith: A Comparative Study of Muhammad 'Abduh and 'Abdul-Baha 'Abbas |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn= 9780203928578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Due to the concerns of Hamid II views of `Abdu'l-Bahá's activities, a Commission of Inquiry interviewed him in 1905, with the result that he was almost exiled to [[Fezzan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alkan |first= Necati |date= 2011  |title= Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule | chapter= The Young Turks and the Bahá'ís in Palestine  |chapter-url=  http://bahai-library.com/alkan_young_turks_palestine | editor1-last= Ben-Bassat | editor1-first= Yuval |editor2-last= Ginio |editor2-first= Eyal |publisher= I.B.Tauris  |page= 263 |isbn= 978-1848856318}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote the sultan a letter protesting that his followers refrain from involvement in partisan politics and that his ''[[tariqa]]'' had guided many Americans to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Alkan |first= Necati |date= 2011  |title= Late Ottoman Palestine: The Period of Young Turk Rule | chapter= The Young Turks and the Bahá'ís in Palestine  |chapter-url=  http://bahai-library.com/alkan_young_turks_palestine | editor1-last= Ben-Bassat | editor1-first= Yuval |editor2-last= Ginio |editor2-first= Eyal |publisher= I.B.Tauris  |page= 264 |isbn= 978-1848856318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the [[Young Turk Revolution]] `Abdu'l-Bahá was released from his imprisonment and allowed to travel away from Palestine.

==Bahá'í ties to Zionism==
Bahá'ís have also been accused of ties to [[Zionism]], a movement that calls for the self-determination of the Jewish people and a sovereign, Jewish national homeland. This claim is typically advanced by noting that the most [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings|holy shrines]] of the Bahá'ís are located in current-day Israel.&lt;ref name="chehabi_190"/&gt; However, Bahá'u'lláh was banished from Persia by Nasser-al-Din Shah, at which time Bahá'u'lláh went to [[Baghdad]] in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="balyuziA99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was later exiled by the Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], at the behest of the Persian Shah, to territories further away from Iran and finally to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in Syria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1777|pp=56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; which only a century later was incorporated into the state of [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;

[[Bahá'u'lláh]] died in 1892 near Acre, and the burial place is in [[Bahji]]. Following his death, Bahá'u'lláh's son [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] took over the leadership of the religion until his death in 1921, and he is buried in [[Haifa]], which was then in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="balyuziA452"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important figure for Bahá'ís who is buried in current-day Israel is the Báb, whose remains were secretly transferred to Palestine and buried in Haifa in 1909.&lt;ref name="balyuziA452483"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=452–483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel was not formed until 1948, almost 60 years after Bahá'u'lláh's death, 40 years after the Báb's remains were brought to the region, and 27 years after `Abdu'l-Bahá's death.

On February 23, 1914, at the eve of World War I,  Baron [[Edmond James de Rothschild]], a member of the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild banking family]] who was a leading advocate and financier of the Zionist movement, attended a general meeting at the home of `Abdu'l-Bahá during one of his early trips to Palestine. `Abdu'l-Bahá is recorded saying in part "Unless the souls are believers in God and assured in the verses of God, wealth causes the hearts to be hardened and without light."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= February 23, 1914 |url= https://bahai.works/Star_of_the_West/Volume_9/Issue_10#pg107 |newspaper= Star of the West |page= 107 | volume= 9 | issue= 10 |location= |date= September 8, 1918 |access-date= December 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the British occupation of Palestine following World War I, `Abdu'l-Bahá remarked,
{{quote|text=If the Zionists will mingle with the other races and live in unity with them, they will succeed. If not, they will meet certain resistance. For the present I think a neutral government like the British administration would be best. A Jewish government might come later.&lt;br /&gt;There is too much talk today of what the Zionists are going to do here. There is no need of it. Let them come and do more and say less.&lt;br /&gt;The Zionists should make it clear that their principle is to elevate all the people here and to develop the country for all its inhabitants. This land must be developed, according to the promises of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zachariah. If they come in such a spirit they will not fail.&lt;br /&gt;They must not work to separate the Jews from the other Palestinians. Schools should be open to all nationalities here, business companies, etc. The Turks went down because they attempted to rule over foreign races. The British are always in power because they keep fair and promote harmony.&lt;br /&gt;This is the path to universal peace here as elsewhere - Unity. We must prevent strife by all means.|source=Star of the West (8 September 1919)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Declares Zionists Must Work with Other Races |url= https://bahai.works/Star_of_the_West/Volume_10/Issue_10#pg196 |newspaper= Star of the West |page= 196 | volume= 10 | issue= 10 |location= |date= September 8, 1919 |access-date= December 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bahá'ís have from time to time negotiated with the government of Israel over such matters as the acquisition of properties that currently compose the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings]].  For example, a cablegram sent by Shoghi Effendi on November 12, 1952 announced the "acquisition of vitally-needed property" of the [[Mansion of Bahjí]] and the area around it from "the [[Israel Land Authority|Development Authority of the State of Israel]]...The exchange of said property, including land and houses, was made possible by the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|precipitate flight of the former Arab owners]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Effendi |first= Shoghi | authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |date= 1971 |title= Messages To The Bahá'í World: 1950-1957 |url= http://bahai-library.com/shoghieffendi_messages_bahai_world |location= Wilmette, Illinois |chapter-url= http://bahai-library.com/writings/shoghieffendi/mbw/sec-25.html |chapter= Acquisition of Vitally-Needed Property |publisher= Bahá'í Publishing Trust |page= 45 |isbn= 978-0877430360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the mansion of [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#Mazra'ih|Mazra'ih]] was transferred by the nascent Israeli government from a Muslim [[waqf]] to the Bahá'í administration in 1951.&lt;ref name= "Mazraih 1"&gt;{{cite news |date=June 1951| last= Holley| first= Horace| title= International Baha'i Council Haifa, Israel |newspaper=Bahá'í News |issue=244 |url=https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File%3ABaha%27i_News_244.pdf&amp;page=4  |access-date=May 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Mazraih 2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Universal House of Justice  |date= 1976 |title=Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1968-1973 | chapter = Ridván Message 1973 | url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1968_1973#n55 |location= Wilmette, IL |publisher= Baha'i Publishing Trust |page=113 |isbn=0-87743-076-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Masra'ih is a Moslem religious endowment, and it is consequently impossible, under existing laws in this country, for it to be sold. However, as the friends are aware, the Ministry of Religions, due to the direct intervention of the Minister himself, [[Yehuda Leib Maimon|Rabbi Maimon]], consented, in the face of considerable opposition, to deliver Masra'ih to the Baha'is as a Holy Place to be visited by Baha'i pilgrims. This means that we rent it from the Department of Moslem and Druze affairs in the Ministry of Religions. The head of this Department is also a Rabbi, Dr. Hirschberg. Recently he, his wife and party, visited all the Baha'i properties in Haifa and 'Akka, following upon a very pleasant tea party in the Western Pilgrim House with the members of the International Baha'i Council."&lt;ref name= "Mazraih 1" /&gt; (''Bahá'í News'', no. 244, June 1951, p. 4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mansion was ultimately purchased by the Bahá'ís in 1973.&lt;ref name= "Mazraih 2"/&gt;

Since the [[Iranian revolution]] there have been accusations that the Bahá'ís support Israel because they send fund contributions to the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] which is located in northern Israel.&lt;ref name="sanasarian119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://adibflash.googlepages.com/Ayam_Javabiye_Velvelehdarshahr_4.pdf |format=PDF| title = Clamour in the City, Part 4, Version 1.2 | page = 163|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donations are used in the Bahá'í World Centre for upkeep of the Bahá'í properties, as well as the administration of the worldwide Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="sanasarian119"/&gt;  The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Iran in a 1983 letter to the Iranian government stated that while Muslims were praised for sending money out of the country to Iraq and Jerusalem for the upkeep of their religious shrines, when Bahá'ís sent money for the upkeep of their own shrines it was considered an unforgivable sin.&lt;ref name="ihrdc"&gt;{{Harvnb|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'ís as agents of the Shah's regime and its secret police==
Another criticism claims that the Bahá'ís, during the time of the Pahlavi dynasty, collaborated with the [[SAVAK]], the Iranian secret police, and held positions of power in the government.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chehabi|2008|pp=186–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the [[Iranian revolution]], the Bahá'ís, viewed as the "other" in Iranian society, were held responsible by the rest of the Iranians for the abusive suppression by SAVAK and the Shah's unpopular policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tavakoli-Targhi|2008|pp=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the revolution, the assertion that the Bahá'ís were agents of the Shah perhaps partly originates because Bahá'ís did not help the revolutionary groups, since one of the tenets of the Bahá'í Faith is to obey the government of one's country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://adibflash.googlepages.com/Ayam_Javabiye_Velvelehdarshahr_4.pdf |format=PDF| title = Clamour in the City, Part 4, Version 1.2 | page = 111|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bahá'í International Community]] has, however, stated that the Bahá'í community in Iran was the victim of the Shah's regime, and that SAVAK was one of the main ways of persecuting the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="ganea109111"/&gt; For example, Reza Shah’s government ordered the closure of Bahá'í schools, such as Tehran’s Tarbiyat school for boys and girls, in 1934.&lt;ref name="momen477"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1981|pp=477–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the month of [[Ramadan]] in 1955, when the Shah’s government needed to distract the general population from its decision to join the [[Baghdad Pact]] under pressure from the British and American governments, it sought the support of the clerics. Ayatollah [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi]], acting as the [[Marja'|Marja Taqlid]], a Grand Ayatollah with the authority to make legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law, pushed the Shah's government to support the persecution of the Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="mottahedeh"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mottahedeh|1985|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sanasarian52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanasarian|2000|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1955 attacks were particularly destructive and widespread due to an orchestrated campaign by the government and clergy who utilized the national Iranian radio station and its official newspapers to spread hatred which led to widespread mob violence against Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="mottahedeh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sanasarian52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihrdc9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah's military also occupied the [[Haziratu'l-Quds|Bahá'í centre]] in Tehran, which was destroyed in the violence.&lt;ref name="mottahedeh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sanasarian52"/&gt; Mottahedeh states that under the Pahlavi dynasty, the Bahá'ís were actually more a "political pawn" than a collaborator, and that Reza Shah's government toleration of Bahá'ís in the early 20th-century was more a sign of secular rule and an attempt to weaken clerical influence than a signal of favour for the Bahá’ís.&lt;ref name="mottahedeh" /&gt;  
  	
There is also evidence that SAVAK collaborated with Islamic groups throughout the 1960s and 1970s in harassing Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="sanasarian52"/&gt; SAVAK also had links to [[Hojjatieh]], a radical anti-Bahá'í group. Rahnema and Nomani state that the Shah gave Hojjatieh free rein for their activities toward the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="ganea109111"/&gt; Keddie states that the accusations of Bahá'ís being part of SAVAK were mainly false pretexts for persecution.&lt;ref name="Keddie151"/&gt;

With regards to the accusation that Bahá'ís held many prominent positions in the government of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], there is no empirical study that endeavours to determine the truth of such an accusation.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt; There were a number of individuals who were part of the government and who had Bahá'í backgrounds, but were not Bahá'ís themselves. One problem that arises is the definition of a Bahá'í: a Bahá'í is a member of a voluntary association that admits people only when they meet certain religious qualifications, and one can choose to become, remain or cease to be a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt; However, Muslims who do not recognize the possibility of [[apostasy]] (leaving one's religion) may not understand that individuals are free to reject their previous, in this case Bahá'í, beliefs .&lt;ref name="ganea109111"/&gt;{{rp|110}}

Bahá'ís have used the term Bahá'ízada to refer to people of Bahá'í background who are not Bahá'ís themselves or part of the Bahá'í community; there is no Muslim equivalent of the term.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt; Of the Bahá'ís who held positions near the Shah, the best known is the Shah's personal physician, [[Abdol Karim Ayadi]]. While Asadullah Sanii, another Bahá'í, was appointed Minister of Defence, the Bahá'í community of Iran revoked his administrative rights &amp;mdash; as he had accepted a political position and Bahá'ís are prohibited from involvement in partisan politics &amp;mdash; the public, however, still continued to associate him with his previous religion.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt;  Parviz Sabeti, a SAVAK official, was raised in a Bahá'í family, but had left the religion and was not a member of the community by the time he started working with the agency.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt;

Other people who were associated with the Bahá'í Faith either had Bahá'í backgrounds or were not connected with the religion at all.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt; For example, it was often rumoured that the Prime Minister [[Amir-Abbas Hoveida]] was a Bahá'í. While Hoveida's father had been a Bahá'í, he had left the religion and Hoveida himself was not religious.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt; Other people rumoured to be Bahá'ís included [[Mahnaz Afkhami]], who was the Minister for Women's Affairs and the daughter of a Bahá'í mother, and [[Farrokhroo Parsa]], a cabinet member who was not connected to the religion at all.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt; Chehabi notes that the allegations that half of the Shah's cabinet were Bahá'ís are fanciful and, given the persecution the Bahá'ís have suffered, irresponsible exaggerations.&lt;ref name="chehabi_188"/&gt;

==Bahá'í ties to Freemasonry==

Iranian critics of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] have accused the religion of having ties to [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  As Freemasonry was a secretive society originating from the West, many in Iran connected the movement with the introduction of foreign ideas into the country in order to undermine Iranian values.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt; Claims were made that many of the earliest Freemason lodges, such as [[Malkom Khan]]'s ''faramush-khanih'', which were founded in 1858, were linked to European lodges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keddie|2006|pp=431–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keddie|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Freemasonry was brought to Iran by Iranians who had seen the movement in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;

Specific accusations connecting the Bahá'í Faith to Freemasonry often include an assertion that Dr. Dhabih Qurban, who was a well-known Bahá'í, was also a freemason.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;  This assertion is based on an Iranian book publishing documents related to Freemasonry in the country; that book states that in specific pages of Fazel Mazandarani's book on the Bahá'í Faith there are statements that Dr. Dhabih Qurban is a Freemason, but in fact Freemasony is not mentioned in the pages of the referenced Bahá'í book.&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;  Furthermore, the Iranian book that is the source of the accusation includes a discussion between the Grand Master of the Great Lodge in Iran, and the Grand Master notes that "no Bahá'ís have become masons and this is repeated by others present with no-one disagreeing."&lt;ref name="momenjournal"/&gt;

At times and places where the Bahá'ís have not had access to their own specific venues, they have either hired, or used with permission those belonging to other organizations, with which they do not have other links. This has included Masonic lodges, such as the case with Ruth "Ruhaniyyih" Moffett during her visit to Puerto Rico in 1950 to introduce the religion there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bahai.works/index.php?title=File%3ABaha%27i_News_231.pdf&amp;page=11 |title=Bahá'í News |issue=231 |date=May 1950 |access-date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that the teachings of the Baha'i Faith expressly forbid membership in secret societies, and asked all Bahá'ís to remove their memberships from all secret societies, including the Freemasons, so that they can serve the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith without compromising their independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Compilations |editor = Hornby, Helen (Ed.) |year = 1983 |title = Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India |isbn = 81-85091-46-3 |url = http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance | page =421 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Holocene|image=[[File:Guanella Pass Ridges.jpg|220px]]|caption=Forests begin recovery}}
The '''Preboreal''' is a stage of the Holocene epoch. It is preceded by the [[Late Pleistocene|Tarantian]] and succeeded by the [[Boreal (age)|Boreal]]. It lasted from 10,300 to 9,000{{nbsp}}[[Before present|BP]] in radiocarbon years or 8350{{nbsp}}BC to 7050{{nbsp}}BC in Gregorian calendar years ([[8th millennium BC]]). It is the first stage of the [[Holocene]] epoch.

The Holocene has not been formally divided by the IUGS. As a result the Preboreal is only a proposal, and as stratigraphy and dating techniques have improved since this 1972 proposal the dates would be different if proposed today. Instead others have begun to use the terms Early, Middle and Late, which strictly should be Lower, Middle and Upper for the Holocene. If this terminology were to be used the preboreal would be replaced by Lower Holocene which would be dated 11.7 - 8.2 ka B2K.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ub.edu/ice/sites/default/files/docs/jornades/Walker2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1228">A '''recommended exposure limit''' ('''REL''') is an [[occupational exposure limit]] that has been recommended by the [[United States]] [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] to the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) for adoption as a [[permissible exposure limit]]. The REL is a level that NIOSH believes would be protective of worker safety and health over a working lifetime if used in combination with engineering and work practice controls, exposure and medical monitoring, posting and labeling of hazards, worker training and [[personal protective equipment]]. No REL has ever been adopted by OSHA, but they have been used as guides by some industry and advocacy organizations. RELs for chemical exposures are usually expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm), or sometimes in [[milligram]]s per cubic metre (mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Although not legally enforceable limits, NIOSH RELs are considered by OSHA during the promulgation of legally enforceable PELs.

The United States '''Rural Utilities Service''' ('''RUS''') administers programs that provide infrastructure or infrastructure improvements to [[Rural America|rural communities]]. These include water and waste treatment, electric power, and telecommunications services.&lt;ref name="rus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural Utilities Service|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/about-rd/agencies/rural-utilities-service|website=USDA|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is an operating unit of the [[USDA Rural Development]] agency of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). It was created in 1935 as the '''Rural Electrification Administration''' ('''REA'''), a [[New Deal]] agency promoting rural electrification.

A total of 890 rural electric and 800 rural telecommunications utilities in 47 States, [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], [[Marshall Islands|the Marshall Islands]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] have received financial assistance. Approximately 7,200 rural communities are served through financial assistance received from water and waste loans and grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rural Utilities Service|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/rural-utilities-service|website=Federal Register|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RUS administers the following programs:
* Water and Environmental: provides financial assistance for drinking water, sanitary sewer, solid waste and storm drainage facilities in rural areas and communities with a population of 10,000 or less.&lt;ref name="rus"/&gt;
* Electric Programs: help maintain, expand, upgrade and modernize the rural electric infrastructure. It also supports demand-side management, energy efficiency and conservation programs, and on-and off-grid renewable energy systems.&lt;ref name="rus"/&gt;
* Telecommunications: helps deploy the rural telecommunications infrastructure.&lt;ref name="rus"/&gt;

RUS originated with the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), one of the agencies created under the New Deal in 1935 to promote [[rural electrification]]. In the 1930s, the U.S. lagged behind Europe in providing electricity to rural areas. In 1934, less than 11% of U.S. farms had electricity. That same year, in France and Germany, nearly 90% of farms had electricity.

Backed by the 1936 [[Rural Electrification Act]] the REA gave loans and other help to rural organizations setting up their own power systems and was one of the [[New Deal]]'s most successful programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McChesney|first1=Paul|last2=Podesta|first2=John|title=Let There Be Wi-Fi|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0601.podesta.html|publisher=Washington Monthly|accessdate=3 March 2016|ref=washingtonmonthly}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1937, hundreds of new municipal power utilities were created nationwide. In 1939, 288,000 households had their electricity provided by rural electric cooperatives. Most of these electric co-ops had applied for and received loans from REA. By 1942, nearly 50% of US farms had electricity, and by 1952 almost all US farms had electricity.&lt;ref&gt;''FDR: The New Deal Years, 1933–1937'', pages 491–92, by Kenneth S. Davis. Published by Random House, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the REA became authorized to provide loans to rural telephone cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Rural Telecommunications|url=http://www.ntca.org/about-ntca-the-rural-broadband-association/history-of-rural-telecommunications.html|website=The Rural Broadband Association|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994]] the REA was absorbed by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Laurence Malone |title=Rural Electrification Administration |encyclopedia=EH.Net Encyclopedia |editor=[[Robert Whaples]] |publisher=[[Economic History Association]] |date=March 16, 2008 |accessdate=July 31, 2016 |url=https://eh.net/encyclopedia/rural-electrification-administration/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Henry Schneider''' (February 11, 1945&amp;nbsp;– July 19, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/science/earth/20schneider.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Douglas | last=Martin | title=Stephen H. Schneider, Climatologist, Is Dead at 65 | date=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Professor of Environmental Biology and Global Change at [[Stanford University]], a Co-Director at the Center for Environment Science and Policy of the [[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]] and a Senior Fellow in the [[Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment]]. Schneider served as a consultant to federal agencies and White House staff in the [[Richard Nixon]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] administrations.

Schneider's research included modeling of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[climate change]], and the effect of global climate change on biological systems. Schneider was the founder and editor of the journal ''[[Climatic Change]]'' and authored or co-authored over 450 [[scientific paper]]s and other publications. He was a Coordinating Lead Author in Working Group II Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [[TAR (IPCC)|Third Assessment Report]] and was engaged as a co-anchor of the Key Vulnerabilities Cross-Cutting Theme for the [[Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4) at the time of his death. During the 1980s, Schneider emerged as a leading public advocate of sharp reductions of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to combat [[global warming]]. In 2006 Professor Schneider was an [[Adelaide Thinker in Residence]] advising the [[South Australian Government]] of Premier [[Mike Rann]] on climate change and [[renewable energy]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinkers.sa.gov.au  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126035853/http://www.thinkers.sa.gov.au/ |date=2014-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ten years [[South Australia]] went from zero to 31% of its electricity generation coming from renewables.

An annual award for outstanding climate science communication was created in Schneider's honor after his death, by the [[Commonwealth Club of California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/309764-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Stephen Schneider Memorial Lecture of the [[American Geophysical Union]] honors Schneider's life and work. &lt;ref&gt;https://honors.agu.org/sfg-award-lecture/stephen-schneider-lecture/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==
Schneider grew up on [[Long Island, New York]]. He studied engineering at [[Columbia University]], receiving his bachelor's degree in [[mechanical engineering]] in 1966. In 1971, he earned a Ph.D. in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[plasma physics]].&lt;ref name="Nuzzo2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nuzzo | first1 = R. | title = Profile of Stephen H. Schneider| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0507327102 | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume = 102 | issue = 44 | pages = 15725–15727 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16249332 | pmc =1276082 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10215725N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider studied the role of greenhouse gases and suspended particulate material on climate as a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]].

In 1971, Schneider was second author on a ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper with [[S. Ichtiaque Rasool]] titled "Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate" (''Science'' 173, 138–141). This paper used a one-dimensional [[radiative transfer model]] to examine the competing effects of cooling from aerosols and warming from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The paper concluded that:

{{quote|[I]t is projected that man's potential to pollute will increase six- to eightfold in the next 50 years. If this increased rate of injection of particulate matter in the atmosphere should raise the present background opacity by a factor of 4, our calculations suggest a decrease in global temperature by as much as 3.5 ''°K''. Such a large decrease in the average temperature of Earth, sustained over a period of few years, is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age. However, by that time, nuclear power may have largely replaced fossil fuels as a means of energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rasool SI, Schneider SH |title=Atmospheric carbon dioxide and aerosols: effects of large increases on global climate |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=173 |issue=3992 |pages=138–41 |date=July 1971 |pmid=17739641 |doi=10.1126/science.173.3992.138 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17739641|bibcode=1971Sci...173..138R }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carbon dioxide was predicted to have only a minor role. However, the model was very simple and the calculation of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effect was lower than other estimates by a factor of about three, as noted in a footnote to the paper.

The story made headlines in the ''[[New York Times]]''. Shortly afterwards, Schneider became aware that he had overestimated the cooling effect of aerosols, and underestimated the warming effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a factor of about three. He had mistakenly assumed that measurements of air particles he had taken near the source of pollution applied worldwide. He also found that much of the effect was due to natural aerosols which would not be affected by human activities, so the cooling effect of changes in industrial pollution would be much less than he had calculated. Having found that recalculation showed that global warming was the more likely outcome, he published a retraction of his earlier findings in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], ''The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming'', (2010) [[Guardian Books]], {{ISBN|978-0-85265-229-9}}, pp. 24–27. "When he redid the maths, the balance between warming and cooling now tipped strongly towards warming."&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1976 book ''The Genesis Strategy'' he discusses both long-term warming due to carbon dioxide and short-term cooling due to aerosols,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Schneider and Lynne E. Mesirow, ''The Genesis Strategy: Climate and Global Survival'', Plenum, April 1976. [http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/schneider-genesis.html Quotes] (accessed 22 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated for adopting policies that are resilient to future changes in climate.&lt;ref&gt;The reference is to the story of Joseph, in ''[[The Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' 41-42, who advises the Pharaoh to store harvest from years of abundant harvest to prepare for years of famine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media contributions==
Schneider was a frequent contributor to commercial and noncommercial print and broadcast media on climate and environmental issues, e.g., ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'', ''Planet Earth'', ''[[Nightline]]'', ''Today Show'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', [[Bill Maher]]'s shows, ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Dateline]]'', [[The Discovery Channel]], as well as appearances on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|British]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian]] and [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Santer, B. and Ehrlich, P. 2014. [http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/schneider-stephen.pdf ''Stephen Schneider: a biographical essay'']. Washington D.C.: National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider commented about the frustrations and difficulties involved with assessing and communicating scientific ideas. In a January 2002 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article, he wrote:
{{quote|''I readily confess a lingering frustration: uncertainties so infuse the issue of climate change that it is still impossible to rule out either mild or catastrophic outcomes, let alone provide confident probabilities for all the claims and counterclaims made about environmental problems. Even the most credible international assessment body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has refused to attempt subjective probabilistic estimates of future temperatures. This has forced politicians to make their own guesses about the likelihood of various degrees of global warming.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schneider SH |title=Misleading Math about the Earth: Science defends itself against ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' |journal=Sci. Am. |date=January 2002 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000F3D47-C6D2-1CEB-93F6809EC5880000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1989, Schneider addressed the challenge scientists face trying to communicate complex, important issues without adequate time during media interviews. This citation sometimes was used by his critics to accuse him of supporting misuse of science for political goals:

{{quote|''On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but — which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we'd like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we need to get some broadbased support, to capture the public's imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. This 'double ethical bind' we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. I hope that means being both.'' (Quoted in ''Discover'', pp. 45–48, October 1989.) }}

A '''vacuum airship''', also known as a '''vacuum balloon''', is a hypothetical [[airship]] that is [[Vacuum|evacuated]] rather than filled with a lighter-than-air gas such as hydrogen or helium. First proposed by Italian [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] in 1670,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Francesco Lana-Terzi, S.J. (1631–1687); The Father of Aeronautics | url=http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/lana.htm | accessdate = 13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vacuum balloon would be the ultimate expression of lifting power per volume displaced.

==History==
From 1886 to 1900 [[Arthur De Bausset]] attempted in vain to raise funds to construct his "vacuum-tube" airship design, but despite early support in the United States Congress, the general public was skeptical. Illinois historian Howard Scamehorn reported that [[Octave Chanute]] and [[Albert Francis Zahm]] "publicly denounced and mathematically proved the fallacy of the vacuum principle", however the author does not give his source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scamehorn|first=Howard Lee|title=Balloons to Jets: A Century of Aeronautics in Illinois, 1855–1955|year=2000|pages=13–14|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2336-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Bausset published a book on his design&lt;ref name="De Bausset 1887"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = De Bausset | first1 = Arthur | title = Aerial Navigation | publisher = Fergus Printing Co. | year = 1887 | location = Chicago | url = https://archive.org/details/aerialnavigatio00chicgoog | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered $150,000 stock in the Transcontinental Aerial Navigation Company of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Aerial Navigation | journal = New York Times | date = February 14, 1887| id = | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/02/14/103137015.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = To Navigate the Air | journal = New York Times | date = February 19, 1887| id = | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/02/19/103097161.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His patent application was eventually denied on the basis that it was "wholly theoretical, everything being based upon calculation and nothing upon trial or demonstration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mitchell (Commissioner) | title = Decisions of the Commissioner of Patents for the Year 1890 | publisher = US Government Printing Office | year = 1891 | page = 46 | accessdate = | quote = 50 O.

In 1921, Lavanda Armstrong discloses a composite wall structure with a vacuum chamber "surrounded by a second envelop constructed so as to hold air under pressure, the walls of the envelope being spaced from one another and tied together", including a honeycomb-like cellular structure, however leaving some uncertainty how to achieve adequate buoyancy given "walls may be made as thick and strong as desired".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | number=1390745 |status=patent | inventor= Lavanda M Armstrong | country=US  | title = Aircraft of the lighter-than-air type | pubdate=Sep 13, 1921  |assign1=Lavanda M Armstrong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, David Noel discussed the use of geodesic sphere covered with plastic film and "a double balloon containing pressurized air between the
skins, and a vacuum in the centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pages=262–266 | journal=Correspondence, Speculations in Science and Technology  | volume=6 | issue=3 | date=1983 | title=Lighter than Air Craft Using Vacuum  | author=David Noel | url=http://aoi.com.au/Originals/VacuumBalloon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  1982–1985 Emmanuel  Bliamptis elaborated on energy sources and use of "inflatable strut rings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | number=4534525 |status=patent | inventor= Emmanuel  Bliamptis | country=US  | title = Evacuated balloon for solar energy collection | pubdate=Aug 13, 1985 |assign1=Emmanuel  Bliamptis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004–2007 Akhmeteli and Gavrilin address choice of materials ("beryllium, boron carbide ceramic, and diamond-like carbon" or aluminum) in honeycomb double layer craft to address buckling issues.&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"/&gt;

==Principle==
An [[airship]] operates on the principle of [[buoyancy]], according to [[Archimedes' principle]]. In an airship, air is the fluid in contrast to a traditional [[ship]] where [[water]] is the fluid.

The [[density of air]] at standard temperature and pressure is 1.28 g/l, so 1 [[liter]] of displaced air has sufficient buoyant force to lift 1.28 g. Airships use a bag to displace a large volume of air; the bag is usually filled with a lightweight gas such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]]. The total lift generated by an airship is equal to the weight of the air it displaces, minus the weight of the materials used in its construction including the gas used to fill the bag.

Vacuum airships would replace the helium gas with a near-[[vacuum]] environment, having no mass, density would be near to 0.00 g/l, which would theoretically be able to provide the full lift potential of displaced air, so every liter of vacuum could lift 1.28 g. Using the [[molar volume]], the mass of 1 liter of helium (at 1 atmospheres of pressure) is found to be 0.178 g. If helium is used instead of vacuum, the lifting power of every liter is reduced by 0.178 g, so the effective lift is reduced by 14%. A 1-liter volume of hydrogen has a [[mass]] of 0.090 g.

The main problem with the concept of vacuum airships is that, with a near-vacuum inside the airbag, the exterior [[atmospheric pressure]] is not balanced by any internal pressure. This enormous imbalance of forces would cause the airbag to collapse unless it were extremely strong (in an ordinary airship, the force is balanced by helium, making this unnecessary). Thus the difficulty is in constructing an airbag with the additional strength to resist this extreme net force, without weighing the structure down so much that the greater lifting power of vacuum is negated.

==Material constraints==
===Compressive strength===
From the analysis by Akhmeteli and Gavrilin:&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"&gt;{{cite patent | number=2007001053 |status=application | inventor=AM Akhmeteli, AV Gavrilin | country=US  | title =US Patent Application 11/517915. Layered shell vacuum balloons| pubdate=Feb 23, 2006 |pridate=2004-05-13 |assign1=Andrey M Akhmeteli and Andrey V Gavrilin | url=http://akhmeteli.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/vacuum_balloons_cip.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total force on a hemi-spherical shell of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; by an external pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pi R^2 P&lt;/math&gt;. Since the force on each hemisphere has to balance along the equator the compressive stress will be, assuming &lt;math&gt;h&lt;&lt;R&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi R^2 P / 2 \pi R h = R P / 2 h&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the shell thickness.

Neutral buoyancy occurs when the shell has the same mass as the displaced air, which occurs when &lt;math&gt;h/R = \rho_a/(3 \rho_s)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is the air density and &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is the shell density, assumed to be homogeneous. Combining with the stress equation gives 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = (3/2)(\rho_s/\rho_a)P&lt;/math&gt;.
For aluminum and terrestrial conditions Akhmeteli and Gavrilin estimate the stress as &lt;math&gt;3.2\cdot 10^8&lt;/math&gt; Pa, of the same order of magnitude as the compressive strength of aluminum alloys.

===Buckling===
Akhmeteli and Gavrilin note, however, that the compressive strength calculation disregards [[buckling]], and using R. Zoelli's formula for the critical buckling pressure of a sphere
:&lt;math&gt;P_{cr} = \frac{2Eh^2}{\sqrt{3(1-\mu^2)}}\frac{1}{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[modulus of elasticity]] and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Poisson ratio]] of the shell. Substituting the earlier expression gives a necessary condition for a feasible vacuum balloon shell:
:&lt;math&gt;E/\rho_s^2 = \frac{9P_{cr}\sqrt{3(1-\mu^2)}}{2\rho_a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
The requirement is about &lt;math&gt;4.5\cdot10^5 kg^{-1} m^5 s^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Akhmeteli and Gavrilin assert that this cannot even be achieved using diamond (&lt;math&gt;E/\rho_s^2 \approx 1\cdot 10^5&lt;/math&gt;), and 
propose that dropping the assumption that the shell is a homogeneous material may allow lighter and stiffer structures (e.g. a [[honeycomb structure]]).&lt;ref name="Akhmeteli"/&gt;

==Atmospheric constraints==
A vacuum airship should at least float (Archimedes law) and resist external pressure (strength law, depending on design, like the above R. Zoelli's formula for sphere). These two conditions may be rewritten as an inequality where a complex of several physical constants related to the material of the airship is to be lesser than a complex of atmospheric parameters. Thus, for a sphere (hollow sphere and, to a lesser extent, cylinder are practically the only designs for which a strength law is known) it is &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} &lt; \sqrt{1-\frac{P_{\rm int}}{P}}\cdot L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm int}&lt;/math&gt; is pressure within the sphere, while &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; («Lana coefficient») and &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; («Lana atmospheric  ratio») are:&lt;ref name=shikhovtsev16&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mir.k156.ru/aeroplan/de_bausset_aeroplane-03-1.html#a03-1-2016 |title=Is FLanar Possible? | author=E. Shikhovtsev | date=2016 | accessdate=2016-06-19 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} = 2.79\cdot \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{E}} \cdot (1-\mu^2)^{0.25}&lt;/math&gt; (or, when &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L} \approx 2.71\cdot \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{E}}&lt;/math&gt; with an error of order of 3% or less);
:&lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a} = \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_{\rm atm}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{P}}&lt;/math&gt; (or, when &lt;math&gt;\rho_a&lt;/math&gt; is unknown, &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_{\rm atm}}{P}} \cdot \frac{M_a}{T_a}&lt;/math&gt;),
where &lt;math&gt;P_{\rm atm} = 101325&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Pa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\rm atm} = 1.22&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;kg/m^3&lt;/math&gt; are pressure and density of standard Earth atmosphere at sea level, &lt;math&gt;M_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; are molar mass (kg/kmol) and temperature (K) of atmosphere at floating area.
Of all known planets and moons of the Sun system only the Venusian atmosphere has &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; big enough to surpass &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm L}&lt;/math&gt; for such materials as some composites (below altitude of ca. 15&amp;nbsp;km) and graphene (below altitude of ca. 40&amp;nbsp;km). Both materials may survive in the Venusian atmosphere. The equation for &lt;math&gt;L_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; shows that exoplanets with dense, cold and high-molecular (&lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; type) atmospheres may be suitable for vacuum airships, but it is a rare type of atmosphere.

==In fiction==
In the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] novel ''[[Tarzan at the Earth's Core]]'' [[Tarzan]] travels to [[Pellucidar]] in a vacuum airship constructed of the fictional material Harbenite.

In ''Passarola Rising'', novelist [[Azhar Abidi]] imagines what might have happened had [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão]] built and flown a vacuum airship.

Spherical vacuum body airships using the [[Magnus effect]] and made of [[carbyne]] or similar superhard carbon are glimpsed in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]''.

In ''Maelstrom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rifters.com/real/MAELSTROM.htm|title=Maelstrom by Peter Watts|first=Peter|last=Watts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Behemoth:B-Max'', author [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]] describes various flying devices, such as "botflies" and "lifters" that use "vacuum bladders" to keep them airborne.

In ''[[Feersum Endjinn]]'' by [[Iain M. Banks]], a vacuum balloon is used by the narrative character Bascule in his quest to rescue Ergates. Vacuum dirigibles (airships) are also mentioned as a notable engineering feature of the space-faring utopian civilisation [[The Culture]] in Banks' novel ''[[Look to Windward]]''&lt;!-- At the end of Chapter 4, Scorched Ground, dialogue between Zleper and 947 Praf. --&gt;, and the vast vacuum dirigible Equatorial 353 is a pivotal location in the final Culture novel, ''[[The Hydrogen Sonata]]''.

A '''volcanic bomb''' is a mass of molten rock ([[tephra]]) larger than 64&amp;nbsp;mm (2.5&amp;nbsp;inches) in [[diameter]], formed when a [[volcano]] ejects [[viscosity|viscous]] fragments of [[lava]] during an eruption. They cool into solid fragments before they reach the ground. Because volcanic bombs cool after they leave the volcano, they are [[extrusive]] [[igneous]] rocks. Volcanic bombs can be thrown many kilometres from an erupting vent, and often acquire aerodynamic shapes during their flight. Bombs can be extremely large; the 1935 eruption of [[Mount Asama]] in Japan expelled bombs measuring 5–6&amp;nbsp;m in diameter up to 600&amp;nbsp;m from the vent. Volcanic bombs are a significant volcanic hazard, and can cause severe injuries and death to people in an eruption zone. One such incident occurred at [[Galeras]] volcano in [[Colombia]] in 1993; six people near the summit were killed and several seriously injured by lava bombs when the volcano erupted unexpectedly. On July 16, 2018, 23 people were injured on a tour boat near the [[Kilauea]] volcano as a result of a [[Basketball (ball)|basketball-sized]] lava bomb from the [[2018 lower Puna eruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawaii volcano: At least 23 injured as 'lava bomb' hits tourist boat |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/07/16/hawaii-volcano-least-12-injured-lava-bomb-hits-tourist-boat/789467002/ |website=USA Today |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =23 injured after basketball-sized ‘lava bomb’ crashes through roof of Hawaiian tour boat|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/07/16/23-injured-after-basketball-sized-lava-bomb-crashes-through-the-roof-of-a-hawaiian-tour-boat |website=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcanic bombs are known to occasionally explode from internal gas pressure as they cool, but in most cases, most of the damage they cause is from impact, or subsequent fire damage. Bomb explosions are most often observed in "bread-crust" type bombs.

==Types of bombs==

[[File:Volcanic bombs in Japan.jpg|thumb|upright|Various volcanic bombs in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].]]
Bombs are named according to their shape, which is determined by the fluidity of the magma from which they are formed. 
* ''Ribbon or cylindrical bombs'' form from highly to moderately fluid magma, ejected as irregular strings and blobs. The strings break up into small segments which fall to the ground intact and look like ribbons. Hence, the name "ribbon bombs". These bombs are circular or flattened in cross section, are fluted along their length, and have tabular vesicles.
* ''Spherical bombs'' also form from high to moderately fluid magma. In the case of spherical bombs, [[surface tension]] plays a major role in pulling the ejecta into spheres.
* ''Spindle, fusiform, or almond/rotational bombs'' are formed by the same processes as spherical bombs, though the major difference being the partial nature of the spherical shape. Spinning during flight leaves these bombs looking elongated or almond shaped; the spinning theory behind these bombs' development has also given them the name 'fusiform bombs'. Spindle bombs are characterised by longitudinal fluting, one side slightly smoother and broader than the other. This smooth side represents the underside of the bomb as it fell through the air.
* ''Cow pie bombs'' are formed when highly fluid magma falls from moderate height, so the bombs do not solidify before impact (they are still liquid when they strike the ground). They consequently flatten or splash and form irregular roundish disks, which resemble cow dung.
* ''Bread-crust bombs'' are formed if the outside of the lava bombs solidifies during their flights. They may develop cracked outer surfaces as the interiors continue to expand.
* ''Cored bombs'' are bombs that have rinds of lava enclosing a core of previously consolidated lava. The core consists of accessory fragments of an earlier eruption, accidental fragments of country rock or, in rare cases, bits of lava formed earlier during the same eruption.

'''William Howitt''' (18 December 1792 – 3 March 1879), was a prolific English writer on history and other subjects. William and his wife Mary also owned a school still used today; Howitt Primary School in Heanor, Derbyshire.

==Biography==
Howitt was born at [[Heanor]], Derbyshire. His parents were [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], and he was educated at the [[Ackworth School|Friends public school]] at [[Ackworth, West Yorkshire|Ackworth]], Yorkshire. His younger brothers were [[Richard Howitt (poet)|Richard]] and [[Godfrey Howitt|Godrey]] whom he helped tutor. In 1814 he published a poem on the ''Influence of Nature and Poetry on National Spirit''. He married, in 1821, [[Mary Howitt|Mary Botham]], who like himself was a Quaker and a poet. William and Mary Howitt collaborated throughout a long literary career, the first of their joint productions being ''The Forest Minstrels and other Poems'' (1821).

In 1831, William Howitt produced a work resulting naturally from his habits of observation and his genuine love of nature. It was a history of the changes in the face of the outside world in the different months of the year, and was entitled ''The Book of the Seasons, or the Calendar of Nature'' (1831). His ''Popular History of Priestcraft'' (1833) won him the favour of active [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]s and the office of [[alderman]] in [[Nottingham, England|Nottingham]], where the Howitts had made their home.

They moved in 1837 to [[Esher]], and became friends with [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] and her husband. 1838 saw publication of his ''Colonization and Christianity'', which was later quoted approvingly by [[Karl Marx]] in ''[[Capital, Volume I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The passage, which is used in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm chapter 31] of ''Volume I'', is from [https://archive.org/stream/colonizationchri00howirich#page/8/mode/2up p.&amp;nbsp;9] of ''Colonization and Christianity'': "The barbarities and desperate outrages of the so-called Christian race, throughout every region of the world, and upon every people they have been able to subdue, are not to be paralleled by those of any other race, however fierce, however untaught, and however reckless of mercy and of shame, in any age of the earth."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840 they went to [[Heidelberg]], primarily for the education of their children, remaining in Germany for two years. In 1841 William Howitt produced, under the pseudonym of Dr Cornelius, ''The Student Life of Germany'', the first of a series of works on German social life and institutions. Mary Howitt devoted herself to [[Scandinavian literature]], and between 1842 and 1863 she translated the novels of [[Frederika Bremer]] and many of the stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. With her husband she wrote in 1852 ''The Literature and Romance of Northern Europe''. In June of that year William Howitt, with two of his sons, set sail for Australia, where he spent two years in the goldfields. The results of his travels appeared in ''A Boy's Adventures in the Wilds of Australia'' (1854), ''Land, Labour and Gold; or, Two Years in Victoria'' (1855) and ''Tallangetta, the Squatter's Home'' (1857).

On his return to England Howitt had settled at [[Highgate]] and resumed his indefatigable book-making. From 1856 to 1862 he was engaged on Cassell's ''Illustrated History of England'', and from 1861 to 1864 he and his wife worked at the ''Ruined Abbeys and Castles of Great Britain''. The Howitts had left the [[Society of Friends]] in 1847, and became interested in [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]]. In 1863 he published ''The History of the Supernatural in all Ages and Nations, and in all Churches, Christian and Pagan, demonstrating a Universal Faith''. He added his own conclusions from a practical examination of the higher phenomena through a course of seven years.

From 1870 onwards Howitt spent the summers in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and the winters in Rome, where he died. In 1880 Mary Howitt had a house built for her (which is still standing) in the spa town of [[Meran]] in South Tyrol (then part of Austria) and from then on divided her time between Rome and Meran.
Mary Howitt was much affected by William's death, and in 1882 she joined the Roman Catholic Church, towards which she had been gradually moving during her connection with spiritualism. She died at Rome on 30 January 1888.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The Howitts are remembered for their untiring efforts to provide wholesome and instructive literature. Their son, [[Alfred William Howitt]], made a name for himself by his explorations in Australia. [[Anna Mary Howitt]] was both an artist and a poet, and married [[Alaric Alfred Watts]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Mary Howitt's ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63040 Retrieved 9 July 2011. Subscription required.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Howitt's autobiography was edited by her daughter, Margaret Howitt, in 1889.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; William Howitt wrote some fifty books, and his wife's publications, inclusive of translations, number over a hundred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4146">The '''World Population Conference''' was held at the Salle Centrale, [[Geneva]], Switzerland, from 29 August to 3 September 1927. Organized by the [[League of Nations]] and [[Margaret Sanger]], the conference was an attempt to bring together international experts on population, food supply, fertility, migration and health to discuss the problem of [[human overpopulation]]. Sir [[Bernard Mallet]] presided over the meeting, and [[William H. Welch]] was vice-president.

==Event==
The conference was truly international, with one hundred and twenty-three delegates from [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]], [[Greece]], the [[Netherlands]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Siam]], [[Spain]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]]. Sessions included papers followed by open discussion on topics including biology and population growth, food and population, [[differential fertility]], falling [[birth rates]], international migration and migration restriction, heredity, and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanger|first=Margaret|title=Proceedings of the World Population Conference|year=1927|publisher=Edward Arnold &amp; Co.|location=London|pages=363–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MyRBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22proceedings+of+the+world+population+conference%22&amp;dq=%22proceedings+of+the+world+population+conference%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EMB6UdLgOOf94APlzoHgCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The World Population Conference succeeded in drawing attention to the study of population growth and established the [[International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]]. British [[Malthusian]] leader [[Charles Vickery Drysdale]] noted that the meeting was "devoid of propagandism," and that the "weight of authority at it has surpassed all the previous gatherings, and has been second to none in brilliance. The simple fact that nearly two hundred persons of the highest eminence in biological, economic and statistical science, sociologists, statesmen, and physicians have come from all parts of the world to Geneva to confer on this question is sufficient to show that it cannot be disregarded and that it will have to be considered by the Governments of all countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drysdale|first=C. V.|title=The First World Population Conferrnce: Some Impressions|journal=Birth Control Review|date=October 1927|volume=XI|issue=10|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A second World Population Conference, sponsored by the [[United Nations]] was held in 1954 in [[Rome]], and a third in 1974 in [[Bucharest]].

==Margaret Sanger's Role==
[[Margaret Sanger]] conceived of the World Population Conference and organized a group of scientists including [[Raymond Pearl]], [[Edward Murray East]], and [[Clarence Cook Little]], to develop the program and invite speakers. She agreed that birth control would not be discussed. She established an office to administer the conference in Geneva, but just before the Conference was to open, Sir [[Bernard Mallet]] removed her name and the names of her all-female administrative staff from the printed conference programs, using the excuse that administrators and clerical staff should not be listed in a scientific program. Sanger's staff quit in protest. Sanger persuaded most back, arguing that the meeting was more important than who was credited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Margaret Sanger Papers Project|title=From Geneva to Cairo: Margaret Sanger and the First World Population Conference|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/from_geneva_to_cairo.html|work=Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter|accessdate=2013-04-26|date=Spring 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sanger edited the Proceedings of the World Population Conference.
