The '''Ackerstraße''' is a street in [[Berlin]] which runs northwest from near the [[Liesenstraße]] – Scheringstraße traffic circle in [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin)|Gesundbrunnen]] to Invalidenstraße, where it turns south, terminating at the [[Linienstraße]] in [[Mitte]].

==History==
[[File:Acker- Bernauer-Straße.jpg|thumb|left|Corner of [[Bernauer Straße]] and Ackerstraße photographed in 1963 and 2011]]

On 22 September 1751, Lieutenant General [[Hans Christoph Friedrich Graf von Hacke]], commandant of the city of Berlin, received orders from King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] of Prussia to build houses outside the [[Berlin Customs Wall|city Customs Wall]] between the [[Hamburger Tor|Hamburg Gate]] and the [[Rosenthaler Tor|Rosenthal Gate]].&lt;ref name=Luisenstadt&gt;[http://berlin.kauperts.de/Strassen/Ackerstrasse-10115-13355-Berlin#Geschichte Geschichte von Ackerstraße], Straßennamenlexikon des [[Luisenstadt|Luisenstädtischen]] Bildungsvereins, at ''Kauperts Straßenführer durch Berlin'', online ed. {{de icon}}, retrieved 23 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially 30 houses were to be built, to house 60 families selected from applicants. The objective was to have the craftsmen stay year-round in Berlin rather than leaving each winter. The new residents were mostly from [[Vogtland]]; as a result the new area of settlement came to be called Neuvoigtland (New Vogtland).&lt;ref name=Luisenstadt/&gt; The streets were laid out in parallel straight lines and were designated numerically; what is now the Ackerstraße was the middle street and was originally called the ''Zweite Reihe'' (second row), and became the ''Dritte Reihe'' (third row) when the local population increased in the 19th century and new streets were added.&lt;ref name=Luisenstadt/&gt; The district was divided into identical land parcels with approximately {{convert|10.5|m|ft}} frontages&lt;ref name="Ackerhöfe"&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/staedtebau/foerderprogramme/stadterneuerung/de/rosenthaler/ackerhoefe.shtml Ackerhöfe, Ackerstraße 14&amp;ndash;15], Stadterneuerung - Mitte - Rundgang Rosenthaler Vorstadt, Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt, Berlin {{de icon}}, retrieved 23 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and to save money and time, the original houses were standardised; this set a new trend. Gardens were laid out between them, but the population increase led to extension of the buildings as the area became more urban.

The area changed name to Rosenthaler Vorstadt, and the local residents petitioned the police for street names to be assigned. On 18 February 1801 the "third row" was renamed Ackerstraße (Field Street), probably because the development was in the farming area outside the city, the ''Feldmark''.&lt;ref name=Luisenstadt/&gt; On 6 April 1833, the continuation of the same street, from Invalidenstraße to Liesenstraße, was named Neue Ackerstraße (New Ackerstraße). The southern extension to Koppenplatz was added in 1877. The residents there preferred the name Virchowstraße, but their request was denied.&lt;ref name=Luisenstadt/&gt;

The [[St. Elisabeth Cemetery (Berlin)|St. Elisabeth Cemetery]] near the midpoint of the street was dedicated in 1844 and is still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/cgi-bin/hidaweb/getdoc.pl?DOK_TPL=lda_doc.tpl&amp;KEY=obj%2009010182 Friedhof der Elisabeth-Gemeinde], Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt, Berlin {{de icon}}, retrieved 23 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s and 1880s, the character of the street was greatly changed with the building of [[tenement]]s. The Ackerhöfe at numbers 14&amp;ndash;15, unusual in occupying two of the original land parcels, are a restored complex of tenements built in four phases between 1867 and 1911, the last phase representing an attempt at housing reform.&lt;ref name="Ackerhöfe"/&gt; The most notorious tenement in Berlin, [[Meyers Hof]], was at number 132.&lt;ref name=Nowel&gt;Ingrid Nowel, ''Berlin: Die neue Hauptstadt: Architektur und Kunst, Geschichte und Literatur'', Dumont Kunstreiseführer, Cologne: DuMont, 2001, {{ISBN|9783770155774}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF4aQgX-gB8C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq=Klaus+Kordon,+Die+roten+Matrosen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b5iCxasBRz&amp;sig=0lyhjcLx_P_vpYzOfKnW6xZ4xOo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JpoNUM3nCObC2gW3j_QG&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Meyers%20Hof&amp;f=false p. 324] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Hake, ''Topographies of Class: Modern Architecture and Mass Society in Weimar Berlin'', Social history, popular culture, and politics in Germany, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 2008, {{ISBN|9780472070381}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sFooWhwOgo4C&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Bodenschatz,+Platz+frei&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IB5uobZiB6&amp;sig=grYeaEMrWOZSuStkwxFQSDYGT3M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RLENUJ7FLtT-2QX6rIDABQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Meyers%20Hof&amp;f=false p. 281].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the original covered markets of Berlin, now known as the ''Ackerhalle'', was built on the corner with Invalidenstraße in 1886&amp;ndash;88 and is still in use; it is the only one that retains its original façade.&lt;ref name=Dubilski&gt;Petra Dubilski, ''Berlin'', Dumont Reise-Taschenbücher, Cologne: DuMont, 2001, {{ISBN|9783770155965}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XCcSVNgmNeoC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=Ackerstra%C3%9Fe,+Grenzstreifen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FltCnDwuLT&amp;sig=D99CcRk4gnr58-77ozY4Cn32LRo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HaQNUPj-OYSq2QWW0oHQAg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=noch%20im%20Januar%201985%20die%20Vers%C3%B6hnungskirche%2C%20die%20im%20Grenzstreifen%20lag%2C&amp;f=false p. 217] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19 historic buildings on the street are protected historic monuments of the city of Berlin: 1&amp;ndash;5, 10&amp;ndash;13, 16/17, 19&amp;ndash;22, 144&amp;ndash;147, 154/155, 165, and 171.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/cgi-bin/hidaweb/getdoc.pl?DOK_TPL=lda_doc.tpl&amp;KEY=obj%2009010061 Ensemble ehem.

From 1961 to 1989, the [[Berlin Wall]] divided the city. It ran along [[Bernauer Straße]], and required closing a section of Ackerstraße at the corner with that street, which fell within the "death strip"; a church in this part of Ackerstraße, the [[Kapelle der Versöhnung#Church of Reconciliation|Versöhnungskirche (Church of Reconciliation)]], was dynamited by the East German authorities in 1985.&lt;ref name=Dubilski/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Magercord, ''Meine Mauer: Fotografien eines Westberliners 1986 bis 1993'', Erfurt: Sutton, 2011, {{ISBN|9783866807860}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wu0mMhJpKQgC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Ackerstra%C3%9Fe,+Grenzstreifen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UvjBXbM4R6&amp;sig=Tq44a1XBCQE0-C_ri9A-mUvX4dI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HaQNUPj-OYSq2QWW0oHQAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Ackerstra%C3%9Fe%2C%20Grenzstreifen&amp;f=false pp. 72&amp;ndash;73] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In commemoration of the Wall and those who died attempting to cross it, a portion of the main and inner walls and the "death strip" are preserved on Bernauer Straße at the corner of Ackerstraße as part of the [[Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer]] (Berlin Wall Memorial);&lt;ref&gt;Damien Simonis, ''Berlin'', National Geographic traveler, Washington, DC: [[National Geographic Society]], 2006, {{ISBN|9780792262121}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU_LRiSFgMUC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=Ackerstra%C3%9Fe,+Mauer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=356C8QQcJT&amp;sig=vEOQH8v2q9ayklqjmCWCI8NoH3I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tqANUOa4IafO2AXtjIHACA&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Ackerstra%C3%9Fe%2C%20Mauer&amp;f=false p. 114].&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|212|m|ft}} of the border strip along Bernauer Straße between Ackerstraße and Bergstraße were made a protected landmark on 2 October 1990&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Tacke, "Die Mauer im Kopfe: Mauerbau &amp; -fall im kollektiven Gedächtnis", in ''NachBilder der Wende'', ed.

In 1973, she received her PhD in English Education from the [[University of Iowa]].&lt;ref name="Emeritus Voices"&gt;{{cite web |title=Emeritus Voices Authors and Artists |url=https://emerituscollege.asu.edu/sites/default/files/ecdw/EVoicesGeneric/homeauthor.html |website=The Journal of the Emeritus College at ASU |publisher=Arizona State University |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nilsen |first1=Alleen Pace |last2=Nilsen |first2=Don |title=Growing Old in a Primitive Culture vs. Growing Old in a Capitalistic Culture |url=https://emerituscollege.asu.edu/sites/default/files/ecdw/EVoice10/growing_old_in.html |website=Emeritus Voices |publisher=Arizona State University |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her dissertation dealt with occurrences of sexist language in school materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arter |first1=Lisa |title=Pushing Good Books: Alleen Pace Nilsen, Winner of the 2006 Hipple Award |journal=ALAN Review |date=2006 |volume=35 |issue=1 |url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v35n1/arter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Nilsen and Kenneth L. Donelson co-authored ''Literature for Today's Young Adults'', which became a seminal textbook for teachers and librarians and has seen nine editions so far&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bucher |first1=Katherine T. |last2=Hinton |first2=KaaVonia |title=Young adult literature: Exploration, evaluation, and appreciation |date=2014 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=9780133066791 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 1980s, Nilsen was also co-editor of the ''English Journal for the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] (NCTE)'', a president of [[The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents]] of NCTE (ALAN), and a founding editor of ''ALAN Review''.&lt;ref name="Emeritus Voices"/&gt; In 1987, she received the ALAN award, a yearly award whose aim is to "honor those who have made outstanding contributions to the field of adolescent literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ALAN Award |url=http://www.alan-ya.org/awards/alan-award/ |website=Assembly on Literature for Adolescents of NCTE |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other work ==
Between 1967 and 1969, Alleen lived in [[Afghanistan]], where she accompanied her husband Don on an international development mission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brigham Young University |url=https://magazine.byu.edu/article/profiles-10/ |website=Profiles: Summer 2002 issue |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Based on these experiences, the couple created a website called [http://www.public.asu.edu/~apnilsen/afghanistan4kids/ "Afghanistan for Kids"], which aims to educate American children and their parents about the country.

Don and Alleen Nilsen have also created several dozens of introductory PowerPoint presentations with the aim of educating the general public about humor research, gender, and other topics their academic work has touch upon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Don and Alleen Nilsen's Educational Powerpoint Presentations |url=https://www.aath.org/don-and-alleen-power-points |website=Association for Applied and Therapeutic Humor |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Commons category|Amarna letters}}

'''Amarna letter EA 86''', (see here [https://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00330/AN00330504_001_l.jpg] ), titled: ''Complaint to an Official,''&lt;ref&gt;Moran 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 86, ''Complaint to an Official,'' pp. 158-9.&lt;/ref&gt; is a somewhat moderate length [[clay tablet]] letter from [[Rib-Hadda]] of [[city-state]] [[Byblos]] (named ''Gubla'' in the letter) to Amanappa, an official at the court of the Pharaoh.

The letter has a degraded surface of the clay; it also has missing corners and part of a side. The tablet's obverse fails to yield an easy translation for the last lines of the front and bottom, lines 18-22 (ten percent of the 50-line text). And other [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] are found throughout the translation.

EA 86 is an extremely ovate, pillow-shaped (thick) clay tablet. It is located in the [[British Museum]], no. 29804.

'''''Angelic Salutation''''' (German: '''''Engelsgruß''''') is an assemblage of [[limewood]] sculptures celebrating the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Germany|German]] artist [[Veit Stoss]] in 1518. It was created for the medieval church of [[St. Lorenz, Nuremberg|St. Lorenz]] in [[Nuremberg]], southern Germany, where it hangs on a metal chain in the center of the choir facing the [[high altar]]. It was commissioned in 1517 by the German merchant, city councillor and treasurer [[Tucher von Simmelsdorf|Anton Tucher]] as a devotional centerpiece for those reciting the [[rosary]] or other [[Marian devotions]].&lt;ref name="H74"&gt;Heal, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Tucher employed [[Albrecht Dürer]] to review the quality of the piece before final payment was determined and made to Stoss.&lt;ref name="S353"&gt;Smith, 353&lt;/ref&gt; The work shows the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] surrounded by a series of small angels, many of whom are ringing bells in celebration or joyfully playing musical instruments. The statues are suspended within the encircling frame of a [[garland|wreath]] of roses embedded with eight medallions illustrating scenes from both the [[Life of the Virgin]] and [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]. Stoss created a large gilded crown to hang over the frame, but this is now lost. Tucher commissioned craftsman Jakob Pulmann to design and install an iron [[candelabra]] holding a miniature statue of Mary in order to illuminate Stoss's work.&lt;ref name="S353" /&gt;

The ensemble was completed on the eve of the [[Protestant Reformation|German Reformation]], when Lutheran reformers introduced ideas of [[iconoclasm]] as they began to question both the need for, and purpose of religious art.&lt;ref name="S354"&gt;Smith, 354&lt;/ref&gt; In 1525 Tucher and the city split from the Catholic church in favour of [[Lutheranism]].&lt;ref name="S353" /&gt; From 1519 a green fabric was placed over the work, and it was allowed to be uncovered only on [[Holy day of obligation|holy days]]. It had long been thought that the covering was imposed by iconoclasts, however the 20th-century discovery of a document drawn up by Tucher finds mention of payment for the cloth indicating that the shroud was part of the original design. In 1529 it stopped being uncovered for Church holidays. A 1756 record reveals that because the Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]] "preached against this image and called the Mary a golden milk-maid a green coverage was made for it."&lt;ref name="H74" /&gt;

In the late 1520s ''Angelic Salutation'' was seen as merely devotional, with no liturgical purpose; it celebrated Mary rather than Jesus and was centered on the rosary which fell out of favour with the Lutherans.&lt;ref name="S353" /&gt; It was expensive to maintain, and it was argued that the money paid for its upkeep could be better spent providing for the poor.&lt;ref name="S354" /&gt; Because the work was deemed the private property of the wealthy and influential Tucher family it mostly escaped destruction. Generally, in post-reformation Germany, religious art commissioned by nobility was spared if it was taken into private collection. Yet the ''Angelic Salutation'' was allowed to remain - albeit shrouded - in a public area,&lt;ref name="H104"&gt;Heal, 104&lt;/ref&gt; an indication of the city of Nuremberg's pride in its heritage.&lt;ref name="H109"&gt;Heal, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Only the crown was disassembled and demolished, and the centerpiece covered and largely decommissioned. The work remained threaten{{clarify|date=February 2016}} and was described as "a disgrace to Nuremberg". At one point a collection was made to replace the metal suspension with hemp to save costs. However, in 1817 this rope broke.&lt;ref&gt;Brockmann, Stephen. ''Nuremberg: The Imaginary Capital''. London: Camden House, 2006. 36. {{ISBN|1-5711-3345-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the end of the 19th century that the ''Angelic Salutation'' was permanently uncovered and opened to the public.&lt;ref name="S353" /&gt;

The avant-garde pushes the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Many [[artists]] have aligned themselves with the avant-garde movement and still continue to do so, tracing a history from [[Dada]] through [[Situationist International|the Situationists]] to postmodern artists such as the [[Language poets]] around 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubu.com/ UBU Web] List of artists from Dada to the present day aligning themselves with the avant-garde&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2016}}

The avant-garde also promotes radical social reforms. It was this meaning that was evoked by the [[Saint Simonian]] [[Olinde Rodrigues]] in his essay "L'artiste, le savant et l'industriel" ("The artist, the scientist and the industrialist", 1825), which contains the first recorded use of "avant-garde" in its now customary sense: there, Rodrigues calls on artists to "serve as [the people's] avant-garde", insisting that "the power of the arts is indeed the most immediate and fastest way" to social, political and economic reform.&lt;ref&gt;Matei Calinescu, ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/five-faces-of-modernity/ The Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-Garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism]'' (Durham: [[Duke University Press]], 1987), {{Page needed|date=May 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers have attempted to map the parameters of avant-garde activity. The Italian essayist [[Renato Poggioli]] provides one of the earliest analyses of vanguardism as a cultural phenomenon in his 1962 book ''Teoria dell'arte d'avanguardia'' (''The Theory of the Avant-Garde'').&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Bru and Gunther Martens, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=suPzDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 The Invention of Politics in the European Avant-Garde (1906–1940)]'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2006), p. 21. {{ISBN|9042019093}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying the historical, social, psychological and philosophical aspects of [[vanguardism]], Poggioli reaches beyond individual instances of art, poetry, and music to show that vanguardists may share certain ideals or values which manifest themselves in the non-conformist lifestyles they adopt: He sees  vanguard culture as a variety or subcategory of [[Bohemianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Renato Poggioli|title=The Theory of the Avant-Garde |publisher=Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]]| year = 1968 | isbn = 0-674-88216-4 |page=11}}, translated from the Italian by Gerald Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted both to clarify and to extend Poggioli's study. The [[Germans|German]] literary critic Peter Bürger's ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'' (1974) looks at [[the Establishment]]'s embrace of socially critical works of art and suggests that in complicity with capitalism, "art as an institution neutralizes the political content of the individual work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Peter Bürger|title=Theorie der Avantgarde|publisher=Suhrkamp Verlag|year=1974}} English translation (University of Minnesota Press) 1984: 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bürger's essay also greatly influenced the work of contemporary American art-historians such as the German [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]] (born 1941). Buchloh, in the collection of essays ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry'' (2000) critically argues for a dialectical approach to these positions.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Buchloh, ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry: Essays on European and American Art from 1955 to 1975'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-02454-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent criticism theorized the limitations of these approaches, noting their circumscribed areas of analysis, including Eurocentric, chauvinist, and genre-specific definitions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relation to mainstream society==
{{See|Mainstream}}
{{see also|Media culture|Spectacle (critical theory)}}
The concept of avant-garde refers primarily to artists, writers, composers and thinkers whose work is opposed to mainstream cultural values and often has a trenchant social or political edge. Many writers, critics and theorists made assertions about vanguard culture during the formative years of modernism, although the initial definitive statement on the avant-garde was the essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'' by New York art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Greenberg |first= Clement|date=Fall 1939 |title=Avant-Garde and Kitsch |url=http://hgar-srv3.bu.edu/collections/partisan-review/search/detail?id=283920 |magazine=The Partisan Review |pages=34-49 |volume=6 |issue=5 |access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg argued that vanguard culture has historically been opposed to "high" or "mainstream" culture, and that it has also rejected the artificially synthesized [[mass culture]] that has been produced by industrialization. Each of these media is a direct product of [[Capitalism]]—they are all now substantial industries—and as such they are driven by the same profit-fixated motives of other sectors of manufacturing, not the ideals of true art. For Greenberg, these forms were therefore ''[[kitsch]]'': phony, faked or mechanical culture, which often pretended to be more than they were by using formal devices stolen from vanguard culture. For instance, during the 1930s the advertising industry was quick to take visual mannerisms from [[surrealism]], but this does not mean that 1930s advertising photographs are truly surreal.

[[File:AdornoHorkheimerHabermasbyJeremyJShapiro2.png|thumb|right|[[Max Horkheimer]] (front left), [[Theodor Adorno]] (front right), and [[Jürgen Habermas]] in the background, right, in 1965 at [[Heidelberg]], [[West Germany]].]]

Various members of the [[Frankfurt School]] argued similar views: thus [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] in their essay ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment|The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass-Deception]]'' (1944), and also [[Walter Benjamin]] in his highly influential "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1935, rev. 1939).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, "[http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205013822/http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html |date=5 December 2006 }}{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--Place, publisher, translator, etc. needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Where Greenberg used the German word ''[[kitsch]]'' to describe the antithesis of avant-garde culture, members of the Frankfurt School coined the term "[[mass culture]]" to indicate that this bogus culture is constantly being manufactured by a newly emerged [[culture industry]] (comprising commercial publishing houses, the movie industry, the record industry, and the electronic media).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/adorno_culture_reconsidered.pdf Theodor W. Adorno (1963)], "[[Culture Industry Reconsidered]]: Selected Essays on Mass Culture", London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; They also pointed out that the rise of this industry meant that artistic excellence was displaced by sales figures as a measure of worth: a novel, for example, was judged meritorious solely on whether it became a best-seller, music succumbed to ratings charts and to the blunt commercial logic of the Gold disc. In this way the autonomous artistic merit so dear to the vanguardist was abandoned and sales increasingly became the measure, and justification, of everything. Consumer culture now ruled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The avant-garde's [[Recuperation (politics)|co-option]] by the global capitalist market, by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economies, and by what [[Guy Debord]] called ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', have made contemporary critics speculate on the possibility of a meaningful avant-garde today. Paul Mann's ''Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde'' demonstrates how completely the avant-garde is embedded within institutional structures today, a thought also pursued by [[Richard Schechner]] in his analyses of avant-garde performance.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Schechner, "The Conservative Avant-Garde." ''New Literary History'' 41.4 (Autumn 2010): 895–913.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the central arguments of Greenberg, Adorno and others, various sectors of the mainstream culture industry have co-opted and misapplied the term "avant-garde" since the 1960s, chiefly as a marketing tool to publicise popular music and commercial cinema. It has become common to describe successful rock musicians and celebrated film-makers as "avant-garde", the very word having been stripped of its proper meaning. Noting this important conceptual shift, major contemporary theorists such as [[Matei Calinescu]] in ''Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism'' (1987),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} and Hans Bertens in ''The Idea of the Postmodern: A History'' (1995),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} have suggested that this is a sign our culture has entered a new [[post-modern]] age, when the former [[modernist]] ways of thinking and behaving have been rendered redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Calinescu 1987,{{page needed|date=September 2012}}; Bertens 1995.{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, an incisive critique of vanguardism as against the views of mainstream society was offered by the New York critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The De-Definition of Art: Action Art to Pop to Earthworks'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 219 {{ISBN|0-226-72673-8}}. Originally published: New York: Horizon Press, 1972; reprinted New York: Collier Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to strike a balance between the insights of Renato Poggioli and the claims of Clement Greenberg, Rosenberg suggested that from the mid-1960s onward progressive culture ceased to fulfill its former adversarial role. Since then it has been flanked by what he called "avant-garde ghosts to the one side, and a changing mass culture on the other", both of which it interacts with to varying degrees. This has seen culture become, in his words, "a profession one of whose aspects is the pretense of overthrowing it".&lt;ref&gt;George Dickie, "[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Arts/Arts-idx?type=turn&amp;id=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2&amp;entity=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2.p0074&amp;isize=text "Symposium on Marxist Aesthetic Thought: Commentary on the Papers by Rudich, San Juan, and Morawski]", ''Arts in Society: Art and Social Experience: Our Changing Outlook on Culture'' 12, no. 2 (Summer–Fall 1975): p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Music===
{{Main article|Avant-garde music}}
Avant-garde in music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner.&lt;ref name=iha&gt;David Nicholls (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of American Music'' (Cambridge and New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1998), 122–24. {{ISBN|0-521-45429-8}} {{ISBN|978-0-521-54554-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether.&lt;ref name="Samson"&gt;Jim Samson, "Avant garde", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, some avant-garde composers of the 20th century include [[Arnold Schoenberg]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xiv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ives]],&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), 222. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv" /&gt; [[Anton Webern]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_50"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), 50. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Antheil]] (in his earliest works only), [[Alban Berg]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_50" /&gt; [[Henry Cowell]] (in his earliest works), [[Philip Glass]], [[Harry Partch]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Richard Strauss]] (in his earliest work),&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiii"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xiii–xiv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]],&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Schwartz, Barney Childs, and James Fox (eds.), ''Contemporary Composers on Contemporary Music'' (New York: Da Capo Press, 1998), 379. {{ISBN|0-306-80819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgard Varèse]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv" /&gt; Although most avant-garde composers have been men, this is not exclusively the case. Women avant-gardists include [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Diamanda Galás]], [[Meredith Monk]], and [[Laurie Anderson]].&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xvii"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xvii. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another definition of "Avant-gardism" that distinguishes it from "modernism": Peter Bürger, for example, says avant-gardism rejects the "institution of art" and challenges social and artistic values, and so necessarily involves political, social, and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="Samson" /&gt; According to the composer and musicologist [[Larry Sitsky]], modernist composers from the early 20th century who do not qualify as avant-gardists include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Igor Stravinsky; later modernist composers who do not fall into the category of avant-gardists include [[Elliott Carter]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], and [[Luciano Berio]], since "their modernism was not conceived for the purpose of goading an audience."&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xv"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Experimental theatre}}

Whereas the avant-garde has a significant history in 20th-century music, it is more pronounced in theatre and performance art, and often in conjunction with music and sound design innovations, as well as developments in visual media design. There are movements in theatre history that are characterized by their contributions to the avant-garde traditions in both the United States and Europe. Among these are [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Neo-Dada]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10387">'''Bounded emotionality''' is a [[communications studies]] approach to dealing with [[emotional control]] in the workplace. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotional control simply refers to how [[Employment|employers and employees]] handle the range of emotions that naturally occur in the [[workplace]]. These emotions can occur because of work, or they can be brought into work from an employee's home life. Bounded emotionality was proposed by [[Dennis K. Mumby]] and [[Linda L. Putnam]]. Mumby and Putnam (1992) stress that bounded emotionality encourages the [[Emotional expression|expression]] of a wide range of emotions. Their theory encourages expression of emotions because it is a way to maintain [[interpersonal relationships]] and [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] among people in the organization. Additionally, the expression of emotions strengthens work relations because people bond over mutual feelings. Bounded emotionality is a broad framework for organizations to use when dealing with emotions.  It has six defining characteristics. The characteristics are: [[intersubjective]] limitations, spontaneously emergent work feelings, tolerance of [[ambiguity]], [[heterarchy]] of values, integrated [[self identity]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]], and [[Sense of community|community]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Origins ==
Prior to Mumby and Putnam's specific articulation of bounded emotionality research and the role it plays in what is known about organizational emotion regulation, workplace emotion research focused on the relationship between emotion regulation, [[work performance]] and general attitudes towards work. Traditionally, two concepts, '''[[bounded rationality]]''' and '''[[emotional labor]]''' were used to describe conventional organizational theory pertaining to emotional regulation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Bounded Rationality:''' Whereas bounded emotionality encourages the expression of a large spectrum of emotions in organizational communication, bounded rationality advocates for the “control” or tempering of any emotion or [[Personality|personal characteristics]] that may interfere with [[rational]] organizational decision making. Simon introduced the term bounded rationality and cast it as “bounded” because he viewed highly emotion-based forms of reasoning such as [[intuition]] and [[judgement]] as [[irrational]] and thus unhelpful in reaching organizational goals. Bounded rationality approaches to emotional regulation not only devalue individual emotion in the workplace but also view excessive emotional expression as [[inappropriate]] for the work setting. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Emotional Labor:''' Emotional labor refers to the way in which individuals manage emotions based on what is perceived as “appropriate” in specific social or environmental situations. Human beings often pay close attention to their surroundings and how they should act in certain social situations. A variety of organizational factors as well as personal factors may impact emotional regulation including: [[socialization]], [[Interpersonal_communication#Situational_milieu|channels of communication]], departmental differences (e.g. sales vs. packaging), etc. In an organization that deploys a bounded emotionality approach to emotional regulation, much less emotional labor will be required than an organization that deploys a bounded rationality approach.

Mumby and Putnam introduced the concept of bounded emotionality as an alternative organizational concept to bounded rationality and emotional labor in order to demonstrate the instability of traditional understandings and highlight what they believe to be the importance of emotions in organizational decision-making. In an organization framed by bounded emotionality (as opposed to bounded rationality and emotional labor), hierarchical goals and values are flexible as emotion and the physical self are not isolated from the process of organizing. In other words, emotions are “bounded” in organizations to protect [[interpersonal relationships]] and mutual understandings, two organizational aspects that Mumby and Putnam argue as important to success. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Bounded emotionality vs. Unbounded emotionality ==

'''Unbounded Emotionality''' should be enacted not for the instrumental gain of the organization, but to enhance the well-being of the individual organizational members. [[Work stress]] is a political, organizational and community issue that can be difficult to implement in large organizations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Bounded Emotionality''' is a limited, pragmatic approach to the problem of emotional control in organizations. It focuses on work related emotions, defined as, “feelings, sensations, and affective responses to organizational sensations”. However, it is acknowledged that such work feelings stem from and affect emotions that come from one’s [[personal life]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Encourages the expression of a wider range of emotions than is usually condoned in traditional and [[normative]] organizations

* Stresses the importance of maintaining interpersonally sensitive, variable boundaries between what is felt and what is expressed

* The goal of bounded emotionality to build interpersonal relationships through mutual understanding of work related feelings

* Six defining characteristics &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Defining characteristics ==
'''Intersubjective Limitations''': This is a necessary restriction known by individuals in the organization that helps them adequately work with and respond to one another . Just as individuals do in personal relationships, they need to respect emotional boundaries in professional ones. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: If a coworker feels certain emotional expressions or topics are inappropriate, you will not discuss them. Similarly, they will respect what you find inappropriate. Those [[personal boundaries]] are the intersubjective limitations of the work relationship.  For instance, a cabin crew member may be absolutely repulsed by vomit, but when a passenger vomits that cabin crew member controls the disgust and helps calms the passenger down. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Spontaneously emergent work feelings''': Feelings about work emerge in response to work tasks. Generally these form around the organizations [[Organisation climate|climate]] and [[workplace|environment]]. This is natural and [[management]] should not try to ascribe feelings to employees. When spontaneous feelings emerge they should be dealt with within the previously set intersubjective limitations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: An example of this would be a study done on [[hair stylists]]. The study found that for the employee they found enjoyment when a [[customer]] confided in them about a private matter. That consumer as well would find it satisfying, therefore more likely to return. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tolerance of [[ambiguity]]''': Complex emotions are likely to occur because of emotional labor (the process of controlling emotions during interactions at work). Bounded emotionality entails tolerance of these complex emotions. Contradictory feelings must coexist. This constitutes a new norm that wants to be aware of different positions, and even those directly opposite among its organizational members. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: People with low tolerance of ambiguity experience stress react prematurely and avoid ambiguous stimuli. The person with high tolerance will look at ambiguous situations as desirable, challenging, and interesting. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Heterarchy]] of [[values]]''': The opposite of [[hierarchy]] of values, or placing certain values as more important than others. A heterarchy of values means that no one is set above another. The context of situations and individual preferences determines what values may be prioritized in a given moment. There is not just one universal set of values guiding one's life choices. Heterarchy is designed for handling the innovative side of things therefore it requires a different form of conflict management. This helps prevent undermining the governing logic. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: An individual may highly value human life but be against abortion rights, but maybe be for the death penalty, or the other way around. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Integrated [[Self-concept|Self Identity]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|Authenticity]]''': Bounded emotionality assumes that people have one single [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. This means that that their [[personality]], their [[values]], and their actions are the same no matter where they are physically. The goal of bounded emotionality is to make it easy to be one's [[true self]] while at work. It means you are part of a social collective working toward obtaining goals for your organization. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: If an [[actor]] brings in private experiences to create an original character presentation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Sense of community|Community]]''': The purpose of bounded emotionality is to create a strong sense of community among its members. There is a need for connections within freedom and for diversity within individuality.  Research has shown this structure works best in smaller organizations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: When a director encourages questions and then the director discusses performance related critiques with them afterwards developing a sense of togetherness. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Callanish Stones''' (or "Callanish I", ''Clachan Chalanais'' or ''Tursachan Chalanais'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]]) are an arrangement of [[Menhir|standing stones]] placed in a [[cruciform]] pattern with a central [[stone circle]]. They were erected in the late [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] era, and were a focus for ritual activity during the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]. They are near the village of [[Callanish]] (Gaelic: ''Calanais'') on the west coast of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], Scotland.

==Location==
The Callanish Stones ({{gbmapping|NB213330}}) are situated on a low ridge above the waters of [[Loch Roag]] with the hills of [[Great Bernera]] as a backdrop.&lt;ref name="hsoverview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_051&amp;PropName=Calanais%20Standing%20Stones |title=Calanais Standing Stones Property Overview |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other ritual sites lie within a few kilometres.&lt;ref name="hsoverview"/&gt; These include at least three other circles, several arcs, alignments and single stones; many visible from the main site.&lt;ref name="armit82"&gt;{{cite book |last=Armit |first=Ian |date=1996 |title=The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=82 |isbn=0748606408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most impressive – [[Callanish II]] and [[Callanish III]] – lie just over a kilometre southeast of the main Callanish Stones, and originally consisted of circles of stones at least eight in number.&lt;ref name="hsoverview"/&gt; The existence of other monuments in the area implies that Callanish was an active focus for prehistoric religious activity for at least 1500 years.&lt;ref name="hsabout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertyabout.htm?PropID=PL_051&amp;PropName=Calanais%20Standing%20Stones |title=Calanais Standing Stones About the Property |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Callanish III]], [[Callanish IV]], [[Callanish VIII]] and [[Callanish X]]).

==Management==
The Callanish Stones are managed by [[Historic Environment Scotland]]. There is a visitor centre operated by Urras Nan Tursachan (The Standing Stones Trust).

==Description==
[[File:Plan of the Callanish Stones.png|thumb|right|Map of the Callanish Stones]]
The Callanish Stones consist of a [[stone circle]] of thirteen stones with a monolith near the middle. Five [[Stone row|rows]] of standing stones connect to this circle. Two long rows of stones running almost parallel to each other from the stone circle to the north-northeast form a kind of [[Avenue (archaeology)|avenue]]. In addition, there are shorter rows of stones to the west-southwest, south and east-northeast. The stones are all of the same rock type, namely the local [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]]. Within the stone circle is a chambered tomb to the east of the central stone.

===Centre stone===
The central monolith stands 0.8 metres west of the true centre of the stone circle. The stone is 4.8 metres high, 1.5 metres wide and 0.3 metres thick.&lt;ref name="burl149"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |date=2005 |title=A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |publisher=Yale University Press |page=149 |isbn=0300114060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest sides of the stone are almost perfectly oriented to the north and south.&lt;ref name="burl149"/&gt; The monolith has the shape of a ship's rudder and probably weighs about seven tonnes.&lt;ref name="burl149"/&gt;

===Stone circle===
The stone circle consists of thirteen stones and has a diameter of 11.4 metres. The stone circle is not a perfect circle, but is a ring with a flattened east side (13.4 metres north-south by 12 metres east-west). The stones have an average height of three metres. The ring covers an area of 124 square metres. This is quite small compared to similar circles, including the nearby [[Callanish II]] which is 2.5 times as large.&lt;ref name="burl149"/&gt;

===Northern avenue===
The avenue connects to the stone circle from the north-northeast. The avenue is 83.2 metres long.&lt;ref name="burl149"/&gt; The avenue has 19 stones remaining: nine stones are on the eastern side, ten on the western side.&lt;ref name="burl150"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |date=2005 |title=A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |publisher=Yale University Press |page=150 |isbn=0300114060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest stone is 3.5 metres high and stands on the western end of the row. The two rows are not exactly parallel to each other but fan out: at the north end the rows are 6.7 metres apart, while the distance between the rows is 6 metres at the south end.&lt;ref name="burl150"/&gt; From the circle the height of the stones decreases towards the middle of the avenue; from there the height increases again. The stones of the eastern side of the avenue have only three-quarters of the height of the stones on the western side.&lt;ref name="burl150"/&gt;

===Stone rows===
As well as the two stone rows of the avenue, there are three stone rows connecting to the circle. One comes from the east-northeast, one from the south, and one from the west-southwest. The east-northeast row today consists of five stones and is 23.2 metres long.&lt;ref name="burl150"/&gt; The southern row consists of five stones and is 27.2 metres long.&lt;ref name="burl150"/&gt; The west-southwest row consists of four stones and is 13 metres long.&lt;ref name="burl150"/&gt;

None of the stone rows is aimed at the centre of the stone circle. The east-northeast row is aligned to a point 2 metres south of the centre; the south row points to 1 metre west of the centre and the west-southwest row points to 1 metre south of the centre.&lt;ref name="burl150"/&gt;

===Chambered tomb===
[[File:Callanish I 2011 17.JPG|thumb|right|Chambered tomb]]
Between the central and the eastern monolith of the stone circle is a [[chambered tomb]] 6.4 metres long.&lt;ref name="burl151"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |date=2005 |title=A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |publisher=Yale University Press |page=151 |isbn=0300114060}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was built later than the stone circle and is squashed in between the eastern stones and the central monolith.&lt;ref name="burl151"/&gt;

There is another stone [[cairn]] just on the northeast side of the stone circle.&lt;ref name="rcahms"&gt;{{Canmore |num=4156 |desc=Lewis, Callanish |access-date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reduced to ground-level and the outline can barely be traced.&lt;ref name="rcahms"/&gt; It is not necessarily an original part of the site.&lt;ref name="rcahms"/&gt;

==Archaeology and dating==
[[File:Callanish-circle.jpg|thumb|right|A distant view of the circle, stone rows and part of the northern avenue]]
There were limited excavations in 1980–81 which provided some information on the development of the site. The first traces of human activity are indicated by a broad ditch (no longer visible above ground) which appears to have belonged to some structure or enclosure.&lt;ref name="armit82"/&gt; This may have been ritual, but could instead have been domestic.&lt;ref name="armit82"/&gt; In the centuries around 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, however, the site was turned over to agriculture, which obliterated most of the earlier traces.&lt;ref name="armit82"/&gt; After this, the site was allowed to grass over for a time.&lt;ref name="armit82"/&gt;

The stone circle was set up between 2900 and 2600&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="hsabout"/&gt; It is not clear whether the stone alignments were constructed at the same time as the circle, or later.&lt;ref name="hsabout"/&gt; Some time after the erection of the stones, a small chambered tomb was inserted into the eastern part of the stone circle.&lt;ref name="armit83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Armit |first=Ian |date=1996 |title=The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=83 |isbn=0748606408}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many pottery fragments found indicate that the tomb was used for several centuries.&lt;ref name="armit83"/&gt; These pottery fragments included not only the local Hebridean pots, but numerous sherds of [[Beaker culture|beaker vessels]] (dating to around 2000–1700 BC) and sherds of [[grooved ware]].&lt;ref name="armit83"/&gt;

Around 1500–1000 BC the complex fell out of use and was despoiled by the later Bronze Age farmers.&lt;ref name="armit83"/&gt; Fragments of pots appear to have been cast out of the chamber.&lt;ref name="armit83"/&gt; This may have been just ordinary agriculture, but it may conceivably have been ritual cleansing.&lt;ref name="hsoverview"/&gt; There appears to have been a later rebuilding of the tomb, but this may have been for domestic use as there is no evidence for any later ritual use of the monument.&lt;ref name="armit83"/&gt; Between 1000 BC and 500&amp;nbsp;BC the stones were covered by a thick layer of turf. It is estimated that the place was abandoned around 800&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashmore |first=P. |date=2002 |title=Calanais Standing Stones |publisher=Historic Scotland |page=36 |isbn=1-903570-59-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in 1857 was the overlying 1.5&amp;nbsp;metres of [[peat]] removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashmore |first=P. |date=2002 |title=Calanais Standing Stones |publisher=Historic Scotland |page=22 |isbn=1-903570-59-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
[[File:Callanish Stones 3.jpg|alt=Callanish Stones|thumb|Callanish Stones]]
The first written reference to the stones was by Lewis native John Morisone, who around 1680 wrote that the stones were men "converted into stone by ane Inchanter" and set up in a ring "for devotione".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |date=2005 |title=Prehistoric Astronomy and Ritual |publisher=Osprey |page=18 |isbn=0747806144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime around 1695 [[Martin Martin]] visited the site and was told by the local people that "it was a place appointed for worship in the time of heathenism, and that the chief druid or priest stood near the big stone in the centre, from whence he addressed himself to the people that surrounded him."&lt;ref name="armit82"/&gt; In his 1726 work on the [[druid]]s, [[John Toland]] specifically identified [[Diodorus Siculus]]' ''[[Hyperborea]]'' with Lewis, and the "spherical temple" mentioned by Diodorus with the Callanish Stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haycock|first1=David Boyd|title=William Stukeley: Science, Religion and Archaeology in Eighteenth-Century England|date=2002|publisher=[[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]|location=Woodbridge, UK|isbn=9780851158648|url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00024|accessdate=12 March 2016|chapter=Chapter 7: Much Greater, Than Commonly Imagined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1743, [[William Stukeley]] described the stone circle as a druid circle and the avenue like a serpent.&lt;ref name="ashmore20"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashmore |first=P. |date=2002 |title=Calanais Standing Stones |publisher=Historic Scotland |page=20 |isbn=1-903570-59-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, geologist [[John MacCulloch]] published the first accurate description.&lt;ref name="ashmore20"/&gt; In 1846, the Danish historian [[J. J. A. Worsaae]] made a sketch and plan of the Callanish Stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashmore |first=P. |date=2002 |title=Calanais Standing Stones |publisher=Historic Scotland |page=21 |isbn=1-903570-59-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 [[peat]] to a depth of five feet (1.5 metres) was cleared away, under the orders of the proprietor of Lewis, [[James Matheson]], revealing the chambered tomb and the true height of the stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ritchie |first=Graham |last2=Ritchie |first2=Anna |date=1991 |title=Scotland: Archaeology and Early History |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=58 |isbn=0748602917}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 the Callanish Stones were taken into state care.&lt;ref name="hsoverview"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[Alexander Thom]] and [[Gerald Hawkins]] suggested that the stones were a prehistoric lunar observatory. Others have proposed a relationship between the stones, the moon and the [[Clisham]] range on Harris. Critics of these theories argue that several alignments are likely to exist purely by chance in any such structure, and many factors such as the weathering and displacement of the stones over the millennia mean there can be no certainty of any alignments, original or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armit|first=Ian|title=The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles|year=1996|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=0748606408|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folklore==
According to one tradition, the Callanish Stones were petrified giants who would not convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name="burl151"/&gt; In the 17th century the people of Lewis were calling the stones ''fir bhrèige'' ("false men").&lt;ref name="hsoverview"/&gt; Another legend is that early on [[summer solstice|midsummer morning]] an entity known as the "Shining One" walks the length of the avenue, his coming heralded by the call of the cuckoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Westwood |first=Jennifer |date=1985 |title=Albion: A Guide to Legendary Britain |publisher=Grafton Books |page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:Callanish Stones in summer 2012 (7).JPG|thumb|Callanish Stones]]
*In 1974, the sculptor [[Gerald Laing]] created a work known as ''Callanish'' for [[Strathclyde University]]'s  campus in the centre of [[Glasgow]]. He planted 16 abstract steel girders in the ground, intended to relate to the configuration of the stones.  The sculpture is popularly referred to as "Steelhenge".
*The stones feature as a setting in the 1974 novel ''[[Lookout Cartridge]]'' by American author [[Joseph McElroy]].
*In 1984, the [[new romantic]] band [[Ultravox]] used an image of the stones on the cover of their album ''[[Lament (Ultravox album)|Lament]].'' They filmed their video of "[[One Small Day]]" at the site; it is the first single taken from that album.
*In 1988 [[Jon Mark]] released a CD, ''The Standing Stones of Callanish'', intended to evoke Britain's Celtic legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambientmusicguide.com/pages/M/mark.php|title=Essential releases: Jon Mark|last=Watson|first=Mike|work=AmbientMusicGuide|publisher=Mike Watson|accessdate=4 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102185740/http://ambientmusicguide.com/pages/M/mark.php|archivedate=2 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Julian Cope]]'s 1992 album ''[[Jehovahkill]]'' features the stones on its cover.
*[[The Waterboys]]' 1993 album ''[[Dream Harder]]'' contains a song called "Wonders of Lewis" which appears to reference the  stones.
*The stones are featured in the plot and setting of ''Death of an Adept'' (1996), a novel by [[Katherine Kurtz]] and [[Deborah Turner Harris]]. They are a central part of the cover art (by [[Joe Burleson]]) for the 1997 mass-market paperback edition.
*The stones are also shown on the front cover of the 1996 CD [[Celtic Nights]], by [[Enaid]] and [[Einalem]], released by [[Northsound Music]].
*The Dutch [[melodic death metal]] band, [[Callenish Circle]], took their name from the stones, slightly changing the spelling.
*The 1998 book ''The Last Highlander'' by Claire Delacroix features the stones as a key location.
*The [[Pixar]] film ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012) features several scenes set in and around the stones.
* [[Bank of Scotland]] [[debit card]]s feature an image of the stones, among other Scottish landmarks including the [[Falkirk Wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bankofscotland.co.uk/bankaccounts/|title = Bank of Scotland|date = |accessdate = 2014-10-15|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Starz]] TV series, ''[[Outlander (TV series)|Outlander]]'' (2014) has used the stones as a model for a fictional circle near Culloden called Craigh na Dun. The series is based on a series of books by [[Diana Gabaldon]].

==Other nearby sites==

[[File:Camp and Crew.jpg|thumb|right|'''Lumberjack camp and crew''']]
'''Cordwood Pete''' is a fictional character who was the younger brother of legendary lumberjack [[Paul Bunyan]].  While Paul Bunyan is said to have been a giant of a man, his younger brother Peter Bunyan was a mere {{convert|4|ft|9|in|m}} in height.  Pete's growth was apparently stunted by the fact that he could never get enough flapjacks at the breakfast table because Paul ate everything in sight.

According to legend, Paul Bunyan left his home in [[Bangor, Maine]], to make his way in the world, and ended up in the north woods of Minnesota where he excelled as a lumberjack.  Pete, tired of being mocked by lumberjacks in Maine because of his size, followed Paul to Minnesota, and despite his diminutive stature, found work as a lumberjack near [[Fosston, Minnesota]].

Local lumberjacks nicknamed him "Le Dang Cordwood Pete" because his size suggested he was more suited to cutting cordwood than felling huge trees.  Pete spent much time in the local saloons, and his fellow lumberjacks soon learned he was hot tempered and full of spunk, especially after imbibing.  They came to admire his feisty spirit, and no one dared fight him.

Legend has it that he "borrowed" his brother's double-bladed ax one day.  He swung the ax, and its weight kept the ax spinning round and round as if in perpetual motion.  When the ax finally stopped spinning, {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of timber had been felled.  The railroad hired Pete the next day to clear a path for their tracks, and before the day was over, he had clear-cut fifty square miles of timber.  Pete had to give his brother's ax back to him the next day, and he never again achieved such a lumberjacking feat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fosston.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={FD14779F-1317-450C-930F-A2CA8F031CAB} Fosston.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

After that Pete stuck to cutting cordwood which he hauled to market with the help of his little donkey named Tamarack.  He died at the age of 84.

The story of Cordwood Pete had been all but forgotten until the spring of 2001 when a time capsule was discovered by a work crew demolishing one of Fosston's oldest buildings.  Inside was the complete story of Cordwood Pete, younger brother of legendary lumberjack Paul Bunyan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T9okjBKav1oC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq Weird Minnesota By Eric Dregni, Mark Moran, Mark Sceurman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors [[Richard Dorson]] and Marshall Fitwick cite Paul Bunyan as an example of "[[fakelore]]", or a modern story passed off as an older folktale.&lt;ref&gt;Fitwick, Marshall.  ''Probing popular culture on and off the Internet''.  Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-7890-2133-5}}, p. 114-118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorson, Richard.  ''American Folklore''.  University of Chicago Press, 1977, {{ISBN|978-0-226-15859-4}}, p. 216-226&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that the legend of Cordwood Pete may also qualify as "fakelore."  Some suggest the legend was created by Arvid "Clem" Clementson who was the mayor of Fosston when he died at the age of 81.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogybuff.com/mn/polk/webbbs_config.pl/read/15 Obituary of Arvid "Clem" Clementson]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Course in General Linguistics''''' ({{lang-fr|Cours de linguistique générale}}) is a book compiled by [[Charles Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye]] from notes on lectures given by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] at the [[University of Geneva]] between 1906 and 1911. It was published in 1916, after Saussure's death, and is generally regarded as the starting point of [[structural linguistics]], an approach to linguistics that flourished in Europe and the United States in the first half of the 20th century. One of Saussure's translators, [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]], summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of language in the following way:

{{quote|Language is no longer regarded as peripheral to our grasp of the world we live in, but as central to it. Words are not mere vocal labels or communicational adjuncts superimposed upon an already given order of things. They are collective products of social interaction, essential instruments through which human beings constitute and articulate their world. This typically twentieth-century view of language has profoundly influenced developments throughout the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Roy. 1988. ''Language, Saussure and Wittgenstein''. Routledge. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Saussure was specifically interested in [[historical linguistics]],  the ''Course''  develops a theory of [[semiotics]] that is more generally applicable. A manuscript containing Saussure's original notes was found in 1996, and later published as ''Writings in General Linguistics''.

==Semiology: ''langue'', ''langage'', and ''parole''==
Saussure distinguishes between "language (''langue'')" and "speech (''langage'')". Language is a well-defined homogeneous object in the heterogeneous mass of speech facts. Speech is many-sided and heterogeneous:  it belongs both to the individual and to society. Language is a self-contained whole and a principle of classification:  it is social. Language is not complete in any speaker:  it is a product that is assimilated by speakers. It exists only within a collective. Language is "a system of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] that express ideas".

To explain how the social crystallization of language comes about, Saussure proposes the notion of "individual speaking (''parole'')". Speaking is willful and intentional.

While individual speaking is [[heterogeneous]], that is to say composed of unrelated or differing parts or elements, language is [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogeneous]]{{mdash}}a system of signs composed of the union of meanings and "sound images", in which both parts are [[Psychology|psychological]]. Therefore, as speech (''langue'') is systematic, it is this that Saussure focuses on since it allows an investigative [[methodology]] that is "scientific" in the sense of systematic enquiry.

Beginning with the Greek word ''semîon'' meaning "sign", Saussure proposes a new science of "[[semiology]]": "a science that studies the life of signs within [[society]]".

==The sign==

The focus of Saussure's investigation is the linguistic unit or sign.

The [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] (''signe'') is described as a "double entity", made up of the signifier, or sound pattern (referred to by Saussure as a 'signal'), and the signified, or concept (referred to by Saussure as 'signification'). The sound pattern is a psychological&lt;!-- or mental? --&gt;, '''not''' a material concept, belonging to the system. Both components of the linguistic sign are inseparable. One way to appreciate this is to think of them as being like either side of a piece of paper – one side simply cannot exist without the other.

The relationship between signifier and signified is, however, not quite that simple. Saussure is adamant that language cannot be considered a collection of names for a collection of objects (as it is in the conception that [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] named the animals, for example). According to Saussure, language is not a nomenclature. Indeed, the basic insight of Saussure's thought is that denotation, the reference to objects in some [[universe of discourse]], is mediated by system-internal relations of difference.

==Arbitrariness==
For Saussure, there is no essential or natural reason why a particular signifier should be attached to a particular signified. Saussure calls this the "arbitrariness of the sign" (''l'arbitraire du signe'').

[[Image:Tree.gif|thumb|300px|left|''Fig. 2 – Arbitrariness'']]

No two people have precisely the same concept of "tree," since no two people have precisely the same experiences or psychology. We can communicate "tree," however, for the same reason we can communicate at all: because we have agreed to use it in a consistent way. If we agreed to use the word and sound for "horse" instead, it would be called "horse" to the same effect. Since all that is important is agreement and consistency, the connection is arbitrary.

In further support of the arbitrary nature of the sign, Saussure goes on to argue that if words stood for pre-existing universal concepts they would have exact equivalents in meaning from one language to the next and this is not so. Languages reflect shared experience in complicated ways and can paint very different pictures of the world from one another. To explain this, Saussure uses the word ''bœuf'' as an example. In English, he says, we have different words for the animal and the meat product: ''Ox'' and ''beef''. In French, ''bœuf'' is used to refer to both concepts. In Saussure's view, particular words are born out of a particular society's needs, rather than out of a need to label a pre-existing set of concepts.
But the picture is actually even more complicated, through the integral notion of 'relative motivation'. Relative motivation refers to the [[compositionality]] of the linguistic system, along the lines of an [[immediate constituent]] analysis. This is to say that, at the level of ''langue'', hierarchically nested signifiers have relatively determined signified. An obvious example is in the English number system: That is, though ''twenty'' and ''two'' might be arbitrary representations of a numerical concept, ''twenty-two'', ''twenty-three'' etc. are constrained by those more arbitrary meanings. The tense of verbs provides another obvious example: The meaning of "kicked" is relatively motivated by the meanings of "kick-" and "-ed". But, most simply, this captures the insight that the value of a syntagm—a system-level sentence—is a function of the value of the signs occurring in it. It is for this reason that [[Leonard Bloomfield]] called the [[lexicon]] the set of fundamental irregularities of the language. (Note how much of the "meaningfulness" of the ''Jabberwocky'' poem is due to these sorts of compositional relationships!)

A further issue is [[onomatopoeia]]. Saussure recognised that his opponents could argue that with onomatopoeia there is a direct link between word and meaning, signifier and signified. However, Saussure argues that, on closer [[Etymology|etymological]] investigation, onomatopoeic words can, in fact, be unmotivated (not sharing a likeness), in part evolving from non-onomatopoeic origins. The example he uses is the French and English onomatopoeic words for a dog's bark, that is ''ouaoua'' and ''Bow Wow''.

Finally, Saussure considers [[interjection]]s and dismisses this obstacle with much the same argument, i.e., the sign/signifier link is less natural than it initially appears. He invites readers to note the contrast in pain interjection in French (''aie'') and English (''ouch'').

==Value==
{{see_also|Value (semiotics)}}

The value of a sign is determined by all the other signs in the ''langue''.

[[File:Semiotic Value.GIF|thumb|700px|center|''Fig. 3 – Value'']]

Saussure realized that if linguistics was going to be an actual science, language could not be a mere nomenclature; for otherwise it would be little more than a fashionable version of [[lexicology]], constructing lists of the definitions of words. Thus he argued that the sign is ultimately determined by the other signs in the system, which delimit its meaning and possible range of use, rather than its internal sound-pattern and concept. ''Sheep'', for example, has the same meaning as the French word ''mouton'', but not the same value, for ''mouton'' can also be used to mean the meal lamb, whereas ''sheep'' cannot, because it has been delimited by ''mutton''.

Language is therefore a system of interdependent entities. But not only does it delimit a sign's range of use, for which it is necessary, because an isolated sign could be used for absolutely anything or nothing without first being distinguished from another sign, but it is also what makes meaning possible. The set of synonyms ''redouter'' ("to dread"), ''craindre'' ("to fear"), and ''avoir peur'' ("to be afraid"), for instance, have their particular meaning so long as they exist in contrast to one another. But if two of the terms disappeared, then the remaining sign would take on their roles, become vaguer, less articulate, and lose its "extra something", its extra meaning, because it would have nothing to distinguish it from.

This is an important fact to realize for two reasons: (A) it allows Saussure to argue that signs cannot exist in isolation, but are dependent on a system from within which they must be deduced in analysis, rather than the system itself being built up from isolated signs; and (B) he could discover grammatical facts through [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] analyses.

==Syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations==

Language works through relations of difference, then, which place signs in opposition to one another. Saussure asserted that there are only two types of relations: syntagmatic and paradigmatic. The latter is associative, and clusters signs together in the mind, producing sets: ''sat'', ''mat'', ''cat'', ''bat'', for example, or ''thought'', ''think'', ''thinking'', ''thinker''. Sets always involve a similarity, but difference is a prerequisite, otherwise none of the items would be distinguishable from one another: this would result in there being a single item, which could not constitute a set on its own.

These two forms of relation open linguistics up to [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]. Take morphology, for example. The signs ''cat'' and ''cats'' are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of ''cat''. Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an ''s'' to the end of the word. Likewise, in syntax, through paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, we can discover the grammatical rules for constructing sentences: the meaning of ''je dois'' ("I should") and ''dois je?'' ("Should I?") differ completely simply because of word order, allowing us to note that to ask a question in French, you only have to invert the word order.  A third valuation of language stems from its social contract, or its accepted use in culture as a tool between two humans.

Since syntagmas can belong to speech, the linguist must identify how often they are used before he can be assured that they belong to the language.

==Synchronic and diachronic axes==

To consider a language [[synchronic analysis|synchronically]] is to study it "as a complete system at a given point in time," a perspective he calls the ''AB'' axis. By contrast, a [[historical linguistics|diachronic]] analysis considers the language "in its historical development" (the ''CD'' axis). Saussure argues that we should be concerned not only with the ''CD'' axis, which was the focus of attention in his day, but also with the ''AB'' axis because, he says, language is "a system of pure values which are determined by nothing except the momentary arrangements of its terms".

To illustrate this, Saussure uses a [[chess]] metaphor. We could study the game diachronically (how the rules change through time) or synchronically (the actual rules). Saussure notes that a person joining the audience of a game already in progress requires no more information than the present layout of pieces on the board and who the next player is. There would be no additional benefit in knowing how the pieces had come to be arranged in this way.

==Geographic linguistics==
A portion of '''''Course in General Linguistics''''' comprises Saussure's ideas regarding the geographical branch of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;This section of the article references the Roy Harris translation of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Saussure, the geographic study of languages deals with external, not internal, linguistics. Geographical linguistics, Saussure explains, deals primarily with the study of linguistic diversity across lands, of which there are two kinds: diversity of relationship, which applies to languages assumed to be related; and absolute diversity, in which case there exists no demonstrable relationship between compared languages. Each type of diversity constitutes a unique problem, and each can be approached in a number of ways.

For example, the study of Indo-European languages and Chinese (which are not related) benefits from comparison, of which the aim is to elucidate certain constant factors which underlie the establishment and development of any language. The other kind of variation, diversity of relationship, represents infinite possibilities for comparisons, through which it becomes clear that dialects and languages differ only in gradient terms. Of the two forms of diversity, Saussure considers diversity of relationship to be the more useful with regard to determining the essential cause of geographical diversity.

While the ideal form of geographical diversity would, according to Saussure, be the direct correspondence of different languages to different areas, the asserted reality is that secondary factors must be considered in tandem with the geographical separation of different cultures.

For Saussure, time is the primary catalyst of linguistic diversity, not distance. To illustrate his argument, Saussure considers a hypothetical population of colonists, who move from one island to another. Initially, there is no difference between the language spoken by the colonists on the new island and their homeland counterparts, in spite of the obvious geographical disconnect. Saussure thereby establishes that the study of geographical diversity is necessarily concentrated upon the effects of time on linguistic development. Taking a monoglot community as his model (that is, a community which speaks only one language), Saussure outlines the manner in which a language might develop and gradually undergo subdivision into distinct dialects.

Saussure's model of differentiation has 2 basic principles: (1) that linguistic evolution occurs through successive changes made to specific linguistic elements; and (2) that these changes each belong to a specific area, which they affect either wholly or partially.

It then follows from these principles that dialects have no natural boundary, since at any geographical point a particular language is undergoing some change. At best, they are defined by "waves of innovation"—in other words, areas where some set of innovations converge and overlap.

The "wave" concept is integral to Saussure's model of geographical linguistics—it describes the gradient manner in which dialects develop. Linguistic waves, according to Saussure, are influenced by two opposed forces: parochialism, which is the basic tendency of a population to preserve its language's traditions; and intercourse, in which communication between people of different areas necessitates the need for cross-language compromise and standardization. Intercourse can prevent dialectical fragmentation by suppressing linguistic innovations; it can also propagate innovations throughout an area encompassing different populations. Either way, the ultimate effect of intercourse is unification of languages. Saussure remarks that there is no barrier to intercourse where only gradual linguistic transitions occur.

Having outlined this monoglot model of linguistic diversity, which illustrates that languages in any one area are undergoing perpetual and nonuniform variation, Saussure turns to languages developing in two separate areas.

In the case of segregated development, Saussure draws a distinction between cases of contact and cases of isolation. In the latter, commonalities may initially exist, but any new features developed will not be propagated between the two languages. Nevertheless, differentiation will continue in each area, leading to the formation of distinct linguistic branches within a particular family.

The relations characterizing languages in contact are in stark contrast to the relations of languages in isolation. Here, commonalities and differences continually propagate to one another—thus, even those languages that are not part of the same family will manage to develop [[Areal feature|common features]].

Lev was born and raised in [[Youngstown, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Kompas"&gt;{{cite news | title = Prof Daniel S Lev Berpulang | url = http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0607/31/utama/2845415.htm | work = [[Kompas]] | date = July 31, 2006 | language = Indonesian | accessdate = November 5, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060830083133/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0607/31/utama/2845415.htm | archivedate = August 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth, he participated in the [[Golden Gloves]] competitions for [[amateur boxing]]. He graduated from [[Miami University]] in 1955 and received his doctorate from [[Cornell University]], where he became a member of the Modern Indonesia Project.

After returning to the United States, he became a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Lev's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] was not well received by the university and likely prevented him from receiving [[tenure]]. Soon after, he moved to Seattle to teach at the [[University of Washington]] before finally retiring in 1999.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"/&gt; As a scholar of Indonesian law, Lev helped the country's lawyers and activists continue their education in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kompas"/&gt; His dissertation titled ''The Transition to Guided Democracy: Indonesian Politics 1957–1959'' analyzed Sukarno's [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy]] principles became a classic reading on the development of the country's political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nasution | first = Adnan Buyung | title = Selamat Jalan Dan Lev | url = http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0607/31/opini/2845681.htm | work = [[Kompas]] | date = July 31, 2006 | language = Indonesian | accessdate = November 5, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123954/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0607/31/opini/2845681.htm | archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of [[Human Rights Watch]] and served on the advisory committee of its Asia division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = In Memory of Daniel S.

Lev was a heavy smoker and died from [[lung cancer]] on July 29, 2006.&lt;ref name="Seattle Times"/&gt; He had been writing a biography on [[Chinese Indonesian]] lawyer and human rights advocate [[Yap Thiam Hien]] at the time of his death.

'''''Doctor Dolittle in the Moon''''' (1928) was intended to be the last of [[Hugh Lofting]]'s [[Doctor Dolittle]] books, and differs considerably in tone from its predecessors; the stripped down narrative does not have room for any of the sub-plots and tales previously present. Instead there is a growing sense of an event about to happen that is almost spooky in tone. There are some very complex passages for a children’s book; for example, it begins with a meditation about what the writer expects from the reader and vice versa.

==Plot introduction==
Doctor Dolittle has landed on the [[Moon]] and each day brings a new discovery. He meets Otho Bludge the Moon Man, a Stone Age artist who was the only human on the Moon when it [[Geology of the Moon#Fission hypothesis|broke away from the Earth]]. The animals of the Moon flock to Doctor Dolittle, and he discovers how to communicate with the intelligent plants there. But will the lunar flora and fauna ever let him leave?

There is no pretence that the Lunar environment, described in meticulous detail, in any way conforms to what was known to science at the time of writing; thus, the book can be considered as [[fantasy]] more than [[science fiction]].

''Dr. Dolittle in the Moon'' was ahead of its time in that it introduced the concept of 'ecology' (although it did not use that term). Dr. Dolittle helps guide the Lunar Council, headed by Otho Bludge, a ten-foot tall Stone-Age Artist and expatriate terrestrial.  Together they negotiate how many seeds each person can legally produce each year.

The book delves into the subject of "The Days Before There Was a Moon", as remembered in tales that Chee Chee the Monkey's grandmother told him when he was little. The story of how the moon was created is closer to science than some of the other fantasy elements of the book. Otho Bludge, the stone-age sculptor, came to be the man on the moon because he was transported on the lump of rock that had broken off the Earth, and became the moon. Alone for many years, the sole human on the Moon, Otho Bludge, weary of rendering his own image as reflected in the water, longed for the sight of another human being. In answer to his longing, he was visited by a vision of Princess Pepiteepa, who poses for him, then fades away.

'''Donald Kagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|g|ən}}; born May 1, 1932) is an American [[historian]] and [[classicist]] at [[Yale University]] specializing in [[ancient Greece]], notable for his four-volume history of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. He formerly taught in the [[Cornell University Department of History|Department of History]] at [[Cornell University]]. At present, Kagan is considered among the foremost American scholars of [[History of Greece|Greek]] history.

==Early life and education==
Born into a Jewish family from [[Kursenai|Kuršėnai]], Lithuania, Kagan grew up in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section of [[Brooklyn, New York]], where his family emigrated when he was two years old, shortly after the death of his father. He graduated from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1954, received an MA from [[Brown University]] in 1955 and a PhD from the [[Ohio State University]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=yalealumnimagazine.com|url=http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_04/kagan.html|title=Lion in Winter|accessdate=2007-08-19|date=April 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809010253/http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_04/kagan.html|archivedate=2007-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career ==
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?62796-1/origins-war ''Booknotes'' interview with Kagan on ''On the Origins of War'', March 12, 1995], [[C-SPAN]]| video2 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?161612-1/america-sleeps Presentation by Donald Kagan and Frederick Kagan on ''While America Sleeps'', November 29, 2000], [[C-SPAN]]| video3 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?169430-1/peloponnesian-war Presentation by Kagan on ''The Peloponnesian  War'', October 3, 2003], [[C-SPAN]]}}
Once a liberal Democrat, Kagan changed his views in 1969. According to Jim Lobe, cited by Craig Unger, Kagan's turn away from liberalism occurred in 1969 when Cornell University was pressured into starting a [[Black Studies]] program by gun-wielding students [[Willard Straight Hall#1969 building takeover|seizing the Willard Straight Hall]]: "Watching administrators demonstrate all the courage of [[Neville Chamberlain]] had a great impact on me, and I became much more conservative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig Unger|title=American Armageddon|page=39|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of the original signers of the 1997 Statement of Principles by the [[neoconservatism (United States)|neoconservative]] think tank [[Project for the New American Century]], co-founded by his son [[Robert Kagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=newamericancentury.org |accessdate=2007-08-19 |title=Statement of Principles |url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/aboutpnac.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303065219/http://www.newamericancentury.org/aboutpnac.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/aboutpnac.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303065219/http://www.newamericancentury.org/aboutpnac.htm|title=About PNAC|archivedate=3 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the eve of the 2000 presidential elections, Kagan and his son, [[Frederick Kagan]], published ''[[While America Sleeps]]'', a call to increase defense spending.

Known for his prolific research of the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Kagan is also famous for his work ''On the Origins of War and the Preservation of Peace'', a comparative history examining four major conflicts (the Peloponnesian War, [[World War I]], the [[Second Punic War]], and [[World War II]])  and one non-conflict (the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]) with the purpose of identifying how and why wars do or do not begin. Remarking in 2015 on the work, Kagan summarized the causes of war by quoting [[Thucydides]]: "You know, Thucydides has this great insight. I wish I could get people to pay attention – he has one of his speakers at the beginning of the war say, 'Why do people go to war? Out of fear, honor, and interest.' Well, everybody knows interest, and fear is very credible. Nobody takes honor seriously." &lt;ref name="conversationswithbillkristol.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/donald-kagan/|title=Donald Kagan on Conversations with Bill Kristol|work=Conversations with Bill Kristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kagan, however, believes honor played an out-sized role in beginning World War I and that modern observers would do better to understand the concept as "prestige."&lt;ref name="conversationswithbillkristol.org"/&gt;

The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) awarded Donald Kagan the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 2002, and selected him to deliver the 2005 [[Jefferson Lecture]], which the NEH calls "the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Kagan's Jefferson Lecture was entitled "In Defense of History";&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kagan,[https://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/donald-kagan-lecture "In Defense of History,"] text of Jefferson Lecture at NEH website.&lt;/ref&gt; he argued that history is of primary importance in the study of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kennicott, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/13/AR2005051300041_pf.html "Yale Historian Donald Kagan, Mixing the Old And the Neo,"] ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George F. Will]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/18/AR2005051802040.html "History's Higher Ground,"] ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In a review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', critic [[George Steiner]] said of Kagan's seminal four-volume history of the Peloponnesian War: "The temptation to acclaim Kagan's four volumes as the foremost work of history produced in North America in this century is vivid."

Until his retirement in 2013, Kagan was [[Sterling Professor]] of Classics and History at [[Yale University]]—a title reserved for only the few most accomplished academics at Yale. His course "The Origins of War" was one of the university's most popular courses for twenty-five years. He currently teaches "Introduction to Ancient Greek History"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oyc.yale.edu/classics/introduction-to-ancient-greek-history|title=Open Yale Courses - Introduction to Ancient Greek History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upper level History and Classical Civilization seminars focusing on topics from [[Thucydides]] to the [[spartan hegemony|Lakedaimonian hegemony]].

==Personal life and family ==
Kagan lives in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. His late wife of sixty-two years, Myrna Kagan (1932-2017), was a teacher and historian in her own right, and the author of ''Vision in the Sky: New Haven's Early Years, 1638-1784''.   He is the father of [[Robert Kagan]] and [[Frederick Kagan]], both well-known writers. Robert Kagan's wife is [[Victoria Nuland]], the State Department spokesperson from 2011 to 2013 and former [[Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs]]. Frederick Kagan's wife is [[Kimberly Kagan]], a well-known military historian and founder and president of the [[Institute for the Study of War]].

Evidence for '''early glassmaking in the United States''' has been found of glassmaking at the English settlement on [[Jamestown Island]], [[Virginia]]. While some glass window panes were made there after 1608, most of the windows had been shipped from [[England]].&lt;ref name=kelso&gt;Kelso, William M. Jamestown, the buried truth. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, they started glass making in Jamestown 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The glassmaking business in the United States started when eight Germans (known as "Dutchmen") and Poles arrived as part of the Second supply on board the ''[[Mary and Margaret]]''. They used local material: [[Silica|sand]] in the [[James River]], [[potash]] was in the forest and a bed of endless oyster shells which could be burned and ground to make [[Calcium oxide|lime]]. They set up making the first batches of goods exported to England from the [[New World]]. The first shipment sent to England was called the trial glass. Most of it was window glass, bottles, vials and plain drinking glasses. The glass factory at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] was believed to be the first [[Factory|manufactory]] in the United States.

== The Glass House Point ==

The location was near the Jamestown peninsula over a mile from the fort, in a location that was convenient for glassblowing. The [[Jamestown Glasshouse]] was situated where the Native Americans used to camp and where the main roads converged, known to the settlers as the Greate Road.  The area came to be called [[Glass House Point]]. Though this location made the recovery of mineral resources easily accessible, it also made the glassmakers vulnerable to sneak attacks by local tribes. The glass manufactory was controlled exclusively by the Polish glassmakers. The Dutchmen went to [[Werowocomoco]] (a Native American village on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] fifteen miles from Jamestown) in order to build a house for the chief of the [[Powhatan]]s, and plotted to kill [[Captain John Smith]] and steal powders and arms from the settlers. They didn’t succeed, and were kicked out of the village when the chief became suspicious of their dealings.&lt;ref&gt;Grizzard, Smith. Jamestown Colony: A Political, Social, And Cultural History. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

The glassmaking operation required three furnaces with different sizes. The first furnace was for melting the glass, the smaller one for [[Annealing (glass)|annealing]] or cooling the finished glass. And an even smaller [[frit]]ting furnace for preheating the ingredients needed for making the glass. A fourth furnace was erected to fire up the clay pots used in the glassmaking process. The construction of the furnaces was made up of huge boulders rolled out of the river and glued together with mud. A rectangular wood-frame building was constructed to protect the furnaces and the workers from the weather. Overall the glass house was about thirty seven feet wide by fifty feet long, and probably had a high thatched roof and partially open sides with the office situated next to the furnaces.&lt;ref name=kelso /&gt;

== Archaeological evidence ==

In 1948, while excavating the foundation of the furnaces, archaeologist [[J.C. Harrington|Jean Carl Harrington]] theorized that the workmen probably produced a lot of green glass. The glass was comparable to that produced in England: exhibit showcases, window panes, bottles, and drinking vessels. Glassmaking in the colonies was discontinued in 1609 during the [[Starving Time]]. The [[Virginia Company]] expected returns; since the glassmaking business was in decline, they ventured to other manufactories.

== American production ==

Glassmaking in America symbolized wealth. [[Ivor Noël Hume]] excavated in Virginia and found one fragment of a piece of glass. Most glass was utilitarian with a case of glasses in the parlor quite common. Over 70 percent of Hume’s finds were fragments of quatre foil-stemmed glasses. Round bottles assumed a more squat shape. Glass was not universal in most households. Many wealthy colonists had little to no glass in their households. According to his records, a Ralph Fisbourn died in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] in 1708 with an estate of £1,762; his only glass possessions were a few bottles.&lt;ref name=Edgar&gt;Edgar. A Documentary History of American Interiors from the Colonial Era. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

American glass factories were founded first in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1732 and then in [[South Jersey]] by [[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] in 1739. The 1730s saw an increasing variety of products. Boston merchants advertised wine glasses, jelly glasses, [[syllabub]]s, [[decanter]]s, sugar pots, barrel cans, [[punch bowl]]s, bird fountains, and [[candlestick]]s. Merchants also offered japanned glassware. "For those who did buy taste in the newest styles, drinking glasses were the inverted baluster type (popular in England from 1720 to about 1735) or the later drawn stem glass (1730–1745)."{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Both types have been found in Virginia. Wealth and fashion did not dictate an elaborate collection of glass, for the Reverend Ebenezer Thayer who died in nearby Roxbury less than a year later had £137 worth of silver. But his only glass was some salts in the parlor.&lt;ref name=Edgar /&gt;

== Style ==

The style of glassmaking changed by 1746 when the government passed the Glass Excise Bill, which taxed glass by weight; beginning in 1751 advertisements in a Boston newspaper made a reference to “new fashion” glass. Usually the phrase referred to the air twist stemmed glass or “wormed wine glasses” that had first been advertised in the Boston market in 1746. By 1761, glasses and decanters were also engraved or “flowered”. Glassmakers worked diligently to provide special glasses for specific purposes, and inevitably only the well-to-do could afford a full array of forms. The inventory of [[Francis Fauquier|Governor Francis Fauquier’s]] glass is revealing, when the former Governor of Virginia died in 1768, he left: 5 beer glasses, 5 champagne glasses, 14 water glasses, 55 wine glasses, 59 syllabub glasses, 69 jelly glasses, 23 glass [[salver]]s, 15 decanters and 8 [[cruet]]s. He also had three sets of salvers that made up into large pyramids; the largest pyramid was valued at £15. Such pyramids were advertised in the Boston press in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter John L., J. Paul Hudson. New Discoveries at Jamestown . Washington D.C.: U.S Government Printing Office, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Federal architecture|Federal Period]], after the [[American Revolutionary War]], Americans adopted new European styles. During the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary period]], decoration was minimal. Although the American glass industry was making a strong beginning, considerable quantities were still imported. Cut glass was advertised in Baltimore as early as 1786, gaining popularity toward the end of the period. American production of [[Early American molded glass|blown three-mold glass]] began during the [[War of 1812]]. Glassmakers [[Henry William Stiegel]] and [[John Frederick Amelung]] had both tried to produce elaborate, fine table glass rivaling the European imports and both failed because there was not yet a market for the work they produced.

== European influences ==

Many of the glassmakers who worked in American factories were from England and their designs bore a resemblance to that of European designs. European cut glass influenced the patterns of American cut glass until 1880. Phillip McDonald designed the “Russian” pattern for [[T.G. Hawkes &amp; Company]] of [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]]; from this point on American cut glass wares became richer in design and quality of both workmanship and glass. John S. O’Connor’s “Parisian” patterns - the first cut glass designs to utilize a curved line in cutting - greatly influenced American designs thereafter, because most of the cutting had been straight lines.&lt;ref&gt;C., Revi Albert. American Cut and Engraved Glass. New York: Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufactures across the mid colonies ==

Since the Anglo-American [[War of 1812]] had stopped the importation of fine cut glass from abroad, American factories progressed in the making of [[flint glass]]. Glassworks such as the South Boston Crown Glass Company manufactured flint glass in [[South Boston]]. Another flint glass manufacturer, the [[New England Glass Company]], was established in 1818. Glassmakers often worked for a number of companies; many split off to form their own glassworks. The glassmaking business could be risky; many glassworks closed after only a few years in business due to labor or financial troubles.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Bay State Glass Company was established in [[East Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1857, and advertised products such as cut flint glassware and engraved glass. However, the firm dissolved only a few years later in 1863.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} The [[Boston and Sandwich Glass Company]] in [[Sandwich, Massachusetts]] produced a considerable quantity of fine cut glassware after 1826, but closed in 1888 due to troubles with a newly formed glassmakers' union.&lt;ref name=romance&gt;{{cite book|title=The Romance of Old Sandwich Glass |last=Chipman |first=Frank W.|year=1932|publisher=Sandwich Publishing Company Inc. |url=https://archive.org/details/romanceofoldsand027272mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Meriden, Connecticut]], Parker and Casper opened a glass cutting shop in 1867. They manufactured decanters, caster bottles, and sugar, salt and mustard glass liners until the shop closed in 1869.

{{Italic title}}
The '''''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''''' ({{lang-uk|Енциклопедія українознавства}}) is a fundamental work of [[Ukrainian Studies]] created under the auspices of the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] in Europe ([[Sarcelles]], near [[Paris]]). As the '''''Encyclopedia of Ukrainian Studies''''' it conditionally consists of two parts, the general part (1949-1952) that includes three volumes and the dictionary part (1955–89) that includes 10 volumes. It was published in Ukraine since 1991.

[[Volodymyr Kubiyovych]] was the editor-in-chief of Volumes I and II (published in 1984 and 1988 respectively). The concluding three volumes, with [[Danylo Husar Struk]] as editor-in-chief, appeared in 1993.&lt;ref name="cfus"/&gt;

==English variant==
In 1984-93 the [[Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies]] at the [[University of Alberta Faculty of Arts]] with the help of the [[Canadian Foundation of Ukrainian Studies]] and the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Europe&lt;ref name=eou/&gt; prepared the [[English language|English]] version of encyclopedia&lt;ref name="cfus"&gt;[http://www.cfus.ca/encyclopedia.html Canadian Foundation of Ukrainian Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eou/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ualberta.ca/CIUS/ CIUS Page]&lt;/ref&gt; which was published by the [[University of Toronto Press]].&lt;ref name=eou/&gt; It consists of five volumes, almost 4,000 pages and some 12,500 alphabetical entries.

It was called as "the most comprehensive and balanced work in the English language on Ukraine and Ukrainians in the diaspora" and a "monumental publication" by the ''[[Canadian Journal of History]]''.&lt;ref name="cfus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eou&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/info.asp About Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine] at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prof. [[Oleh Romaniv]] from the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], and an avowed pro-Muscovite historian with ties to the discredited Bolshevik regime,  the ''Encyclopedia of Ukraine'' demonstrates an exemplar of Ukrainian bias and preconception in relation to Russia, which was very typical for the works of the [[Ukrainian diaspora]] during the period when Ukraine was part of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;''Енциклопедія Українознавства''. Львів, 1993. //Олег Романів. ''Довгий тернистий шлях українства до самопізнання'', стор. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine''==
{{refimprove|date=June 2016}}
The ''Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine'' is an [[English language]], free online encyclopedia covering wide range of issues on [[Ukraine]], including its history, people, geography, economy, culture, etc. Upon completion, the ''IEU'' will become the most authoritative and comprehensive Internet-based resource in English on Ukraine and Ukrainians. Currently it contains some 6,000 entries and 5,000 illustrations.

The current ''Encyclopedia'' team consists of [[Roman Senkus]], Managing Editor, Dr. [[Marko R. Stech]], Project Manager, [[Andrij Makuch]], Senior Manuscript Editor, and a team of subject editors. This site was designed by [[Jaroslaw Kiebalo]]; [[Walter Kiebalo]] acted as consulting designer.

==Controversies==
===The 'Michael Wong Kin-chow incident'===
In 2003, Michael Wong Kin-chow was removed as the Chairman of the EOC after an investivation by the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC) revealed that Mr Wong had deliberately made improper applications to the HKSAR government for reimbursement of several first-class flights between 1998 and 2001, valued at {{HKD|171,666}}.&lt;ref&gt;The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. [http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200601/25/P200601250089.htm "Statement by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the case of Mr Michael Wong Kin-chow"], ''Press Release'', Hong Kong, 25 January 2006, Retrieved on 6 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that Mr Wong had continued to draw his pension as a former High Court judge while he was employed at the EOC. The ICAC's report was submitted to the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) in November 2005 who ultimately decided not to proceed with prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Council Secretariat. [http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr06-07/english/panels/ajls/papers/aj1023cb2-141-1e.pdf "Background brief for the meeting on 23 October 2006: The case of Mr Michael WONG Kin-chow"], ''Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services'', Hong Kong, 20 October 2006, Retrieved on 6 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements by Alfred Chen===
On 1 June 2016, a concern was raised by some legislators that the newly appointed Chairperson, Prof Alfred Chen, had expressed views which suggested he was not suitably aware of the key issues necessary to execute his duties as head of the EOC. These included a dismissal of the need to address the lack of any anti-discrimination ordinance to protect sexual minorities, confusion of concepts such as gender identity and sexual orientation, and declaring that the EOC should echo the views of the government.&lt;ref&gt;The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. [http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201606/01/P201606010389.htm "LCQ2: Appointment of Chairperson of Equal Opportunities Commission"], ''Press Release'', Hong Kong, 1 June 2016, Retrieved on 6 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The museum opened in 1991. It has permanent exhibits of local archaeological finds and on the traditional way of life historically in Fujairah in particular and the UAE in general. Within the museum, the first exhibit hall displays heritage objects related to traditional local occupations such as agriculture, fishing, pottery, trade, and weaving.&lt;ref name="uaeeastcoast"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.uaeeastcoast.com/fujairah-museum.html | website=www.uaeeastcoast.com | title=Fujairah Museum | publisher=East Coast Tourism | location=UAE | accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second hall on heritage displays ancient weapons, various costumes, and utensils. A further hall has displays including a spice shop and souq.

==History==
In 1969, a small single-room museum was established with exhibits including coins, farming tools, pottery, and weapons. On 27 May 1991, Sheikh [[Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi]] issued a decree to establish a Department of Antiquities and Heritage for the Emirate of Fujairah, including maintenance of the museum and its collection. On 30 November 1991, the ruler of Fujairah officially opened the museum. In 1998, the Department completed museum expansion plans with two large halls covering antiquities and three halls for heritage.

'''''God: The Failed Hypothesis''''' is a 2007 [[New York Times bestseller]] by scientist [[Victor J. Stenger]] who argues that there is no evidence for the existence of a [[deity]] and that [[God]]'s existence, while not impossible, is improbable.

David Ludden of ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine wrote that "Stenger lays out the evidence from [[cosmology]], [[astrophysics]], [[condensed matter physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[plasma physics]], [[particle physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]] showing that the universe appears exactly as it should if there is no creator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-04-04.html | title=Conspicuous by His Absence | publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |date= April 4, 2007| first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludden concluded "All freethinkers should have both volumes [''[[The God Delusion]]'' and ''God: The Failed Hypothesis''], side by side, on their bookshelves."

Damien Broderick wrote in ''[[The Australian]]'', "Stenger offers an answer to that deep question in his two new books, arguing a materialist, God-free account of the cosmos, equally antagonistic to superstition, the paranormal and religions archetypal and newfangled alike. He refuses to accept the polite accommodation urged by agnostic [[Stephen Jay Gould]] that science and religion can never be in conflict as they are [[Non-overlapping magisteria|non-overlapping 'magisteria']]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/god-the-failed-hypothesis-the-comprehensible-cosmos/story-e6frg8no-1111113107222 | title=God: The Failed Hypothesis / The Comprehensible Cosmos | publisher=[[The Australian]]|date= March 10, 2007 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Stenger says that, when [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] said religion was outside the reach of science, he was reducing religion to moral philosophy. In contrast, Stenger believes that religion often makes claims that are very much within the abilities of science to investigate. In that vein, he says that science practices [[methodological naturalism]], although it does not rule out the supernatural (i.e. [[metaphysical naturalism]] or [[physicalism]]), science does restrict itself to testing that which can actually be tested - namely effects in the natural world (be their cause natural or supernatural).&lt;ref name=StengerPOI&gt;[http://www.pointofinquiry.org/victor_stenger_god_the_failed_hypothesis Point of Inquiry Podcast, "God: The Failed Hypothesis" interview with Vic Stenger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stenger believes we have more than enough [[evidence of absence]] of the [[Judeo-Christian]] God. He adds that many arguments for God that were once compelling are now weak or irrelevant in light of modern scientific understanding. Stenger does not think we should be dogmatic about disbelief in God, but says the evidence is overwhelmingly against the belief. He is also critical of [[Fine tuning]] arguments, and says they misunderstand the more reasonable [[weak anthropic principle]].&lt;ref name="StengerPOI"/&gt;

*'''''[[Miracleman|All-New Miracleman Annual]]''''': "October Incident: 1966" (with [[Joe Quesada]], co-feature, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;A six-page script written by Morrison in 1986, this solo Kid Marvelman tale was intended to appear in Dez Skinn's '''''Warrior''''' magazine as a placeholder for Alan Moore's ''Marvelman'' strip, then on hiatus due to Skinn's legal wrangles with Marvel Comics over the Marvelman name. Dez Skinn, speaking in George Khoury's '''''Kimota! – The Marvelman Companion''''': {{cquote|... Grant did submit a Kid Marvelman story, about a discussion between Kid Marvelman and a Catholic priest, and it was quite fascinating because Kid Marvelman argued a very good case against organised religion. Nobody was flying, no beams from anyone's eyes, but a bloody clever script, clever enough that I sent it to Alan Moore for his opinion. Alan's reply was, "Nobody else writes Marvelman." And I said to Grant, "I'm sorry, he's jealously hanging on to this one."

'''Hacilar''' is an early human settlement in southwestern [[Turkey]], 23&amp;nbsp;km south of present-day [[Burdur]]. It has been dated back 7040 [[Anno Domini|BC]] at its earliest stage of development. Archaeological remains indicate that the site was abandoned and reoccupied on more than one occasion in its history.

==Archaeological History==
[[File:MNAO-OllaHacilar.jpg|thumb|Terracotta vase painted in red from Haçilar. Late Neolithic - early Chalcolithic (late 6th - beginning of the 5th millennium BC). Rome, National Museum of Oriental Art (Palazzo Brancaccio)]]
Hacilar lived and died in prehistory. What remained of Hacilar became a mound on the plain and remained so until 1956. It was in this year that a local teacher showed the mound to British archaeologist [[James Mellaart]]. In 1957 the excavation of Hacilar began under Mellaart's direction and continued until 1960. The artifacts recovered during this excavation are currently on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in [[Ankara]].

Ceramics from Hacilar show similarities with those of the [[Halaf culture]] from about the same period. There are also similarities in their figurines.

===Stratigraphy===
Up to 11 stratigraphic levels have been identified. The oldest strata belong to [[aceramic Neolithic]], and are dated to the 8th millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Spanish Wikipedia, see refs there&lt;/ref&gt;

To the 6th millennium BC, nine levels are assigned, the oldest with ceramics, that were almost entirely undecorated.

Level VI is dating back to 5600 BC, and there were many activities at this time. Nine buildings were found, grouped around a square. Livelihood mainly consisted of agriculture. Spelt, wheat, barley, peas and vetch were cultivated. Villagers engaged in the breeding of animals; bones of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and dogs were found. The pottery is simple, although some specimens represent animals.&lt;ref&gt;Helbaek H (1970) The plant husbandry of Hacilar: a study of cultivation and domestication. In: Mellaart J, editor. Excavations at Hacilar. Edinburgh: University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous nude female figures, made of clay, are quite remarkable, and possibly represent some divinity.

At level II (c. 5300 BC), the village was fortified and had a small temple.

The settlement of level I, dating after 5000 BC, differs significantly from the previous layers, so it is believed that there were newcomers who settled here. The site is now heavily fortified. The pottery is of high quality and is generally painted in red on a cream background.

==Architecture==
Housing in Hacilar consisted of grouped units surrounding an inner courtyard. Each dwelling was built on a foundation of stone to protect against [[water damage]]. Walls were made of wood and [[Daub and wattle|daub]] or [[mud-brick]] that was [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]ed with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]]. Wooden poles were located within each unit to support a flat roof. It is generally believed that these houses had an upper story made of wood.

The interiors were finished smooth with plaster and were rarely painted. Over time changes were made to the housing units; [[Quern-stone|Querns]], [[brazier]]s and [[Mortar and pestle|mortars]] appeared in the floors. Recesses in walls were also put to good use as cupboards. The kitchen was separated from the living rooms and the upper levels were used for granaries and/or workshops.

As Mellaart describes: 'The walls and floors were carefully plastered, laid on a pebble base. The plaster was frequently stained red and burnished or decorated with elementary geometric designs in red on cream.' In Hacilar houses no doorways were found. It seems possible that the entry was from the roof only.&lt;ref&gt;Mellaart, J. 1965. Earliest Civilizations of the Near East, p. 80) Thames &amp; Hudson, London&lt;/ref&gt;

'''H.W.A. (Henk) Blezer''' (born July 14, 1961 in [[Schaesberg]]) is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]], [[Indology|Indologist]], and scholar of [[Buddhist studies]].

== Study ==
After initial studies in [[Biology]] and [[Biochemistry]], and also in [[Theology]], from 1987, Blezer studied [[Indology]] at [[Leiden University]]. In 1992, he completed his 'Doctoraal' (B.A. + M.A.) in [[Buddhist studies|Buddhist]], [[Tibetology|Tibetan]], and [[Vedas|Vedic]] Studies (''cum laude'').

From 1993, he did Ph.D. research at the Center for Non-Western Studies (CNWS, later: Research School for Asian, African, and Amerindian Studies). He defended his Ph.D. thesis on April 16, 1997. His dissertation is on post-mortem visions of peaceful and [[wrathful deities]], discussed according to esoteric traditions attributed the 14th century visionary saint [[Karma Lingpa]].

== Career ==
Since 1997, Blezer works as postdoctoral researcher at Leiden University. His research covers [[Tibet]]an and also [[India]]n [[history of ideas]], notably [[Buddhism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and [[Bön]]. He completed three postdoc research projects in this field.

In 2000, Blezer organized the ninth seminar of the IATS (International Association for Tibetan Studies), at the IIAS (International Institute for Asian Studies), in Leiden, with ca. 300 participants and 215 papers. In 2002 he published the proceedings of the Leiden seminar, in ten volumes, with [[Brill Publishers|Brill Academic Publishers]].

From 2005 to 2010, as principal investigator, Blezer led a Vidi research programme on a Tibetan minority Religion called Bön: ''The Three Pillars of Bön: Doctrine, 'Location' and Founder''. The research programme was jointly funded by the [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]] (N''W''O) and Leiden University.&lt;ref&gt;Facta, [http://www.siswo.uva.nl/facta/2004/Facta-6-2004.pdf Toekenningen Vidi-subsidies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717131218/http://www.siswo.uva.nl/facta/2004/Facta-6-2004.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }}, ''Oude tradities met nieuwe geschiedenis'' {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme has as short public summary:&lt;ref name="KNAW-3PillarsBon"&gt;Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen (KNAW), [http://www.onderzoekinformatie.nl/en/oi/nod/onderzoek/OND1308511 ''Program: The Three Pillars of Bon: Doctrine, ‘Location’ &amp; Founder'']&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Adherents of the Tibetan Bön religion (Bönpos) style their religion Eternal Bön for a reason: they have outspoken ideas about the antiquity of their origins. In their view Bön traditions preserve and continue religious culture that predates the first official introduction of Buddhism into Tibetan cultural areas (7th to 9th c. AD); Bönpos consider themselves to be (more) indigenous to Tibet. Nowadays, they trace their origins even as far back as 16.017 BC (in the Paleolithic!). Tibetan Buddhism is thus portrayed as a relatively new arrival on the scene, a foreign tradition at best. There is an interesting paradox involved in this Bön historical endeavor. It resides precisely in the need felt by Bönpos to establish vis-à-vis Tibetan Buddhists the continuity of Bön from a period that, in fact, antedates the appearance of organized Bön and its written sources in Tibet. Due to the understandable scarcity of early (and relevant) written Tibetan and particularly Bön sources, these indigenous antecedents of Bön largely elude (textual) historical verification. The aim of the project is to understand the process of formation of Bön religious identity in Tibet at the turn of the first millennium AD; this process is defined by the presence in the area of rather successfully competing Buddhist sects, at a time when these sects were arising and Tibetan Buddhism was undergoing a major renaissance.''&lt;ref name="KNAW-3PillarsBon" /&gt;

Around 2010, Blezer prepares two monographs and one volume of conference proceedings on the origins of the Bön minority religion in Tibet. He also edits two volumes with comparative case studies on the wider topic of the emergence of new religious traditions, particularly in subdominant positions. The volumes broadly engage culture comparison and include contributions from an international group of specialists on different regions of the [[Far East|Far]] and [[Middle East]]. One of these volumes draws special attention to the ubiquitous phenomenon of nativist responses to the rise of Buddhism; this volume he edits together with [[Mark Teeuwen]] ([[University of Oslo]]).

Blezer is co-founder and editor of ''Brill's Tibetan Studies Library''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id9780.htm ''Brill's Tibetan Studies Library''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611224635/http://www.brill.nl/m_catalogue_sub6_id9780.htm |date=2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliation ==
From 1993 to 1997 Blezer was affiliated to the Center for Non-Western Studies (CNWS) at Leiden University; from 1997 to 2001 to the IIAS (International institute for Asian Studies) in Leiden; and from 2002 to 2008 again to the CNWS. Since 2008 he works for the LIAS (het Leiden University Institute for Area Studies), where since 2010 he teaches [[Buddhist studies]].

'''Hidatsa''' {{IPAc-en|h|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɑː|t|s|ə}}&lt;ref&gt;Park, Indrek. 2012. ''A Grammar of Hidatsa''. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Indiana, Bloomington.&lt;/ref&gt; is an endangered [[Siouan language]] that is related to the [[Crow language]]. It is spoken by the [[Hidatsa]] tribe, primarily in [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]].

A description of Hidatsa-Mandan culture, including a grammar and vocabulary of the language, was published in 1877 by [[Washington Matthews]], a government physician who lived among the Hidatsa at the [[Fort Berthold Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref name="matthews1877"&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=Washington |title=Ethnography and philology of the Hidatsa Indians |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]] |year= 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the language has been the subject of work in the [[generative grammar]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hidatsa Syntax|author=Matthews, G.H.|year=1965|publisher=Mouton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sacagawea ==

Linguists working on Hidatsa since the 1870s have considered the name of [[Sacagawea]], a guide and interpreter on the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], to be of Hidatsa origin. The name is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of two common Hidatsa [[noun]]s, ''cagáàga'' {{IPA-sio|tsaɡáàɡa|}} 'bird' and ''míà'' {{IPA|[míà]}} 'woman'. The compound is written as ''Cagáàgawia'' 'Bird Woman' in modern Hidatsa [[orthography]] and pronounced {{IPA-sio|tsaɡáàɡawia|}} ({{IPA|/m/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[w]}} between vowels in Hidatsa). The double {{IPA|/aa/}} in the name indicates a long [[vowel]] and the [[diacritic]]s a falling [[pitch accent|pitch]] pattern. Hidatsa is a pitch-accent language that does not have [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] so all syllables in {{IPA|[tsaɡáàɡawia]}} are pronounced with roughly the same relative emphasis. However, most English speakers perceive the accented syllable (the long é{{IPA|/aa/}}) as stressed. In faithful rendering of the name ''Cagáàgawia'' to other languages, it is advisable to emphasize the second, long, syllable, not the last as is common in English.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Indrek. 2012. ''A Grammar of Hidatsa''. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Indiana, Bloomington. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hidatsa has five vowels and two diphthongs. It lacks nasal vowels, which is a way it differs from other Siouan languages. (Boyle 2007) The /a/ vowel has three sounds. The long ‘a:’ sounds like the ‘a’ in the English word, ‘father’; ‘ǎ’ has the sound of the ‘a’ in the English word ‘what’; and an obscure sound, ‘ạ’, which represents the short ‘u’ sound in English, like in the word ‘fun’.

The /e/ vowel also has three sounds. Unmarked ‘e’ has the English sound ‘ai’, like the initial syllable in the word ‘air’; ‘ě’ has the short English ‘e’ sound, such as in the word ‘den’;  ‘e:’ has the sound of the English long ‘e’, like the sound of the ‘e’ in ‘they’.

The /i/ vowel has only two sounds. The ‘ǐ’ in Hidatsa sounds like the short ‘i’ sound in English, like in the word ‘pin’; the long ‘i:’ sounds like the English ‘i’ in the word ‘marine’. The /o/ and /u/ vowels have one sound each, the ‘o’ in the English word ‘bone’ and the ‘u’ in the English word ‘tune’, respectively. (Matthews 1877) The /e/ and /o/ vowels are rare and appear as long sounds. Length, as demonstrated in the table above, is phonemically distinct. There is evidence of this within some minimal and near-minimal pairs in the language: 
(1)	e/e:
gáre		/káre/		‘to stick into’
garée      	/karé:/		‘to vomit’

(2)	a/a:
miŕa		/wiŕa/           	‘wood’
miíraa		/wiíra:/		‘goose’
(3)	i/i:
máashii	/wáaši:/	‘holy story’
máashi		/wáaši/		‘to buy, to hire’

===Consonants===
Hidatsa has ten consonants:

|}

Unlike the Mississippi Valley Siouan languages, Hidatsa does not have the glottalized or the aspirated stops of [[Proto-Siouan]]. It has only one series of voiceless oral stop, /p,t,k/, which are voiced intervocalically as [b,d,g]. Hidatsa has one voiceless affricate, /t͡s/. The two fricatives, /ʃ/ and /x/, are voiceless when they are unaspirated. They are not voiced intervocalically.

Hidatsa has three sonorants: two glides, /w/ and /r/, as well as /h/. The glides are realized as [m] and [ŋ] after a pause, most frequently at the beginning of a word.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, John P. "Hidatsa morpho-syntax and clause structure. University of Chicago, Proquest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2007. 3272979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==

===Gender===
In Hidatsa, the usage of different words creates a division between masculine and feminine. Words may stand alone or be added to common gender words.&lt;ref name="Matthews, Washington 1983. p. 34"&gt;Matthews, Washington. Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the Hidatsa. New York: AMS, 1983. p. 34. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouns of the masculine gender: 'matsé' ('man'), ṡikàka ('young man'), 'itàka' ('old man'), the terms used for male relations ('itsùka', 'idìṡi', etc.) and their compounds (such as 'makadiṡta-maste' and 'itakaḣe') are the masculine nouns for humans. The word 'kedapi' by itself means "bull" but designates the maleness of any of the lower animals in its suffix form, with or without the interposition of the adverb 'adu'.&lt;ref name="Matthews, Washington 1983. p. 34"/&gt;

Nouns of the feminine gender: 'mia' ('woman'), kaduḣe ('old woman'), the terms used for female relations ('idu', 'itakiṡa', etc.) and their compounds (such as 'miakaza', meaning "a young woman") are feminine nouns for humans. The word 'mika', meaning" a mare," the designation for females of the lower animals, with or without the interposition of 'adu'.&lt;ref name="Matthews, Washington 1983. p. 34"/&gt;

===Number===
Hidatsa nouns do not change forms to mark the difference between singular and plural. Some nouns are known to be singular or plural from only the original meaning of the word or how they are used in a sentence. In other cases, numeral adjectives or adjectives such as ahu ('many'), etsa ('all') and kauṡta ('few') are the only indications at discerning number.&lt;ref name="Matthews, Washington 1983. p. 34"/&gt;

===Person===
There are five simple pronouns: 'ma' and 'mi', sometimes contracted to 'm', refer to the first person; 'da' and 'di', sometimes contracted to 'd', to the second person; and 'i' to the third person. They are normally incorporated into other words but can stand out for repetition or emphasis.

Both 'ma' and 'da' are the proper nominative forms, used as the nominatives of transitive verbs, but they may also be used as the nominative of certain intransitive verbs in an active sense, such as 'amaki' ("he sits") and 'adamaki' ("you sit"). They may also be prefixed, suffixed, or inserted into verbs, such as 'kikidi' ("he hunts"), 'dakikidi' ("you hunt"), and 'amakakạṡi' ("I write").&lt;ref name="Matthews, Washington 1983. p. 37"&gt;Matthews, Washington. Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the Hidatsa. New York: AMS, 1983. p. 37. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Ma' ("my") is used in the possessive case and is prefixed to the noun to indicate the possessed, in 'intimate or nontransferable' possession; examples include words such as 'maṡạki' ("my hand"), from the original word 'saki' ("hand").&lt;ref name="Matthews, Washington 1983. p. 37"/&gt;

===Modality===
There are three modes in Hidatsa: infinitive, indicative, and imperative. They are shown in the conjugations of verbs.

The infinitive is the same as the third person indicative, which is the simple form of the verb. However, finite verbs are much more commonly used in speech. For example, "I try to cough" would be produced as 'mahua mamahets' ("I cough, I try") rather than as 'hua mamahets' ("to cough, I try)"). In the third person, no distinction is made between the infinitive and the indicative modes.

The simple form of the verb is the third person indicative; it is modified by incorporated pronouns for the first and the second persons.

The imperative mode has five forms. The first form uses the same form as the second person indicative, which uses verbs that have incorporated pronouns suffixed. The second is made by final ‘i’ or ‘e’ of the infinitive to ‘a’ or using an infinitive ending in a or u. The third is formed by dropping the final ‘i’ of verbs ending in ‘ki’ and sometimes of those ending in ‘ti’. The fourth form adds the auxiliary ‘da’ to the second form of the imperative, usually placed after the verb. The fifth form is made by adding ‘diha’ instead of ‘da’. The fourth and the fifth forms are used when immediate compliance with the order is desired.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Washington. Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the Hidatsa. New York: AMS, 1983. p. 45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time===
In Hidatsa, there are two distinct conjugations of verbs related to time: one for the indefinite and one for future time. The indefinite tense is shown by the simple form of the verb, with or without the incorporated pronouns, and it is used for both past and present time.

In the future tense, indicative mode, 'mi' and 'miha' are added to the indefinite for the first person, 'di' and 'diha' for the second person. In the third person, the form is the same as in the indefinite.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Washington. Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the Hidatsa. New York: AMS, 1983. p. 46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Place===
Most adverbs of place are formed from nouns by suffixing the prepositions 'du', 'ha', 'ka', 'koa', and 'ta'. Some examples include 'dumàta' ("the middle"), 'dumàtadu' ("through the middle"), 'dumàtaka' ("the middle"), 'dumàtakoa' ("at the middle"), and 'dumàtata' ("facing in the direction of the middle"). Words formed so are used in the same way as the English adverbs 'windward' and 'forward'.

===Word order===
In Hidatsa, word order is [[subject-object-verb]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neiu.edu/~linguist/what_is_hidatsa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconjugated verbs===
Since there is no copula in Hidatsa, all adjectives, adverbs, and nouns that are used as predicates of nouns are regarded as intransitive verbs. They do not undergo a change of form to denote different modes and tenses. They may take the incorporated pronouns 'mi' and 'di' for their nominatives, which are prefixed. Verbs beginning with consonants are usually prefixed in full: 'liié' ("old, to be old") and 'liie' ("he, she, or it is or was old" or "you are or were old"). Before verbs beginning with vowels, the pronouns are often contracted.

Transitive verbs used in the third person or impersonally in a passive sense, with pronouns in the objective case prefixed, also look like unconjugated intransitive verbs.
&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Washington. Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the Hidatsa. New York: AMS, 1983. p. 115. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case===
Hidatsa nouns are not inflected to indicate case except (arguably) in the possessive.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Washington. Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the Hidatsa. New York: AMS, 1983. p. 96. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Possession is shown by the use of possessive pronouns, which are before the noun that is possessed. They are consided to be prefixed to it. Two kinds of possessions are indicated in Hidatsa: intimate (or non-transferable) possession, such as parts of the body, relationships, and anything else that cannot be relinquished; examples are the words 'idakoa' ("his friend or comrade") and 'iko'pa' ("her friend or comrade"). Initimate possession is shown by the simple possessive pronouns 'i', 'di', and 'ma' as well as the contractions 'm' and 'd': 'ạki' ("hand") can turn into 'iṡạki' ("his or her hand") 'diṡạki' ("your hand"), and  'maṡạki' ("my hand").

The other type, acquired possession,  indicates transferable possession, anything that can be givenn to another. It is shown by compound possessive pronouns 'ita', 'dita', and 'mata'. They are all formed by adding '-ta' to the simple pronouns: 'midaki' ("a shield"), 'itamidaki', ("his shield"), 'ditamidaki', ("your shield"), 'matamidaki', ("my shield").

The position of a word in a sentence and the conjugation of the verb that follows usually show whether it is in the nominative or the objective case. Often, it is unmistakable in context.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Washington. Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the Hidatsa. New York: AMS, 1983. p. 97. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
By the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale, originally proposed by linguist Joshua Fishman in 1991, the status of the language is at level 7, or 'Shifting': "The child-bearing generation can use the language among themselves, but it is not being transmitted to children."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-status&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by linguist Victor Golla in 2007 found that out of an ethnic population of 600, only 200 people are able to speak Hidatsa. There are 6 monolingual speakers, and only 50 speak the language semi-fluently; the most proficient speakers are ages 30 and older, and children are familiar with the language only in passing. Conversations in Hidatsa primarily take place between elders in the privacy of the home.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/language/hid&lt;/ref&gt; Revitalization is still possible since a good number of speakers are of child-bearing age, but emphasis on Hidatsa-language education must be stressed while that is still the case.

''La scienza della pigrizia'' (''The Science of Laziness''), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality and an excellent example of Late Modernism.]] --&gt;
In the visual arts, '''late modernism''' encompasses the overall production of most recent art made between the aftermath of World War II and the early years of the 21st century. The terminology often points to similarities between late modernism and post-modernism although there are differences. The predominant term for art produced since the 1950s is [[contemporary art]]. Not all art labelled as contemporary art is modernist or post-modern, and the broader term encompasses both artists who continue to work in modern and late modernist traditions, as well as artists who reject modernism for post-modernism or other reasons. [[Arthur Danto]] argues explicitly in ''After the End of Art'' that contemporaneity was the broader term, and that postmodern objects represent a subsector of the contemporary movement which replaced modernity and modernism, while other notable critics: [[Hilton Kramer]],&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp. 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Kirk Varnedoe]],&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe - Passages'', critical essay, [[Artforum]], Nov. 2003 by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and others have argued that postmodern objects are at best relative to modernist works.

The jargon which encompasses the two terms ''late modernism'' and ''[[postmodern art]]'' is used to denote what may be considered as the ultimate phase of [[modern art]], as art at the end of [[modernism]] or as certain tendencies of [[contemporary art]].

There are those who argue against a division into modern and [[postmodern]] periods. Not all critics agree that the stage called modernism is over or even near the end. There is no agreement that all art after modernism is post-modern. [[Contemporary art]] is the more-widely used term to denote work since roughly 1960, though it has many other uses as well. Nor is post-modern art universally separated from modernism, with many critics seeing it as merely another phase in [[modern art]] or as another form of late [[modernism]].

As with all uses of the term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"/&gt; This is not to say that the phase of art denoted by post-modernism is accepted, merely that the need for a term to describe movements in art after the peak of [[abstract expressionism]] is well established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay. URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, the consensus is that a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.

In literature, the term '''late modernism''' refers to works of literature produced after World War II. However, several different definitions of late modernist literature exist. The most common refers to works published between 1930 and 1939, or 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Hindrichs, "Late Modernism, 1928–1945: Criticism and Theory" ''Literature Compass'', Volume 8, Issue 11, pages 840–855, November 2011;  J. H. Dettmar "Modernism". David Scott Kastan. Oxford University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are modernists, such as [[Basil Bunting]] (1900–85) and [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888-1965), writing later than 1945, and [[Samuel Beckett]], who died in 1989, has been described as a "later modernist".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Dickstein, "An Outsider to His Own Life", Books, ''The New York Times'', August 3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot published two plays in the 1950s and Bunting's long modernist poem "[[Briggflatts]]" was published in 1965. The poets [[Charles Olson]] (1910-1970) and [[J. H. Prynne]] (1936- ) are, amongst other writing in the second half of the 20th century, who have been described as late modernists.&lt;ref&gt;''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors; see also Prynne's publisher, Bloodaxe Books.&lt;/ref&gt; There is the further question as to whether late modernist literature differs in any important way from the modernist works produced before 1930. To confuse matters, more recently the term late modernism has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of [[World War II]], especially the [[Holocaust]] and the dropping of the atom bomb.&lt;ref&gt;''Late modernist poetics: From Pound to Prynne'' by Anthony Mellors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late modernism describes movements which both arise from, and react against, trends in [[modernism]] and reject some aspect of modernism, while fully developing the conceptual potentiality of the modernist enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8-171&lt;/ref&gt; In some descriptions post-modernism as a period in art is completed, whereas in others it is a continuing movement in [[contemporary art]]. In art, the specific traits of modernism which are cited are generally formal purity, [[medium specificity]], [[art for art's sake]], the possibility of [[authenticity in art]], the importance or even possibility of universal truth in art, and the importance of an avant-garde and originality. This last point is one of particular controversy in art, where many institutions argue that being visionary, forward looking, cutting edge and progressive are crucial to the mission of art in the present, and that postmodern therefore, represents a contradiction of the value of "art of our times".

One compact definition offered is that while post-modernism acts in rejection of modernism's grand narratives of artistic direction, and to eradicate the boundaries between high and low forms of art, to disrupt genre and its conventions with collision, collage and fragmentation. Post-modern art is seen as believing that all stances are unstable and insincere, and therefore irony, parody and humor are the only positions which cannot be overturned by critique or later events.

Many of these traits are present in modern movements in art, particularly the rejection of the separation between high and low forms of art. However, these traits are considered fundamental to post-modern art, as opposed to merely present in one degree or another. One of the most important points of difference, however, between post-modernism, and modernism, as movements in art, is modernism's ultimately progressive stance that new works be more "forward looking" and advanced, whereas post-modern movements generally reject the notion that there can be advancement or progress in art per se, and thus one of the projects of art must be the overturning of the "myth of the [[avant-garde]]". This relates to the negation of what post-structuralist philosophers call "[[metanarratives]]".

[[Rosalind Krauss]] was one of the important annunciators of the view that avant-gardism was over, and that the new artistic era existed in a post-liberal and post-progress normalcy.&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8-171, Part II, ''Toward Post-Modernism'', pp. 196-291.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this viewpoint is explained by [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] in ''The Shock of the New''&lt;ref&gt;''The Shock of the New'' [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], Publisher: Knopf; Revised edition (August 13, 1991),&lt;/ref&gt; in his chapter "The Future That Was":

{{Quote|
Where did this new academy begin? At its origins the ''avant-garde'' myth had held the artist to be a precursor; the significant work is the one that prepares the future. The cult of the precursor ended by cluttering the landscape with absurd prophetic claims. The idea of a cultural ''avant-garde'' was unimaginable before 1800. It was fostered by the rise of [[liberalism]]. Where the taste of religious or secular courts determined patronage, "subversive" innovation was not esteemed as a sign of artistic quality. Nor was the artist's autonomy, that would come with the [[Romanticism|Romantics]].

As with all uses of the term postmodern there are critics of its application. [[Kirk Varnedoe]], for instance, stated that there is no such thing as postmodernism, and that the possibilities of modernism have not yet been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'', University of Chicago Press, 1997, p. 4. {{ISBN|0-226-22480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics are currently in the minority.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp. 218-221"/&gt;

[[Hilton Kramer]] describes postmodernism as "a creation of modernism at the end of its tether".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oliver Bennett, ''Cultural Pessimism: Narratives of Decline in the Postmodern World'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p. 131. {{ISBN|0-7486-0936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]], in [[Frederic Jameson]]'s analysis, does not hold that there is a postmodern stage radically different from the period of [[high modernism]]; instead, postmodern discontent with this or that high modernist style is part of the experimentation of high modernism, giving birth to new modernisms.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Jameson, ''Foreword'' to Jean-François Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Condition'', Manchester University Press, 1997, pxvi. {{ISBN|0-7190-1450-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radical movements in modern art ==

Radical movements in Modernism, Modern art, and radical trends regarded as influential and potentially as precursors to late modernism and postmodernism emerged around World War I and particularly in its aftermath. With the introduction of the use of industrial artifacts in art, movements such as [[Cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] as well as techniques such as [[collage]] and artforms such as cinema and the rise of [[reproduction]] as a means of creating artworks. Both [[Pablo Picasso]] the [[Modernist]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] the rebel created important and influential works from [[found objects]].

===Fauvism, cubism, dada, surrealism as the precedent===
{{main|Fauvism|Cubism|Dada|Surrealism}}

[[File:Matissedance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[The Dance (second version)]]'', 1909 [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]]]
In the early 20th century, following [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]]'s impact as Fauvist painters and [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]'s monumental innovations and the worldwide success of [[Cubism]] and the emboldening of the [[avant-garde]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] exhibited a urinal as a sculpture. His point was to have people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art, because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]]." The ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'',  was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, that shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as [[Dada]].

Dadaism can be viewed as part of the modernist propensity to challenge established styles and forms, along with [[Surrealism]], [[futurism]] and [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p. 17. {{ISBN|0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a chronological point of view Dada is located solidly within modernism, however a number of critics have held that it anticipates postmodernism, while others, such as [[Ihab Hassan]] and [[Steven Connor]], consider it a possible changeover point between modernism and postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Pegrum, ''Challenging Modernity: Dada Between Modern and Postmodern'', Berghahn Books, 2000, pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|1-57181-130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fauvism]] and [[Henri Matisse]] in particular became an important influence on both [[abstract expressionism]] and [[color field painting]], important milestones of Late Modernism. ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' is commonly recognized as "a key point of Matisse's career and in the development of modern painting".&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; With its large expanse of blue, simplicity of design and emphasis on pure feeling the painting was enormously influential to American artists who viewed it at [[MoMA]] in New York City.

===High art and culture===

The ignition point for the definition of modernism as a movement was the austere rejection of popular culture as [[kitsch]] by important post-war artists and taste-makers, most notably [[Clement Greenberg]] with his essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'', first published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/kitsch.html Avant-Garde and Kitsch]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s Greenberg proved to be an articulate and powerful art critic. In particular his writing on American Abstract expressionism, and 20th-century European modernism persuasively made the case for High art and culture. In 1961 ''Art and Culture'', Beacon Press, a highly influential collection of essays by [[Clement Greenberg]] was first published. Greenberg is primarily thought of as a [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] [[art critic]] and many of his most important essays are crucial to the understanding of [[Modern art]] history, and the history of [[modernism]] and Late Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson Pollock: abstract expressionism===
{{main|Jackson Pollock|Abstract expressionism|Process art|Western painting}}

During the late 1940s [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]'s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art gets made at the mid-century point. Pollock's move — away from easel painting and conventionality — was a liberating signal to his contemporaneous artists and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process — working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing, essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. [[Abstract expressionism]] in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them.

===Neo-Dada, collage and assemblage===

{{main|Collage|Assemblage art|Installation art}}

Related to [[abstract expressionism]] was the emergence of combined manufactured items — with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and [[commercial photography]].

[[Leo Steinberg]] uses the term postmodernism in 1969 to describe Rauschenberg's "flatbed" picture plane, containing a range of cultural images and artifacts that had not been compatible with the pictorial field of premodernist and modernist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp in Hal Foster (ed), ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p. 44. {{ISBN|0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] goes further, identifying the significance of Rauschenberg's work not as a representation of, in Steinberg's view, "the shift from nature to culture", but as a demonstration of the impossibility of accepting their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]] identify Rauschenberg and [[Jasper Johns]] as part of the transitional phase, influenced by [[Marcel Duchamp]], between modernism and postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997, p. 174. {{ISBN|1-57230-221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960s and 1970s===

[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|[[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], ''CUBI VI'', 1963]]
In abstract painting and sculpture during the 1950s and 1960s [[Geometric abstraction]] emerged as an important direction in the works of many sculptors and painters. In painting [[color field painting]], [[minimalism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliff, Carter. The New Informalists, Art News, v. 68, n. 8, December 1969, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; constituted radical new directions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Rose]]. ''American Painting. Part Two: The Twentieth Century''. Published by Skira - Rizzoli, New York, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Darby Bannard]]. "Notes on American Painting of the Sixties." ''Artforum'', January 1970, vol. 8, no. 5, pp.40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]]&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Rose, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/american-painting-the-twentieth-century/oclc/416195315&amp;referer=brief_results American painting, the twentieth century](New York : Skira/Rizzoli, 1986.) {{ISBN|2-605-00308-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Sir Anthony Caro]], [[Mark di Suvero]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Isaac Witkin]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Kenneth Snelson]], [[Al Held]], [[Ronald Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;

April, 1967. pp. 37-41, Cover Illus.: Six-Ninths Blue, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Hodgkin]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Peter Reginato]], were some of the artists whose works characterized abstract painting and sculpture in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v. 57, n. 6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lyrical abstraction]] shares similarities with [[color field]] painting and [[abstract expressionism]] especially in the freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in [[abstract expressionism]] and [[color field]] painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in [[action painting]] there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.
During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Richard Saba]], [[Susan Crile]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;"Shade acrylic canvases in which geometric shapes are juxtaposed". [[Betty Parsons]] Gallery. The New Yorker. Oct. 3, 1977 p.8&lt;/ref&gt; and dozens of others continued to produce vital and influential paintings.

===Minimalism and post-minimalism===

{{main|Minimalism|Postminimalism}}
[[File:'Red Canvas' by Richard Tuttle, 1967, Corcoran Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Tuttle]], ''Red Canvas'', 1967]]
By the early 1960s [[minimalism]] emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]). Important artists who emerged as pioneers of [[minimalism]] include [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ronald Bladen]] among others. These artists also frequently employed [[shaped canvas]]es, as in the example by [[Richard Tuttle]] shown at right. [[Minimal art]] rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of [[action painting]]. [[Minimalism]] argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting and sculpture, as opposed to other areas, is a late modernist movement and depending on the context can be construed as a precursor to the post modern movement.

Hal Foster, in his essay ''The Crux of Minimalism'', examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian modernism in their published definitions of minimalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 44–53. {{ISBN|0-262-56107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that minimalism is not a "dead end" of modernism, but a "paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today."&lt;ref name=Foster36/&gt;

In the late 1960s the term [[Post-minimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, ''[[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]]'', March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosalind Krauss]] argues that by 1968 artists such as Morris, LeWitt, Smithson and Serra had "entered a situation the logical conditions of which can no longer be described as modernist."&lt;ref name=Krauss287&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' pp.287&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the category of sculpture to include [[land art]] and [[architecture]], "brought about the shift into postmodernism."&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Sculpture in the Expanded Field'' (1979). pp.290&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their late [[modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

===Process art===
{{Main|Process art}}

By the late 1960s however, [[process art]] emerged as a revolutionary concept and movement that encompassed painting and sculpture, via [[lyrical abstraction]] and the [[postminimalist]] movement, and in early [[Conceptual Art]]. [[Eva Hesse]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Nancy Graves]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Mel Bochner]], [[Hannah Wilke]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Barry Le Va]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], and [[Alan Saret]], were some of the process artists that emerged during the 1960s. Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, scale, size, and plastic and real space.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pop art===
{{main|Pop art|Western painting}}
The term "pop art" was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] to describe paintings that celebrated [[consumerism]] of the post World War II era.&lt;ref&gt;''Topics in American Art since 1945'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], 1975 by W.W. Norton and Company, NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement rejected [[abstract expressionism]] and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of [[David Hockney]] and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] were considered seminal examples in the movement. While later American examples include the bulk of the careers of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and his use of [[Benday dots]], a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a clear connection between the radical works of [[Duchamp]], the rebellious [[Dada]]ist — with a sense of humor; and [[pop art]]ists like [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

In general pop art and [[minimalism]] began as modernist movements, a shift in the paradigm and a philosophical split between [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and anti-formalism in the early 1970s caused those movements to be viewed by some as precursors, or transitioning to postmodern art. Other modern movements cited as influential to postmodern art are [[Conceptual art]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]] and the use of techniques such as [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[collage]], [[bricolage]] and art forms which used recording or reproduction as the basis for artworks.
 
There are differing opinions as to whether pop art is a late modernist movement or is [[Postmodern]]. Thomas McEvilly, agreeing with [[Dave Hickey]], says that postmodernism in the visual arts began with the first exhibitions of pop art in 1962, "though it took about twenty years before postmodernism became a dominant attitude in the visual arts."&lt;ref name=McEvilly29&gt;Thomas McEvilly in Richard Roth, Jean Dubuffet, Susan King, ''Beauty Is Nowhere: Ethical Issues in Art and Design'', Routledge, 1998. p. 29. {{ISBN|90-5701-311-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Jameson]], too, considers pop art to be postmodern.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Jameson in Hal Foster, ''Postmodern Culture'', Pluto Press, 1985 (first published as ''The Anti-Aesthetic'', 1983). p. 111. {{ISBN|0-7453-0003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way that Pop art is postmodern is that it breaks down what [[Andreas Huyssen]] calls the "Great Divide" between high art and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'', Routledge, 2005. p. 20. {{ISBN|0-415-28064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism emerges from a "generational refusal of the categorical certainties of high modernism."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Sim, ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'', Routledge, 2001. p. 148. {{ISBN|0-415-24307-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although to presuppose that [[modernism]] stands for "high art" only, and is in any way certain as to what constitutes "high" art is to profoundly and basically misunderstand modernism.

===Performance art and happenings===

{{main|Performance art|List of performance artists|Happenings}}
[[File:Schneemann-Interior Scroll.gif|thumb|left|[[Carolee Schneemann]] performing her piece ''Interior Scroll, 1975.'' [[Yves Klein]] in [[France]], and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in [[New York City]] were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caroleeschneemann.com/interiorscroll.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of [[contemporary art]]. [[Yves Klein]] in France, and [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], and [[Yoko Ono]] in New York City were pioneers of performance based works of art. Groups like The [[Living Theater]] with [[Julian Beck]] and [[Judith Malina]] collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments; radically changing the relationship between audience and performer especially in their piece ''Paradise Now''. The [[Judson Dance Theater]] located at the [[Judson Memorial Church]], [[New York City]], and the Judson dancers, notably [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Trisha Brown]], [[Elaine Summers]], Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Steve Paxton]] and others collaborated with artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Robert Whitman]], [[John Cage]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and engineers like [[Billy Klüver]]. These performances were often designed to be the creation of a new art form, combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. The works were characterized by the reductive philosophies of [[minimalism]], and the spontaneous improvisation, and expressivity of [[abstract expressionism]].

During the same period — the late 1950s through the mid-1960s various [[avant-garde]] artists created [[Happenings]]. Happenings were mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in varied specified locations. Often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physical exercise, costumes, spontaneous [[nudity]], and various random and seemingly disconnected acts. [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Robert Whitman]] among others were notable creators of Happenings.

===Fluxus===

{{main|Fluxus}}
Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–78), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to [[John Cage]]'s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage's students included Fluxus founding members [[Jackson Mac Low]], [[Al Hansen]], [[George Brecht]] and [[Dick Higgins]].

Fluxus encouraged a do it yourself aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

[[Andreas Huyssen]] criticises attempts to claim Fluxus for postmodernism as, "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement – as it were, postmodernism's sublime."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 192. {{ISBN|0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he sees Fluxus as a major [[Neo-Dada]]ist phenomena within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against, "the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Huyssen, ''Twilight Memories: Marking Time in a Culture of Amnesia'', Routledge, 1995. p. 196. {{ISBN|0-415-90934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and low===

[[File:OtternessSculpture.JPG|thumb|Tom Otterness sculpture in Nelson A. Rockefeller Park, [[Battery Park City]], New York City]]
As a kind of response to [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture'', Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 [[Kirk Varnedoe]] and [[Adam Gopnik]] curated ''High and Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture'', at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The exhibition attempted to elucidate the extent that artists and high culture drew on and from popular culture. Although universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Kirk Varnedoe, 1946&amp;ndash;2003'' - Front Page - Obituary - [[Art in America]],  Oct, 2003 by Marcia E. Vetrocq&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition is remembered today as a benchmark of the conflict between late modernism and postmodernism.

==Movements associated with Postmodern art==

===Conceptual art===
{{main|Conceptual art}}

[[Conceptual art]] became an important development in contemporary art in the late 1960s, it delivered an influential critique on the status quo. Late modernism expanded and contracted during the late 1960s and for some, conceptual art made a complete break with modernism. Sometimes it is labelled as postmodern because it is expressly involved in [[deconstruction]] of what makes a work of art, "art". Conceptual art, because it is often designed to confront, offend or attack notions held by many of the people who view it, is regarded with particular controversy. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. Thus, because ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was exhibited, it was a sculpture. [[Marcel Duchamp]] famously gave up "art" in favor of [[chess]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Duchamp]]&lt;/ref&gt; Avant-garde composer [[David Tudor]] created a piece, ''Reunion'' (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross that features a chess game, where each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. At the premiere, the game was played between [[John Cage]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Tudor]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some other famous examples being [[John Cage]]'s 4' 33" which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence and Rauschenberg's ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]''.  Many conceptual works take the position that art is created by the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not from the intrinsic qualities of the work itself.

=== Installation art ===

{{main|Installation art}}
An important series of movements in art which have consistently been described as postmodern involved [[installation art]] and creation of artifacts that are conceptual in nature.  One example being the signs of [[Jenny Holtzer]] which use the devices of art to convey specific messages, such as "Protect Me From What I Want".  Installation Art has been important in determining the spaces selected for museums of contemporary art in order to be able to hold the large works which are composed of vast collages of manufactured and found objects. These installations and collages are often electrified, with moving parts and lights.

They are often designed to create environmental effects, as [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' which was a row of barrels intended to create a [[traffic jam]].

=== Intermedia and multi-media ===

{{main|Intermedia}}

Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. [[Intermedia]], a term coined by [[Dick Higgins]] and meant to convey new artforms along the lines of [[Fluxus]], [[Concrete Poetry]], [[Found objects]], [[Performance art]], and [[Computer art]]. Higgins was the publisher of the [[Something Else Press]], a [[Concrete poet]], married to artist [[Alison Knowles]] and an admirer of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. [[Ihab Hassan]] includes, "Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms", in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art.&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Hassan in Lawrence E. Cahoone, ''From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2003. p. 13. {{ISBN|0-631-23213-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common forms of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed [[Video art]]. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with [[performance art]], where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.

=== Appropriation art and neo-conceptual art ===

{{main|Appropriation art|neo-conceptual art}}
In his 1980 essay ''The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism'', [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]] identifies the re-emergence of an [[allegorical]] impulse as characteristic of postmodern art. This impulse can be seen in the [[appropriation art]] of artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]] and [[Robert Longo]] because, "Allegorical imagery is appropriated imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Craig Owens, ''Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture'', London and Berkeley: University of California Press (1992), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation art debunks modernist notions of artistic genius and originality and is more ambivalent and contradictory than modern art, simultaneously installing and subverting ideologies, "being both critical and complicit."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, ''The Postmodern Turn'', Guilford Press, 1997. p. 186. {{ISBN|1-57230-221-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neo-expressionism ===
{{main|Neo-expressionism}}

The return to the traditional art forms of sculpture and painting in the late 1970s and early 1980s seen in the work of [[Neo-expressionism|neo-expressionist]] artists such as [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]] has been described as a postmodern tendency,&lt;ref&gt;Tim Woods, ''Beginning Postmodernism'', Manchester University Press, 1999. p. 125. {{ISBN|0-7190-5211-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first coherent movements to emerge in the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Thomson Wadsworth, 2006, p. 842. {{ISBN|0-495-00480-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its strong links with the commercial art market has raised questions, however, both about its status as a postmodern movement and the definition of postmodernism itself. Hal Foster states that neo-expressionism was complicit with the conservative cultural politics of the Reagan-Bush era in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Foster36&gt;Hal Foster, ''The Return of the Real: The Avant-garde at the End of the Century'', MIT Press, 1996, p. 36. {{ISBN|0-262-56107-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Félix Guattari]] disregards the "large promotional operations dubbed 'neo-expressionism' in Germany", (an example of a "fad that maintains itself by means of publicity") as a too easy way for him "to demonstrate that postmodernism is nothing but the last gasp of modernism." These critiques of neo-expressionism reveal that money and public relations really sustained contemporary art world credibility in America during the same period that conceptual and feminist art practices were systematically reevaluating modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Doss, ''Twentieth-Century American Art'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 210. {{ISBN|0-19-284239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutional Critique ===
{{main|Institutional Critique}}

Critiques on the institutions of art (principally museums and galleries) are made in the work of [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]] and [[Hans Haacke]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the beginning of the 21st century contemporary painting, contemporary sculpture and contemporary art in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting, sculpture and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on", and consequently "nothing going on" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently, magnificent and important works of art continue to be made albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit. Frank Stella's ''La scienza della pigrizia'' (''The Science of Laziness''), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality and an excellent example of Late Modernism.

[[Hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[hyperrealism]], [[photorealism]], [[expressionism]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], [[pop art]], [[op art]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[color field painting]], [[monochrome painting]], [[neo-expressionism]], [[collage]], [[intermedia]] painting, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] painting, [[digital painting]], [[postmodern]] painting, [[Neo-Dada]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting, environmental [[mural painting]], traditional [[figure painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]], are a few continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century. The New European Painting of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, with painters like [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Luc Tuymans]], has opened a complex and interesting dialogue with the legacy of American color field and lyrical abstraction on the one hand and figurality on the other hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13330">The '''learning center''' strategy  uses eight basic learning centers to address the countless objectives of [[United States|American]] early childhood [[classroom]]s, attempting to develop the student’s social, emotional, physical, cognitive, and aesthetic abilities.

There are eight basic learning centers in an early childhood/elementary classroom, according to the [http://www.sfasu.edu/education/departments/elementary/centers/ Stephen F. Austin State University Charter School program], each structured to expand the students’ experiences in a variety of meaningful and effective ways.  Each center is constructed to encompass numerous objectives, including state and federal standards, school standards, and community standards.  The learning centers approach focuses on student autonomy and learning style by giving each student an opportunity to explore his learning environment hands-on in a developmentally appropriate classroom (see [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivism]]). Teachers act as facilitators, providing materials and guidance, as well as planning discussions, activities, demonstrations, and reviews.

==Importance of learning centers==

Learning centers are typically set up in a classroom to encourage children to make choices.  As they work in the centers they learn to work independently as well as cooperatively.  This gives the child more control over what they do.&lt;ref name="Hayes" &gt;{{cite book

==Basic learning centers==

One important learning center that is invaluable to an independent learning environment that fosters creativity and expression is the "art center".  According to Dodge, Colker, and Heroman,&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, 2002, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; the art center allows children to visually express themselves.  Children also learn how to critically evaluate their artwork,&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the artwork as others, helping them to practice and develop their cognitive skills, language skills, and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Bickart, Jablon, and Dodge, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;  Art also offers many opportunities for core subject integration, especially in regard to science, social studies, or language arts.&lt;ref&gt;Bickart, Jablon, and Dodge, p. 433-434&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when studying the anatomy of a flower, the teacher could ask students to draw and color their own flowers based on an accurate representation of a flower or diagram.

Next, the "blocks center" is essential in a [[pre-kindergarten]] classroom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/ece/1996/01.asp 10 Signs of a Great Preschool]&lt;/ref&gt; and greatly valued in older grades.&lt;ref name=BJD119/&gt; The blocks center gives children an opportunity to recreate experiences,&lt;ref&gt;Bickart, Jablon, and Dodge, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; and explore the elements and complexities of structures.&lt;ref name=BJD119&gt;Bickart, Jablon, and Dodge, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Children learn about their community and its functions while building representations&lt;ref name=BJD119/&gt; of common buildings like fire stations, houses, libraries, and zoos.  A plethora of other subjects can be integrated in the blocks center, including literacy, mathematics, science, social studies, art, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Bickart, Jablon, and Dodge, p. 253-254&lt;/ref&gt; The blocks center is an especially good place for children to explore the rules of society, relationships, and teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another center is "Discovery", a place where children can explore the answers to questions driven by their natural curiosity&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Colker, Heroman, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; Science is a special subject in discovery, as gives children the chance to explore life, earth, and the laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery center sets the stage for students to use the [[scientific method]] to predict and find solutions starting during the second half of first grade.&lt;ref&gt;ECH 331 Curriculum Author, Slide 24 - Contact Stephen F. Austin State University Charter School's principal Lori Harkness&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler, Texas' [http://www.discoveryscienceplace.com/ Discovery Science Place] features numerous types of discovery centers.

"Dramatic play" centers promote [[social interaction]], role exploration, and abstract thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  Children are given the opportunity to deeply explore roles of people in their family and community.&lt;ref name=DCH271&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;   Pretending is an important part developing abstract thought, such as connecting symbols with real objects and events.&lt;ref name=BSD154/&gt; Dramatic play greatly enhances a child’s social and emotional development when children cooperate, feel empathy, and control their emotions.&lt;ref name=DCH271/&gt;

In the United States, [[literacy]] is a number one priority for both public and private education. In fact, the United States’ literacy rate is one of the highest in the world, reaching 99% of the population.{{cn|date=October 2013}}  For this reason, "library centers" are a major contribution to not only learning center curriculum, but all other classroom strategies.  In the library center, children learn the importance of reading and writing by engaging in motivational literacy activities through meaningful contexts.&lt;ref name=Psread/&gt; The library center also gives the child opportunities to practice reading, have immediate access to print materials for independent reading,&lt;ref name=Psread&gt;[http://www.naeyc.org/about/positions/pdf/PSREAD98.PDF Learning to Read and Write: Developmentally Appropriate Practices for Young Children] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001190859/http://www.naeyc.org/about/positions/pdf/PSREAD98.PDF |date=2008-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; participate in read-alouds and retellings (Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p.&amp;nbsp;371-373), and share experiences they have had with books.  The library center can enhance the theme of any classroom curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p. 363-364&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when doing a science unit on mammals, studying human impact on animal life in social studies, and creating pictures of animals in art, the teacher could also facilitate books and activities in the library center about animals, creating connections between subjects.  Furthermore, many children are not exposed to literature in their homes, severely limiting their print knowledge.&lt;ref name=Psread/&gt; The library center provides these children with regular and active interactions with print.&lt;ref name=Psread/&gt;   

A pertinent center to the American health and [[obesity]] epidemic is the "muscle center".  In the muscle center, students engage in activities that exercise their bodies, and subsequently “wake up” their minds.&lt;ref&gt;Bickart, Jablon, Dodge, p. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;  Movement also allows children to outlet their high energy and creativity.&lt;ref name=DCH423&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;  During muscle activities, students learn to control their bodies and apply gross motor skills to new types of movement.&lt;ref name=DCH423/&gt;

Next, the "music center" creates opportunities for children to cooperate in activities that stimulate creativity, listening, and language. By engaging in songs, children learn the natural intonations and rhythms of language.  When singing together, children feel harmony with their classmates.&lt;ref&gt;Bickart, Jablon, and Dodge, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;  Music instruction has also been proven to increase intelligence quotient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040619/fob6.asp Bower]&lt;/ref&gt;  Music also offers an easy way for those children on a lower developmental level to participate successfully in a fun group activity.	

Lastly, the "table games center" offers a unique way for children to explore established rules, create their own rules, and enforce those rules.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Colker, and Heroman, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; Table games also promote healthy competition, giving students a chance to cope with negative feelings in a safe and supportive environment.&lt;ref name=BSD154&gt;Bickart, Jablon, and Dodge, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Children explore mathematical concepts while playing games like cards, dice, and Connect Four.&lt;ref name=BSD154/&gt;  Children must plan strategies in order to problem solve and win the game.&lt;ref name=BSD154/&gt;  

Another important center that should be included in this list is a writing center.  Set up an environment that supports and motivates writing. Provide writing materials in all of your learning centers. Once writing becomes established in the classroom, you'll find that it carries over into a variety of activities. Memo pads, notepads, and stationery placed in manipulative, library, or art areas can transform the activities children typically engage in there. These writing materials allow children to create their own activities and play scenarios, reinforcing the important message that there are many uses for writing &lt;/ref Neuman ref&gt;.

Encourage independent use of learning centers with these quick and easy tips 
# One Define the space. Use throw rugs, bookcases, and curtains to help children contain their play within the center. 
# Two Take a room tour. Start the year by taking a few children at a time on a quick tour of the centers. Show them where materials are and how to put them away. 
# Three Keep materials accessible. Put current materials for each center in well-defined containers and marked shelves at children's eye level. 
# FourStore a few teacher materials in each center. It takes too much time to have to search for your own materials. Place your materials on a high shelf in each area. 
# Five Stock centers sparingly. It is easier for children to manage materials if there are just a few items there. As children learn how to easily use and put materials away, ask them to suggest what new items they would like to add to the centers. 
# Six Set up portable centers. Use plastic tubs or bins to create portable centers children can take to a private area to work and play. 
# Seven Make a cooperative center rules chart. At a group time, encourage children to suggest rules for working/playing in learning centers. If children are having difficulty, suggest issues such as sharing materials, respecting each other's work, and putting materials away. 
# Eight Display children's work. Use bulletin boards, shelf backs, cardboard boxes or [[room dividers]] as a place to show children what others have done in the center. 
# Nine Set up a works-in-progress shelf. Sometimes children don't have enough time to complete a project in a center. Create a "safe place" where children can store ongoing projects. 
# Ten Create a take-home box. Set out a box near the door for children to place their finished projects for take-home at the end of the day &lt;/ref Church, E. ref&gt;.

The book's story is in eight parts. The book includes Na Liu's reaction to the death of [[Mao Zedong]]. Elizabeth Bird, an [[Evanston Public Library]] Collection Development Manager and a previous [[New York Public Library]] materials specialist, stated how Na Liu cries since the other persons around her are also crying is "very realistic".&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt; 

The book includes supplementary materials, such as maps, translations of [[hanzi]], a glossary, and a timeline of Chinese history.&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

==Reception==
Bird gave a favorable review to the book in an article for the ''[[School Library Journal]]''. Bird cited how it "simply tells a true story about some of the people who were helped by Mao’s rule" and has "universal stories from her youth that anybody can enjoy", even though it was one of several works around the [[Cultural Revolution]], a common theme in children's books about China available in the United States, and used that particular setting.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt; Bird stated that a coworker who grew up in China in the same period confirmed to her that the book's details were authentic.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

''[[Publisher's Weekly]]'' stated described Na Liu as a "storyteller whose words are enlivened by Martinez’s enthusiastic and energetic art, and their respective tones complement each other fluidly."&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] stated that the book is "Beautifully drawn and quietly evocative."&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

'''''Living Witchcraft: A Contemporary American Coven''''' is a [[sociology|sociological]] study of an American [[coven]] of [[Wicca]]ns who operated in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] during the early 1990s. It was co-written by the sociologist Allen Scarboro, psychologist Nancy Campbell and literary critic Shirley Stave and first published by [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] in 1994. Although largely sociological, the study was interdisciplinary, and included both insider and outsider perspectives into the coven; Stave was an initiate and a practicing Wiccan while Scarboro and Campbell remained non-initiates throughout the course of their research.

The trio became friends after meeting at an academic seminar devoted to the study of religion held at [[Emory University]], Atlanta in 1990. Stave subsequently revealed herself to the group as a Wiccan, a member of a [[new religious movement]] that interested Scarboro and Campbell, and together the three decided to undertake a study of the Wiccan coven to which Stave belonged. This, the Ravenwood coven, met in the local area, where it was led by a High Priestess named Lady Sintana. Learning of their proposals, Lady Sintana gave them her permission to attend the coven's rituals, classes and open houses and also to interview its members.

Divided into three parts, ''Living Witchcraft'' offers a sociological investigation of a coven of Wiccans located in Atlanta known as Ravenwood.

==Background==

===Wicca in the United States===

Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic fieldwork into Wicca===

Prior to the authors' work, several American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''[[Persuasions of the Witch's Craft|Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England]]'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as Scarboro, Campbell and Stave were undertaking their research, the American anthropologist and practicing Wiccan Loretta Orion was also undertaking an investigation into the Pagan movement in the East Coast and Midwest of the United States. Orion's work would come to be published as ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' by Waveland Press in 1995, although would be heavily criticized in reviews written by both Luhrmann and T.O. Beidelman, both of whom were of the opinion that Orion's Pagan beliefs had clouded her critical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ori95|Orion 1995]], and also [[#Bei95|Beidelman 1995]] and [[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] of the [[West Chester University of Pennsylvania]] had also been undertaking fieldwork among the Wiccan community of [[New England]] during that decade, having developed an interest in researching the subject in 1986. The results of Berger's 11 years of research would come to be published by the [[University of South Carolina Press]] in 1999 as ''[[A Community of Witches|A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States]]'', to predominantly positive academic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ber99|Berger 1999]], and also [[#Fol99|Foltz 1999]], [[#Gla99|Glazier 1999]], [[#Kos99|Kostarelos 1999]], [[#Sch00|Schnurbein 2000]] and [[#Nei00|Neitz 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scarboro, Campbell, Stave and their research===

|}

The project that resulted in ''Living Witchcraft'' originated at a seminar led by Robert Detweiler, a professor at [[Emory University]]'s Graduate Institute of the Liberal Arts. Sponsored by the [[Dana Foundation]], the seminar took place in Autumn 1990, and involved six professors from various U.S. colleges meeting together in Atlanta to share their research into various different aspects of religion and discuss conceptions of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality between the mind and the body]].&lt;ref name="Scarboro ix"/&gt; One of the academics attending the seminar, Shirley "Holly" Stave, a literary critic and untenured faculty member at Emory, soon admitted to the group that she was a practicing Wiccan, and told them of her belief that her religion could provide "a way of reuniting mind and body."&lt;ref name="Scarboro ix"/&gt; Stave later explained to the group that she felt "moved" by "Spirit" to inform them of her own spiritual beliefs, in spite of the discrimination that this could bring upon her in the largely Christian state of Georgia. She also felt that in helping to educate others about Wiccan beliefs, it would ultimately help to prevent the misinformation and persecution that many Wiccans faced.&lt;ref name="Scarboro x"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the other academics attending the seminar were already familiar with the Wiccan movement. Allen Scarboro, then studying the [[sociology of religion]], had previously undertaken magico-religious practices with two Native American shamans, and had a basic knowledge of various new religious movements including Wicca, while Nancy Campbell, an academic psychologist, had previously attended the rituals of a feminist Wiccan group. Wanting to learn more about the faith, Scarboro and Campbell approached Stave, asking her if they could witness any of the rituals performed by her coven, which was known as Ravenwood. After gaining the permission of the coven's High Priestess, Lady Sintana, they attended the group's [[Sabbat]] rite at [[Hallowmas]], later deciding that they wanted to undertake research into the group for an interdisciplinary project, imagining that it would result in an extended [[academic paper]].&lt;ref name="Scarboro x"/&gt;

Agreeing to their proposals, the only two constraints that Lady Sintana imposed on the researchers was that Scarboro and Campbell, the two non-initiates, could not "observe, know, or report the text for the circle-building procedures that immediately precede and prepare the energy circle for rituals", and that they also could not attend initiation rituals or learn the text for the Ravenwood initiation rites. These things, Lady Sintana maintained, were secrets that only those initiated into the coven could know.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi-xii"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. pp. xi&amp;ndash;xii.&lt;/ref&gt; In putting together their [[research design]], the trio were aided by Robin Ingalls, a student with a background in psychology and spirituality who was studying at [[Georgia State University]], while another student, Gilbert Bond, who was then studying at Emory University's Graduate Institute of Liberal Arts, also aided them in their research.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xii"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The group began their project in October 1990, having gathered most of their data by June 1991, by which time they had also written early drafts for several chapters of what would later come to be published as ''Living Witchcraft'' in 1994.&lt;ref name="Scarboro xii"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Part I: Ravenwood: A Living Atlanta Coven===
The first part of ''Living Witchcraft'' was devoted to describing the ritual activities which members of the Ravenwood coven took part in.&lt;ref name="Scarboro 1-2"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Insider/outsider dichotomy===
Regarding their approach to fieldwork, the authors noted that they had given "serious consideration" to whether Stave, being a practicing Wiccan, could be [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] in her participation in the study. However, as they later noted, "poststructural theoretical perspective[s]" had shown that "pure objectivity is never possible", and that the "context of each researcher &amp;ndash; gender, race, socioeconomic level, sexual orientation, one's biography as a whole &amp;ndash; shapes that person's understanding."&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi"&gt;[[#Scar94|Scarboro, Campbell and Stave 1994]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than aiming to achieve a positivist objectivity, they instead focused on achieving what American anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926&amp;ndash;2006) referred to as a "[[thick description]]" in his book ''The Interpretation of Cultures'' (1973). This "thick description" approach would not only present the Wiccans themselves in a manner that they would recognize, but also related what a "non-Witch, specifically a thinking, reflective, non-Witch, would experience were she or he to participate in rituals and classes at Ravenwood."&lt;ref name="Scarboro xi"/&gt;

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===
The anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann]] (1959&amp;ndash;) of the [[University of California, San Diego]], published a review of both ''Living Witchcraft'' and Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times]]'' (1995) in the ''Journal of Anthropological Research''. Noting that ''Living Witchcraft'' was "as sympathetic to the practice" of Wicca as Orion's study, she believed however that it had the advantage of being "written from the more distanced stand of the participant-observer as understood in mainstream anthropology." In focusing in on one particular coven rather than trying to provide a broader study of the Wiccan movement, Luhrmann felt that ''Living Witchcraft'' had provided a study which was "unusual and fascinating and remarkably rich in its detail." She proceeded to note that in her opinion, the "eye-opening" feature of the book was its examination of what life was like for public Witches living in the [[Deep South]], a predominantly conservative and Christian part of the United States. In summing up her review, Luhrmann stated that "witchcraft remains an important study for anthropological research, if only because so many people have such peculiar ideas about it."&lt;ref name="Luhrmann 1996"&gt;[[#Luh96|Luhrmann 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please replace this with a better definition, but so far as I can tell the midlist is the list, most often a list of books from a publisher, that have been determined to do okay, but not be their bestsellers. So a midlist author would be someone who constantly writes books that are almost the at the top of the list, but not quite.
--&gt;
'''Midlist''' is a term in the [[publishing industry]] which refers to [[book]]s which are not [[bestseller]]s but are strong enough to economically justify their publication (and likely, further purchases of future books from the same [[author]]). The vast majority of total titles published are midlist titles, though they represent a much smaller fraction of total book sales, which are dominated by bestsellers and other very popular titles.

Authors who consistently publish acceptable but not bestselling books are referred to as '''Midlist authors'''.

== United States ==
In the US, midlist publications were negatively affected by the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case [[Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue]], which changed how [[book publisher]]s have to account for and can depreciate unsold inventory each year. The Thor decision caused publishers and booksellers to be much quicker to destroy stocks of poorly-selling books in order to realize a taxable loss. These books would previously have been kept in stock but written down to reflect the fact that not all of them were expected to sell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/how-thor-power-hammered-publishing/&lt;/ref&gt; This has been somewhat mitigated by the development of [[On-line book|online bookselling]], which makes less popular titles more accessible to average readers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">'''Nouvelle Tendance''' (New Tendency) was an art movement founded in Yugoslavia in 1961. The "theoretician"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the group was Serbian art critic [[Marko Mestrovich]]. The other original founders of Nouvelle Tendance were Brazilian painter [[Almir Mavignier]], and [[Bozo Bek]], the Croatian director of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|isbn=9780500288443|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Nouvelle Tendance was more accurately a reflection of common approaches used by artists in a variety of simultaneous movements worldwide, such as [[Concrete art]], [[Kinetic art]], and [[Op Art]]. The main consideration of the movement has been described as the "problem of movement as conveyed through repetition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "sensation of displeasure" is provoked in some Nouvelle Tendance works, to "stimulate a more active field of vision" and interest the spectator in an "auto-creative process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Frank|title=Origins and development of kinetic art|year=1968|publisher=New York Graphic Society|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct self-identified groups of artists who became associated with Nouvelle Tendance included GRAV, Gruppo T, Gruppo N, and Zero. The movement attracted artists from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. International artists participated in a series of exhibits at European galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500288443|pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group should not be confused with an early 20th century circle of Paris-based artists who operated briefly under the name "Tendances nouvelles" and held an exhibition in 1904; founding members included [[Alice Dannenberg]] and [[Martha Stettler]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gil Blas'', April 13, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6703">In rhetoric, '''Parallel Syntax''' (also known as parallel construction and parallelism) is a rhetorical device that consists of repetition among adjacent sentences or clauses.  The repeated sentences or clauses provides emphasis to a center theme or idea the author is trying to convey.&lt;ref name=Farn /&gt;

In language, syntax is the structure of a sentence, so this can also be called parallel sentence structure. This rhetorical tool improves the flow of a sentence, making it more concise by eliminating unnecessary words that could distract the reader from the main point. Parallel structure is like the derived conjunction analysis because it assumes several underlying complete sentences.&lt;ref&gt;"Parallel Structures in Syntax." Lingua 75.2 (1988): 275-87. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to providing emphasis, it is evident that parallel structure appeals to the reader or listener in a variety of ways as well.  Primarily, the repetition of clauses promotes a heightened mental ability to process the sentence as a whole; studies have shown that the reiteration of the second clause will increase the speed an individual can process the sentence.&lt;ref name="download.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frazier|first1=Lyn|last2=Taft|first2=Lori|last3=Roeper|first3=Tom|last4=Clifton|first4=Charles|last5=Ehrlich|first5=Kate|title=Parallel Structure: A Source of Facilitation in Sentence Comprehension|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=March 29, 1984|volume=12|issue=5|pages=421–430|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/810/art%253A10.3758%252FBF03198303.pdf?auth66=1414788407_29c078e2ac0e2ea4d583efc2e44f139d&amp;ext=.pdf|doi=10.3758/bf03198303}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it decreases the load of information needed to be processed by the reader, facilitating comprehension.&lt;ref name="download.springer.com"/&gt;  Employment of parallel structure is not only persuasive; it is emotionally appealing to the reader.

According to Aristotle, persuasion is created through parallel syntax by means of repetition.  Recapping crucial aspects of an argument through properly created phrases and clauses further embeds the idea into the listener, ultimately resulting in persuasion.  However, these clauses must be created precisely, in a way similar to poetry, in order to maximize the effect.  For example, paired sentences, phrases, or clauses must be created with equal structure in regards to verb and noun choice, along with both number of syllables and meter; according to Aristotle, the more ways in which these aspects match, the more persuasive the argument will be.&lt;ref name="Verbal and Visual Parallelism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=Verbal and Visual Parallelism|journal=Written Communication|date=April 1, 2003|volume=20|issue=2|page=128|url=http://wcx.sagepub.com/content/20/2/123.full.pdf+html|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using Parallel syntax among two clauses is known as an '''Isocolon''', when among three clauses it is known as a '''Tricolon'''.&lt;ref name=Farn&gt;Farnsworth, Ward. Farnsworth's Classical English Rhetoric. 1st. Boston: David R. Godine, 2011. 74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having similar syntactical structure among clauses or phrases helps the reader identify the similarity of ideas proposed within them.&lt;ref&gt;Strunk, William. Elements of Style. Ithaca, N.Y.: Priv. print. [Geneva, N.Y.: Press of W.P. Humphrey], 1918; Bartleby.com, 1999. www.bartleby.com/141/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isocolon is made up of the Greek words ''iso'' (equal) and ''kolon'' (member), so each part or clause is the same length. A Tricolon has 3 clauses that do not need to be the same length. An Isocolon can be a Tricolon but a Tricolon cannot be an Isocolon.

Also, parallel syntax adds a figure of balance to sentences it is implemented into.&lt;ref name=Eid&gt;Eidenmuller, Michael E. "Rhetorical Figures in Sound: Parallelism." Rhetorical Figures in Sound: Parallelism. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Parallel syntax is often used in conjunction with [[Antithesis]], [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|Anaphora]], [[Asyndeton]], [[Climax (figure of speech)|Climax]], [[Epistrophe]] and [[Symploce]].&lt;ref name=Eid /&gt;

== Examples ==

'''Examples of Parallel structure used alongside other rhetorical devices:'''

* Anaphora ''(repetition of the beginning of successive clauses)'': "I live, I love, I laugh."
* Epistrophe ''(repetition of the end of successive clauses)'': "Work stinks, wife stinks, dog stinks."
* Climax ''(increasing in intensified meaning)'': “I like him, I love him, I need him.”
* Asyndeton ''(purposely leaving out conjunctions to compact a sentence)'': “Reduce, reuse, recycle.”
* Symploce ''(simultaneous use of anaphora and epistrophe)'': “If you sing I will smile, if you laugh I will smile, if you love I will smile.”
* Antithesis ''(two opposite ideas put together to achieve a contrasting effect)'': “A small step for man, a giant step for mankind.”

'''Examples of Isocolons and Tricolons:'''

* Isocolon: “Veni, vidi, vici.”
* Tricolon: “I came, I saw, I conquered.”

The English version of the Latin phrase cannot be an Isocolon because the third clause is not the same length as the first two. "Veni, vidi, vici" is both an Isocolon and a Tricolon, but "I came, I saw, I conquered" is only a Tricolon.

'''Do’s and Don’ts'''

* '''Do''' use the same forms in each clause: "She wants to sing, she wants to act, she wants to dance."
* '''Don’t''' mix forms: "She wants to sing, she wants to act, she wants to be a dancer."

The final clause in this sentence does not match the preceding two.

== History ==

The first known instances of parallel syntax can be traced back to Aristotle in his book Rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=Verbal and Visual Parallelism|journal=Written Communication|date=April 1, 2003|volume=20|issue=2|page=126|url=http://wcx.sagepub.com/content/20/2/123.full.pdf+html|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle underlines the fact that it is very useful in persuasion to pair multiple sentences, each with very similar clauses and phrases to the point that they are equal or nearly equal in syllable count; Aristotle perfected this art by creating various examples to be cited in a very metrically organized way.&lt;ref name="Verbal and Visual Parallelism"/&gt; However, although Aristotle did provide examples and a definition, there is evidence to support that he was simply not comfortable with the amount of power tied to the styling of sentences; with a proper design of sentence, Aristotle believed that one can wield incredible amounts of persuasive power.&lt;ref name="Verbal and Visual Parallelism"/&gt;

A '''parallel universe''' is a hypothetical self-contained [[reality]] co-existing with one's own. A specific group of parallel universes are called a "[[multiverse]]", although this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that constitute reality. While the terms "parallel universe" and "alternative reality" are generally [[synonym]]ous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term "alternative reality" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own. The term "parallel universe" is more general, without implying a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe. A universe where the very [[Physical law|laws of nature]] are different – for example, one in which there are no Laws of Motion – would in general count as a parallel universe but not an alternative reality and a concept between both fantasy world and earth.

The actual [[many-worlds interpretation|quantum-mechanical]] hypothesis of parallel universes is "universes that are separated from each other by a single quantum event."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Overview==
Fantasy has long borrowed an idea of "another world" from [[mythology|myth]], [[legend]] and [[religion]]. [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]], and [[Valhalla]] are all "alternative universes" different from the familiar material realm. [[Plato]] reflected deeply on the parallel realities, resulting in [[Platonism]], in which the upper reality is perfect while the lower earthly reality is an imperfect shadow of the heavenly. The lower reality is similar but with flaws.

Modern [[fantasy]] often presents the concept as a series of planes of existence where the laws of nature differ, allowing [[magic in fiction|magical]] phenomena of some sort on some planes. This concept was also found in ancient [[Hindu mythology]], in texts such as the [[Puranas]], which expressed an infinite number of universes, each with its own gods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Similarly in [[Persian literature]], "The Adventures of Bulukiya", a tale in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', describes the protagonist Bulukiya learning of alternative worlds/universes that are similar to but still distinct from his own.&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin|first1=Robert|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|date=2005|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|location=London|isbn=1860649831}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} In other cases, in both fantasy and [[science fiction]], a parallel universe is a single other material reality, and its co-existence with ours is a rationale to bring a protagonist from the author's reality into the fantasy's reality, such as in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]] or even the beyond-the-reflection travel in the two main works of [[Lewis Carroll]]. Or this single other reality can invade our own, as when [[Margaret Cavendish]]'s English heroine sends submarines and "birdmen" armed with "fire stones" back through the portal from ''[[The Blazing World]]'' to Earth and wreaks havoc on England's enemies. In [[dark fantasy]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]] the parallel world is often a hiding place for unpleasant things, and often the protagonist is forced to confront effects of this other world leaking into his own, as in most of the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and the ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'' computer game series, or ''[[Warhammer 40,000|Warhammer 40K]]'' miniature and computer games. In such stories, the nature of this other reality is often left mysterious, known only by its effect on our own world.

The concept also arises outside the framework of quantum mechanics, as is found in [[Jorge Luis Borges]] short story ''El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' ("[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]"), published in 1941 before the many-worlds interpretation had been invented. In the story, a [[Sinology|Sinologist]] discovers a manuscript by a Chinese writer where the same tale is recounted in several ways, often contradictory, and then explains to his visitor (the writer's grandson) that his relative conceived time as a "garden of forking paths", where things happen in parallel in infinitely branching ways. One of the first [[Science fiction]] examples is [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''[[Sidewise in Time]]'', in which portions of alternative universes replace corresponding geographical regions in this universe. ''[[Sidewise in Time]]'' describes it in the manner that similar to requiring both [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] coordinates in order to mark your location on Earth, so too does time: travelling along latitude is akin to [[time travel]] moving through past, present and future, while travelling along latitude is to travel perpendicular to time and to other realities, hence the name of the short story. Thus, another common term for a parallel universe is "another dimension", stemming from the idea that if the 4th [[dimension]] is time, the 5th dimension - a direction at a right angle to the fourth - are alternate realities.

While this is a common treatment in Science fiction, it is by no means the only presentation of the idea, even in [[hard science fiction]]. Sometimes the parallel universe bears no historical relationship to any other world; instead, the laws of nature are simply different from those in our own, as in the novel ''[[Raft (novel)|Raft]]'' by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], which posits a reality where the [[gravitational constant]] is much larger than in our universe. (Note, however, that Baxter explains later in ''[[Vacuum Diagrams]]'' that the protagonists in ''Raft'' are descended from people who came from the [[Xeelee Sequence]] universe.)

One motif is that the way time flows in a parallel universe may be very different, so that a character returning to one might find the time passed very differently for those he left behind. This is found in folklore: King Herla visited Fairy and returned three centuries later; although only some of his men crumbled to dust on dismounting, Herla and his men who did not dismount were trapped on horseback, this being one folkloric account of the origin of the [[Wild Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1967) p.50-1&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[C. S. Lewis]] made use of this in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''; indeed, a character points out to two skeptics that there is no need for the time between the worlds to match up, but it would be very odd for the girl who claims to have visited a parallel universe to have dreamed up such a different time flow - from their perspective, the girl had only been gone for a few minutes though she was in Narnia for hours, and if she was making it up surely she would have spent a while longer hiding than a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassham|first1=Gregory|title=Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: The Lion, the Witch, and the Worldview|date=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=0812695887|page=171|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The division between science fiction and fantasy becomes fuzzier than usual when dealing with stories that explicitly leave the universe we are familiar with, especially when our familiar universe is portrayed as a subset of a multiverse. Picking a genre becomes less a matter of setting, and more a matter of theme and emphasis; the parts of the story the author wishes to explain and how they are explained. ''[[Narnia]]'' is clearly a fantasy, and the TV series ''[[Sliders]]'' is clearly science fiction, but works like the ''[[World of Tiers]]'' series or ''[[Glory Road]]'' tend to occupy a much broader middle ground.

==Science fiction==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
While technically incorrect, and looked down upon by hard science-fiction fans and authors, the idea of another "[[dimension]]" has become synonymous with the term "parallel universe". The usage is particularly common in [[movies]], television and [[comic books]] and much less so in modern prose science fiction. The idea of a parallel world was first introduced in comic books with the publication of ''The Flash'' #123, "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In written science fiction, "new dimension" more commonly – and more accurately – refer to additional [[Coordinate axis|coordinate axes]], beyond the three spatial axes with which we are familiar. By proposing travel along these extra axes, which are not normally [[perceptible]], the traveler can reach worlds that are otherwise unreachable and invisible.

[[File:Flatland cover detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin A. Abbott]]'s ''[[Flatland]]'' is set in a world of two dimensions.]]
In 1884, [[Edwin A. Abbott]] wrote the seminal novel exploring this concept called ''[[Flatland|Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions]]''. It describes a world of two dimensions inhabited by living squares, triangles, and circles, called Flatland, as well as Pointland (0 dimensions), Lineland (1 dimension), and Spaceland (three dimensions) and finally posits the possibilities of even greater dimensions. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions."

In 1895, ''[[The Time Machine]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]] used time as an additional "dimension" in this sense, taking the [[Spacetime|four-dimensional]] model of [[classical physics]] and interpreting time as a space-like dimension in which humans could travel with the right equipment. Wells also used the concept of parallel universes as a consequence of time as the fourth dimension in stories like ''[[The Wonderful Visit]]'' and ''[[Men Like Gods]]'', an idea proposed by the astronomer [[Simon Newcomb]], who talked about both time and parallel universes; "Add a fourth dimension to space, and there is room for an indefinite number of universes, all alongside of each other, as there is for an indefinite number of sheets of paper when we pile them upon each other".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are many examples where authors have explicitly created additional spatial dimensions for their characters to travel in, to reach parallel universes. In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the Doctor accidentally enters a parallel universe while attempting to repair the [[TARDIS]] console in "[[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]]". The parallel universe was similar to the real universe but with some different aspects, Britain has a fascist government and the royal family has been executed. [[Douglas Adams]], in the last book of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', uses the idea of [[probability]] as an extra [[Coordinate axis|axis]] in addition to the classical four dimensions of space and time similar to the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]]. Though, according to the novel, they're not really parallel universes at all but only a model to capture the continuity of space, time and probability. [[Robert A. Heinlein]], in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', postulated a six-dimensional universe. In addition to the three spatial dimensions, he invoked [[symmetry]] to add two new temporal dimensions, so there would be two sets of three. Like the fourth dimension of H. G. Wells' [[The Time Traveller (character)|"Time Traveller"]], these extra dimensions can be traveled by persons using the right equipment.

===Hyperspace===
{{main article|Hyperspace (science fiction)}}

Perhaps the most common use of the concept of a parallel universe in science fiction is the concept of hyperspace. Used in science fiction, the concept of "hyperspace" often refers to a parallel universe that can be used as a [[faster-than-light]] shortcut for [[interstellar travel]]. Rationales for this form of hyperspace vary from work to work, but the two common elements are:
#at least some (if not all) locations in the hyperspace universe map to locations in our universe, providing the "entry" and "exit" points for travellers.
#the travel time between two points in the hyperspace universe is much shorter than the time to travel to the analogous points in our universe. This can be because of a different speed of light, different speed at which time passes, or the analogous points in the hyperspace universe simply being much closer to each other.

Sometimes "hyperspace" is used to refer to the concept of additional coordinate axes. In this model, the universe is thought to be "crumpled" in some higher spatial dimension and that traveling in this higher spatial dimension, a ship can move vast distances in the common spatial dimensions. An analogy is to crumple a newspaper into a ball and stick a needle straight through, the needle will make widely spaced holes in the two-dimensional surface of the paper. While this idea invokes a "new dimension", it is not an example of a parallel universe.  It ''is'' a more scientifically plausible use of hyperspace. (See [[wormhole]].)

While use of hyperspace is common, it is mostly used as a [[plot device]] and thus of secondary importance. While a parallel universe may be invoked by the concept, the nature of the universe is not often explored. So, while stories involving hyperspace might be the most common use of the parallel universe concept in fiction, it is not the most common source of fiction ''about'' parallel universes.

===Time travel and alternative history===
[[File:H G Wells pre 1922.jpg|thumb|right|British author [[H. G. Wells]]' 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'', an early example of [[time travel]] in modern fiction]]
{{Main article|Time travel|Alternate history}}

Parallel universes may be the backdrop to or the consequence of time travel, their most common use in [[Time travel in fiction|fiction]] if the concept is central to the story. A seminal example of both is in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s novel ''[[The Big Time]]'' where there's a war across time between two [[alternative future]]s manipulating history to create a timeline that results in or realizes their own world.

Time travelers in fiction often accidentally or deliberately create [[alternative history|alternative histories]], such as in ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] where the [[Confederate Army]] is given thousands of [[AK-47]] rifles and ends up winning the [[American Civil War]]. (However, [[Ward Moore]] reversed this staple of alternative history fiction in his ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), where an alternative world where the [[Confederate States of America]] won the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and the [[American Civil War]] is destroyed after a historian and time traveler from the defeated United States of that world travels back to the scene of the battle and, by inadvertently causing the death of the Confederate officer whose troops occupied [[Little Round Top]], changes the result so that the Union forces are victorious.) The alternative history novel ''[[1632 (novel)|1632]]'' by [[Eric Flint]] explicitly states, albeit briefly in a prologue, that the time travelers in the novel (an entire town from [[West Virginia]]) have created a new and separate universe when they're transported into the midst of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 17th century [[Germany]]. (This sort of thing is known as an ISOT among alternative history fans, after [[S. M. Stirling]]'s ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'': an ISOT is when territory or a large group of people is transported back in time to another historical period or place.){{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Ordinarily, [[alternative history|alternative histories]] are not technically parallel universes. The concepts are similar but there are significant differences. Where characters travel to the past, they may cause changes in the timeline (creating a point of divergence) that result in changes to the present. The alternative present will be similar in different degrees to the original present as would be the case with a parallel universe. The main difference is that parallel universes co-exist whereas only one history or alternative history can exist at any one moment.&lt;!--maybe not the best term here but i introduce 'moment' below--&gt; Another difference is that moving to a parallel universe involves some inter-dimensional travel whereas &lt;!--moving between?--&gt;alternative histories involve some type of time travel. (However, since the future is only potential and not actual, it is often conceived that more than one future may exist simultaneously.)

The concept of "sidewise" time travel, a term taken from Murray Leinster's "[[Sidewise in Time]]", is often used to allow characters to pass through many different alternative histories, all descendant from some common branch point. Often worlds that are similar to each other are considered closer to each other in terms of this sidewise travel. For example, a universe where World War II ended differently would be "closer" to us than one where Imperial China colonized the New World in the 15th century. [[H. Beam Piper]] used this concept, naming it "paratime" and writing a series of stories involving the Paratime Police who regulated travel between these alternative realities as well as the technology to do so. [[Keith Laumer]] used the same concept of "sideways" time travel in his 1962 novel ''[[Worlds of the Imperium]]''. More recently, novels such as [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[The Coming of the Quantum Cats]]'' and [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Anathem]]'' explore human-scale readings of the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation|"many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics]], postulating that historical events or human consciousness spawns or allows "travel" among alternative universes.

Universe 'types' frequently explored in sidewise and alternative history works include worlds whose [[Axis victory in World War II|Nazis won the Second World War]], as in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], ''[[SS-GB]]'' by [[Len Deighton]], and ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], and worlds whose Roman Empire never fell, as in ''[[Roma Eterna]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]] and ''[[Romanitas (novel)|Romanitas]]'' by [[Sophia McDougall]]. The novel ''[[Warlords of Utopia]]'' by [[Lance Parkin]] explored a multiverse in which the universes whose Rome never fell go to war with all those whose Nazis won World War II. It fits loosely in the [[Faction Paradox]] series initiated by [[Lawrence Miles]], several of whose novels featured an artificially created universe existing within another; specifically, within a bottle. ''[[Dead Romance]]'' explored the consequences of inhabitants of the 'real' universe entering the Universe-in-a-Bottle.

In [[Philip Pullman]]'s trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', the protagonist begins in a world that is a Victorian counterpart to ours, although it takes place at the same time.&lt;!--is contemporary to ours?--&gt; It also appears that the [[Protestant Reformation]] happened differently with John Calvin becoming the last Pope.

===Counter-Earth===
The concept of [[Counter-Earth]] is typically similar to that of parallel universes but is actually a distinct idea. A counter-earth is a planet that shares [[Earth's orbit]] but is on the opposite side of the Sun and, therefore, cannot be seen from Earth. There would be no necessity that such a planet would be like [[Earth]] in any way though typically in fiction; it is usually nearly identical to Earth. Since Counter-Earth is always within the [[universe]] (and the [[Solar System]]), travel to it can be accomplished with ordinary space travel.

Gerry and Sylvia Anderson used this concept in their 1969 movie ''[[Doppelgänger (1969 film)|Doppelgänger]]'' (released outside Europe as ''Journey to the Far Side of the Sun''), in which a Counter-Earth is detected by astronomers and a manned mission launched by a US-European space consortium to explore it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Convergent evolution===
[[Convergent evolution]] is a biological concept whereby unrelated species acquire similar traits because they adapted to a similar environment and/or played similar roles in their ecosystems. In fiction, the concept is extended whereby similar planets will result in races with similar cultures and/or histories.

Technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel, but the stories are similar in some respects. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' frequently explored such worlds:

*In "[[Bread and Circuses (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Bread and Circuses]]" the ''Enterprise'' encounters a planet called Magna Roma, which has many physical resemblances to Earth such as its atmosphere, land to ocean ratio, and size. The landing party discovers that the planet is at roughly a late 20th-century level of technology but its society is similar to the Roman Empire, as if the Empire had not fallen but had continued to that time: there is also a reference to the Roman god [[Jupiter]] as the namesake of a new line of automobile, and gladiator fights are televised in [[primetime]]. [[Slavery]] on this world has also developed into an institution, with slaves guaranteed medical benefits and old-age pensions, so the workers grew more content and never rebelled. At the end of the episode, it is discovered that the society has just found their own version of [[Jesus]], referred simply as "the son" (whose followers they had previously mistaken for [[Solar deity|sun worshipers]]).
*In "[[The Omega Glory]]", the crew visit a planet on which there is a conflict between two peoples called the Yangs and the Kohms. They discover that the Yangs are like Earth's "Yankees" (in other words, Americans) and the Kohms are like Earth's Communists; the Yangs, who had at some point in the past been conquered by the Kohms, had a ritual speech that was word for word identical to the American [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], and treated the [[U.S. Constitution]] as a sacred text. (A deleted scene from the episode, however, implied that both the Yangs and Kohms were actually descendants of human colonists.)
*In "[[Miri (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Miri]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew encounter a planet that is physically identical to Earth. Histories on the two planets were apparently identical until the 20th century when scientists had accidentally created a deadly virus that killed all the adults but extended the lives of the children (who call themselves the "Onlies").

===Convergent evolution due to contamination===
A similar concept in biology is [[gene flow]]. In this case, a planet may start as different from Earth, but due to the influence of Earth culture, the planet comes to resemble Earth in some way; technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel, but the stories are similar in some respects. ''Star Trek'' used this theory as well: in "[[Patterns of Force (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Patterns of Force]]", a planet is discovered that has become very similar to Nazi Germany due to the influence of a historian that came to reside there (believing that the Nazi fascism itself was not evil and under benevolent leadership could be "good government"), while in "[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew visits a planet that, 100 years after a book ''Chicago Mobs of the Twenties'' that had been left behind by previous Earth craft, their society resembles mob ruled cities of the [[Prohibition era]] United States.

===Simulated reality===

{{main article|Simulated reality in fiction}}

Simulated realities are digital constructs featured in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]''.

==Fantasy==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}

===Stranger in a strange land===
[[Image:Oz-and-surrounding-countrie.jpg|right|thumb|[[Land of Oz|Oz]] and its surroundings.]]
Fantasy authors often want to bring characters from the author's (and the reader's) reality into their created world. Before the mid-20th century, this was most often done by hiding fantastic worlds within hidden parts of the author's own universe. Peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an [[ogre]] or other fantastical beings could live an hour away, but increasing geographical knowledge meant that such locations had to be farther and farther off.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=C. S.|last2=Hooper|first2=Walter|title=Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0156678977|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in the author's world could board a ship and find themselves on a fantastic island, as [[Jonathan Swift]] does in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' or in the 1949 novel ''[[Silverlock]]'' by [[John Myers Myers]], or be sucked up into a [[tornado]] and land in [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. These "[[Lost World (genre)|lost world]]" stories can be seen as geographic equivalents of a "parallel universe", as the worlds portrayed are separate from our own, and hidden to everyone except those who take the difficult journey there. The geographic "lost world" can blur into a more explicit "parallel universe" when the fantasy realm overlaps a section of the "real" world, but is much larger inside than out, as in [[Robert Holdstock]]'s novel ''[[Mythago Wood]]''. Madeleine L'engle, "Wrinkle in Time" series: characters go from the present time to places in the universe.

After the mid-20th century, perhaps influenced by ideas from science fiction, perhaps because exploration had made many places on the map too clear to write "[[Here be dragons|Here there be dragons]]", many fantasy worlds became completely separate from the author's world.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; A common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] is a [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] or [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifact]] that connects worlds together, prototypical examples being the wardrobe in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', or the sigil in [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[The Cream of the Jest]]''. In [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]'', [[Chihiro Ogino]] and her parents climb over a small stream into the spirit world. The main difference between this type of story and the "lost world" above, is that the fantasy realm can only be reached by certain people, or at certain times, or after following certain rituals, or with the proper artifact.

In some cases, physical travel is not even possible, and the character in our reality travels in a dream or some other [[altered state of consciousness]]. Examples include the ''[[Dream Cycle]]'' stories by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] or the ''[[Thomas Covenant]]'' stories of [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]. Often, stories of this type have as a major theme the nature of reality itself, questioning if the dream-world can have the same "reality" as the waking world. Science fiction often employs this theme (usually without the dream-world being "another" universe) in the ideas of [[cyberspace]] and [[virtual reality]].

===Between the worlds===
[[Image:Šachovnice.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' -- and the parallel universe [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] found there]]
Most stories in this mold simply transport a character from the real world into the [[fantasy world]] where the bulk of the action takes place. Whatever gate is used &amp;ndash; such as the tollbooth in ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' by [[Norton Juster]], or the mirror in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' &amp;ndash; is left behind for the duration of the story, until the end, and then only if the protagonists will return.

However, in a few cases the interaction between the worlds is an important element, so that the focus is not on one world or the other, but on both, and their interaction. After [[Rick Cook]] introduced a computer programmer into a [[high fantasy]] world, his ''[[Rick Cook#Wizardry series|Wizardry]]'' series steadily acquired more interactions between this world and ours. In [[Aaron Allston]]'s ''[[Aaron Allston#Doc Sidhe|Doc Sidhe]]'' our "grim world" is paralleled by a "fair world" where the elves live and history echoes ours. A major portion of the plot deals with preventing a change in interactions between the worlds. [[Margaret Ball (writer)|Margaret Ball]], in ''No Earthly Sunne'', depicts the interaction of our world with Faerie, and the efforts of the Queen of Faerie to deal with the slow drifting apart of Earth and Faerie. [[Poul Anderson]] depicts Hell as a parallel universe in ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'', and the need to transfer equivalent amounts of mass between the worlds explains why a [[changeling]] is left for a kidnapped child. Interactions between magical and scientific universes, and the protagonists' attempts to restore and maintain the balance between them, are major plot points in [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Apprentice Adept]]'' series; he depicts two worlds, the "SF" planet Proton and the fantasy-based Phaze, such that every person born in either world has a physical duplicate on the other world. Only when one duplicate has died can the other cross between the worlds. Several of his ''[[Xanth]]'' novels also revolve around interactions between the magical realm of Xanth and "[[mundane|Mundania]]".

Multiple worlds, rather than a pair, increase the importance of the relationships. In ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', there are only our world and [[Narnia]], but in other of C. S. Lewis's works, there are hints of other worlds, and in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', the [[Wood between the Worlds]] shows many possibilities, and the plot is governed by transportation between worlds, and the effort to right problems stemming from them. In [[His Dark Materials]] by [[Philip Pullman]], the two protagonist Lyra and Will find themselves lost amongst many worlds, and travel them looking for the other. In [[Andre Norton]]'s [[Witch World]], begun with a man from Earth being transported to this world, gates frequently lead to other worlds – or come from them. While an abundance of illusions, disguises, and magic that repels attention make certain parts of Witch World look like parallel worlds, some are clearly parallel in that time runs differently in them, and such gates pose a repeated problem in Witch World. In the radio sitcom ''[[Undone (radio series)|Undone]]'', the main character, Edna Turner, prevents people from a parallel version of [[London]] called "Undone" from moving to London and making the city too weird. There are other parallel versions of London, and one of the main plots in the series is the attempt by The Prince to unite all versions of London together. Travel between the [[many-worlds interpretation|manyworlds]] is the central conceit of [[Ian McDonald (British author)|Ian McDonald]]'s ''[[Everness (series)|Everness]]'', where the protagonist travels to a parallel London in a world without fossil fuels.

[[Linking room]]s of various types (not all actual rooms) can hook together any number of worlds. The characters may chose only one, but the choice is all important in determining the worlds.

===Fantasy multiverses===
The idea of a [[multiverse]] is as fertile a subject for fantasy as it is for science fiction, allowing for epic settings and godlike protagonists. Among the most epic and far-ranging fantasy "multiverses" is that of [[Michael Moorcock]].  Like many authors after him, Moorcock was inspired by the [[many worlds]] interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]], saying: {{cquote|It was an idea in the air, as most of these are, and I would have come across a reference to it in ''New Scientist'' (one of my best friends was then editor) ... [or] physicist friends would have been talking about it. ... Sometimes what happens is that you are imagining these things in the context of fiction while the physicists and mathematicians are imagining them in terms of science. I suspect it is the romantic imagination working, as it often does, perfectly efficiently in both the arts and the sciences.''{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}}}
Unlike many science-fiction interpretations, Moorcock's ''[[The Eternal Champion (novel)|Eternal Champion]]'' stories go far beyond [[alternative history]] to include [[mythology|mythic]] and [[sword and sorcery]] settings as well as some worlds more similar to our own. However, the Eternal Champion himself is incarnate in all of them.

[[Roger Zelazny]] used a mythic [[cosmology]] in his ''[[Chronicles of Amber]]'' series. His protagonist is a member of the royal family of Amber, whose members represent a godlike [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] ruling over a prototypical universe that represents Order. All other universes are increasingly distorted "shadows" of it, ending finally at the other extreme, Chaos, which is the complete negation of the prototype. Travel between these "shadow" universes is only possible by beings descended from the blood of this pantheon. Those "of the blood" can walk through Shadow, imagining any possible reality and then walk to it, making their environment more similar to their desire as they go. It is argued between the characters whether these "shadows" even exist before they're imagined by a member of the royal family of Amber, or if the "shadows'" existence can be seen as an act of godlike creation.

In the ''[[World of Tiers]]'' novels by [[Philip José Farmer]], the idea of godlike protagonists is even more explicit. The background of the stories is a multiverse where godlike beings have created a number of [[pocket universe]]s that represent their own desires. Our own world is part of this series, but our own universe is revealed to be much smaller than it appears, ending at the edge of the Solar System.

The term 'polycosmos' was coined as an alternative to 'multiverse' by the author and editor [[Paul le Page Barnett]], best known by the pseudonym John Grant, and is built from [[Greek language|Greek]] rather than [[Latin]] [[morpheme]]s. It is used by Barnett to describe a concept binding together a number of his works, its nature meaning that "all characters, real or fictional [...] have to co-exist in all possible real, created or dreamt worlds; [...] they're playing hugely different roles in their various manifestations, and the relationships between them can vary quite dramatically, but the essence of them remains the same."{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There also are multiverses in the [[Warcraft universe]], ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series, and [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Chrestomanci]]'', ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Deep Secret]]'' books and standalone book ''[[A Sudden Wild Magic]]''.

===Fictional universe as alternative universe===
{{main article|Fictional universe}}
There are many examples of the [[meta-fiction]]al idea of having the author's created universe (or any author's universe) rise to the same level of "reality" as the universe we're familiar with. The theme is present in works as diverse as H.G. Wells' ''[[Men Like Gods]]'', Myers' ''Silverlock'', and Heinlein's ''Number of the Beast''. [[Fletcher Pratt]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] took the protagonist of the [[Harold Shea]] series through the worlds of Norse myth, [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and the ''[[Kalevala]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moorcock|first1=Michael|title=Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy|date=2004|publisher=MonkeyBrain|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=1932265074|page=88|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; – without ever quite settling whether writers created these parallel worlds by writing these works, or received impressions from the worlds and wrote them down. In an interlude set in "[[Kubla Khan|Xanadu]]", a character claims that the universe is dangerous because the poem went unfinished, but whether this was his misapprehension or not is not established.

Some fictional approaches definitively establish the independence of the parallel world, sometimes by having the world differ from the book's account; other approaches have works of fiction create and affect the parallel world: [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', taking place on an astral plane, is populated by the daydreams of mundane people, and in [[Rebecca Lickiss]]'s ''[[Eccentric Circles]]'', an elf is grateful to [[Tolkien]] for transforming elves from dainty little creatures.  These stories often place the author, or authors in general, in the same position as Zelazny's characters in Amber. Questioning, in a literal fashion, if writing is an act of creating a new world, or an act of discovery of a pre-existing world.

Occasionally, this approach becomes self-referential, treating the literary universe of the work itself as explicitly parallel to the universe where the work was created. [[Stephen King]]'s seven-volume ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series hinges upon the existence of multiple parallel worlds, many of which are King's own literary creations. Ultimately the characters become aware that they are only "real" in King's literary universe (this can be debated as an example of [[breaking the fourth wall]]), and even travel to a world – twice – in which (again, within the novel) they meet Stephen King and alter events in the real Stephen King's world outside of the books.  An early instance of this was in works by [[Gardner Fox]] for DC Comics in the 1960s, in which characters from the Golden Age (which was supposed to be a series of comic books within the DC Comics universe) would cross over into the main DC Comics universe. One comic book did provide an explanation for a fictional universe existing as a parallel universe. The parallel world does "exist" and it resonates into the "real world." Some people in the "real world" pick up on this resonance, gaining information about the parallel world which they then use &lt;!--'use to' here is not an error for 'used to'; this comment is to repel well-meaning bots--&gt; to write stories.

[[Robert Heinlein]], in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', quantizes the many parallel fictional universes - in terms of ''fictons''.  A number of fictional universes are accessible along one of the three axes of time which Dr. Jacob Burroughs' "time twister" can access. Each quantum level change - a ''ficton'' - along this time axis corresponds to a different universe from one of several bodies of fiction known to all four travellers in the inter-universal, time travelling vehicle ''Gay Deceiver''.  Heinlein also "[[breaks the fourth wall]]" by having "both Heinleins" (Robert and his wife [[Virginia Heinlein|Virginia]]) visit an inter-universal science-fiction and fantasy convention in the book's last chapter. The convention was convened on Heinlein character [[Lazarus Long]]'s estate on the planet "Tertius" to attract the evil "Black Hats" who pursued the main characters of ''[[The Number of the Beast]]'' through space and time in order to destroy Dr. Burroughs and his invention.  Heinlein continues this literary conceit in ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'', using characters from throughout his science-fictional career, hauled forth from their own "fictons" to unite in the war against the "Black Hats."

Heinlein also wrote a stand-alone novel, ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'', whose two protagonists fall from alternative universe into alternative universe (often naked), and after a number of such adventures die and enter a stereotypically [[Fundamentalist Christian]] Heaven (with many of its internal contradictions explored in the novel). Their harrowing adventures through the universes are then revealed to have been "destruction testing" of their souls by [[Loki]], sanctioned by the Creator person of the Christian God ([[Yahweh]]). The Devil appears as the most sympathetic of the gods in the story, who expresses contempt for the other gods' cavalier treatment of the story's main characters.
 
Thus, ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'' rings in the theological dimension (if only for the purpose of satirizing evangelical Christianity) of parallel universes, that their existence can be used by God (or a number of gods, Loki seems to have made himself available to do Yahweh's dirty work in this novel).  It manages also to have a fictional multiverse angle in that references are made to Heinlein's early SF/fantasy short story "[[They (Heinlein)|They]]," a solipistic tale in which reality is constantly being transmogrified behind the scenes to throw the central character off his guard and keep him from seeing reality as it is, which was set in the same Heinlein fictional universe as ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]''.

===Elfland===
{{main article|Álfheim}}

[[Álfheim|Elfland]], or Faerie, the otherworldly home not only of [[Elf|elves]] and [[Fairy|fairies]] but [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, and other folkloric creatures, has an ambiguous appearance in folklore.

On one hand, the land often appears to be contiguous with 'ordinary' land. [[Thomas the Rhymer]] might, on being taken by the Queen of Faerie, be taken on a road like one leading to Heaven or Hell.

This is not exclusive to English or French folklore. In [[Norse mythology]], Elfland ([[Alfheim]]) was also the name of what today is the Swedish province of [[Bohuslän]]. In the sagas, it said that the people of this petty kingdom were more beautiful than other people, as they were related to the [[elves]], showing that not only the territory was associated with elves, but also the race of its people.

While sometimes folklore seems to show fairy intrusion into human lands – "[[Tam Lin]]" does not show any otherworldly aspects about the land in which the confrontation takes place – at other times the otherworldly aspects are clear. Most frequently, time can flow differently for those trapped by the fairy dance than in the lands they come from; although, in an additional complication, it may only be an appearance, as many returning from Faerie, such as [[Oisín]], have found that time "catches up" with them as soon as they have contact with ordinary lands.

Fantasy writers have taken up the ambiguity. Some writers depict the land of the elves as a full-blown parallel universe, with portals the only entry – as in [[Josepha Sherman]]'s [[Josepha Sherman#Prince of the Sidhe|Prince of the Sidhe]] series or [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''[[Elf Defense]]'' – and others have depicted it as the next land over, possibly difficult to reach for magical reasons – [[Hope Mirrlees]]'s ''[[Lud-in-the-Mist]]'', or [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''. In some cases, the boundary between Elfland and more ordinary lands is not fixed. Not only the inhabitants but Faerie itself can pour into more mundane regions. [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series proposes that the world of the Elves is a "parasite" universe, that drifts between and latches onto others such as Discworld and our own world (referred to as "Roundworld" in the novels). In the young teenage book ''[[Mist]]'' by [[Kathryn James]], the Elven world lies through a patch of mist in the woods. It was constructed when the Elven were thrown out of our world. Travel to and fro is possible by those in the know, but can have lethal consequences.

===Isekai===
{{main|Isekai}}
[[Isekai]], is a subgenre of Japanese fantasy light novels, manga, anime, and video games revolving around a normal person being transported to or trapped in a parallel universe. Often, this universe already exists in the protagonist's world as a fictional universe, but it may also be unbeknownst to them.

==Films==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
The most famous treatment of the alternative universe concept in film could be considered ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which portrays a parallel world, famously separating the magical realm of the [[Land of Oz]] from the mundane world by filming it in [[Technicolor]] while filming the scenes set in [[Kansas]] in [[sepia tone|sepia]]. At times, alternative universes have been featured in small scale independent productions such as Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's ''[[It Happened Here]]'' (1964), featuring an alternative United Kingdom which had undergone [[Operation Sea Lion]] in 1940 and had been defeated and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. It focused on moral questions related to the professional ethics of Pauline, a nurse forced into Nazi collaboration.

Another common use of the theme is as a prison for [[villain]]s or [[demons]]. The idea is used in the first two ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' movies starring [[Christopher Reeve]] where [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] villains were sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]] from where they eventually escaped. An almost exactly parallel use of the idea is presented in the campy cult film ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension]]'', where the "8th dimension" is essentially a "phantom zone" used to imprison the villainous Red Lectroids. Uses in [[horror films]] include the 1986 film ''[[From Beyond (film)|From Beyond]]'' (based on the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] [[From Beyond (short story)|story]] of the same name) where a scientific experiment induces the experimenters to perceive [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] from a parallel universe, with bad results. The 1987 [[John Carpenter]] film ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' is based on the premise that the essence of a being described as [[Satan]], trapped in a glass canister and found in an abandoned church in [[Los Angeles]], is actually an alien being that is the 'son' of something even more evil and powerful, trapped in another universe. The protagonists accidentally free the creature, who then attempts to release his "father" by reaching in through a [[mirror]].

Some films present parallel realities that are actually different contrasting versions of the narrative itself.  Commonly this motif is presented as different points of view revolving around a central (but sometimes unknowable) "truth", the seminal example being [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]''. Conversely, often in [[film noir]] and [[crime film|crime dramas]], the alternative narrative is a fiction created by a central character, intentionally – as in ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' – or unintentionally – as in ''[[Angel Heart]]''. Less often, the alternative narratives are given equal weight in the story, making them truly alternative universes, such as in the [[Germany|German]] film ''[[Run Lola Run]]'', the short-lived British [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[Our House (musical)|Our House]]'' and the [[Great Britain|British]] film ''[[Sliding Doors]]''.

More recent films that have explicitly explored parallel universes are: the 2000 film ''[[The Family Man]]'', the 2001 [[cult movie]] ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', which deals with what it terms a "tangent universe" that erupts from our own universe; ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1993) has the eponymous heroes cross over into a parallel universe ruled by humanoids who evolved from dinosaurs; ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'' (2001) starring [[Jet Li]], in which there is a complex system of realities in which Jet Li's character is a police officer in one universe and a [[serial killer]] in another, who travels to other universes to destroy versions of himself, so that he can take their energy; and ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'' (2004), the main character runs away from a totalitarian nightmare, and he enters into a cyber-afterlife alternative reality. The current  ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' films are set in an alternative universe created by the first film's villain traveling back in time, thus allowing the franchise to be [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] without affecting the continuity of any other ''Star Trek'' film or show. The 2011 science-fiction thriller ''[[Source Code]]'' employs the concepts of quantum reality and parallel universes. The characters in ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', the third installment of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|franchise]], accidentally create a ripple in the time-space continuum and travel into an alternate universe, where the [[Clover (creature)|monster]] and the events in the [[Cloverfield (film)|first film]] transpired. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] has also experimented with this through some of their animated films such as ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' and ''[[Zootopia]]'', where anthropomorphic animals take on the role of (in this case, nonexistent) humans and emulating the latter's characteristics, without abandoning their hereditary own.

==Television==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
The idea of parallel universes have received treatment in a number of television series, usually as a single story or episode in a more general [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] storyline.

The 1990s TV series ''[[Sliders]]'' depicts a group of adventurers visiting assorted parallel universes, as they attempt to find their "home" universe. Included in the 1st season is a universe where the world is stuck in the ice age, with no life anywhere. Another episode includes 'Honest Abe' never to be president, in which the United States loses World War I and World War II, and they are controlled by a senator, and technology is at an all-time low.

One of the earliest television plots to feature parallel time was a 1970 storyline on soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]''. Vampire Barnabas Collins found a room in Collinwood which served as a portal to parallel time, and he entered the room in order to escape from his current problems. A year later, the show again traveled to parallel time, the setting this time being 1841.

A well known and often imitated example is the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode entitled "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]".  The episode introduced an [[Mirror Universe|alternative version of the ''Star Trek'' universe]] where the main characters were barbaric and cruel to the point of being [[evil]].  When the parallel universe concept is [[parody|parodied]], the allusion is often to this ''Star Trek'' episode.  A previous episode for the ''Trek'' series first hinted at the potential of differing reality planes (and their occupants), titled "[[The Alternative Factor]]". A mad scientist from "our" universe, named Lazarus B., hunts down the sane Lazarus A.; resident of an [[antimatter]]-comprised continuum.  His counterpart, in a state of paranoia, claims the double threatens his and the very cosmos' existence. With help from Captain [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], A traps B along with him in a "anti"-universe, for eternity, thus bringing balance to both [[matter]] oriented realms. A similar plot was used in the ''Codename: Kids Next Door'' episode Operation: P.O.O.L..

The mirror universe of ''Star Trek'' was further developed by later series in the franchise. In several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', the later evolution of the mirror universe is explored. A two-part episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', entitled "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]", serves as a [[prequel]], introducing the early developments of the Mirror Universe.

In the 1970s young adult British SF series [[The Tomorrow People]], its second-season episode, ''A Rift in Time'' (March–April 1974) pitted the three telepath core characters and allies against time travelling interlopers from an [[alternative history]] where the [[Roman Empire]] developed the [[steam engine]] in the first century CE, had a technological headstart, did not fragment during the fifth century and underwent accelerated technological development. The Roman eagle standard was planted on the Moon in the fifth century and by its alternative twentieth century, it had mastered interstellar travel, had a galactic empire and time travel. Consequently, the Tomorrow People had to rectify this aberrant timeline by dismantling and disabling the anomalous steam engine.

Multiple episodes of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' use the concept.  In "Parallel Universe" the crew meet alternative versions of themselves: the analogues of Lister, Rimmer and Holly are female, while the Cat's alternative is a dog.  "Dimension Jump" introduces a heroic alternative [[Ace Rimmer|Rimmer]], a version of whom reappears in "Stoke Me a Clipper".  The next episode, "Ouroboros", makes contact with a timeline in which Kochanski, rather than Lister, was the sole survivor of the original disaster; this alternative Kochanski then joins the crew for the remaining episodes.

''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' experienced a Parallel universe where she was a mental patient in ''[[Normal Again]]'' and not really "The Slayer" at all.  In the end, she has to choose between a universe where her mother and father are together and alive (mother) or one with her friends and sister in it where she has to fight for her life daily. In [[The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)]], Cordelia Chase inadvertently created a dystopian alternative reality in which Buffy had never moved from LA to Sunnydale. Her core-universe allies [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]] had become vampires in that timeline.

The plot of the [[Charmed (season 4)|season four]] episode of ''[[Charmed]]'', entitled "Brain Drain", features [[The Source (Charmed)|The Source of All Evil]] kidnapping Piper Halliwell and forcing her into a deep coma, where she experiences an alternative reality in which the Halliwell manor is actually a mental institution. She and her sisters serve as patients in this universe, their powers only a manifestation of their minds, a ruse put up to trick Piper into willingly relinquishing the sisters' magic.

The animated series, ''[[Futurama]]'', had [[The Farnsworth Parabox|an episode]] where the characters travel between "Universe 1" and "Universe A" via boxes containing each universe; and one of the major jokes is an extended argument between the two sets of characters over which set were the "evil" ones.

The idea of a parallel universe and the concept of [[déjà vu]] was a major plot line of the first-season finale of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', guest-starring [[Leonard Nimoy]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. The show has gone on to feature the parallel universe prominently.

In the 2010 season of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', the result of characters traveling back in time to prevent the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 apparently creates a parallel reality in which the Flight never crashed, rather than resetting time itself in the characters' original timeline. The show continued to show two "sets" of the characters following different destinies, until it was revealed in the series finale that there was really only one reality created by the characters themselves to assist themselves in leaving behind the physical world and passing on to an afterlife after their respective deaths.

In the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', in the Androids Saga, Future Trunks returns to the past to give Goku medicine to prevent him from dying of a heart disease and warns him of the Androids, in the process creating parallel realities, leading to the appearance of Cell, who killed the same Future Trunks from a different splitting timeline to come back to the main timeline when the Androids are still alive for him to absorb. The Majin Buu Saga later depicts Kaio-Shin Realms and the Afterlife. Its sequel, ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', later features separate universes that are in pairs whose numbers add up to the total number of the universe: 13 in this case. Previously there were 18 universes, but Zen'o (the supreme ruler of the Dragon Ball Multiverse) destroyed 6 of them in a rage. Previously, Daizenshuu 7 stated that the typical Dragon Ball Universe had only 4 galaxies, but ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' effectively retcons this, where Whis says that the universe contains endless galaxies.

The [[anime]] ''[[Turn A Gundam]]'' attempted to combine all the parallel [[Gundam]] universes (other incarnations of the series, with similar themes but differing stories and characters, that had played out at different times since the debut of the concept in the 1970s) of the [[metaseries]] into one single reality.

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Eureka Seven: AO]]'' takes place in a parallel universe that is different from the one in the series' predecessor ''[[Eureka Seven]]''. The ''E7'' series started off in the year 12005, and the ''AO'' world, which takes place in the year 2025, would be the home of the two main characters' son.

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Katekyo Hitman Reborn!]]'' by Akira Amano features this idea in its third main arc, known as Future arc.

The anime ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' features a parallel world in one of the final episodes. This parallel world is a sharp contrast to the harsh, dark "reality" of the show and presents a world where all the characters enjoy a much happier life. This parallel world would become the basis for the new Evangelion manga series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]''.

The anime series ''[[Bakugan]]'' features a parallel universe called Vestroia and is the homeworld of fantastic creatures called Bakugan. The series' hero Dan Kuso alongside his friends and teammates must save Earth and Vestroia from total destruction. Season 2 &amp; 3 feature another universe where Dan and his team save the day. They go to another dimension or universe through a pathway. The other universe has also other life forms and other types of technology.

In another anime series, ''[[Digimon]]'', there is parallel universe called "digital world". The show's child protagonists meet digital monsters, or digimon, from this world and becomes partners and friends. In the third story arc of ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'', the Clockmaker (who is later revealed to be Bagramon) and his partner Clockmon travel through space-time to recruit heroes from previous series so they can help the Fusion Fighters to defeat Quartzmon before DigiQuartz can absorb each human and digital world in the multiverse.

In the anime series ''[[Umineko no Naku Koro ni]]'' the rounds of the battle between Battler and Beatrice take place in different dimensions, in order to show all kinds of possibilities (much to Battler's dismay) also the character Bernkastel is known for her ability to travel into different worlds by the usage of "fragments".

In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Parallels]]", Lt. [[Worf]] traveled to several parallel universes when his shuttlecraft went through a time space fissure.

The ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' episode [[Remedial Chaos Theory]], six different timelines and one "prime" timeline are explored, each having a different outcome based on which member of the study group goes to get the [[pizza]]. One timeline, dubbed the "Darkest Timeline", results in the greatest amount of terrible incidents and ends with Abed donning a felt goatee bearing resemblance to Spock's in "Mirror, Mirror".

In the 2003 anime series of ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist (anime)|Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', there exists a gateway that can be conjured by alchemists that acts as a source of all knowledge and energy; towards the end of the series, it is revealed that this gateway connects the world of the anime with the real world, set during the first decades of the 20th century. It is revealed that the two worlds shared a common history until their histories [[Point of divergence|diverged]], apparently due to the success of alchemy in one world and that of modern physics in the other.

===As an ongoing subplot===
Sometimes a television series will use parallel universes as an ongoing subplot.  ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' elaborated on the premise of the original series' "Mirror" universe and developed multi-episode story arcs based on the premise.  Other examples are the science fiction series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the fantasy/horror series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and the romance/fantasy ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

Following the precedent set by ''Star Trek'', these story arcs show alternative universes that have turned out "worse" than the "original" universe: in ''Stargate SG-1'' the first two encountered parallel realities featured Earth being overwhelmed by an unstoppable [[Goa'uld]] onslaught; in ''Buffy'', two episodes concern a timeline in which Buffy came to [[Sunnydale]] too late to stop the vampires from taking control; ''Lois &amp; Clark'' repeatedly visits an alternative universe where [[Clark Kent]]'s adoptive parents, [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], died when he was ten years of age, and [[Lois Lane]] is also apparently dead.  Clark eventually becomes Superman, with help from the "original" Lois Lane, but he is immediately revealed as Clark Kent and so has no life of his own.

In addition to following ''Star Trek's'' lead, showing the "evil" variants of the main storyline gives the writers an opportunity to show what is at stake by portraying the worst that could happen and the consequences if the protagonists fail or the importance of a character's presence.

''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' often talks about alternative realms or universes in which all different forms of magic, and non-magic may occur, depending on the realm. According to the Mad Hatter (Sebastian Stan), they "touch each other in a long line of lands, each just as real as the last." He referred to our world's tendency to deny such things as arrogant.

In the season 1 finale of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]] opens a singularity that connects his world to a parallel universe called Earth-2. In the second season, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] starts facing villains from that earth who also have doppelgangers on Prime Earth sent by [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]. The array of Earth-2 villains consists of [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], Sand Demon, [[King Shark]], and [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Dr. Light]]; all are sent by Zoom to kill The Flash with the assurance of being taken back home. However, they are not the only ones who arrive from the singularity; this also includes the [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Earth-2 Flash]] after a close death and loss of speed from a confrontation with Zoom. When the Earth-2 Flash (called Jay Garrick) introduces himself to Team Flash, Barry (The Flash) distrusts him at first and places him in the metahuman pipeline at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]. When The Flash starts having a hard time facing off against Sand Demon, he frees Jay so that he could help him as well as train him in his speed. With a new trick taught by Jay, Barry defeats Sand Demon. Later on, the Earth-2 counterpart of the Reverse-Flash, [[Harrison Wells]], arrives in Prime Earth as well. He steals a weapon from Mercury Labs and saves Barry from the Earth-2 King Shark. When Jay confronts and sees Wells again, the argument gets heated between them before Barry intercedes.

The "Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon" series, created by artist Mr Doodleburger, uses footage from the Australian TV drama show [[Home and Away]], but through the use of clever overlaid audio tracks, casts one of the main characters of the show, long running character [[Alf Stewart]] as a vicious violent character in a parallel version of Home and Away. ''see main article'' [[Alf_Stewart#In_popular_culture| Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon Series]]

===Television series involving parallel universes===
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
There have been a few series where parallel universes were central to the series itself.
* ''[[The Fantastic Journey]]'', in which several travelers lost in the Bermuda Triangle find themselves in another world
* ''[[Otherworld (TV series)|Otherworld]]'', in which a family gets trapped in an alternative world
* ''[[Sliders]]'', where a young man invents a worm-hole generator that allows travel to "alternative" Earths.  Several characters travel across a series of "alternative" Earths, trying to get back to their home universe
* ''[[Parallax (TV series)|Parallax]]'', in which a boy discovers portals to multiple parallel universes in his home town
* ''[[Charlie Jade]]'', in which the titular character is accidentally thrown into our universe and is looking for a way back to his own.  The series features three universes - alpha, beta and gamma
* ''[[Awake (TV series)|Awake]]'', where a man switches between realities whenever he goes to sleep: one in which his wife survived a car accident that killed their son, and one in which his son survived but his wife died
* In the TV series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', a main element of the series is the loss of balance and the eventual collision of two universes and the moral ramifications of it. Most main characters have a doppelganger who is usually slightly different from their prime selves.
* In the South Korean Drama ''[[Dr. Jin]]'' (2012), the concept of parallel universes was used. A doctor travels into the past, specifically, the Joseon era, and this results in major changes in history.
* ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', in which there is an infinite number of realities and universes.
* ''[[Stranger Things]]'', in which a small town becomes home to a gateway between dimensions.
* ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', in which Barry Allen travels to multiple parallel universes in the multiverse with the help of his super speed.
* ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', in which several episodes deal with parallel universes, particularly [[Supernatural (season 13)|the thirteenth season]] which features storylines centering around parallel universes known as Apocalypse World and The Bad Place which appears in the [[backdoor pilot]] to the proposed spinoff ''Supernatural: Wayward Sisters''. Apocalypse World is depicted as a dark post-apocalyptic universe where ''Supernatural's'' main protagonists [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] and [[Dean Winchester]] were never born and thus could not stop the end of the world.

==Comic books==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
Parallel universes in modern comics have become particularly rich and complex, in large part due to the continual problem of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] faced by the major two publishers, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. The two publishers have used the [[multiverse]] concept to fix problems arising from integrating characters from other publishers into their own canon, and from having major [[Serial (literature)|serial]] protagonists having continuous histories lasting, as in the case of [[Superman]], over 70 years. Additionally, both publishers have used new alternative universes to re-imagine their own characters. (See ''[[Multiverse (DC Comics)]]'' and ''[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)]]'')

[[DC Comics]] inaugurated its multiverse in the early 1960s, with the reintroduction of [[Golden Age]] superheroes the [[Justice Society of America]] now located on [[Earth-Two]], and devised a "mirror universe" scenario of inverted morality and supervillain domination of [[Earth-Three]] shortly afterward, several years before ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' devised its own darker alternative universe. There was a lull before DC inaugurated additional alternative universes in the seventies, such as Earth-X, where there was an [[Axis victory in World War II]], Earth-S, home to the [[Fawcett Comics]] superheroes of the forties and fifties, such as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and Earth-Prime, where superheroes only existed in fictional forms.

Therefore, comic books in general are one of the few entertainment mediums where the concept of parallel universes are a major and ongoing theme. DC in particular periodically revisits the idea in major [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storylines, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', where Marvel has a series called ''[[What If (comics)|What If...]]'' that's devoted to exploring alternative realities, which sometimes impact the "main" universe's continuity. DC's version of "What If..." is the Elseworlds imprint.

DC Comics series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' heralded the return of the Multiverse. ''52'' was a mega-crossover event tied to ''Infinite Crisis'' which was the sequel to the 1980s ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.  The aim was to yet again address many of the problems and confusions brought on by the Multiverse in the DCU.  Now 52 Earths exist and including some Elseworld tales such as ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', DC's [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[WildStorm]] and an Earth devoted to the [[Charlton Comics]] heroes of DC. ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' and ''Countdown Presents: The Search for [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]'' and the ''Tales of the Multiverse'' stories expand upon this new Multiverse.

Marvel has also had many large crossover events which depicted an alternative universe, many springing from events in the [[X-Men]] books, such as 1981's ''[[Days of Future Past]]'', 1995's ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', and 2006's ''[[House Of M]]''. In addition the [[Squadron Supreme]] is a DC inspired Marvel Universe that has been used several times, often crossing over into the mainstream Universe in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] comic. [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] is an offshoot of the ''[[X-Men]]'' franchise that allows characters to hop from one alternative reality to another, leaving the original, main [[Marvel Universe]] intact. The [[Marvel UK]] line has long had multiverse stories including the [[Jaspers' Warp]] storyline of [[Captain Britain]]'s first series (it was here that the designation [[Earth-616]] was first applied to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]]).

Marvel Comics, as of 2000, launched their most popular parallel universe, the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. It is a smaller subline to the mainstream titles and features [[Ultimate Spider-Man]], [[Ultimate X-Men]], [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] and the [[Ultimates]] (their "Avengers").

The graphic novel [[Watchmen]] is set in an alternative history, in a 1985 where superheroes exist, the Vietnam War was won by the United States, and [[Richard Nixon]] is in his fifth term as President of the United States.  The Soviet Union and the United States are still locked in an escalating "Cold War" as in our own world, but as the Soviet Union invades [[Afghanistan]] in this world and threatens Pakistan, nuclear war may be imminent.

In 1973, [[Tammy (comics)|Tammy]] published ''The Clock and Cluny Jones'', where a mysterious grandfather clock hurls bully Cluny Jones into a harsh alternative reality where she becomes the bullied. This story was reprinted in [[Misty (comics)|Misty]] annual 1985 as ''Grandfather's Clock.''

In 1978, [[Misty (comics)|Misty]] published ''The Sentinels''. The Sentinels were two crumbling apartment blocks that connected the mainstream world with an alternative reality where [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] conquered Britain in 1940.

In 1981, [[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]] published ''Worlds Apart.'' Six girls experience alternative worlds ruled by greed, sports-mania, vanity, crime, intellectualism, and fear. These are in fact their dream worlds becoming real after they are knocked out by a mysterious gas from a chemical tanker that crashed into their school. In 1977 Jinty also published ''Land of No Tears'' where a lame girl travels to a future world where people with things wrong with them are cruelly treated, and emotions are banned.

The parallel universe concept has also appeared prominently in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comic series]] from [[Archie Comics]]. The first and most oft-recurring case of this is another "mirror universe" where Sonic and his various allies are evil or anti-heroic while the counterpart of the evil Dr. Robotnik is good. Another recurring universe featured in the series is a [[perpendicular]] dimension that runs through all others, known as the No Zone. The inhabitants of this universe monitor travel between the others, often stepping in with their Zone Cop police force to punish those who travel without authorization between worlds.

In more recent years, the comic has adapted the alternative dimension from the video games [[Sonic Rush]] and [[Sonic Rush Adventure]], home to Sonic's ally Blaze the Cat. The continuities seen in various other Sonic franchises also exist in the comic, most notably those based on the cartoon series [[Sonic Underground]] and [[Sonic X]]. For some years, a number of other universes were also featured that parodied various popular franchises, such as [[Sailor Moon]], [[Godzilla]], and various titles from [[Marvel Comics]]. Archie has also used this concept as the basis for crossovers between Sonic and other titles that they publish, including [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]] and [[Mega Man]].

The various [[Transformers]] comics also feature the parallel universe concept, and feature the various continuities from different branches of the franchise as parallel worlds that occasionally make contact with each other. Quite notably, the annual [[Botcon]] fan convention introduced a comic storyline that featured [[Cliffjumper]], an [[Autobot]] from the original Transformers series, entering an alternative universe where his fellow Autobots are evil and the [[Decepticons]] are good. This universe is known as the "Shattered Glass" universe, and continued on in comics and text based stories after its initial release.

==Video games==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' after the main protagonist, Link, defeats the dark lord, Ganon, he travels back in time to his childhood. This results in two alternative histories for Hyrule. In one a younger version Link travels to the land of Termina in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]''. In the other Link is no longer present allowing Ganon to return to go on a rampage that forced the gods of Hyrule to flood the world in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]''. There is also a scenario in which Link is killed by Ganon in the final battle, resulting in an alternative history in which Hyrule is put in an era of decline, leading to the events of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dutton|first1=Fred|title=Nintendo Feature: Zelda Timeline Explained|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/|website=Official Nintendo Magazine|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=2 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155115/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/|archivedate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 psychological horror point-and-click adventure game ''[[Dark Seed (video game)|Dark Seed]]'', the main character Mike Dawson discovers a parallel universe by going through his living room mirror.

The series also introduces the concepts of different "Realms" corresponding to Light, Darkness, Twilight, and Nothingness.

In the 1999 role-playing game ''[[Outcast (video game)|Outcast]]'', a probe is sent to a parallel universe and is attacked by an "entity". Cutter Slade must escort a team of scientists across to the other world in order to retrieve and repair the damaged probe before the earth is consumed by a black hole.

The ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series revolves heavily around alternate universes. [[Xen]] is a location in the first Half-Life game, accidentally discovered by scientists and described as a border world between dimensions, where the player must travel to stop an alien invasion. Half-Life 2 features a multidimensional empire called [[Combine (Half-Life)|The Combine]] which has successfully conquered Earth and subdued humanity, among countless other universes and species.

In the [[survival horror]] video game series ''[[Silent Hill]]'', the town of Silent Hill fluctuates between the real world, where Silent Hill is seemingly just an ordinary tourist town, the Fog World, which is like the real world, except the town is shrouded in thick fog and is nearly uninhabited except for monsters and a few people, and a dark and dilapidated version of the town called the "Other World".

In the 1993 adventure PC game ''[[Myst]]'', the unnamed protagonist travels to multiple alternative worlds through the use of special books, which describe a world within and transport the user to that world when a window on the front page is touched.

In the 1996 adventure PC game ''[[9: The Last Resort]]'', after resolving several mind-blowing and unique puzzles, the player gets past "The Tiki Guards"; and a door opens up to "The Void" - actually a room to another universe, which houses the entirety of space.

Both titles of the ''When They Cry'' visual novel series (''[[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni|Higurashi]]'' and ''[[Umineko]]'' for short) contain the concept of parallel worlds. These series both involve some kind of murder mystery. As soon as the main character has 'lost', another parallel world, called a Fragment, is chosen to be observed. This continues until the entire mystery is solved.

''[[EarthBound]]'' features many areas of the game that can be considered alternative dimensions. The first is an illusion created by the Mani Mani Statue that transforms the metropolis of Fourside into a bizarre neon metropolis called Moonside, filled with unusual characters and enemies. The second is Magicant, the world of Ness's subconscious that is accessed after obtaining the Eight Melodies. Finally, toward the end of the game, the protagonists arrive at the Cave to the Past, where they travel back in time to the haunting past dimension of the cave to face Giygas.

''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' features a "Magic Potion" item that when used, creates a doorway allowing the player to temporarily access "Subspace"; a mirrored silhouette version of the world where items can be found.

After the completion of the Special World in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', the overworld transforms from a green-colored springtime to an orange-colored autumnal setting. Many enemies encountered in the game are transformed into bizarre counterparts.

''[[Super Mario 64]]'' features a world called "Tiny Huge Island" which has two variants: one scaled up, the other scaled down. The player can only access certain parts of the level to obtain certain stars depending on which variant they are into. The two variants can be switched between via portals in the world.

''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' features a world called "Click Clock Wood", which has spring, summer, autumn and winter variants. The environment develops between the seasons making some areas accessible or inaccessible, and actions taken in one season affect the outcome in others.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' features a dark and twisted parallel version of [[Hyrule]] called the "Dark World".

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages]]'' use a similar concept to that which is used in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''. In those games, the player must switch between the parallel past and present worlds (Ages) and between spring, summer, autumn and winter (Seasons) to progress through the game.

In the first half of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', areas of Hyrule are veiled by the Twilight Realm. These areas are dusky and brooding in appearance, Link cannot transform out of wolf form, characters only appear as spirits that cannot be communicated with, and enemies are twilight variations of their regular forms. Otherwise, the Twilight Realm is identical to regular Hyrule.

[[Resistance: Fall of Man]] is set in alternative universe where Tsarist [[Russia]] never experienced the [[Russian Revolution]] but instead became the bridgehead for an aggressive [[alien invasion]] from a species known as the "Chimera", who then proceed to overrun [[Western Europe]], [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]] and much of the [[United States]], and where there has been no Second World War as a result. The events of the game and its sequels begin in its alternative 1951.

Each Zone in ''[[Sonic CD]]'' has four variations: Past, Present, Bad Future and Good Future, each displaying some subtle and not-so subtle alterations. The series has also seen alternative dimensions in the case of the ''[[Sonic Rush]]'' series, in which Sonic encounters a hero from another world named Blaze the Cat whose nemesis is an alternative counterpart of his own foe, Dr. Eggman. The ''Sonic'' series also makes use of the concept of alternative timelines.

The story of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' centers around travel between two alternative timelines, the original or "Another World"  and "Home World" which is a [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch]] created by the actions of the heroes of the game's predecessor, ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''.

In ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', the town "Flipside" (which acts as the game's central hub) has an alternative mirrored version called "Flopside". While Flipside appears pristine and the residents there are typically cheerful, Flopside appears somewhat dilapidated and is populated by surly characters.

The series ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' is played through several realms and timelines.

''[[Sudeki]]'' is set in a realm of light and a parallel realm of darkness.

''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' features an alternative hellish world called "Oblivion", as well as a painting you can climb into and a quest where you enter a dream world.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' takes place in Termina, a parallel world to [[Hyrule]]. Almost all of the characters from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reappear in the game.

''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' pivots around a world of darkness you travel to when you die, which is occupied by World War 1 soldiers.

''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'' involves a world, "Aether", having an alternative self in the, "Dark" realm, universe, or dimension. The protagonist, Samus, finds out that she just dropped into a hopeless war for the Luminoth, the dominant species of Light Aether against the Ing, the dominant species of Dark Aether. She also finds her counterpart, Dark Samus or Metroid Prime's essence inside Samus's Phazon Suit.

''[[Crash Twinsanity]]'' features Crash, Cortex, and Nina traveling to the "10th dimension," which could also be a parallel universe (suggested by the theme and how everything seems to be opposite).

''[[Minecraft]]'' features an alternative dimension called "The Nether", that includes a 'hell' like theme. It also contains a second alternative dimension called "The End", home world of the Endermen, a type of monster that spawns rarely in the main world.

''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]'' takes place in an alternative universe called "This Side" where in the events of Innocent Sin did not take place and the characters have never met in the past.

The ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series takes place in a subtly different universe. For example, the ship that landed the first men on the moon in 1969 is called ''Valiant 11'', rather than [[Apollo 11]]. This universe diverged from ours after [[World War II]], which resulted in a lack of advanced computers, the Cold War, VHS, etc.

The MMORPG ''[[City of Heroes]]'' features a Player vs Player (PvP) zone called Recluse's Victory. It is an alternative future in a constant state of flux, as heroes and villains battle for the future of Earth.

In the text-based science fiction MMORPG ''[[OtherSpace]]'', refugees from Earth's universe were forced to migrate to a parallel universe called ''Hiverspace'', whose quantum divergence occurred billions of years in the past, after damage to the time/space continuum began to tear their own universe apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Wes Platt]] |title=Otherspace: Down to Earth Chronicle |year=2012 |publisher= |page=139 |quote= ..."You did not 'jump' in time. You have jumped dimensions." Nix clarifies. "Hiverspace's timeline is obviously different from you own. ... Our universe, our Orion Arm, was destroyed by untold number of black holes created by a young Kamir not in control of his own powers. The rest of the Kamir gathered as many people from our universe as possible and rifted us all here. Our universe is gone, but it sound like your version of Normalspace still exists, not destroyed by some cataclysmic event. Such is similar for many others who have been brought here. You are just the newest in a long list that ever growing. But, I am not surprised that you were brought here by Kamir-influenced artifacts. In fact, I would be less surprised if you were not."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, they were able to find a means back to a past universe whose quantum divergence from their original ones was relatively minor.

2011 action-adventure video game ''[[Portal 2]]'' features a game-mode entitled "Perpetual Testing Initiative" (PeTI), where a plot item features protagonist "Bendy" through thousands of different worlds of which character Cave Johnson exist in different roles entitled "The Multiverse", and the PeTI's parallel universes are different from the main Half-Life/Portal timeline.

The 2012 visual novel/puzzle video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' heavily uses the concept of multiple realities as the basis for its plot as well as its central gameplay mechanic of traversing through realities and altering history.

The '''''Portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi''''' is a painting by the Italian artist [[Agnolo di Cosimo]], known as [[Bronzino]], finished around 1545. It is housed in the [[Uffizi]] Gallery in [[Florence]], Italy.

Lucrezia di Sigismondo Pucci was the wife of [[Bartolomeo Panciatichi]], a Florentine humanist and politician, also portrayed by Bronzino in another Uffizi portrait. [[Giorgio Vasari ]] describes the two portraits as: "so natural that they seem truly living". The show of refined garments and jewelry was intended not only to underline the élite position of the woman, but also aspects of her personality through a complex symbology, including the words "Amour dure sans fin" on the golden necklace, a reference to a love treatise written for the Grand Duke of Florence, [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], in 1547.

'''Pre-Construct Archaeology Limited'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Companies House]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a well-established independent company specialising in providing appropriate solutions to heritage problems.

==History==

'''Pre-Construct Archaeology (PCA)''' was formed in 1993 as a Partnership and was located in Lincoln, but operated in Greater London also. The Partners were Gary Brown, Brian Simmons and Colin Palmer Brown. Gary Brown, who was based in London, left the Partnership in 1995 and retained the name which he conceived, operating from this date as a Sole Trader. In 1996 Peter Moore and Dr Frank Meddens joined the organisation as Project Managers, followed a year later by Josephine Brown.
In March 1998 the legal status changed again with the organisation becoming a Limited Company&lt;ref name="wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk"&gt;http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk &lt;/ref&gt; the Directors of which are Gary Brown, Peter Moore, Dr Frank Meddens, and Josephine Brown.
In 1997 the organisation opened a second office in Durham managed by Robin Taylor-Wilson, who was later made a non-share holding Director. Further offices have been opened in Cambridge (PCA Central), Winchester (PCA West), both 2011 and Market Harborough (PCA Midlands) 2012. The company has expanded further and currently (2017) it operates from the seven offices: London, Cambridge, Norwich, Durham, Newark, Warwick and Winchester.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9143">The [[Pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]] made in 968 CE/357AH for Prince al-Mughira (15&amp;nbsp;cm x 8&amp;nbsp;cm) is a portable ivory carved container that dates from Medieval Islam's [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Spanish Umayyad period]]. It is in the collection of the [[Louvre]] in Paris. The container was made in one of the [[Medina Azahara|Madinat al-Zahra]] workshops, near modern-day [[Cordoba, Spain]] and is thought to have been a coming-of-age present for the son of caliph Abd al-Rahman III. Historical sources say that the prince referred to as al-Mughira was Abu al-Mutarrif al-Mughira, the last born son of the caliph [[Abd-ar-Rahman III|‘Abd al-Rahman III]], born to a concubine named Mushtaq.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 316&lt;/ref&gt;  We are certain this pyxis belongs to al-Mughira because of the inscription around the base of the lid which reads: “Blessing from God, goodwill, happiness and prosperity to al-Mughīra, son of the Commander of the Faithful, may God's mercy [be upon him], made in the year 357"

[[File:Pyxid Al Mughira OA 4068.jpg|thumb|Pyxis of al-Mughira. 968 CE/357AH. 15cm x 8cm]]

==Physicality and Context==
Pixides are known as luxury personal vessels given to members of the royal family and are thought to have been used for holding precious gems, jewelry, aromas, perfume etc.; however, the actual purpose of the pyxis of al-Mughira is unknown because there are no traces of any substance on the interior. Though the entire surface of the pyxis is intricately and expertly carved with different forms of decoration, most attention lies within the four main medallions around its diameter.

The exterior of the pyxis is elaborately carved and incised elephant ivory, imported by the caliph from North Africa. It is possible the pyxis was originally inlaid with gold and silver but only traces of jade remain. Though discovered with metal hinges mounting the lid on the container, it is believed (and clear) that the mounts were placed later than the original creation date because no space was allowed for the metal mounts to be placed. This is known because the hinges destroy part of the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen, “The Metal Mounts,” 303&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to these mentioned uncertainties, it is unclear how the lid was intended to be situated on the vessel and thus unknown how the inscription should be read, what is considered front or back and what its relation is to the scenes below.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 325&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Medallions==
'''Medallion One''' displays a scene of two men gathering eggs from falcon nests, which is popularly seen as a symbol for Umayyad power or legitimacy. Scholars have claimed that the synchronism between the falcon and Umayyad power was a current and strong symbol due to such metaphors found in poetry and art during that time period. In particular, [[Abd al-Rahman I|‘Abd al-Rahman I al-Dakhil]], founder of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyads]] in al-Andalus, was famously named “the falcon of the Quraysh” by an [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 321&lt;/ref&gt;
Because both men are being bitten by dogs it is also suggested that this was an implication of threat to those who would try to grasp power.

'''Medallion Two''' is of two horse riders picking clusters of dates from a date-palm tree. These trees are primarily found in the Middle East and North Africa and may allude to the Eastern lands, or “homeland of the palm tree groves”, lost to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]—another sect of control within Medieval Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Prado-Vilar, “Enclosed in Ivory,” 147&lt;/ref&gt;  Abd al-Rahman I, who founded Umayyad rule in the Iberian Peninsula, used the tree as code in his poetry. Some scholars suggest that the intertwining branches of the tree represent the twin branches of the Umayyad dynasty of which “both prophecy and the caliphate sprang” according to Umayyad panegyrist Hasan al-Tubni.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 320&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medallion Three''' shows a musical court scene of two seated figures flanking a middle figure who is suspected to be a servant due to his smaller, secondary scale. One figure holds the braided specter and flask of the Umayyads, while the other holds a fan. The meaning of this medallion is quite controversial but a popular viewpoint argues that the man with the specter and flask symbolizes the Umayyad Caliph and the figure with the fan symbolizes the Abassids. It is argued by Francisco Prado-Vilar that this scene could represent a ceremony performed in the court of al-Hakam II that would be of political significance to al-Mughira and act as a reminder to him of the continuation and solidity of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Prado-Vilar, “Enclosed in Ivory,” 141&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medallion Four''' is the only medallion that shows a common symbol of power through an image of a bull and lion fighting. Some scholars, including those at the Louvre and Eva Baer, have interpreted this as a message of authority and legitimacy of Umayyad Caliphs in competition with the Abbasid Caliphs, who ruled in Baghdad. Prado-Vilar ties this scene to fables told at the time that were used to teach life lessons to the young, especially to family of the royal court. He makes the claim that, with keeping Kalila wa Dimna in mind, al-Mughira would reflect on the symbolism of the “tragic consequences of listening to evil advice of those plotting to have him conspire against his brother’s lineage;” a way for the caliph to keep him in his secondary role and to not attempt to seek reign.&lt;ref&gt;Prado-Vilar, “Enclosed in Ivory,” 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation Controversy==
Scholars like Renata Holod argue that the pyxis was a present given to al-Mughira with an ironic, comical edge as a reminder to him that he would never be the next in line for rule. Holod also suspects the gift was not from the caliph or commissioned by al-Mughira; however, scholars like Makariou who refute this claim argue that it would be difficult for someone other than royalty to commission such a highly expensive item and to solely focus to a purely ironic message does not lead anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Makariou, “The al-Mughira Pyxis,” 318&lt;/ref&gt;  Makariou’s arguments also conflict with Prado-Vilar, who focuses solely on the pyxis as a vessel of serious warning to al-Mughira in regards to any political goals he may have had; however, Makariou contends that this argument shows lack of knowledge in regards to medieval caliphate customs and that it was not in the nature of the caliph to be so seriously concerned with internal power struggles.

The actual purpose of the pyxis of al-Mughira is highly argued and unanimously unknown. We do know the caliphate of Cordoba was infamous for their ability to acquire highly expensive and luxurious materials for their royal court. And because of their power, capabilities and secrecy, they maintained a singular and exclusive relationship with Northern Africa; a trading agreement no other dynasty was able to access. Ivory, a valuable and hard to work with material, was one of the many ways they displayed their wealth and power; however, using these capabilities to create the pyxis of al-Mughira is widely seen as wasteful and mediocre because of its leisurely context indicated by the assortment of princely entertainments on its exterior; however it is a vessel of impeccable craftsmanship and expert design.
To date the pyxis of al-Mughira’s purpose is still speculated and debated.
It is currently a part of the Islamic Art collection at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.

The '''Stupa No.2''' at [[Sanchi]], also called '''Sanchi II''', is one of the oldest existing Buddhist [[stupa]]s in India, and part of the Buddhist complex of Sanchi. It is of particular interest since it has the earliest known important displays of decorative reliefs in India, probably anterior to the reliefs at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]], or the reliefs of [[Bharhut]].&lt;ref name="Bell 15"&gt;Didactic Narration: Jataka Iconography in Dunhuang with a Catalogue of Jataka Representations in China, Alexander Peter Bell, LIT Verlag Münster, 2000 [https://books.google.com/books?id=77hHrXX4COgC&amp;pg=PA15 p.15ff]&lt;/ref&gt; It displays what has been called "the oldest extensive stupa decoration in existence".&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;"The railing of Sanchi Stupa No.2, which represents the oldest extensive stupa decoration in existence, (and) dates from about the second century B.C.E"  Constituting Communities: Theravada Buddhism and the Religious Cultures of South and Southeast Asia, John Clifford Holt, Jacob N. Kinnard , Jonathan S. Walters, SUNY Press, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PnnG8sclrdYC&amp;pg=PA197 p.197]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stupa number II at Sanchi is therefore considered as the birthplace of [[Jataka]] illustrations.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

==Foundation==
[[File:Sanchi map with Stupa 2.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Sanchi hill, with Stupa 2 at the extreme left, to the west.]]
Stupa No. 2 is located in the Buddhist complex of [[Sanchi]]. It was probably founded later than the Great Stupa (Stupa number 1) at Sanchi, but it contained reliquaries dated to the [[Mauryan Empire]] period (323-185 BCE), and it was the earliest to receive decorative reliefs, about a century earlier than Stupa Nb 1.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt; 

One of the key indicators to date Sanchi Stupa No.2 has been the similarity of its architectural motifs with those of [[Heliodorus pillar]], which is datable to circa 113 BCE due to its establishment during the rule of [[Indo-Greek]] [[Antialcidas]], as well as similarities of the [[paleography]] of the inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India, Julia Shaw, 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 p.88ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stupa is located outside of the main complex of Sanchi, about 300 meters to the west, on the slope of Sanchi hill.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"&gt;Monuments Of Sanchi Vol.1, John Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.532798 p.79ff]&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in a lower position than Stupa 1 because the relics it contained, are those of church dignitaries from the time of [[Ashoka]], who were considered as worthy of a lower position than the Buddha himself in Stupa number 1, or his disciples in Stupa number 3.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt;

==Relics==
[[File:Sanchi Stupa No 2 relics.jpg|thumb|Some of the relics found in Stupa Nb 2.]]
The Stupa contained a relic box with four small caskets of [[steatite]] inside, containing human bones. An inscription in early [[Brahmi]] was found on the relic box, mentioning that it contained "the relics of all teachers, including Kasapagota and Vachi-Suvijayita".&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt; Besides, ten saints were mentioned on the caskets, who either participated to the [[Third Buddhist Council]] held under [[Ashoka]], or were sent as emissaries to the [[Himalayas]] to preach the Buddhist doctrine. Among them is a "Mogaliputa",who may be [[Mogaliputa Tissa]], who presided the Third Buddhist Council, but this is disputed.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt;

==Content of the reliefs==
Typically, the earliest medallions at Sanchi are dated to 115 BC, while the more extensive pillar carvings are dated to around 80 BC,&lt;ref name="Shaw 90"&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, C. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD, by Julia Shaw, Left Coast Press, 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 p.90]&lt;/ref&gt; or almost a century later than the first ones, around 15 BCE.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt;

===Early period (circa 115 BCE)===
These reliefs from the early period of Sanchi II (circa 115 BCE) are the earliest known examples of Indian stone reliefs.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw 90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw 88"&gt;Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, C.

;First Jatakas
[[File:Sanchi Stupa number 2 KSP 3638.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The relief of the horse-headed ogress in Sanchi Stupa No.2.]]
One relief of a horse-headed woman, similar to [[:File:Bodh Gaya Jataka.jpg|another one]] at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] of [[Bodh Gaya]], is thought to be the first known representation of a [[Jataka]] (a story of a previous life of the Buddha), the Padakusalamanava Jataka, in which a horse-headed ogress falls in love with one of her preys, and the [[Bodhisattva]] (the future Buddha) is born of their union.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

[[File:Sunga railings detail.jpg|thumb|Sunga period railings were initially blank (left: Sanchi Great Stupa), and only started to be decorated circa 115 BCE with Stupa No.2 (right).&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;]]
These first attempts at narrative art are [[aniconic]], as they do not represent the Buddha directly, but only his appearance in previous lives, or his symbols.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

These are altogether 455 medallions and half-medallions, or which 293 consist in lotus flowers, and 126 in a lotus with another motif. Only 36 of the medallions have another subject.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt; For the first time, clearly Buddhist themes are represented, particularly the four events in the life of the Buddha that are: the Nativity, the Enlightenment, the First Sermon and the Decease.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA149 p.149]&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors consider these reliefs as the prelude (the "[[prolegomenon]]") of the iconography of the reliefs in [[Bharhut]] (100-80 BCE) and of the later and much more evolved depictions on the toranas of the Great Stupa in Sanchi (1st century BCE/CE).&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

====Influence from the northwest==== 
It is thought that the earliest reliefs from the last quarter of the 2nd century BCE were produced by craftsmen from the area of [[Gandhara]] in northwestern Indian, a central [[Indo-Greek]] region,&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt; because they left mason's marks in [[Kharoshthi]] (a script used around the area of Gandhara), as opposed to the local [[Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt; This seems to imply that these foreign workers were responsible for some of the earliest and sometimes quite foreign motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, by [[Amalananda Ghosh]], BRILL [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&amp;pg=PA295 p.295]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the first reliefs at Stupa II, in 115 BCE, the embassy of [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]] from the [[Indo-Greek]] king of [[Taxila]] named [[Antialkidas]], visited the court of the [[Sungas]] king [[Bhagabhadra]] in [[Vidisha]], about 6&amp;nbsp;km away from Sanchi. In Vidisha, Heliodorus established the [[Heliodorus pillar]] in a dedication to [[Vāsudeva]]. This would indicate that relations between the Indo-Greeks and the Sungas had improved by that time, that people traveled between the two realms, and also that the Indo-Greeks readily followed Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Indian History and Civilization, Sailendra Nath Sen, New Age International, 1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA170 p.170]&lt;/ref&gt;

The motif was, therefore, widespread and might be called a stock scene in the Parthian repertoire." (Berytus: Archaeological Studies p.291)&lt;/ref&gt;.

;Floral designs
The vast majority of the oldest medallions and half-medallions (293 out of 455) simply consist in a lotus motif. And 126 additional medallions and half medallions represent a lotus with another motif. Some motifs take on Hellenistic decorative forms.

Parmi les médaillons, les symboles purement Bouddhistes sont assez rares, bien qu'apparaissent par endroit les motifs de [[triratna]], de [[palmette]] (visible déjà dans le [[:File:Pataliputra Palace capital by L A Waddell 1895.jpg|Châpiteau de Pataliputra]], 3ième siècle av.

===Later period (circa 15 BCE)===
About a century later, some more descriptive reliefs were added, and often superimposed on the earlier ones, which clearly show the evolution of Buddhist during the intervening period.&lt;ref name="Marshall 79"/&gt; This time, the reliefs are much more Buddhist in character, and are contemporary with the reliefs on the [[torana]] gateways of the Great Stupa at Sanchi.&lt;ref name="Bell 15"/&gt;

'''Street painting''', also known '''pavement art''', '''street art''', and '''sidewalk art''', is the [[performance art]] of rendering artistic designs on [[Road surface|pavement]] such as streets, sidewalks, and town squares with impermanent and semi-permanent materials such as [[chalk]].

==Origin==
The origins of modern street painting can be traced to Britain. Pavement artists were found all over the United Kingdom and by 1890 it was estimated that more than 500 artists were making a full-time living from pavement art in London alone.

The British term for pavement artist is "screever". The term is derived from the writing style, often Copperplate, that typically accompanied the works of pavement artists since the 1700s. The term screever is most commonly cited as Shakespearean [[slang]] dating from around 1500.

The works of screevers often were accompanied by poems and proverbs, lessons on morality, and political commentary on the day’s events. They were described as "producing a topical, pictorial newspaper of current event."{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} They appealed to both the working people, who (on the whole) could not read or write, but understood the visual images; and to the educated members of the middle-classes who appreciated the moral lessons and comments. It was important for a screever to catch the eye of the ‘well to do’ and in turn attract the pennies donated for their efforts.

Street painters, (also called chalk artists) a name these performance artists are most commonly called in the United States are called ''I Madonnari'' in [[Italy]] (singular form: '''madonnaro''' or '''madonnara''') because they recreated images of [[the Madonna]]. In Germany '''''Strassenmaler''''' (streets: straßen, painter: maler).

The Italian Madonnari have been traced to the sixteenth century. They were itinerant artists, many of whom had been brought into the cities to work on the huge cathedrals.  When the work was completed, they needed to find another way to make a living, and thus often would recreate the paintings from the church onto the pavement. Aware of festivals and holy days held in each province and town, they traveled to join in the festivities to make a living from observers who would throw coins if they approved of the artist's work. For centuries, many Madonnari were folk artists, reproducing simple images with crude materials such as tiles, coal, and chalk. Others, such as [[El Greco]], would go on to become household names.

In 1973, street painting was being promoted in Italy by the formation of a two-day festival in [[Curtatone|Grazie di Curtatone]] in the Province of [[Mantua]].

In the 1980s, [[Kurt Wenner]] practiced '3-D pavement art', or one-point perspective art, otherwise known as anamorphic art, a 500-year-old technique, which appears in proper perspective only when viewed from a specific angle.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Festivals==

The first recorded street-painting competition and 'festival' was held in London in 1906.

In 1972 the first 'Italian' International Street Painting Competition was held in Grazie di [[Curtatone]], Italy. It is part of festival celebrating the Assumption with the streets of the city being turned over to the festival.

In 1987, Wenner and Manfred Stader introduced street painting to [[Mission Santa Barbara|Old Mission Santa Barbara]], California.

One of the largest events in the United States is the Lake Worth Street Painting Festival, held in Lake Worth Florida.  Started in 1994, it attracts 100,000 visitors over the weekend to see 250 works of art by over 400 artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetpaintingfestivalinc.org Lake Worth Street Painting Festival website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Rosy Loyola created Festival Bella Via in Monterrey, Mexico, which has launched several Mexican artists into the international street painting field.  Within the years it has become the most important street painting festival in Latin America.

Started in 2002, The Denver Chalk Art Festival on Larimer Square, located in Downtown Denver, is a free two-day street-painting festival. More than 200 artists spend hours during the weekend turning the streets of Larimer Square, into a museum of chalk art. The Festival is produced by the Larimer Arts Association, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting arts awareness and education in Denver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverchalkart.org/festival_info/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416020432/http://www.denverchalkart.org/festival_info/index.php |archivedate=2012-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Mark Wagner and 6,000 people (over 4,000 elementary school kids from Alameda, CA) set a Guinness World Record for the World's largest Pavement Art covering over 90,000 sq. ft. (8,361 sq. meters). A satellite photograph was taken of the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drawingonearth.org Drawing on Earth's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the First International Street Painting Festival held in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/afterhours/features/105871718.html Walter, Nick, ''Ground-breaking street painting" Pelican Press,  October 27, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110614212534/http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/afterhours/features/105871718.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/americas-1st-international-street-painting-festival-brings-250-artists-from-around-the-world-to-downtown-sarasota-104793859.html ''America's 1st International Street-Painting Festival Brings 250 Artists From Around the World to Downtown Sarasota'']&lt;/ref&gt; was organized by Denise Kowal, president of the [[Avenida de Colores, Inc.]] 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that produces the [[Sarasota Chalk Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chalkfestival.com Sarasota Chalk Festival website]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 250 street painters attended the [[Halloween]]-themed festival of 2010 that featured street painters from around the world and ran for eight and a half days.

In 2011 the First International StreetArt was staged in [[Wilhelmshaven]] in Germany. The event is scheduled to return in August 2012.&lt;ref name="StreetArt Wilhelmshaven website"&gt;[http://www.streetart-wilhelmshaven.de StreetArt Wilhelmshaven website]&lt;/ref&gt;

At Sarasota's 2011 chalk festival Dutch artist Leon Keer and the team of Planet Streetpainting created the 3-D street painting of the Lego Terracotta Army.&lt;ref name="3d chalk drawing"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2061268/Artist-draws-Chinas-terracotta-army-chalk-street-art-LEGO-men.html], Artist Leon Keer created the eye-catching image of China's terracotta army, featuring soldiers made from Lego.&lt;/ref&gt; The chalk painting was inspired by Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang's [[Terracotta Army]] "in honor of the arrival of [[Ego Leonard]] and to support his release out of his custody.&lt;ref name="Free Ego"&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2011/11/07/lego-army-invades-chalkfestival-to-free-ego-leonard.html], Lego army invades Chalkfestival to "Free" Ego Leonard.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the 3-Way-Split Project produced the First Annual in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, United Kingdom. The city of Lake Worth Florida is cited as the source of inspiration, by the project director. Nine street artists from the United States came to Southend-on-Sea to support the launch of this new annual event. In 2012 the festival will be held on the second Saturday in September.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.streetpainting-southend.org {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924092524/http://www.streetpainting-southend.org/ |date=2012-09-24 }} International Street Painting &amp; Festival of the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 the Second International StreetArt was staged in [[Wilhelmshaven]] in Germany. 37 artists from all over the world traveled to Wilhelmshaven in Germany. Also the largest anamorphic pavement art 3-D streetpainting picture was built by: Gregor Wosik, Lydia Hitzfeld, Melanie Siegel, und Vanessa Hitzfeld.&lt;ref name="StreetArt Wilhelmshaven website"/&gt;

In 2012, A company called [http://www.wetalkchalk.com We Talk Chalk], led by Creative Director [[Melanie Stimmell]], and Remco Van Latum, introduced the art of [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]] street painting to countries such as Israel and Thailand. The city of Chiang Mai hosted their first street painting festival in March 2012. To celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of Tel Aviv suburb Ramat Hasharon, Israeli and 8 International artists from 'We Talk Chalk' used 3-D chalk drawings to transform Bialik Street into an urban art compound. The festival had as many as 50,000 visitors, including Israel’s President Shimon Peres who posed with paintings by [[Melanie Stimmell]] and Ruben Poncia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Melanie Stimmell|artists wikipedia page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19448">[[Image:Gramsci.png|thumb|The subaltern identity is conceptually derived from the cultural-hegemony work of the Italian Marxist intellectual Antonio Gramsci.]]

In [[critical theory]] and [[postcolonialism]], the term '''subaltern''' designates the populations which are socially, politically, and geographically outside of the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[Hierarchy|power structure]] of the [[colony]] and of the colonial [[homeland]]. In describing "history told from below", ''subaltern'' was coined by [[Antonio Gramsci]], notably through his work on [[cultural hegemony]], which identified the groups that are excluded from a society's established institutions and thus denied the means by which people have a voice in their society.

The terms ''subaltern'' and ''[[Subaltern Studies]]'' entered postcolonial studies through the works of the [[Subaltern Studies|Subaltern Studies Group]], a collection of historians of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] who explored the political-actor role of the men and women who constitute the mass population, rather than the political roles of the social and economic elites, in the history of the Indian Subcontinent. &lt;ref&gt;David Ludden (ed) ''Reading Subaltern Studies: Critical History, Contested Meaning and the Globalisation of South Asia''. Delhi: Permanent Black, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marx's theory of history|Marxist historians]] had already been investigating colonial history as told from the perspective of the [[proletariat]], using the concept of social classes as being determined by economic relations. In the 1970s, ''subaltern'' began to denote the [[Colonization|colonized]] peoples of the Indian subcontinent and described a new perspective of the history of an [[Imperialism|imperial]] colony as told from the point of view of the colonized rather than that of the colonizers. In the 1980s, the scope of enquiry of Subaltern Studies was applied as an "intervention in South Asian [[historiography]]".

As a method of intellectual discourse, the concept of the ''subaltern'' is contentious because it originated as a [[Eurocentric]] method of historical enquiry for studying the non-Western people of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. From its inception as an historical-research model for studying the colonial experience of the  peoples  of the Indian Subcontinent, subaltern studies transformed from a model of intellectual discourse into a method of "vigorous post-colonial critique". The term "subaltern" is used in the fields of [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[human geography]], [[literary criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Prakash, Gyan. "Subaltern Studies as Postcolonial Criticism", ''The American Historical Review'', December, 1994,  Vol. 99, No. 5, 1475–1490, 1476.&lt;/ref&gt; [[musicology]], and art history.

== Denotations ==
In postcolonial theory, the term ''subaltern'' describes the lower classes and the social groups who are at the margins of a society: a subaltern is a person rendered without [[human agency|agency]] by [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert J. C. ''Postcolonialism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the literary critic [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri Spivak]] spoke against an overly broad application of the term in 1992:

{{Quotation|...''subaltern'' is not just a classy word for "oppressed", for [the] [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], for somebody who's not getting a piece of the pie.... In post-colonial terms, everything that has limited or no access to the cultural imperialism is subaltern—a space of difference. Now, who would say that's just the oppressed? The [[working class]] is oppressed. It's not subaltern.... Many people want to claim subalternity. They are the least interesting and the most dangerous. I mean, just by being a discriminated-against minority on the university campus; they don't need the word 'subaltern'.... They should see what the mechanics of the discrimination are. They're within the hegemonic discourse, wanting a piece of the pie, and not being allowed, so let them speak, use the hegemonic discourse. They should not call themselves subaltern.&lt;ref&gt;de Kock, Leon. "Interview With Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: New Nation Writers Conference in South Africa." ''[http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458 ARIEL: A Review of International English Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706205400/http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458 |date=2011-07-06 }}''. 23(3) 1992: 29-47. ARIEL&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Marxist theory]], the civil sense of the term ''subaltern'' was first used by the Italian communist intellectual [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937). In discussions of the meaning of the "subaltern" in Gramsci's writings, Spivak and others have argued that he used the word as a synonym for the proletariat (a [[code word]] to deceive the prison censor to allow his manuscripts out the prison),&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Stephen. "The Subaltern: Genealogy of a Concept", in ''Gayatri Spivak: Ethics, Subalternity and the Critique of Postcolonial Reason''. Malden, MA: Polity, 2007: pp. 96-97; and Hoare, Quintin, and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith. "Terminology", in ''Selections from the Prison Notebooks''. New York: International Publishers, pp. xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; but that interpretation has been contested, with evidence indicating that it was a novel concept in Gramsci's political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Marcus E. "[https://www.academia.edu/1548708/Rethinking_the_subaltern_and_the_question_of_censorship_in_Gramscis_Prison_Notebooks Rethinking the Subaltern and the Question of Censorship in Gramsci's Prison Notebooks]," Postcolonial Studies, Volume 14, Number 4 (2011): 385-402.&lt;/ref&gt; In several essays, the postcolonial critic [[Homi K. Bhabha]] emphasized the importance of [[social power]] relations in defining subaltern social groups as oppressed, racial minorities whose social presence was crucial to the self-definition of the majority group; as such, subaltern social groups, nonetheless, also are in a position to subvert the [[authority]] of the social groups who hold hegemonic power.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Morena, Laura and Pfeiffer, Peter C. Eds. "Unsatisfied: Notes on Vernacular Cosmopolitanism", ''Text and Nation: Cross-Disciplinary Essays on Cultural and National Identities''. Columbia, SC: Camden House, 1996: pp. 191–207 and "Unpacking my library... again", ''The Post-colonial Question: Common Skies, Divided Horizons''. Iain Chambers, Lidia Curti, eds. New York: Routledge, 1996: 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Toward a New Legal Common Sense'' (2002), the sociologist [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]] applies the term ''subaltern cosmopolitanism'' to describe the counter-hegemonic practice, social movement, resistance, and struggle against [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]], especially the struggle against [[social exclusion]]. Moreover, de Sousa Santos applies ''subaltern cosmopolitanism'' as interchangeable with the term ''cosmopolitan legality'' to describe the diverse [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] framework for an ''equality of differences'' in which the term ''subaltern'' specifically denotes the oppressed peoples at the margins of a society who are struggling against hegemonic globalization. However, context, time, and place (but perhaps not the Marxist emphasis on the economic relations) determine who, among the peoples at the margins of a society, is a Subaltern; in India women, [[dalit]]s, rural, tribal, immigrant laborers are part of subaltern.

== Theory ==
Postcolonial theory studies the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and the continued dominance of Western ways of knowing, of intellectual enquiry. The work of [[Edward Said]] in the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' conceptually addresses oppressed subaltern peoples, to explain how the Eurocentric perspective of Orientalism produced the foundations and the justifications for the [[dominance hierarchy|domination]] of [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]], by means of colonialism. Before their explorations of ''The Orient'', the Europeans had created an imagined geography of the Orient, predefined images of savage and monstrous places that lay beyond the horizon of the known world. During their initial Oriental explorations, the Europeans' mythologies were reinforced, when the travellers returned to Europe with reports of monsters and savage lands. The concepts of the "difference" and the "strangeness" of the Orient were perpetuated through the mass communications media of the time and through discourse that created an "Us" and "Them" binary social relation with which the Europeans defined themselves by defining the differences of the Orient from the Occident, the European West. The Us-and-Them binary social relation was a foundation of colonialism, because it represented the Orient as backward and irrational lands, and, therefore, in need of European help to become modern, in the Western sense. Hence, the [[discourse]] of Orientalism is Eurocentric, and does not seek to include the voices of the Oriental peoples, the subalterns, themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings'' by T. Das Gupta, ''et al.'' (eds). Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne. ''Geographies of Postcolonialism'', chapter 1, On Orientalism. SAGE Publications. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] argued that the power of discourse created and reinforced Western dominance. The discourses on how Europe described differences between itself (The West) and others, used European cultural categories, languages, and ideas to represent "The Other." The knowledge produced by such a discourse becomes praxis, which then becomes reality; by producing a discourse of "[[Difference (philosophy)|difference]]" Europe was able to maintain its dominance over "The Other", with a binary social relation between the European and The Other, thereby creating and establishing the Subaltern, made possible by excluding The Other from the production of the discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. "The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power". ''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings''. Das Gupta, T. et al (eds). Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The voice of the subaltern ==
[[Image:Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak at Goldsmiths College.jpg|thumb|175px|Engaging the Subaltern voice: the philosopher and theorist Gayatri Spivak.]]

[[Gayatri Spivak]]'s line of reasoning was developed in Joanne Sharp's ''Geographies of Post colonialism'' (2008), who proposed that Western intellectuals relegate other, non-Western (African, Asian, Middle Eastern) forms of "knowing", of acquiring knowledge of the world, to the margins of intellectual discourse, by re-formulating these forms of knowing as myth and as folklore. To be heard and known, the subaltern must adopt Western ways of knowing, of thought, reasoning, and language; because of such [[Westernization]], a subaltern people can never express their ways of knowing (thought, reasoning, language) and instead must conform expression of their non-Western knowledge of colonial life to Western ways of knowing the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne  ''Geographies of Postcolonialism'', Chapter 6: Can the Subaltern Speak? SAGE Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Subalterns' abandonment of culturally customary ways of thinking and the subsequent adoption of Western ways of thinking are necessary in many situations. The subordinated can be heard by oppressors only by speaking the language of the rulers; thus, intellectual and cultural filters of conformity muddle the true voice of the subaltern. For example, in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Colonial Latin America]], non-elites must conform to the colonial culture and use the filters of religion and servitude, in the language, when addressing the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Imperial]] rulers. To make their appeals to the crown effective, slaves and natives would address the rulers in ways that might mask their own ways of speaking.

Early modern historian [[Fernando Coronil]] said that the goal of the investigator must be "to listen to the subaltern subjects, and to interpret what I hear" and to engage them and interact with their voices. We cannot ascend to a position of dominance over the voice, subjugating its words to the meanings we desire to attribute to them. That is simply another form of discrimination. The power to narrate somebody's story is a heavy task, and we must be cautious and aware of the complications involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coronil|first=Fernando|title=Listening to the Subaltern: The Poetics of Neocolonial States|jstor=1773104|journal=Poetics Today|year=1994|volume=15|issue=4|series=4|pages=643–658|doi=10.2307/1773104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spivak and [[bell hooks]] question the academic's engagement with the Other, and argue that, to truly engage with the subaltern, the academic would have to remove him or herself as "the expert" at the center of the Us-and-Them binary social relation. Traditionally, the academic wants to know about the subaltern's experiences of colonialism, but does not want to know the subaltern's (own) explanation of his or her experiences of colonial domination.  According to the received view in Western knowledge, hooks argued that a true explanation can come only from the expertise of the academic, thus, the subordinated subject, the subaltern surrender knowledge of colonialism for the use of the Western academic; hooks describes the relationship between the academic and the subaltern:

{{Quotation|[There is] no need to hear your voice, when I can talk about you better than you can speak about yourself. No need to hear your voice. Only tell me about your pain. I want to know your story. And then I will tell it back to you in a new way. Tell it back to you in such a way that it has become mine, my own. Re-writing you, I write myself anew. I am still author, authority. I am still [the] colonizer, the speaking subject, and you are now at the center of my talk.|"Marginality as a Site of Resistance" (1990)&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. "Marginality as a Site of Resistance", in R. Ferguson et al. (eds), ''Out There: Marginalization and Contemporary Cultures''. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1990: pp. 241-43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a means of constructing a greater historical picture of society, the Subaltern's story is a revealing examination of society; the perspective of the subaltern man and woman, the most powerless people who live within colonial confines; therefore, the investigator of post-colonialism must not assume a lumbering cultural superiority in the course of studying the voices of the oppressed subalterns.

== Development discourse ==
Mainstream development discourse, which is based upon knowledge of colonialism and [[Orientalism]], concentrates upon [[modernization theory]], wherein the modernization of an underdeveloped country ''should'' follow the path to modernization taken (and established) by the developed countries of the West. As such, modernization is characterized by free trade, open markets, capitalist economic systems, and democratic systems of governance, as the means by which a nation should modernize their country ''en route'' to becoming a developed country in the Western style. Therefore, mainstream development discourse concentrates upon the application of universal social and political, economic and cultural policies that would nationally establish such modernization.&lt;ref name="lawson"&gt;Lawson, Victoria. ''Making Development Geography''. UK: Hodder Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Making Development Geography'' (2007), Victoria Lawson presents a critique of mainstream development discourse as mere recreation of the Subaltern, which is effected by means of the subaltern being disengaged from other social scales, such as the locale and the community; not considering regional, social class, ethnic group, sexual- and gender-class differences among the peoples and countries being modernized; the continuation of the socio-cultural treatment of the subaltern as a subject of development, as a subordinate who is ignorant of what to do and how to do it; and by excluding the voices of the subject peoples from the formulations of policy and practice used to effect the modernization.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt;

As such, the subaltern are peoples who have been silenced in the administration of the colonial states they constitute, they can be heard by means of their political actions, effected in protest against the [[discourse]] of mainstream development, and, thereby, create their own, proper forms of modernization and development. Hence do subaltern social groups create social, political, and cultural movements that contest and disassemble the exclusive claims to power of the Western imperialist powers, and so establish the use and application of local knowledge to create new spaces of opposition and alternative, non-imperialist futures.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt;

Accessed 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The play is composed of eleven ten-minute [[monologues]], each featuring a different woman who talks about her life.&lt;ref name=Playscripts&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking With|url=https://www.playscripts.com/playwrights/bios/330|publisher=Playscripts|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play includes the pieces, "Fifteen Minutes," "Scraps," "Clear Glass Marbles," "Audition," "Rodeo," "Twirler," "Lamps," "Handler," "Dragons," "French Fries," and "Marks."

The play deals with the personal ordeals of each of the female characters. Many of them are very touching; a few are even intensely emotional. However, there is also the very comical. Even the funny ones, however, have an underlying depth to them that gives a sensitive insight into each of the characters involved.The ladies cover a wide spectrum of life and age from the fading rodeo star in "Rodeo" to the young aspiring actress in "Audition", there is much tenderness and diversity in the subject matter involved in the play.&lt;ref name="Women Leading Kentucky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking With …|url=http://womenleadingky.com/about-the-play/|publisher=Women Leading Kentucky|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], '''trilateration''' is the process of determining absolute or relative locations of points by measurement of distances, using the geometry of [[circle]]s, [[sphere]]s or [[triangle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/605329/trilateration Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/t/r/trilateration/source.html diracdelta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812144807/http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/t/r/trilateration/source.html |date=2010-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globmaritime.com/technical-articles/marine-navigation/general-concepts/9622-trilateration-traverse-and-vertical-surveying.html Global Maritime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/trilateration free dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its interest as a geometric problem, trilateration does have practical applications in [[surveying]] and [[navigation]], including [[global positioning system]]s (GPS). In contrast to [[triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]], it does not involve the measurement of [[angle]]s.

In [[2D geometric model|two-dimensional geometry]], it is known that if a point lies on two circles, then the circle centers and the two radii provide sufficient information to narrow the possible locations down to two. Additional information may narrow the possibilities down to one unique location.

In three-dimensional geometry, when it is known that a point lies on the surfaces of three spheres, then the centers of the three spheres along with their radii provide sufficient information to narrow the possible locations down to no more than two (unless the centers lie on a straight line).

This article describes a method for determining the intersections of three sphere surfaces given the centers and radii of the three spheres.
==History==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
== Derivation ==
The intersections of the surfaces of three spheres is found by formulating the equations for the three sphere surfaces and then solving the three equations for the three unknowns, ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''. To simplify the calculations, the equations are formulated so that the centers of the spheres are on the ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 plane. Also, the formulation is such that one center is at the origin, and one other is on the ''x''-axis. It is possible to formulate the equations in this manner since any three non-collinear points lie on a unique plane. After finding the solution, it can be transformed back to the original three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

We start with the equations for the three spheres:
[[File:Trilateration example.png|alt=Example of Trilateration in OpenSCAD|thumb|499x499px|Figure 2. Example of trilateration in OpenSCAD using the derivation at left&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/kwikius/Trilateration/blob/master/trilateration.scad|title=kwikius/Trilateration|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The farthest corner of the underside of the translucent cube is placed at one of the two intersections of the three spheres.]]

:&lt;math&gt;r_1^2=x^2+y^2+z^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_2^2=(x-d)^2+y^2+z^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_3^2=(x-i)^2+(y-j)^2+z^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;


The value ''d'' is the x coordinate of point P2. It needs to be subtracted from x to get the length of the base of the triangle between the intersection and r2 (''x'', ''y'', ''z'' are coordinates, not lengths).

We need to find a point located at (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') that satisfies all three equations.

We need to use r1 and r2 to eliminate y and z from the equation and solve for ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;r_1^2=x^2+y^2+z^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_2^2=(x-d)^2+y^2+z^2. &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_1^2 - r_2^2 = x^2 - (x-d)^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_1^2 - r_2^2 = x^2 - (x^2 - 2xd + d^2) \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_1^2 - r_2^2 = 2xd - d^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_1^2 - r_2^2  + d^2 = 2xd \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{r_1^2-r_2^2+d^2}{2d}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming that the first two spheres intersect in more than one point, that is that

:&lt;math&gt;d-r_1 &lt; r_2 &lt; d+r_1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

In this case, substituting the equation for ''x'' back into the equation for the first sphere produces the equation for a circle, the solution to the intersection of the first two spheres:

:&lt;math&gt;y^2+z^2=r_1^2-\frac{(r_1^2-r_2^2+d^2)^2}{4d^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- Setting this formula equal to the formula for the third sphere finds: --&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt;z^2=r_1^2-x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; into the formula for the third sphere and solving for ''y'' there results:

:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{r_1^2-r_3^2-x^2+(x-i)^2+j^2}{2j}=\frac{r_1^2-r_3^2+i^2+j^2}{2j}-\frac{i}{j}x.&lt;/math&gt;

Now that the ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates of the solution point are found, the formula can be rearranged for the first sphere to find the ''z''-coordinate:

:&lt;math&gt;z=\pm \sqrt{r_1^2-x^2-y^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now the solution to all three points ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' is found. Because ''z'' is expressed as the positive or negative square root, it is possible for there to be zero, one or two solutions to the problem.

This last part can be visualized as taking the circle found from intersecting the first and second spheres and intersecting that solution with the third sphere. If this last falls entirely outside or inside the first solution then ''z'' is equal to the [[Imaginary number|square root of a negative number]] and no real solution exists. If it touches the first solution at exactly one point, ''z'' is equal to zero and if it touches at two points, then ''z'' is equal to plus or minus the square root of a positive number.

== Preliminary and final computations ==
The ''Derivation'' section pointed out that the coordinate system in which the sphere centers are designated must be such that 
# all three centers are in the plane ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, 
# the sphere center, ''P''1, is at the origin, and 
# the sphere center, ''P''2, is on the ''x''-axis.
In general the problem will not be given in a form such that these requirements are met.

This problem can be overcome as described below where the points, ''P''1, ''P''2, and ''P''3 are treated as vectors from the origin where indicated.  ''P''1, ''P''2, and ''P''3 are of course expressed in the original coordinate system.
:&lt;math&gt;\hat e_x = \frac{ P2 - P1 }{ \| P2 - P1 \| }&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the direction from ''P''1 to ''P''2.
:&lt;math&gt;i = \hat e_x \cdot ( P3 - P1 ) &lt;/math&gt; is the signed magnitude of the ''x'' component, in the figure 1 coordinate system, of the vector from ''P''1 to ''P''3.
:&lt;math&gt;\hat e_y = \frac{ P3 - P1 - i \; \hat e_x}{ \| P3 - P1 - i \; \hat e_x \| }&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in the y direction.  Note that the points ''P''1, ''P''2, and ''P''3 are all in the ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 plane of the figure 1 coordinate system.
The third basis unit vector is &lt;math&gt;\hat e_z = \hat e_x \times \hat e_y&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;d = \| P2 - P1 \|&lt;/math&gt; the distance between the centers ''P''1 and ''P''2 and
:&lt;math&gt;j = \hat e_y \cdot ( P3 - P1 ) &lt;/math&gt; is the signed magnitude of the y component, in the figure 1 coordinate system, of the vector from ''P''1 to ''P''3.
Using &lt;math&gt;i, \;  d&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; as computed above, solve for ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' as described in the ''Derivation'' section. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\vec p_{1,2} = P1 + x \ \hat e_x + y \ \hat e_y \ \pm \ z \ \hat e_z &lt;/math&gt;

gives the points in the original coordinate system since &lt;math&gt;\hat e_x, \; \hat e_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat e_z&lt;/math&gt;, the basis unit vectors, are expressed in the original coordinate system!

From 1967 to 1978 a total of 31 Tsiklon satellites were launched onboard [[Kosmos-3]] and [[Kosmos-3M]] rockets, from the [[Kapustin Yar]] and [[Plesetsk]] launch sites.  The project was conceived in the 1950s and the draft proposal was approved in 1962, but was not made operational until 1972 due to delays.&lt;ref name="tsi"&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/tsiklon.htm Tsiklon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The successor satellites to Tsiklon were [[Parus (satellite)|Parus]] and [[Sfera (satellite)|Sfera]].&lt;ref name="tsi" /&gt;  Currently, Russia operates the [[GLONASS]] system.

'''Urban archaeology''' is a sub discipline of [[archaeology]] specialising in the material past of [[town]]s and [[cities]] where long-term human habitation has often left a rich record of the past.

Humans produce waste: Large concentrations of humans produce large concentrations of waste. Kitchen waste, broken objects, and similar material all need to be disposed of. Small numbers of people can dispose of their waste locally without encouraging [[vermin]] or endangering their health. Once people began to live together in large numbers, around five thousand years ago, such methods began to become impractical. Material would be brought into these new settlements but would rarely be taken out again. {{clarify|date=November 2014}}

Up until the nineteenth century when organised rubbish disposal became widespread in urban areas people invariably threw their waste from their windows or buried it in their gardens. If their houses fell down, a common enough occurrence when planning laws were non-existent, owners would pick out what they could reuse, stamp down the remains and rebuild on the old site.

The effect of this is that even a moderately sized settlement of any antiquity is built on top of a heap of refuse and demolished buildings and is therefore raised up from its original height on a plateau of archaeology. This is most apparent in the [[Tell (archaeology)|tel]] sites of the [[Near East]] where towns that have been occupied for thousands of years are raised up many metres above the surrounding landscape.

In walled towns such as those in [[medieval]] [[Europe]] the effect of the encircling defences was to hold in the waste so that it could not slip outwards, magnifying the effect.

==Historic development==

Archaeological [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] within historic cities therefore often produces a thick [[Stratification (archeology)|stratigraphy]] dating back to the original foundation and telling the story of its history.

The [[City of London]] serves as an example, for urban excavations have been performed there since the late 1900s. These excavations, performed in populated areas of the city, revealed historical evidence of events unforeseen previously by historians. London sits on a tel, which preserves a layer of dark material, attributed to the burning of the city by [[Boudica]] in 60 AD. It was only by excavation of the urban areas that these revelations could be made, as the city has long since outgrown its borders after its rebuild, some years after the Boudican revolt.

The dense stratigraphy of such cities posed problems for the archaeologists who first excavated them. Earlier excavations were generally limited to rural areas, or towns which had been long abandoned. [[Open area excavation]] was feasible as there was plenty of space and the archaeology could often be exposed just in plan. In working cities however, space for excavation is usually limited to the size of the open plot and one layer of archaeology needs to be excavated before the next one can be exposed.

Issues such as this had appeared before, at [[Pompeii]] or at multiphase rural sites but the move towards the investigation of cities, which began in Europe following the [[Second World War]]. The trend of urban excavation in areas such as Europe, the East Coast of the United States, and other western world cities, has grown since the war. Due to the bombing of landscapes during the war, the possibility of losing evidence connected to early civilizations became realized. The idea of settlement follows a principle, that settlement is made where resources are conveniently accessed. Prosperous cities, such as Boston and London, began as settlements, and grew quickly due to the convenient access of resources. However, the fact that these cities still exist today does not dismiss the fact that, at some point in history, some other civilization had once settled there.

==Methods==

The resulting solution revolved around the method of [[single context recording]]. The practice involves drawing each feature individually in plan and then relating its position to the site grid rather than planning large areas at once. Each drawing is made on a square piece of translucent film representing a 5-metre x 5 metre grid square. The site is excavated down to the first significant layer of archaeology and features excavated and recorded as normal but also planned as single contexts. The site is then reduced to the next layer of archaeology and the process begins again. The excavation and recording can continue until natural deposits are reached. A small, deep trench known as a [[sondage]] is often excavated at first to provide a view of the entire stratigraphy at once and give an indication of the quantity of material to be excavated.

Once the work is finished, the square sheets can be overlaid onto one another to provide a picture of the site. By identifying which features cut others and using information from dateable [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s and [[ecofact]]s an archaeologist can isolate various phases of activity and show how the use of the site developed of periods of hundreds or even thousands of years. Context record sheets produced by the individual excavators provide further information on each context's nature and relationship with its neighbours. Such interpretation would be impossible using open area excavation where numerous overall site plans would soon seem inflexible.
