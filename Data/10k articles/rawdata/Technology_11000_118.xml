[[File:Acoustic Liner Composite Sandwich.png|thumb|A composite sandwich acoustic liner (A) with perforate face-sheet (B) honeycomb core (C) and back-skin (D)]]

[[Aircraft engines]], typically [[turbofan]]s, use '''acoustic liners''' to damp engine noise. Liners are applied on the internal walls of the engine [[nacelle]], both in the intake and by-pass ducts, and use [[Helmholtz resonance]] principle for the dissipation of incident acoustic energy.

==Configurations==
[[File:Acoustic Liner Configurations.png|thumb|(A) SDOF liner with perofrate face sheet, (B) SDOF liner with wire-mesh face sheet, (C) DDOF liner with wire-mesh septum.]]
An acoustic liner is a sandwich panel made by:
*a porous top layer, called face-sheet;
*a [[honeycomb structure]] providing internal partitions;
*an impervious layer, called back-sheet or back-skin;
The lower half of a liner features dedicated internal slots to allow liquid drainage in order to prevent ice formation or fire hazards. From an acoustic perspective, this implies that the upper acoustic panel is a ''locally reacting liner'', whereas the lower one is a ''non-locally reacting liner''.&lt;ref name=Murray2007&gt;Murray, P., Ferrante, P., &amp; Scofano, A., The Influence of Aircraft Nacelle Acoustic Panel Drainage Slots on Duct Attenuation. In 13th AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference (28th AIAA Aeroacoustics Conference), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acoustic liners can be distinguished by their internal configuration on the base of the number of honeycomb cell layers:
*Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) liners are sandwich panels with a basic configuration, face-sheet bonded to a honeycomb layer and closed by a back-skin. Often ”rectiling” method is used to make sure linkage is given.
*Double Degree of Freedom (DDOF) liners are made by two layers of honeycomb cells divided by a porous septum. In particular, a DDOF liner is constituted by a top facing-sheet, a first honeycomb layer, a porous septum, a second honeycomb layer, and finally an impervious back-skin. Therefore, a DDOF liner couples two Helmholtz resonator in series.
Porous layers (e.g. the septum and the face-sheet) can be for example a perforate plate, a wire mesh or a felt-metal. The honeycomb can be of aluminum or glass fiber and the cells' size is selected small enough to ensure an acoustic plane wave in the cell for the whole frequency of interest. The face-sheet and back-skin can be either metallic or in [[carbon fiber]]. In order to have a cylindrical barrel, panel parts are structurally joined together leading to a partial loss of the acoustic area known as splice. Current state-of-the-art of acoustic are made without splices and are known as zero-splice liners. For example, the evolution of the splices width on the [[Airbus]] family ranges from three splices of about 15&amp;nbsp;cm for the [[Airbus A320]] to a zero-splice liner for the [[Airbus A380]].&lt;ref name="Kempton2011"&gt;[http://www.win.tue.nl/ceas-asc/Workshop15/CEAS-ASC_XNoise-EV_K1_Kempton.pdf Kempton, A, "Acoustic liners for modern aero-engines", 15th CEAS-ASC Workshop and 1st Scientific Workshop of X-Noise EV, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acoustic performance ==
The acoustic liners' performance can be verified in dedicated experimental test rigs,&lt;ref name="Ferrante2011"&gt;Ferrante, P. G., Copiello, D., &amp; Beutke, M.. Design and experimental verification of “true zero-splice” acoustic liners in the universal fan facility adaptation (UFFA) modular rig,”. In 17h AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference, AIAA-2011-2728, Portland, OR.&lt;/ref&gt; by means of virtual prototypes or by means of ground tests on full-scale engines.&lt;ref name="Schuster2010"&gt;Schuster, B., Lieber, L., &amp; Vavalle, A., Optimization of a seamless inlet liner using an empirically validated prediction method. In 16th AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference, Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; Both these type of tests and simulations allow to determine the acoustic attenuation in the far-field. Moreover, the acoustic performance is linked to the acoustic impedance which can be measured with one of the following techniques:
* Impedance tube or Kundt's tube;
* Flow-duct-facilities&lt;ref name="Jones202"&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030007721.pdf Jones, M. G., Tracy, M. B., Watson, W. R., &amp; Parrott, T. L., ''Effects of liner geometry on acoustic impedance.'' AIAA Paper, 2446, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In-situ method or Dean's method&lt;ref name="Dean1974"&gt;Dean, P. D.,''An In-Situ Method of Wall Acoustic Impedance Measurement in Flow Duct'', Journal of Sound and Vibration, No. 34 (1), 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
All these methodologies measure the liner's normal impedance. However, only flow duct facilities and the in-situ method allow the measurement of the impedance in presence of the grazing flow which can affect the impedance itself.&lt;ref name="Jones202" /&gt; Moreover, the in-situ method is the only one able to measure the impedance directly on full scale acoustic liners.&lt;ref name="Schuster2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaeta2010"&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070022427.pdf Gaeta, R. J., Mendoza, J. M., &amp; Jones, M. G., Implementation of in-situ impedance techniques on a full scale aero-engine system. In 13th AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustics Conference, AIAA Paper 2007 (Vol. 3441).]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amazon Prime Air''' is a conceptual [[Delivery drone|drone-based delivery system]] currently in development by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].

==History==
===Concept===
On December 1, 2013, [[Amazon.com]] CEO [[Jeff Bezos]] revealed plans for Amazon Prime Air in an interview on ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Amazon Prime Air is planned to use [[multirotor]] Miniature Unmanned Air Vehicle ([[Miniature UAV]]) technology to autonomously fly individual packages to customers within 30 minutes of ordering.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-unveils-futuristic-plan-delivery-by-drone/|title = Amazon Unveils Futuristic Plan: Delivery by Drone|author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date = 1 December 2013|work= CBS News|accessdate = 6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify for 30 minute delivery, the order must be less than 5 pounds (2.25&amp;nbsp;kg), must be small enough to fit in the cargo box that the craft will carry, and must have a delivery location within a 10-mile (16&amp;nbsp;km) radius of a participating Amazon order fulfillment center.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt;

=== United States regulations and testing under waiver program===
In the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Congress issued the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] a deadline of September 30, 2015 to accomplish a "safe integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/reauthorization/media/PLAW-112publ95%5b1%5d.pdf |title=FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 |date=14 February 2012 |website= FAA.gov |accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016 commercial use of UAV technology was legalized by the United States Congress.&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/29/faas-new-drone-laws-go-into-effect-monday-allowing-us-companies-to-innovate.html|title=FAA's new drone laws go into effect Monday, allowing US companies to innovate |last1= Chandran |first1=Nyshka |date= 29 August 2016|website= CNBC.com |accessdate= 23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the [[US Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] granted Amazon permission to begin U.S. testing of a prototype under a waiver to the then regulations. Amazon reported that the vehicle cleared for use was obsolete. In April 2015, the FAA allowed Amazon to begin testing current models. In the interim, Amazon had begun testing at a Canadian site close to the United States border.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gizmag.com/amazon-new-delivery-drones-us-faa-approval/36957/ |title = Amazon to begin testing new delivery drones in the US|last = Lavars|first = Nick|date = April 12, 2015|work = Gizmag|access-date = April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current U.S. regulations required drones fly no higher than 400&amp;nbsp;ft (122 m), no faster than 100&amp;nbsp;mph (161&amp;nbsp;km/h), and remain within the pilot's line of sight. Amazon has stated it intends to move towards operating above 200&amp;nbsp;ft (61 m) and beneath 500&amp;nbsp;ft (152 m), with 500&amp;nbsp;ft. Amazon has stated it plans to fly drones weighing an up to 55&amp;nbsp;lb (25&amp;nbsp;kg) within a 10&amp;nbsp;mi (16&amp;nbsp;km) radius of its warehouses, at speeds of up to 50&amp;nbsp;mph (80.5&amp;nbsp;km/h) with packages weighing up to 5&amp;nbsp;lb (2.26&amp;nbsp;kg) in tow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Delivery deployment development ===
Amazon has patented a beehive-like structure to house delivery drones in cities, allowing Amazon to move from large single-story warehouses that temporarily store packages before they are shipped.&lt;ref name="Beehive"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/26/amazon-drones-delivery-beehive-patent|title =Amazon patents beehive-like structure to house delivery drones in cities|author = Sam Levin|date = 26 June 2016|work= The Guardian|accessdate = 23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulfillment centres designed to accommodate drone deliveries and operations within a certain radius, are currently required. This was announced in a video released by Amazon.&lt;ref name="amazon"/&gt; On December 15, 2016, Amazon began its first publicly available trial of Amazon Prime Air to those within several miles of Amazon's depot in [[Cambridge]], [[England]].

===First deliveries===
On December 7, 2016, Amazon successfully delivered a Prime Air parcel to [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. Amazon had built a Prime Air fulfillment center in the Cambridge area. Amazon posted a video on their official [[YouTube]] channel, on December 14, 2016 of the delivery.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{Citation|last=amazon|title=Amazon Prime Air’s First Customer Delivery|date=2016-12-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNySOrI2Ny8|accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet connection and information storage ===
Amazon Prime Air drones will be connected to the internet to allow for flight control management, and communication between drones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Mac |first=Ryan |date=28 July 2015 |title=Amazon Proposes Drone Highway As It Readies For Flying Package Delivery| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/07/28/amazon-proposes-drone-highway-as-it-readies-for-flying-package-delivery/#318fb6f564a3|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported by Brookings that Amazon's data collection usage from drones has not been disclosed.&lt;ref name="Singer, Peter W. 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Singer |first=Peter W. |date=8 March 2013 |title= The Predator Comes Home: A Primer on Domestic Drones, their Huge Business Opportunities, and their Deep Political, Moral, and Legal Challenges|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/03/08-drones-singer| website=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pittsburgh Journal of Technology Law and Policy, have reported  proposed data collection from Amazon Prime Air drones as including; automated object detection, GPS surveillance, gigapixel cameras, and enhanced image resolution.&lt;ref name="Schlag, Chris 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlag|first1=Chris|title=The New Privacy Battle: How the Expanding Use of Drones Continues to Erode Our Concept of Privacy and Privacy Rights|journal=Pittsburgh Journal of Technology Law and Policy|date=30 May 2013|volume=13|issue=2|doi=10.5195/tlp.2013.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self Driving Cars ===

[[Autonomous vehicle]]s also fall under the Prime Air division's responsibility.  There is little news about this potential direction, which would seem to make great sense for Amazon, since the last mile of delivery is the most expensive, and human drivers are the primary cost; but there is little news about this since an article about an Amazon patent for reversible lanes.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/18/amazon-self-driving-patent-autonomous-vehicle-plans-reversible-lanes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specification ==

Automatic bug fixing is made according to a specification of the expected behavior which can be for instance a [[formal specification]] or a [[test suite]].&lt;ref name="genprog2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Software Engineering|last1=Weimer|first1=Westley|last2=Nguyen|first2=ThanhVu|last3=Le Goues|first3=Claire|last4=Forrest|first4=Stephanie|date=2009|publisher=IEEE|isbn=978-1-4244-3453-4|pages=364–374|chapter=Automatically finding patches using genetic programming|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.8995|doi=10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test-suite – the input/output pairs specify the functionality of the program, possibly captured in [[Assertion (software development)|assertions]] can be used as a [[test oracle]] to drive the search. This oracle can in fact be divided between the ''bug oracle'' that exposes the faulty behavior, and the ''regression oracle'', which encapsulates the functionality any program repair method must preserve. Note that a test suite is typically incomplete and does not cover all possible cases. Therefore, it is often possible for a validated patch to produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite but incorrect outputs for other inputs.&lt;ref name="kali"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 2015 International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis|last1=Qi|first1=Zichao|last2=Long|first2=Fan|last3=Achour|first3=Sara|last4=Rinard|first4=Martin|date=2015|publisher=ACM|isbn=978-1-4503-3620-8|chapter=An Anlysis of Patch Plausibility and Correctness for Generate-and-Validate Patch Generation Systems|citeseerx=10.1.1.696.5616|doi=10.1145/2771783.2771791}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of such validated but incorrect patches is a major challenge for generate-and-validate techniques.&lt;ref name="kali" /&gt; Recent successful automatic bug-fixing techniques often rely on additional information other than the test suite, such as information learned from previous human patches, to further identify correct patches among validated patches.&lt;ref name="prophet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 43rd Annual ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages|last1=Long|first1=Fan|last2=Rinard|first2=Martin|date=2016|publisher=ACM|isbn=978-1-4503-3549-2|pages=298–312|chapter=Automatic patch generation by learning correct code|doi=10.1145/2837614.2837617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to specify the expected behavior is to use [[formal specification]]s &lt;ref name="autofixe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pei|first1=Yu|last2=Furia|first2=Carlo A.|last3=Nordio|first3=Martin|last4=Wei|first4=Yi|last5=Meyer|first5=Bertrand|last6=Zeller|first6=Andreas|date=May 2014|title=Automated Fixing of Programs with Contracts|journal=IEEE Trans. Softw. Eng.|volume=40|issue=5|pages=427–449|arxiv=1403.1117|doi=10.1109/TSE.2014.2312918|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contract-based Data Structure Repair Using Alloy|citeseerx=10.1.1.182.4390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verification against full specifications that specify the whole program behavior including functionalities is less common because such specifications are typically not available in practice and the computation cost of such verification is prohibitive. For specific classes of errors, however, implicit partial specifications are often available. For example, there are targeted bug-fixing techniques validating that the patched program can no longer trigger overflow errors in the same execution path.&lt;ref name="codephage" /&gt;

== Generate-and-validate techniques ==

Generate-and-validate approaches compile and test each candidate patch to collect all validated patches that produce expected outputs for all inputs in the test suite.&lt;ref name="genprog2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kali" /&gt; Such a technique typically starts with a test suite of the program, i.e., a set of [[test cases]], at least one of which exposes the bug.&lt;ref name="genprog2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prophet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rsrepair"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Qi |first1=Yuhua |last2=Mao |first2=Xiaoguang |last3=Lei |first3=Yan |last4=Dai |first4=Ziying |last5=Wang |first5=Chengsong |date=2014 |chapter=The Strength of Random Search on Automated Program Repair |title=Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering |series=ICSE 2014 |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=ACM |pages=254–265 |isbn=978-1-4503-2756-5 |doi=10.1145/2568225.2568254 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spr"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Long |first1=Fan |last2=Rinard |first2=Martin |date=2015 |chapter=Staged Program Repair with Condition Synthesis |title=Proceedings of the 2015 10th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering |series=ESEC/FSE 2015 |location=Bergamo, Italy |publisher=ACM |pages=166–178 |isbn=978-1-4503-3675-8 |doi=10.1145/2786805.2786811 |ref=harv|citeseerx=10.1.1.696.9059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early generate-and-validate bug-fixing systems is GenProg&lt;ref name="genprog2009" /&gt;. The effectiveness of generate-and-validate techniques remains controversial, because they typically do not provide [[#Limitations of automatic bug-fixing|patch correctness guarantees]].&lt;ref name="kali" /&gt;&lt;ref name="criticalreview"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering|last=Monperrus|first=Martin|date=2014|publisher=ACM|isbn=978-1-4503-2756-5|series=ICSE 2014|location=New York, New York|pages=234–242|chapter=A Critical Review of "Automatic Patch Generation Learned from Human-written Patches": Essay on the Problem Statement and the Evaluation of Automatic Software Repair|arxiv=1408.2103|doi=10.1145/2568225.2568324|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the reported results of recent state-of-the-art techniques are generally promising. For example, on systematically collected 69 real world bugs in eight large C software programs, the state-of-the-art bug-fixing system Prophet generates correct patches for 18 out of the 69 bugs.&lt;ref name="prophet" /&gt;

One way to generate candidate patches is to apply [[program mutation|mutation operators]] on the original program. Mutation operators manipulate the original program, potentially via its [[abstract syntax tree]] representation, or a more coarse-grained representation such as operating at the [[Statement (programming)|statement]]-level or [[Block (programming)|block]]-level. Earlier [[Genetic improvement (computer science)|genetic improvement]] approaches operate at the statement level and carry out simple delete/replace operations such as deleting an existing statement or replacing an existing statement with another statement in the same source file.&lt;ref name=genprog2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="genprog2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=2012 34th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)|last1=Le Goues|first1=Claire|last2=Dewey-Vogt|first2=Michael|last3=Forrest|first3=Stephanie|last4=Weimer|first4=Westley|date=2012|publisher=IEEE|isbn=978-1-4673-1067-3|pages=3–13|chapter=A Systematic Study of Automated Program Repair: Fixing 55 out of 105 Bugs for $8 Each|citeseerx=10.1.1.661.9690|doi=10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent  approaches use more fine-grained operators at the [[abstract syntax tree]] level to generate more diverse set of candidate patches.&lt;ref name=prophet /&gt;&lt;ref name=spr /&gt;

Many generate-and-validate techniques rely on the redundancy insight: the code of the patch can be found elsewhere in the application. This idea was introduced in the Genprog system, where two operators, addition and replacement of AST nodes, were based on code taken from elsewhere (i.e. adding an existing AST node). This idea has been validated empirically, with two independent studies that have shown that a significant proportion of commits (3%-17%) are composed of existing code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi = 10.1145/2591062.2591114|chapter = Do the fix ingredients already exist?

Using fix templates is an alternative way to generate candidate patches. Fix templates are typically predefined program mutation rules for fixing specific classes of bugs.&lt;ref name=par /&gt; Examples of fix templates include inserting a [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional statement]] to check whether the value of a variable is null to fix null pointer exception, and changing an integer constant by one to fix off-by-one errors.&lt;ref name="par" /&gt; Fix templates are therefore often adopted by targeted techniques.&lt;ref name="leakfix" /&gt; It is also possible to automatically mine fix templates for generate-and-validate approches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Martinez|first=Matias|title=Ultra-Large Repair Search Space with Automatically Mined Templates: The Cardumen Mode of Astor|date=2018|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-99241-9_3|work=Search-Based Software Engineering|pages=65–86|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99241-9_3|isbn=9783319992402|access-date=2018-10-20|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other techniques ==

Repair techniques exist that are based on symbolic execution. For example, Semfix&lt;ref name="semfix"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Software Engineering|last1=Nguyen|first1=Hoang Duong Thien|last2=Qi|first2=Dawei|last3=Roychoudhury|first3=Abhik|last4=Chandra|first4=Satish|date=2013|publisher=IEEE Press|isbn=978-1-4673-3076-3|series=ICSE '13'|location=San Francisco, California|pages=772–781|chapter=SemFix: Program Repair via Semantic Analysis|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses symbolic execution to extract a repair constraint. Angelix&lt;ref name="angelix"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE 2016, Austin, Texas, May 14-22, 2016|last1=Mechtaev|first1=Sergey|last2=Yi|first2=Jooyong|last3=Roychoudhury|first3=Abhik|date=2016|pages=691–701|chapter=Angelix: scalable multiline program patch synthesis via symbolic analysis|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of angelic forest in order to deal with multiline patches.

&lt;!-- repair and synthesis --&gt;
Under certain assumptions, it is possible to state the repair problem as a synthesis problem.

Such techniques often use empirical fix templates to fix bugs in the targeted scope. For example, insert a [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional statement]] to check whether the value of a variable is null&lt;ref name="par" /&gt; or insert missing memory deallocation statements.&lt;ref name="leakfix" /&gt; Comparing to generate-and-validate techniques, targeted techniques tend to have better bug-fixing accuracy but a much narrowed scope.&lt;ref name="kali" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leakfix" /&gt;

[[Machine learning]] techniques can improve the effectiveness of automatic bug-fixing systems.&lt;ref name="prophet" /&gt; One example of such techniques learns from past successful patches from human developers collected from [[open-source software|open source]] [[software repository|repositories]] in [[GitHub]] and [[SourceForge]].&lt;ref name="prophet" /&gt; It then use the learned information to recognize and prioritize potentially correct patches among all generated candidate patches.&lt;ref name="prophet" /&gt; Alternatively, patches can be directly mined from existing sources. Example approaches include mining patches from donor applications&lt;ref name="codephage" /&gt; or from QA web sites.&lt;ref name="QAFix" /&gt;

== Usages ==

There are multiple usages of automatic bug fixing:
* in the development environment: when the developer encounters a bug, she activates a feature to search for a patch (for instance by clicking on a button). This search can even happen in the background, when the IDE proactively searches for solutions to potential problems, without waiting for a developer explicit action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muşlu |first1=Kıvanç |last2=Brun |first2=Yuriy |last3=Holmes |first3=Reid |last4=Ernst |first4=Michael D. |last5=Notkin |first5=David |last6=Muşlu |first6=Kıvanç |last7=Brun |first7=Yuriy |last8=Holmes |first8=Reid |last9=Ernst |first9=Michael D. |last10=Notkin |first10=David |title=Speculative analysis of integrated development environment recommendations, Speculative analysis of integrated development environment recommendations |journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices |date=19 October 2012 |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=669, 669–682, 682 |doi=10.1145/2384616.2384665 |issn=0362-1340}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* in the continuous integration server: when a build fails during continuous, a patch search can be attempted as soon as the build has failed. If the search is successful, the patch is given to the developer before she has started working on it, or before she has found the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Urli |first1=Simon |last2=Yu |first2=Zhongxing |last3=Seinturier |first3=Lionel |last4=Monperrus |first4=Martin |title=How to design a program repair bot?: insights from the repairnator project |date=27 May 2018 |pages=95–104 |doi=10.1145/3183519.3183540 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01691496/document}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* at runtime: when a failure happens at runtime, a binary patch can be searched for and [[Self-modifying code|applied online]]. An example of such a repair system is ClearView&lt;ref name=clearview /&gt;, which does repair on x86 code, with x86 binary patches. The Itzal system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Durieux |first1=Thomas |last2=Hamadi |first2=Youssef |last3=Monperrus |first3=Martin |title=Production-driven patch generation |journal=2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Technologies Results Track (ICSE-NIER) |date=May 2017 |doi=10.1109/icse-nier.2017.8 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01463689/document}}&lt;/ref&gt; is different from Clearview: while the repair search happens at runtime, in production, the produced patches are at the source code level. 

== Search space ==

In essence, automatic bug fixing is a search activity, whether deductive-based or heuristic-based. The search space of automatic bug fixing is composed of all edits that can be possibly made to a program. There have been studies to understand the structure of this search space. Qi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qi|first=Yuhua|last2=Mao|first2=Xiaoguang|last3=Lei|first3=Yan|last4=Dai|first4=Ziying|last5=Wang|first5=Chengsong|date=2014-05-31|title=The strength of random search on automated program repair|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2568225.2568254|publisher=ACM|pages=254–265|doi=10.1145/2568225.2568254|isbn=9781450327565}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the original fitness function of Genprog is not better than random search to drive the search. Martinez et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Matias|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|date=2013-11-28|title=Mining software repair models for reasoning on the search space of automated program fixing|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00903808/document|journal=Empirical Software Engineering|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=176–205|doi=10.1007/s10664-013-9282-8|issn=1382-3256|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the imbalance between possible repair actions, showing its significant impact on the search. Long et al.'s&lt;ref name="spaceanalysis" /&gt; study indicated that correct patches can be considered as sparse in the search space and that incorrect overfitting patches are vastly more abundant (see also discussion about overfitting below).

== Limitations of automatic bug-fixing ==

Automatic bug-fixing techniques that rely on a test suite do not provide patch correctness guarantees, because the test suite is incomplete and does not cover all cases.&lt;ref name="kali" /&gt; A weak test suite may cause generate-and-validate techniques to produce validated but incorrect patches that have negative effects such as eliminating desirable functionalities, causing memory leaks, and introducing security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="kali" /&gt; 

Sometimes, in test-suite based program repair, tools generate patches that pass the test suite, yet are actually incorrect, this is known as the "overfitting" problem.&lt;ref name=overfitting&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Edward K. |last2=Barr |first2=Earl T. |last3=Le Goues |first3=Claire |last4=Brun |first4=Yuriy |date=2015 |chapter=Is the Cure Worse Than the Disease? Overfitting in Automated Program Repair |title=Proceedings of the 2015 10th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering |series=ESEC/FSE 2015 |location=New York, New York |publisher=ACM |pages=532–543 |isbn=978-1-4503-3675-8 |doi=10.1145/2786805.2786825 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Overfitting" in this context refers to the fact that the patch overfits to the test inputs. There are different kinds of overfitting&lt;ref name="Yu2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Zhongxing|last2=Martinez|first2=Matias|last3=Danglot|first3=Benjamin|last4=Durieux|first4=Thomas|last5=Monperrus|first5=Martin|title=Alleviating patch overfitting with automatic test generation: a study of feasibility and effectiveness for the Nopol repair system|journal=Empirical Software Engineering|year=2018|issn=1382-3256|doi=10.1007/s10664-018-9619-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;: incomplete fixing means that only some buggy inputs are fixed, regression introduction means some previously working features are broken after the patch (because they were poorly tested). Early prototypes for automatic repair suffered a lot from overfitting: on the Manybugs C benchmark, Qi et al. &lt;ref name="kali" /&gt; reported that 104/110 of plausible GenProg patches were overfitting; on the Defects4J Java benchmark, Martinez et al. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Matias|last2=Durieux|first2=Thomas|last3=Sommerard|first3=Romain|last4=Xuan|first4=Jifeng|last5=Monperrus|first5=Martin|date=2016-10-25|title=Automatic repair of real bugs in java: a large-scale experiment on the defects4j dataset|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01387556/document|journal=Empirical Software Engineering|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=1936–1964|doi=10.1007/s10664-016-9470-4|issn=1382-3256|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that 73/84 plausible patches as overfitting. In the context of synthesis-based repair, Le et al. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Le|first=Xuan Bach D.|last2=Thung|first2=Ferdian|last3=Lo|first3=David|last4=Goues|first4=Claire Le|date=2018-03-02|title=Overfitting in semantics-based automated program repair|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10664-017-9577-2|journal=Empirical Software Engineering|language=en|volume=23|issue=5|pages=3007–3033|doi=10.1007/s10664-017-9577-2|issn=1382-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained more than 80% of overfitting patches.  

Another limitation of generate-and-validate systems is the search space explosion.&lt;ref name=spaceanalysis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Long |first1=Fan |last2=Rinard |first2=Martin |date=2016 |chapter=An Analysis of the Search Spaces for Generate and Validate Patch Generation Systems |title=Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering |series=ICSE '16 |location=New York, New York |publisher=ACM |pages=702–713 |isbn=978-1-4503-3900-1 |doi=10.1145/2884781.2884872 |ref=harv|hdl=1721.1/113656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a program, there are a large number of statements to change and for each statement there are a large number of possible modifications. State-of-the-art systems address this problem by assuming that a small modification is enough for fixing a bug, resulting in a search space reduction.

The limitation of approaches based on symbolic analysis&lt;ref name="semfix" /&gt;&lt;ref name="angelix" /&gt; is that real world programs are often converted to intractably large formulas especially for modifying statements with [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]].

== Example tools ==

Automatic bug-fixing is an active research topic in computer science. There are many implementations of various bug-fixing techniques especially for C and Java programs. Note that most of these implementations are research prototypes for demonstrating their techniques, i.e., it is unclear whether their current implementations are ready for industrial usage or not.

GenProg&lt;ref name=genprog2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=genprog2012 /&gt; and ClearView&lt;ref name="clearview"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the ACM SIGOPS 22nd symposium on Operating systems principles|last1=Perkins|first1=Jeff H.|date=2009|publisher=ACM|isbn=978-1-60558-752-3|pages=87–102|chapter=Automatically patching errors in deployed software|citeseerx=10.1.1.157.5877|doi=10.1145/1629575.1629585|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two earliest generate-and-validate bug-fixing tools published at 2009. The benchmark collected by GenProg authors contains 69 real world defects and it is widely used to evaluate many other bug-fixing tools in C as well.&lt;ref name=genprog2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=prophet /&gt;&lt;ref name=spr /&gt;&lt;ref name=angelix /&gt; The state-of-the-art tool evaluated on GenProg benchmark is Prophet,&lt;ref name=prophet /&gt; generating correct patches for 18 out of 69 defects.

=== Tools for C ===

* ClearView:&lt;ref name=clearview /&gt; A generate-and-validate tool of generating binary patches for deployed systems. It is evaluated on 10 security vulnerability cases. A later study shows that it generates correct patches for at least 4 of the 10 cases.&lt;ref name=kali /&gt;
* GenProg:&lt;ref name=genprog2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=genprog2012 /&gt; A genetic improvement generate-and-validate bug-fixing tool. It

is evaluated on 105 cases and reported to generate repairs for 55 cases. A
later study shows that only 69 cases out of the 105 evaluated cases correspond
to bugs and correct patches for only 2 cases out of the 69 cases are generated.&lt;ref name=kali /&gt;

* SemFix:&lt;ref name=semfix /&gt; The first solver-based bug-fixing tool for C.

It is evaluated on the same benchmark as GenProg and generate correct patches (i.e., equivalent to human patches) for 18 out of 69 cases.&lt;ref name=prophet /&gt;
* SearchRepair:&lt;ref name=searchrepair /&gt; A tool for replacing buggy code using snippets of code from elsewhere. It is evaluated on the IntroClass benchmark&lt;ref name=introclassmanybugs&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Le Goues |first1=Claire |last2=Holtschulte |first2=Neal |last3=Smith |first3=Edward |last4=Brun |first4=Yuriy |last5=Devanbu |first5=Premkumar |last6=Forrest |first6=Stephanie |last7=Weimer |first7=Westley |date=2015 |title= The Many ''Bugs'' and Intro ''Class'' Benchmarks for Automated Repair of C Programs|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=1236–1256 |doi=10.1109/TSE.2015.2454513 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generates much higher quality patches on that benchmark than GenProg, RSRepair, and AE.

'''Bankgiro''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[giro|giro system]] used by all [[bank]]s in the country, managed by [[Bankenes Betalingssentral]] (BBS). The system allows arbitrary transactions between private accounts in all Norwegian accounts using [[Norwegian krone]]. It is optimised for [[online banking]], though it is also available via the [[mail|post]] ([[Brevgiro]]), using a [[telephone]] ([[Telegiro]]) or based on automation, including the services Avtalegiro, [[Autogiro (banking)|Autogiro]] and [[eFaktura]].

The system dates back to 1973 when the [[commercial bank]]s and the [[sparebank|saving banks]] created a common system that could compete with the [[Postgiro]] system used by the postal bank, [[Postbanken]]. Use of Bankgiro was free until 1985. In the late 1990s, Postgiro was bought out by BBS and Postbanken went over to using Bankgiro.

== Transformation ==
In electrical and electronic engineering, transformation from time domain to another domain such as frequency domain is used to focus more on details of the waveform. Many of the details can be analyzed much easier when this transformation is done to waveform, when it goes to another domain. Different methods are present to do transformation from time domain to frequency domain; one of them is the '''Blackman–Tukey transformation''' method that also uses [[Fast Fourier transform]]. To meet the filter specification according to requirements, several methods are used, including windowing effect.

==Statistical estimation==
Statically estimation is to determine the expected value(s) of statistical expected values of statistical quantities. Statistical estimation also tries to find the [[expected values]]. The expected values are those values that we expect among the random values, derived from samples of population in probability (group of subset). Because we have problem here, and in time series analysis, discrete data obtained as a function of time is usually available rather than samples of population or group of subsets taken simultaneously. The difficulty is commonly avoided by the process which is named [[ergodic]] process, that changes with time and probability gets involved with it, and it's not always [[Frequencies|periodic]] at all portions of time.

== Blackman–Tukey transformation methods ==
This method has some procedures such as:
# Calculation of the [[autocorrelation]] function of the data
# Applying a suitable [[window function]], and finally
# Computing a FFT of the data for obtaining the power density spectrum.

Autocorrelation function makes the wave smoothed rather than the averaging several waveforms. This function is set to window, the corresponding waveform toward its extremes.
Computation gets faster if more data is correlated and if memory capacity of the system increases then overlap save sectioning technique would be applied. If the autocorrelation function in Blackman–Tukey is computed using FFT then it will name fast correlation method for spectral estimation.

The '''British Rail flying saucer''', officially known simply as ''space vehicle'', was a proposed [[spacecraft]] designed by [[Charles Osmond Frederick]].

== Purpose ==

The flying saucer originally started as a proposal for a lifting platform. However, the project was revised and edited, and by the time the patent was filed had become a large passenger craft for [[interplanetary travel]].&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news | author=Alan Hamilton |newspaper=The Times |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2083429,00.html |title=The next service to arrive at platform twelve will be... a flying saucer |date=13 March 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-17 |location=London}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

The craft was to be powered by [[nuclear fusion]], using [[laser]] beams to produce pulses of nuclear energy in a generator in the centre of the craft, at a rate of over 1000 [[Hertz|Hz]] to prevent [[resonance]], which could damage the vehicle. The pulses of energy would then have been transferred out of a nozzle into a series of radial [[electrode]]s running along the underside of the craft, which would have converted the energy into electricity that would then pass into a ring of powerful [[electromagnet]]s (the patent describes using [[superconductor]]s if possible). These magnets would accelerate [[subatomic particle]]s emitted by the fusion reaction, providing [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[thrust]].&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;{{Patent | GB | 1310990 | British Railways Board: "Space vehicle"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This general design was used in several [[fusion rocket]] studies.

A layer of thick metal running above the fusion reactor would have acted as a shield to protect the passengers above from the [[radiation]] emitted from the core of the reactor. The entire vehicle would be piloted in such a way that the [[acceleration]] and deceleration of the craft would have simulated [[gravity]] in [[zero gravity]] conditions.&lt;ref name="Patent"/&gt;

A [[patent]] application was filed by Jensen and Son on behalf of [[British Rail]] on 11 December 1970 and granted on 21 March 1973.&lt;ref name="Patent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4801928.stm | title=British Rail flying saucer plan | date= 13 March 2006 |work=BBC News |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1729579,00.html | title=The next saucer to Shoeburyness leaves from platform 5 |date= 13 March 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2007-03-17 |location=London |first=Alok |last=Jha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patent lapsed in 1976 due to non-payment of renewal fees.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

== Media attention ==

The patent first came to the attention of the media when it was featured in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 31 May 1978, in a story by [[Adrian Hope]] of the ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine.  There was a further mention in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' on 11 July 1982, during the [[silly season]]. ''The Railway Magazine'' mentioned it in its May 1996 issue, saying that the passengers would have been "fried" anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=The Railway Magazine | date=May 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the patent was rediscovered in 2006, it gained widespread publicity in the British press.  A group of [[nuclear science|nuclear scientists]] examined the designs and declared them to be unworkable, expensive and very inefficient. [[Michel van Baal]] of the [[European Space Agency]] claimed "I have had a look at the plans, and they don't look very serious to me at all", adding that many of the technologies used in the craft, such as [[nuclear fusion]] and high temperature [[superconductor]]s, had not yet been discovered,&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; while [[Colin Pillinger]], the scientist in charge of the [[Beagle 2]] probe, was quoted as saying "If I hadn't seen the documents I wouldn't have believed it".&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

==Cast==
{{Main|List of Chicago P.D. characters}}

===Main===
* [[Jason Beghe]] as [[Hank Voight|Sergeant Henry "Hank" Voight]], the enigmatic and often mercurial chief of the Chicago P.D.'s Intelligence Unit. Despite his brusque, tough exterior and take-no-prisoners approach to police work, he is loyal to the cops and detectives serving under him and highly dedicated to the victims of the crimes his unit investigates. He is first introduced in ''[[Chicago Fire (season 1)|Chicago Fire]]'' as a dirty cop who clashes with [[Chicago Fire Department|CFD]] [[Matthew Casey|Lt. Matthew Casey]] after Voight's son Justin causes an accident in which a teenager is paralyzed, and Casey, who was first on scene, had intended to testify that Justin was [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]. He was arrested by Det. Antonio Dawson for trying to have Casey silenced by force, but was later released from prison and reinstated to the police force by Internal Affairs. As a result, many of Casey's colleagues disliked him and Casey's superior Chief Boden has a love-hate working relationship with him. It is eventually revealed in the ''Chicago Fire'' episode "[[Chicago Fire (season 1)#ep23|Let Her Go]]" that his dirty cop alter ego was part of an undercover operation to catch criminals and other dirty cops. Prior to taking command of Intelligence, Voight worked in the Gang Unit. His father Richard was a former CPD officer who was killed in the line of duty. Voight is a widower; his wife, Camille, died of cancer some years prior. His son, Justin, served in the [[United States Army|Army]] and was killed in the last episode of season 3 while trying to help a friend. Hank took an interest in Erin Lindsay at 15 and raised her as his daughter.
* [[Jon Seda]] as [[Antonio Dawson|Senior Detective Antonio Dawson]],&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="credits"&gt;Seda left the series in the eighth episode of the fourth season, however his character will be returning full-time in the fifth season.&lt;/ref&gt; an Intelligence Unit detective who previously arrested Voight for harassment and now works alongside him. Unlike Voight, he has limits on how far he will go to get criminals off the streets, as shown by the fact that he asked Halstead to stop Voight from killing anyone while on the hunt for Pulpo, as he did not want it on his conscience. He and his ex-wife Laura have two children: Diego and Eva. His younger sister is paramedic [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Gabriela Dawson|Gabriela Dawson]]. In season 4 he is offered a job at the State's Attorney's Office as Lead Investigator, which he accepts. After becoming disillusioned with the job, he returns to the unit in the first episode of season 5.
* [[Sophia Bush]] as [[Erin Lindsay|Detective Erin Lindsay]] (seasons 1–4),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sophia Bush Leaving Chicago PD After 4 Seasons|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/857200/sophia-bush-leaving-chicago-pd-after-4-seasons|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tough Intelligence Unit detective and former [[confidential informant|CI]] whom Voight took under his wing when she was a juvenile delinquent. Because of this, she is closer with Voight than the other members of the unit. She has a half-brother, Teddy Courtney, who was taken by a pedophilia ring at age thirteen and was found turning tricks in New York City 10 years later. She was in a relationship with her partner Jay Halstead from seasons 2 to 4. She is accused of assault after she sticks her gun down a pedophile's throat in the interrogation room; facing possible dismissal from the union, she accepts a job offer at the FBI in New York and leaves Chicago.
* [[Jesse Lee Soffer]] as [[Jay Halstead|Detective Jay Halstead]], a brash Intelligence Unit detective who is Detective Lindsay's partner. A former [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Ranger]], he is confident in his abilities and sometimes comes across as cocky. He also suffers from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], shown progressively during Season 5, later seeking therapy for it. His brother is Dr. Will Halstead, who is a main character in ''[[Chicago Med]]''. He was in a relationship with his partner Erin Lindsay from season 2 until she was written out of the show at the end of season 4.
* [[Patrick Flueger|Patrick John Flueger]] as [[Adam Ruzek|Officer Adam Ruzek]], a younger police officer recruited straight out of the academy by Olinsky to do undercover work. He is often portrayed as an overeager amateur who dives head-first into a situation without thinking. His parents are separated and he split time between his father "Disco Bob" Ruzek ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]), a longtime patrol officer with the 26th District, who lives in [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]], and his mom in [[New City, Chicago#Canaryville|Canaryville]]. He was engaged to fellow police officer Kim Burgess.
* [[Marina Squerciati]] as [[Kim Burgess|Officer Kim Burgess]], a former flight attendant-turned-uniformed patrol officer who was Atwater's partner. She was then partnered with Sean Roman before his departure.  Burgess is shot in "Called in Dead" and spends the next episode recovering. She was engaged to Adam Ruzek; the relationship was later broken off due to commitment issues. She later developed feelings for Roman before he moved to San Diego. In season 4 she is offered a job in Intelligence, which she accepts.
* [[LaRoyce Hawkins]] as [[Kevin Atwater|Officer Kevin Atwater]], a uniformed patrol officer who was Burgess' former partner until he was promoted to join the Intelligence Unit.
* [[Archie Kao]] as [[Sheldon Jin|Detective Sheldon Jin]] (season 1), a tech and surveillance expert. He was discovered to be a reluctant mole working for Internal Affairs sergeant Edwin Stillwell, who has leverage to make him cooperate. He was found murdered in the first-season finale episode "A Beautiful Friendship".
* [[Elias Koteas]] as [[Alvin Olinsky|Detective Alvin Olinsky]] (seasons 1–5), a veteran undercover officer and a friend of Voight's who previously worked alongside Voight in the Gang Unit. Before joining the force, Olinsky served in the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team]] stationed in Vicenza, Italy. Olinsky mentions in "Called in Dead" that he has 8 confirmed kills in the line of duty. At the end of the fifth season, Olinsky is arrested for the murder of Kevin Bingham, the man who murdered Voight's son Justin, and is later stabbed to death via a hit in prison while awaiting trial.
* [[Amy Morton]] as [[Trudy Platt|Desk Sergeant Trudy Platt]] (season 2–present; recurring, season 1), a sarcastic desk sergeant of District 21, and the immediate superior of the district's patrol officers. Before taking a desk job she was a uniformed patrol officer, and worked with Det. Dawson. She twice passed the detective's exam. Sergeant Platt is also a recurring character on ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' as she is the wife of CFD firefighter [[List of Chicago Fire characters#Randy "Mouch" McHolland|Randy "Mouch" McHolland]].
* [[Brian Geraghty]] as [[Sean Roman|Officer Sean Roman]] (seasons 2–3), a brash patrol officer who partners with Burgess after transferring to the 2-1 from District 31. He transferred out because of his relationship with, Jenn Cassidy ([[Spencer Grammer]]), who is now a K-9 officer, to avoid breaking [[fraternization]] rules. He has his own private security company on the side. After being wounded in the line of duty, and with the department feeling he would unable to return to patrol, he resigns and decides to join the San Diego Police Department.
* [[Tracy Spiridakos]] as Detective Hailey Upton (season 5–present; recurring, season 4&lt;!--consensus has been determined at [[ Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard/Archive_157#Chicago_P.D._.28TV_series.29]] to list Spiridakos as recurring during season 4 please do not change.--&gt;), a tough former Homicide detective and Erin Lindsay's replacement following her departure to New York.

===Reviews===
Since its premiere, ''Chicago P.D.'' has received mixed reviews from critics. [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the drama a 50% rating based on 21 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.metacritic.com/tv/chicago-pd |title=Chicago P.D. : Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotten Tomatoes gives season 1 a rating of 57% based on reviews from 28 critics.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/chicago_pd/s01/ |title=Chicago P.D.: Season 1 – TV Reviews – Rotten Tomatoes|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray Rahman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the drama a favorable review: "It's hard to imagine the series capturing the compelling, can't-watch-just-one magic that makes the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise so marathonable, but it moves just fast enough to keep you from changing the channel in search of an SVU re-run."&lt;ref name="rahman"&gt;http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20773510,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alessandra Stanley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also gave the series a positive review when it premiered on January 8: "''Chicago P.D.'' is, in many ways, a throwback to an earlier, male-dominated era of crime shows, yet it carves out room for strong female characters who are good at their jobs and taken seriously by their colleagues."&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/arts/television/killer-women-and-chicago-pd-debut-this-week.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics expressed their disappointment in the police drama such as Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'': "When did Wolf's work, which used to show some grace and wit, become this ugly, plodding and crass?"&lt;ref name="bianco"&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/01/07/chicago-pd-review/4358131/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1815">A '''color-tagged structure''' is a structure in the [[United States]] which has been classified by a color to represent the severity of damage or the overall condition of the building. The exact definition for each color may be different at local levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waco-texas.com/code-enforcement.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

A &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;"red-tagged"&lt;/span&gt; structure has been severely damaged to the degree that the structure is too dangerous to inhabit. Similarly, a structure is &lt;span style="color:#FFCC00"&gt;"yellow-tagged"&lt;/span&gt; if it has been moderately damaged to the degree that its habitability is limited (only during the day, for example). A &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;"green-tagged"&lt;/span&gt; structure may mean the building is either undamaged or has suffered slight damage, although differences exist at local levels when to use a green tag.

Tagging is performed by government [[building officials]], or, occasionally during disasters, by engineers deputized by the building official. [[Natural disaster]]s such as [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s and [[mudslide]]s are among the most common causes of a building being red-, yellow- or green-tagged. Usually, after such incidents, the [[local government]] body responsible for enforcing the building safety code examines the affected structures and tags them as appropriate.

In some areas of the United States, buildings are marked with a rectangular sign that is red with a white border and a white "X".  Such signs provide the same information as "red-tagging" a building. Tagging structures in these ways can warn [[firefighter]]s and others about hazardous buildings before the buildings are entered.

'''''Components in Electronics''''' is a trade publication for the [[electronics]] [[industry]]. Owned by Specialist Business Media, ''Components in Electronics'' has been in print since 1984.

==History==
''Components In Electronics'' was first launched in 1984; Initially an advertising only publication its publisher, Hannover Press, decided two years later to create a new vehicle with a full editorial content. The team at that time included Tony Worton (publisher) who had formerly worked at electronics titles including ''New Electronics'', along with Alan Fredericks and Sean Stewart (both sales). The title was re-launched in October 1986, with Nick Foot as Editor. One year later, another permanent editor was employed and the same editorial team carried the magazine through to January 1998.

''CIE'' was originally printed on a King Size paper format the shape of a vinyl [[LP record]]. This meant that every page could include a combination of both editorial and advertising. The magazine focused entirely on electronic components, rather than production or test and measurement issues. In style, the editorial content was a mix of technical articles, case studies and new product information.

By the mid-90s the circulation stood at around 20,000 copies were distributed to designers and specifiers. A spin-off and annual Distsribution Directory was published around this time focusing on UK distribution.

In 1998, Jenny Ross, who had worked in a number of important production roles since the launch of the title, assumed the role of publisher. Following on from Ross, Shan Millie became publisher in February 2004 staying until December 2005. Alex McLachlan succeeded Millie taking over the role in December 2005 and remains the current publisher.

In around 2000 Paul Marsh became Editor followed in the early 2000s by Dulcie Elliot.

Late 2006 saw a redesign of the print magazine. The King Size format was replaced by the [[ISO A4]] size.

In September 2007, Neil Tyler took over as Editor followed by Joe Bush in 2014. Amy Wallington became editor in December 2015 and is currently still in the position. 

''CIE'' is a Specialist Business Media publication.

'''Consumer fireworks''' are [[fireworks]] sold to the general public for use.  They are generally weaker in explosive power compared to professional displays.

== Examples ==
Consumer fireworks are often quite small and can be classified into three groups: daytime, nighttime, and novelty fireworks.

=== Daytime fireworks ===
Daytime fireworks include most bottle rockets, smoke balls, firecrackers, and other fireworks that emit very little or no light. Some examples of daytime consumer fireworks include:
*  Bottle Rockets — Launch into the air, sometimes with a high-pitched whistling sound, with a [[Report (noise)|report]] at the end. Some varieties may emit sparks upon launch. Their sizes can range from an inch to about 6 inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) long and 1/8 to 3/4 inches (3–19&amp;nbsp;mm) around, not including the stick. The smaller variety of these rockets are also commonly referred to as "Bottle Rockets" due to the commonality in which people use a bottle as a launching platform.
*  [[Firecracker]] — An explosion occurs on the ground, often in a series.  They range from 1 to 16,000+ on a single string.
*  Smoke ball — Emits colored smoke for a few seconds.  Colors typically include white, green, blue, yellow, orange, fuscia, red and pink.
*  Multiple Rocket Launcher — More commonly known as the "Saturn Missile Battery" typically launches a series of 16 to 800 small rockets (dependent on the firework purchased) with a high-pitched whistle each time, often with a [[Report (noise)|report]].

=== Novelty fireworks ===

Novelty fireworks typically produce a much weaker explosion and sound. In some Countries and areas where fireworks are illegal to use, they still allow these small, low grade fireworks to be used. A few examples include:&lt;ref name="novelty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howtomakefireworks.org/novelty-fireworks/ |title=Novelty Fireworks |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Party Poppers&amp;nbsp;— once a string is pulled to activate the charge, confetti is thrust into the air and produces a [[Report (noise)|report]].
* Snaps&amp;nbsp;— a small paper bag typically filled with gravel and a few milligrams of silver fulminate will produce a [[Report (noise)|report]] when thrown at a hard surface or stepped on.
* Flying Lanterns ([[Sky lantern]])&amp;nbsp;— these paper lanterns float into the sky when lit. They emit a slight glow and are very commonly used at weddings and celebrations.
* Paper Tanks &amp; Vehicles&amp;nbsp;— when lit, these small paper vehicles emit sparks that cause them to move around on the ground and commonly produce a loud bang at the end.
* Party Bombs&amp;nbsp;— a tube filled with toys which, when lit, shoots the toys into the air distributing them around the room. Used in Switzerland (tischbombes).
* Ground Bloom Flowers&amp;nbsp;— a small cylinder that spins on the ground and changes color, spinning in such a way that it resembles a flower. Could be described as a large Jumping Jack.
* Snakes ([[Black snake (firework)|Black snake]])&amp;nbsp;— a small compressed pellet that, when lit, expands into a long snake-like object.

==Use==

===Tools===

Consumer fireworks can be used with a variety of tools. One set of tools has to do with basic [[Flammability|ignition]], such as [[lighters]], [[matches]], and [[Punk (fireworks)|punks]] also known as a 'port fire'. By using a [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714234519/http://www.manmfireworks.com/ rack], one can ignite a series of different fireworks to create a [[scene (fiction)|scene]]. These sometimes allow for the finales seen at professional fireworks displays to be created using consumer fireworks. Racks can be used with multiple types of fireworks, such as aerial shells, fountains, Roman candles, and the newest class of fireworks, 500&amp;nbsp;gram repeaters. Other tools are involved with the setup of fireworks for later display, such as shovels, various hand tools, and spare [[visco fuse]]s. The true scope of tools used with consumer fireworks is limited only by the displayer's [[imagination]].

===Lighting and launching===

There are several ways by which fireworks can be ignited. The most basic of these is simply flame from a [[match]], [[lighter]] or other device that emits flames. Another way to light fireworks is using a device called a punk. A punk is a long, thin piece of wood covered in a substance that burns very slowly, producing only heat, with no flame. A port fire is a smoldering compound as a powder compressed in a stiff paper tube. The most complicated method used to ignite consumer fireworks is to use electronic ignition. This is the preferred method of many professional pyrotechnicians worldwide because of the vast improvement in operator [[safety]]. There are a few electronic ignition (often called "e-fire") systems that use readily available materials.

==Regulations==

Laws regarding consumer fireworks vary between countries and states.

===Europe===
[[Image:Fireworksxyz.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Fireworks on New Year's Eve 2004–2005 in the UK.]]
{{see also|British firework classification}}
In [[Finland]], fireworks (other than novelties and sparklers) are usually sold between Christmas and New Years. It is legal to sell fireworks all year around (predominantly through online retailers). They may only be used on [[New Year's Eve]] from 6pm to 2am the following morning.

In [[Germany]], fireworks are available for purchase from most stores in the 3 days prior to [[New Year's Eve]], allowing families to have their own celebrations in their backyard.

In [[Iceland]], fireworks are sold from December 28–31 and again on January 6.

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the import of consumer fireworks is strictly controlled, and the use of them must be overseen by a professional fireworks operator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_offences/the_law_on_fireworks.html Citizens' Information]&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to considerable smuggling of fireworks from [[Northern Ireland]], where regulations governing the sale of fireworks are more permissive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-means-good-news-for-irish-smugglers/ Politico]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], fireworks (other than category 1) cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 16. They are only sold the last three days up till and including December 31. If one of those days is a Sunday, the sale period is moved to the 28 up till and including 30 December. Fireworks may only be fired between 6pm on New Year's Eve to 2am the following day.

In [[Norway]], fireworks cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18. Class 1, 2 and 3 fireworks are for sale from December 27 to December 31. They may only be fired between 18:00h and 02:00h on New Year's Eve.

In the [[United Kingdom]], fireworks cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18 and are not permitted to be set off between 11pm and 7am. Exceptions are made for [[New Year]], [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] (5 November), the [[Chinese New Year]] and [[Diwali]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2004/20041836.htm Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 1836 The Fireworks Regulations 2004], United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; Fireworks are available from specialist stores year round and their use is also permitted throughout the year within the specified time limits. The sale of Categories 1 (Indoor), 2 (Garden) and 3 (Display) are available to the general public — with Category 4 (Professional) being restricted to permit holders.

In [[Belgium]], fireworks (except category 1) cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 16. Fireworks are available for purchase year round, but may only be used by police permission.

In [[Poland]], fireworks cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18. Fireworks are available for purchase year round, but are primarily sold before New Year's Eve.

===North America===

====Canada====

Fireworks laws vary across province. They make some noise, they sparkle, and according to all the experts, they are dangerous. However, it is legal in Canada to purchase a variety of consumer fireworks like Roman candles and star wheels.

The Western provinces, Such as Alberta and B.C. draw the line when it comes to home explosives.

In [[Alberta]], it varies when it comes Fireworks and Explosives, the province last year considered a province-wide ban on fireworks (though the ban would have given cities wiggle-room to pass laws allowing certain displays).

In [[Calgary]], there’s a total ban, meaning you can’t buy or set off fireworks anywhere, while [[Edmonton]] allows it, but only if you get a permit first.

In [[British Columbia]], Fireworks on the West Coast aren’t even in the discussion for Canada Day, or Victoria Day for that matter.

In the [[Metro Vancouver]], you can buy fireworks in [[Vancouver]], [[Burnaby]], [[West Vancouver]] and [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]], as long as you’re within a week of Halloween (and with a permit), and Canada day, but you’re out of luck in Surrey, Richmond, Langley, and Abbotsford, and much of the lower mainland.

In [[Vancouver]] there is a tradition to light things off on Halloween.

In [[Ontario]], Fireworks are sold around Canada Day and Victoria Day without a permit, and some GTA municipalities now allow fireworks on the Hindu festival of Diwali. In Toronto itself, you might get away with lighting them off on Chinese New Year, and it’s possible to score a permit for other occasions.

In [[Quebec]] St. Jean-Baptiste Day is a major fireworks day, but not necessarily the backyard variety. Fireworks are forbidden year round on the Island of Montreal, though allowed in much of the rest of the province.

In [[Atlantic Canada]], expect [[Prince Edward Island]], All Fireworks are legal a can be used all year round.

====United States====
[[File:Consumer fireworks laws in the USA by state.svg|thumb|400px|A map of consumer fireworks laws in the USA by state.{{Legend-table|lang=en|title=Consumer fireworks laws in the USA by state|#C80000|All consumer fireworks banned|#7DFFFF|Wire sparklers only|#1496FF|Non-aerial fireworks only|#1414FF|All/most consumer fireworks allowed|#009600|Sales to non-residents only|#FF9600|Regulations vary by city/county}}]]
In the [[United States]], the laws governing consumer fireworks vary widely from state to state, or from county to county. It is common for consumers to cross state and county lines in order to purchase types of fireworks which are outlawed in their home-jurisdictions. Fireworks laws in urban areas typically limit sales or use by dates or seasons. Municipalities may have stricter laws than their counties or states do.

The [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] defines what fireworks may be considered consumer fireworks. Consumer fireworks in the United States are limited to 500&amp;nbsp;grams (this was previously 200&amp;nbsp;grams until recent years) of composition, and firecrackers may have up to 50 milligrams of flash powder. Reloadable shells are limited to 1.75" in diameter, and shells in pre-fused tubes are limited to 2". Any fireworks that exceed these limits are not considered consumer fireworks and need an [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] license.

The [[American Pyrotechnics Association]] maintains a [http://www.americanpyro.com/state-law-directory directory of state laws] pertaining to fireworks.

One state &amp;nbsp;— [[Massachusetts]]— bans the sale and use of all consumer fireworks, including novelties and sparklers.

Two states &amp;nbsp;— [[Illinois]] and [[Vermont]] &amp;nbsp;— permits the sale and use of only wire or wood stick sparklers and other novelties.

The following states&amp;nbsp;allow the sale and use of non-aerial and non-explosive fireworks (also called "safe and sane") like novelties, fountains and sparklers, etc.: [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Florida]], [[Idaho]], [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[North Carolina]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and the [[District of Columbia]].

[[Delaware]] Governor [[John Carney (politician)|John Carney]] signed into law a bill on May 20, 2018 allowing sparklers and non-explosive, non-airborne novelty items. The use is allowed only on July 4 and December 31 each year with sales limited to the 30 days preceding their allowed use.&lt;ref&gt;https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?legislationId=25424&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Large fireworks stand for 4th of July.jpg|thumb|left|A fireworks stand in Oregon]]
[[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] signed into law a bill on November 21, 2014 allowing sparklers, party poppers, cone fountains and other novelty items to be sold, possessed, and used in the state of New York outside of New York City. Local governments must approve the sale and use of fireworks before people can legally use them.  Although the use of fireworks is allowed year-round, the sale of fireworks, by registered businesses, is limited to a period of June 1 through July 5 and December 26 through January 2 each year.

[[Michigan]] legislators have passed and enrolled a bill that was signed by Governor [[Rick Snyder]] on December 13, 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277--267415--,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the sale and use of all consumer fireworks, however, sellers must pay a fee ($600–1000) to sell higher-power consumer fireworks, and a tax will be added to fireworks purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan HB 4293'11|url=http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?2011-HB-4293|publisher=Michigan House of Representatives|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] has very specific requirements for the types of consumer fireworks that can be sold to and used by residents. Even then each city can and often does place restrictions on sale and use. The use of firecrackers is permitted according to the FBGOC.

In [[Minnesota]] and [[Florida]] only consumer fireworks that do not explode or fly through the air are permitted to be sold to and used by residents.

The following states&amp;nbsp;permit the sale of all or most types of consumer fireworks to residents: [[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Arkansas]], [[Iowa]],  [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Michigan]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[West Virginia]], [[Wyoming]] (varies by county) and [[Georgia (US State)|Georgia]]. Many of these states have selling seasons around the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] and/or Christmas and New Year's Eve. Some of these states also allow local laws or regulations to further restrict the types permitted or the selling seasons.

[[Missouri]] permits all types of consumer fireworks to be sold to residents with two selling seasons; June 20 – July 10 and December 20 – January 2. [[South Carolina]] permits all types of consumer fireworks except small rockets less than ½” in diameter and 3” long to be sold and used by residents year round.

Two states&amp;nbsp;— [[Hawaii]] and [[Nevada]]&amp;nbsp;— allow each county to establish its own regulations.

For example, [[Clark County, Nevada]], where [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] is located, allows residents to purchase and use only non-explosive and non-aerial consumer fireworks during the 4th of July, while other counties permit all types of consumer fireworks.

In Maine fireworks can only be sold to people over 21 at firework only stores except for sparklers that can be sold at stores that sell other items except for [[propane]] dealers or other explosives

Many states have stores with all types of consumer fireworks that sell to non-residents with the provision they are to remove the purchased fireworks from that state. This is why there are  many stores selling fireworks in states like [[Ohio]], [[Florida]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Nevada]] and [[Wisconsin]] with all types of consumer fireworks, even though residents are limited or prohibited from buying or using those very same consumer fireworks unless they have the appropriate licenses and/or permits.

Many Native American Tribes have consumer fireworks stores on reservation lands that are exempt from state and local authority and will sell to people that are not in the tribe.

===Oceania===
In [[Australia]], Type 1 fireworks are permitted to be sold to the public. For anything that has a large explosion or gets airborne, users need to register for a Type 2 Licence. The [[Australian Capital Territory]] allows fireworks to be sold to residents 18 years or older during the week leading up to the [[Queen's Official Birthday|Queen's Birthday]] long weekend for personal purposes. A similar allowance is made in the [[Northern Territory]] in the days leading up to Northern Territory Day (July 1). The types of fireworks allowed for sale is restricted to quieter fireworks, which can only be used during the long weekend and only at the address provided to the seller.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In [[New Zealand]] fireworks cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18 (previously 14), and may only be sold for the four days leading up to and including November 5. However, fireworks are able to be used at any time of the year (i.e.: there is no time restriction on when fireworks can be used, even though there is a restriction on the sales time of fireworks). The types of fireworks available to the public are multi-shot "cakes", Roman candles, single shot shooters, ground and wall spinners, fountains, cones, sparklers, and various novelties, such as smoke bombs and pharaoh's serpents. sales of fireworks have become increasingly restricted in recent years. Skyrockets, and other fireworks where the firework itself flies, were banned in 1994. Firecrackers and Bangers were banned in 1993. As of 2007, sparklers may only be purchased no more than 50 at a time in packs with other fireworks. This is due to the popularity of sparkler bombs.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyfawkes2007.govt.nz/faq/faq.htm Guy Fawkes 2007 FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021200559/http://www.guyfawkes2007.govt.nz/faq/faq.htm |date=2008-10-21 }}, New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
In [[Chile]] fireworks are restricted for consumer use and can only be seen in professional shows. The prohibition came at the request of organizations dealing with burnt children, many of the accidents being caused by unsupervised use of fireworks.

'''Dr. Scholl's''' is a [[footwear]] and [[foot care]] brand owned by [[Bayer]] in the North and Latin American markets, and by Aurelius AG in its remaining markets worldwide. The brand in the North and Latin American markets was owned by [[Merck &amp; Co.]] through its predecessor [[Schering-Plough]] until they sold it to Bayer on 1 October 2014.&lt;ref name="PRESSRELEASE2015"&gt;[http://www.press.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-closes-acquisition-consumer-business-Merck-Co-Inc-United-States-USD-billion "Bayer closes acquisition of consumer care business of Merck &amp; Co., Inc"], 8/1/2014 Press release&lt;/ref&gt; Aurelius AG bought the brand for all other markets from [[Reckitt Benckiser]] on 21 July 2014.&lt;ref name="PRESSRELEASE2014"&gt;[http://www.noodls.com/view/47FDA4D5D6616DC5D8C2DE7493CD1945414B39A7?812xxx1405936859 "AURELIUS Group to acquire Scholl’s footwear division from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc"], 7/21/2014 Press release&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Podiatrist]] [[William Scholl|William Mathias Scholl]] started the brand in 1906, in [[Chicago]], United States. The original company expanded globally to design and patent over 1000 foot care products, and became a member of the [[Fortune 500]] in 1971.

After William Scholl died in 1968, [[Schering-Plough]] bought the brand. Under parent [[Merck &amp; Co.]], Schering-Plough imports the product line from China, and has a North American distribution agreement with the [[Brown Shoe Company]]. In 1984, Schering-Plough sold the global brand and non-North American operations to [[SSL International|European Home Products]], who manufacture and distrubute footwear and foot care products under the '''Scholl''' brand.

"'''Dream Logic'''" is the fifth [[List of Fringe episodes|episode]] of the [[Fringe (season 2)|second season]] of the American [[science fiction]] [[drama]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and the 25th episode overall. It was written by [[Josh Singer]] and directed by [[Paul A. Edwards]]. The episode follows several people seemingly dreaming while still awake, leading the Fringe team to investigate the dangerous side effects of a sleep study.

On its initial American broadcast on October&amp;nbsp;15,&amp;nbsp;2009 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]], "Dream Logic" was watched by an estimated 5.78&amp;nbsp;million viewers. It received mixed reviews, with multiple critics noting it was considerably worse in quality than the [[Momentum Deferred|previous week's episode]] while at the same time praising the case's ties to [[Peter Bishop|Peter]]'s past as well as the return of [[List of Fringe characters#Sam Weiss|Sam Weiss]].

==Plot==
In [[Seattle]] a man named Greg Leiter (Jim Thorburn) hallucinates that his boss and coworkers are demons, leading Greg to attack and murder the boss. Greg is hospitalized and falls asleep for sixteen hours; when [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]] ([[Anna Torv]]) and [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]) interview him in the hospital, he tells them his boss was a demon out of a bad dream before suffering a seizure and having his hair turn white. [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]) posits that Greg died from "acute exhaustion". However, believing Seattle to be like the mental institution, Walter desires to go home to [[Boston]] and run tests on the corpse from there.

Olivia and Peter learn Greg was being treated for a sleep disorder, and that his dreams had involved demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies. The Fringe team discover that both victims had a [[brain–computer interface]] chip attached to their [[thalamus]], the part of the brain controlling dreams. [[Phillip Broyles|Broyles]] ([[Lance Reddick]]) and [[Nina Sharp|Nina]] ([[Blair Brown]]) reveal new information leading to the sleep researcher Dr. Nayak ([[Ravi Kapoor]]) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion.

Olivia and Peter first suspect Dr. Nayak's research assistant Zach (Jarrett Knowles) but find him dead. Back in Boston Walter believes the chips lead to [[mind control]] and tests this on the FBI agent assigned to him while Peter and Olivia are away. However, during these tests Walter soon changes his theory; the dreams are being stolen from their hosts to cause a "[[Substance intoxication|high]]" in Dr. Nayak, who is receiving them and has two personalities. Peter and Olivia shut down the dream equipment before Nayak kills another victim, but the doctor dies in the process. The final scene shows Peter dreaming about his childhood when Walter kidnaps him, an event Peter normally has no memory of; Peter wakes up confused but still unaware of what his father did.

In a sideplot, Olivia is grieving for her partner [[Charlie Francis (Fringe)|Charlie]], whom she discovered in [[Momentum Deferred|previous episode]] was murdered by a shapeshifter. [[List of Fringe characters#Sam Weiss|Sam Weiss]] ([[Kevin Corrigan]]) helps her work through it by giving her a "project" that requires her to collect business cards from people wearing the color red. She is told to grab random letters from the names, that once unscrambled read "you're gonna be fine".

===Reviews===
[[AOL TV]] writer Jane Boursaw wrote, "The whole storyline with the creepy dual-personality doc and the mind-control-dreams was good, though I sort of knew the doc must be involved from the beginning.

{{Quote box

I'm most intrigued by ''Fringe'' when the overarching plot is at play, like [[Momentum Deferred|last week's tremendously awesome episode]].

[[MTV]] writer Josh Wigler thought the episode "nearly put [him] to sleep," as it was "bland" and "a bit of a dud".&lt;ref name=mtvreview/&gt; The episode however did lead Wigler to "start dig[ging]" Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but believed the episode's [[Villain of the week|monster-of-the-week]] could have been used to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories.&lt;ref name=mtvreview/&gt; He concluded, "It wasn't bad enough to make me concerned for the future of ''Fringe'' or anything, but it certainly didn't keep me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next crazy twist like last week.

After the episode's broadcast, ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' published an article analyzing the science depicted. They concluded that the [[Brain–computer interface]] (BCI) chips, like the ones used in the episode to tie the victims' brains to the computer used by Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak, have also been used on real-life human subjects, though not in relation to controlling sleep cycles. However, the article continued that it is "not currently possible" for BCI chips to "facilitate direct transfer of understandable information from one person's brain to another", nor is it possible for the chips to "directly read another person's thoughts or dreams" and steal them.&lt;ref name=popmech/&gt; In addition, ''Popular Mechanics'' noted that Walter's theory of the victims' deaths being caused by exhaustion is "pure bunk", as there are many long-term experiments that have safely tested humans' deprivation of [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]].&lt;ref name=popmech/&gt; According to one scientist interviewed, though chips shown in "Dream Logic" cause hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, and a disconnect from reality, these traits are "not even remotely possible" outside of fiction.&lt;ref name=popmech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/fact-vs-fiction/4334189 |title=On Fringe, Brain-Computer Interface Chips Have Real-Life Inspiration |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |last=McCarthy |first=Erin |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Carpet cleaning}}
'''Dry carpet cleaning''' involves the use of specialized machines to [[carpet cleaning|clean carpets]] with recently developed chemical technologies that permit no-moisture or "very low moisture" (VLM) cleaning, resulting in carpet beautification, and removal of stains, dirt, grit, sand, and allergens. Clean carpets are recognized by manufacturers as being more visually pleasing, potentially longer-lasting and probably healthier than poorly maintained carpets.&lt;ref name=ics5&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6030975_ITM|title=Opening the Door to the Commercial Market (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpet cleaning is reportedly widely misunderstood, and chemical developers have only within recent decades created new carpet care technologies. Particularly, encapsulation and other green technologies work better, are easier to use, require less training, save more time and money, and lead to less re-soiling than prior methods.&lt;ref name=sm&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleanlink.com/sm/article/A-Deeper-Understanding-Of-CarpetCare-Technology--2455|title=A Deeper Understanding Of Carpet-Care Technology: Encapsulation technology and green products are two of the biggest trends in carpet care, according to industry manufacturers|author=Mollenkamp, Becky|publisher=Sanitary Maintenance|date=2005-01-01|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry carpet cleaning can also aid in achieving U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Design (LEED) certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEED Green flyer|url=http://whittakersystem.com/green/downloads/LEED-Green_flyer.pdf|website=whittakersystem.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes==
Dry carpet cleaning systems are more accurately known as "very low moisture" (VLM) systems, relying on dry compounds complemented by application cleaning solutions, and are growing significantly in market share due in part to their very rapid drying time,&lt;ref name=ics3&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-34824950_ITM|title=Speed Up Your Drying Times: An increasingly common unique selling position for carpet cleaners today is rapid drying, which plays upon the customer's fears and concerns about slow drying, discolorations returning, odor, mildew and GKW (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a significant factor for 24-hour commercial installations. Dry-cleaning and "very low moisture" systems are also often faster and less labor-intensive than wet-extraction systems.&lt;ref name=ics5/&gt;

Pre-treatments, pre-conditioners, or "traffic-lane cleaners", which are detergents or emulsifiers that break the binding of soils to carpet fibers over a short period of time, are commonly sprayed onto carpet prior to the primary use of the dry-cleaning system. One chemical dissolves the greasy films that bind soils and prevent effective soil removal by vacuuming. The solution may add a solvent like [[d-limonene]], petroleum byproducts, [[glycol ether]]s, or [[butyl]] agents. The amount of time the pretreatment "dwells" in the carpet should be less than 15 minutes, due to the thorough carpet brushing common to these "very low moisture" systems, which provides added agitation to ensure the pretreatment works fully through the carpet.&lt;ref name=ics4&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7741213_ITM|title=Pre- and Post-Cleaning Carpet Treatments: As you meander down the aisles of your supplier's showroom, you are presented with a wide array of products designed for such specialized purposes as spot removal, odor control or correction, color correction, and sanitizing (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry compound===
An absorbent, 98% biodegradable cleaning compound may be spread evenly over carpet and brushed or scrubbed in. For small areas, a household hand brush can work such a compound into carpet pile; dirt and grime is attracted to the compound, which is then vacuumed off, leaving carpet immediately clean and dry. For commercial applications, a specially designed cylindrical counter-rotating brushing system is used, without a vacuum cleaner. Machine scrubbing is more typical, in that hand scrubbing generally cleans only the top third of carpet.&lt;ref name=dry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repair-home.com/Dry_Carpet_Cleaning.html|title=Dry Carpet Cleaning|work=Repair-Home.com|publisher=Beehive Content Works|year=2009|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encapsulation===
In the 1990s, new polymers began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) soil particles into dry residues on contact, in a process now regarded by the industry as a growing, up-and-coming technology;&lt;ref name=sm/&gt; working like "tiny sponges", the deep-cleaning compound crystals dissolve and absorb dirt prior to its removal from the carpet. Cleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, "CRB" counter rotating brush, brush applicator, or compression sprayer. Dry residue is vacuumable immediately, either separately or from a built-in unit of the cleaning system machine. According to ''ICS Cleaning Specialist'', evidence suggests encapsulation improves carpet appearance, compared to other systems; and it is favorable in terms of high-traffic needs, operator training, equipment expense, and lack of wet residue. Encapsulation carpet cleaning also keeps carpets cleaner for longer periods of time compared to other methods.  &lt;ref name=ics&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7464080_ITM|work=ICS Cleaning Specialist|title=Encapsulation and Carpet Cleaning (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|author=Wittkamp, Bob|date=2002-10-01|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher=Business News Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encapsulation also avoids the drying time of carpet shampoos, making the carpet immediately available for use.&lt;ref name=dry/&gt;

The use of encapsulation to create a crystalline residue that can be immediately vacuumed (as opposed to the dry powder residue of wet-cleaning systems, which generally requires an additional day before vacuuming)is a newer technology that has recently become an accepted method for commercial and residential carpet deep cleaning.&lt;ref name="ics2"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://cm-instituteonline.com/index.php/2016/01/09/carpet-cleaning-tips-part-2/|title = Myths and Misconceptions (Carpet Cleaning Basics)|work = Cleaning Maintenance Institute|author = Wittkamp, Bob|date = 2003-05-01|accessdate = 2009-04-02|publisher = Business News Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonnet===
After cleaning product in solution is deposited onto the surface as mist, a round buffer or "bonnet" scrubs the mixture with rotating motion. This industry machine resembles a floor buffer, with an absorbent spin pad that attracts soil and is rinsed or replaced repeatedly. The bonnet method is not strictly dry-cleaning and involves short drying time, making it a solution for a deep cleaning of dirt or odor as considered suitable for valuable carpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = John|first1 = Lucas|title = Selecting a Professional Company to Clean Your Carpets|url = http://www.iicrc.org/consumers/care/carpet-cleaning/|accessdate = 22 October 2015|work = IICRC|date = 22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce pile distortion, the absorbent pad should be kept well-lubricated with cleaning solution.

===Solvent extraction===
A d-[[limonene]] based cleaner is pre-sprayed upon the carpet to be cleaned. The product is given a dwell time of 5–10 minutes. The carpet is then extracted using an acid rinse solution through a hot water extraction machine. Triple dry strokes are then performed to ensure a low dry time. While this process is not strictly dry cleaning and involves a 1-4 hour dry time, it cleans deep into the fibers.

The '''elastic and inelastic collisions apparatus''' is a large apparatus to study [[elastic collision|elastic and inelastic collisions]].

It consists of a large frame carrying two beams from which two rows of six and two wooden balls, respectively, are suspended from pairs of strings. The instrument was often used with two elastic balls (of ivory) or inelastic balls (of wet clay), of equal or different mass. By changing the parameters of the experiments such as height of fall and mass, one could conduct a systematic investigation of collision-related phenomena. For example, when the row of balls is struck by one of the outermost balls, the row of balls remains motionless and the impulse is fully transmitted to the ball at the opposite end, which rebounds. As it falls back, the cycle continues in the opposite direction. This apparatus was illustrated by [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] in ''Leçons de physique expérimentale'' (Paris, 1743-1748).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Nollet, Jean-Antoine]] ''Leçons de physique expérimentale'' (Paris, 1743-1748)&lt;/ref&gt; In his description, Nollet claims to have merely altered and developed a model previously used by [[Edme Mariotte]]. The most sophisticated devices for studying elastic and inelastic collisions were built by [[Willem Jacob 's Gravesande]] and [[Petrus van Musschenbroek]].

The instrument is held in the Lorraine collections of the [[Museo Galileo]] in [[Florence]].

'''Elektro''' is the nickname of a [[robot]] built by the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] in its [[Mansfield, Ohio]] facility between 1937 and 1938.  Seven feet tall (2.1 m), weighing 265 pounds (120.2&amp;nbsp;kg), humanoid in appearance, he could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm [[phonograph|record player]]), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move his head and arms. Elektro's body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. His [[photodetector|photoelectric]] "eyes" could distinguish red and green light. He was on exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and reappeared at that fair in 1940, with "Sparko", a robot dog that could bark, sit, and beg to humans.

==History==
Elektro toured North America in 1950 in promotional appearances for Westinghouse, and was displayed at [[Pacific Ocean Park]] in [[Venice, California]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also appeared as "Thinko", in ''[[Sex Kittens Go to College]]'' (1960). In the 1960s, his head was given to Harold Gorsuch, a retiring Westinghouse engineer.

In 1992, the dance band [[Meat Beat Manifesto]] produced the song "Original Control (Version 2)" which prominently featured snippets of Elektro's monologues, quoting lines such as "I am Elektro" and "My brain is bigger than yours".

Elektro survived the scrap pile and is currently the property of the Mansfield Memorial Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026873.000-the-return-of-elektro-the-first-celebrity-robot.html The Return of Electro], Jack Weeks, New Scientist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2012/04/02/149850779/americas-first-celebrity-robot-is-staging-a-comeback? America's First Celebrity Robot is Staging a Comeback], Emma Jacobs, National Rublic Radio&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a replica of Elektro was exhibited at [[The Henry Ford]] Museum in [[Dearborn, MI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A "Mansfield Museum of Circuitry and Robotics" and anecdotes about Elektro and Sparko are briefly but touchingly presented in the beginning of the novel ''The Man from Primrose Lane'' by James Renner, 2012, Sarah Crichton Books, an imprint of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7160">The '''EuroFirst Passive Infrared Airborne Track Equipment''' (PIRATE) is the [[Forward looking infrared]](FLIR) / [[Infra-red search and track]] (IRST) for the [[Eurofighter]] Typhoon. It is produced by the EuroFIRST consortium consisting of [[Leonardo S.p.A.]] of Italy (lead contractor), [[Thales Group|THALES]] Land &amp; Joint Systems of the UK (system technical authority), and TECNOBIT of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202730.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1989/1989%20-%202619.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1993/1993%20-%201645.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The system is mounted on the port side of the fuselage, forward of the windscreen and provides passive and thus undetectable and unjammable means of long range surveillance. In addition the system has been shown to locate stealth aircraft at a "significant distance" with further improvements in detection through software updates.&lt;ref&gt;http://aviationweek.com/awin/us-navy-follows-uk-lead-infrared-systems&lt;/ref&gt; PIRATE detects heat caused on a aircraft's skin caused by air friction.&lt;ref&gt;https://rusi.org/sites/default/files/whr_1-15_maximising_european_combat_air_power_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

In 1989 Thorn-EMI and FIAR, and GEC Avionics and Pilkington and Ferranti competed for the tender to develop an IRST system for the Eurofighter. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1993/1993%20-%201645.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Germany decided not to participate in the development due to cost issues but reserved the right to use the system. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1991/1991%20-%201756.html&lt;/ref&gt; In  September 1992, Thorn-EMI (now Thales) finally won the tender with Italy's [[FIAR]] (now Leonardo) and Spain's Eurotronica for the infrared sensor of the Eurofighters, based on the Air Defence Alerting Device (ADAD), &lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1993/1993%20-%201645.html&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to form the EuroFirst consortium. The flight tests were begun in 2001 by testing the FLIR function in the case of flights between Turin and Sardinia. Later on, the FLIR was also used to coordinate the integration into the Eurofighter's display elements. The first Eurofighter Typhoon equipped with PIRATE was in a tranche 1 block 5 and delivered to the Italian Aeronautica Militare in August 2007. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/release/84955/first-eurofighter-with-irst-sensor-delivered-to-italian-af.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
===Sensor===
PIRATE is a passive, rotating, cooled [[infrared]] sensor with high resolution, which is also referred to as an imaging infrared sensor. PIRATE operates in two IR bands, 3–5 and 8–11 micrometres. The externally visible dome is only the azimutally rotatable sensor head, which contains the tilting mirror. Both elements have been stabilized, the maximum azimuth and elevation range is probably 150 ° × 60 °. &lt;ref&gt; Boyd Cook:"PIRATE: the IRST for Eurofighter TYPHOON", Proc. SPIE 4820, Infrared Technology and Applications XXVIII, 897. January 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The sensor consists of a single Line-Replaceable Item (LRI), which in turn contains four subsystems: The sensor head module with the stabilized sensor head, the detector, the servo control processor, and the electronics for signal matching. The data processing computer to discover and tracking targets, the video processor to the imaging display of the infrared image on the HUD, HMD or MHDD. The sensor is connected to the MIL-STD-1553 to and connect to a STANEG 2910 bus. PowerPC processors were used for the signal processing.  The sensor is 680 × 591 × 300 mm (L x W x H), and weighs kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardocompany.com/documents/63265270/65493314/mm07797_Pirate_IRST_LQ_March14.pdf?download_file&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating Modes=== 
PIRATE is fundamentally a Track-While-Scan infrared search and track (IRST) system which also performs conventional navigation FLIR functions. It can track and prioritized up to 500 targets simultaneously. &lt;ref&gt;http://grupooesia.com/en/portfolio-productos-ingenieria/flir-irst/&lt;/ref&gt;   In the air-air role, the equipment passively detects, tracks, classifies and prioritizes multiple airborne targets under all aspects, look-up, look-down and co-altitude conditions. &lt;ref&gt; Boyd Cook:"PIRATE: the IRST for Eurofighter TYPHOON", Proc. SPIE 4820, Infrared Technology and Applications XXVIII, 897. January 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRST functions are fully integrated into the aircraft attack and identification sub-system and can be diverted to specific search and track areas as a result of commands on the communication bus. The pilot has several selectable operating modes depending upon the particular combat mission requirement. These images are displayed on the Head Up Display (HUD), Multifunction Head Down Display (MHDD) or the pilots helmet visor.  


PIRATE is capable of operating in each one of the following IRST modes &lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardocompany.com/documents/63265270/65493314/mm07797_Pirate_IRST_LQ_March14.pdf?download_file&lt;/ref&gt;:
*Multiple target tracking: Where engagement (detection, tracking and prioritisation) of multiple targets in A/A, look up/down operations over the whole field of regard or in a selectable volume are executable. Passive ranging data is also available.

*Single target tracking: Where angle tracking of a single acquired target can be commanded. Automatic re-acquisition capability is available.

*Slaved acquisition: Where line-of-sight is slaved to externally defined pointing angles and automatic acquisition of a single target is activated. 

PIRATE is also providing IR TV imaging to cockpit displays in accordance with the following FLIR modes:
*Flying / Landing Aid   
*Steerable IR Picture on Helmet (SIRPH): The IRST sensor is coupled to the movement of the head of the pilot. The sensor then looks to where the pilot is looking, the FLIR picture is on the heads-up display projected. 
*Identification

===Range===
The range of the sensor is a closely guarded secret by the EuroFirst consortium but confirmed to be more than 74 km &lt;ref&gt;http://grupooesia.com/en/portfolio-productos-ingenieria/flir-irst/&lt;/ref&gt;.The RAND Corporation reports ranges of 50 nm (93 km) to a subsonic target from the front and up to 90 nm from the rear of a subsonic target. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/files/2008_RAND_Pacific_View_Air_Combat_Briefing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the weather conditions will affect the performance of the infrared-based target search and target tracking significantly. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bundesheer.at/truppendienst/ausgaben/artikel.php?id=807&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the detection range of PIRATE was said to be further increased by software updates. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1993/1993%20-%201645.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">'''Finn Haldorsen''' (5 September 1934 &amp;ndash; February 4, 2005) was a Norwegian-born businessman.

Finn Haldorsen was the youngest of 13 children born to Haldor Haldorsen and Anne Serine Haldorsen in
Rubbestadneset, county of [[Hordaland]],  [[Norway]].  After completing schooling on [[Bømlo]] he attended college in [[Bryne, Norway]]. Following his military service, he went to work at a steel factory in [[Manchester, England]]. He started studying [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Cardiff]] in Wales. After receiving his honours degree in 1961, he returned to Norway to start work at Wichmann Motorfabrikk AS, his father’s engine factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubb.com/fabric_engineer/Fabric_Engineer_2006.pdf  Fabric Engineer. 2005 Rubb Building Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023023112/http://rubb.com/fabric_engineer/Fabric_Engineer_2006.pdf |date=2006-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldorsen was best known for starting the [[Rubb]] Group in [[Norway]] in 1968. Rubb Group was named for his home town of [[Rubbestadneset]]. Haldorsen's goal was to build a fabric covered building that would withstand the harsh Norwegian climate.  His success with this effort lead to him moving to [[England]] to start Rubb Buildings Ltd. in 1977.  When this company was firmly established under the leadership of Bill Wood, he moved to [[Maine]], and established Rubb Inc. in the United States which today is under the leadership of David C. Nickerson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubb.com/fabric_engineer/Fabric_Engineer_2005.pdf ''Rubb Building Systems. 2006''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023023531/http://rubb.com/fabric_engineer/Fabric_Engineer_2005.pdf |date=2006-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldorsen was married, and had 3 sons and 1 daughter.

'''Bull SAS''' (also known as '''Groupe Bull''', '''Bull Information Systems''', or simply '''Bull''') is a [[France|French]]-owned [[computer]] [[company (law)|company]] [[headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Les Clayes-sous-Bois]], in the western suburbs of [[Paris]]. The company has also been known at various times as '''Bull General Electric''', '''Honeywell Bull''', '''CII Honeywell Bull''', and '''Bull HN'''. Bull was founded in 1931, as '''H.W. Egli - Bull''', to capitalize on the [[punched card]] technology patents of [[Norway|Norwegian]] engineer [[Fredrik Rosing Bull]] (1882&amp;ndash;1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/projet/frbull/heide_bull.pdf |title=Heide, Lars (2002) '&amp;#39;National Capital in the Emergence of a Challenger to IBM in France'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a reorganization in 1933, with new owners coming in, the name was changed to '''Compagnie des Machines Bull''' ('''CMB''').

The company has undergone many [[Mergers and acquisitions|takeovers and mergers]] since its formation. In particular, it has had various ownership relations with [[General Electric]], [[Honeywell]], and [[NEC Corporation|NEC]] from the 1960s to the 1980s; and with [[Motorola]], [[Debeka]],  and [[France Télécom]] more recently. It acquired [[Honeywell Information Systems]] in the late 1980s, and later also had a share of [[Zenith Data Systems]] and [[Packard Bell]]. Bull was [[nationalisation|nationalised]] in 1982 and was merged with most of the rest of the French computer industry. In 1994, the company was re-[[privatisation|privatised]].

Bull has a worldwide presence in more than 100 countries, and is particularly active in the defense, finance, health care, manufacturing, public and telecommunication sectors.

In August 2014, the French IT company [[Atos]] announced that it had acquired a controlling stake in Bull SA through a tender offer launched in May.&lt;ref&gt;

Bull launched the [[Hoox m2]], the first integrally secured European smartphone, which in June 2014 was approved for use with data classified as 'Restricted Information' ('Diffusion Restreinte') by the [[Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information]] (ANSSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bull.com/hoox-m2-secure-smart-phone-gets-anssi-approval|title=Home - Atos|website=Atos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoox range of secure mobiles and smartphones ensures confidentiality of voice, SMS, e-mail and data communication.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
On 31 July 1919, a Norwegian engineer named [[Fredrik Rosing Bull]] filed a patent for a "combined sorter-recorder-tabulator of punch cards" machine that he had developed with financing from the Norwegian insurance company Storebrand.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url = http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/Histoire/tabsyn/ts3.htm#A231
|title =  Histoire de Bull
|accessdate = 2014-10-11
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Storebrand integrated his device into its operations in 1921. The following year Bull sold his second machine to the Danish insurer [[Codan A/S|Hafnia]] who had learned of the technology through an article in an insurance trade magazine.&lt;ref name="Bull et le 20ème arrondissement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapage.noos.fr/fholvoet/Bull20eme2.htm|title=Bull et le 20ème arrondissement|publisher=sur le Site personnel de  François Holvoet-Vermaut}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Bull's death of cancer in 1925 at the age of 43, a dozen of his machines had been sold to different companies throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Bull et le 20ème arrondissement"/&gt; The commercial and technical development of the machines continued under the direction of Bull's childhood friend and long-time collaborator Reidar Knutsen along with his brother Kurt Andréas Knutsen.

As the business grew several outside investors were brought in, leading to the incorporation of the company H.W. Egli Bull in 1931.&lt;ref name="patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/Histoire/tabsyn/ts10.htm#A195|title = Événement}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, more investors joined and the company changed its name to Compagnie des Machines Bull, a name it would keep until 1964.

==Amesys controversy==

Amesys, a Groupe Bull subsidiary specializing in defense and aerospace-related systems and software, became embroiled in controversy in 2011 when it was revealed that it had sold an [[Internet surveillance|internet monitoring]] system to the [[Muammar Gaddafi]] regime of Libya in 2007.  The ''Eagle System'' was used by the Gaddafi regime to spy on citizens and foreign journalists.  On 12 March 2013 [[Reporters Without Borders]] named Amesys as one of five "[[Corporate Enemies of the Internet]]" and “digital era mercenaries” for selling products that have been or are being used by governments to violate [[human rights]] and freedom of information.  A judicial inquiry was opened by the French government in May 2012 following allegations of complicity in torture by the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (FIDH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/amesys/ "Corporate Enemies: Amesys"], ''The Enemies of the Internet, Special Edition: Surveillance'', Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904199404576538721260166388 "Firms Aided Libyan Spies "], Paul Sonne and Margaret Coker, ''Wall Street Journal'', 30 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203764804577056230832805896 "Life Under the Gaze of Gadhafi's Spies "], Margaret Coker and Paul Sonne, ''Wall Street Journal'', 14 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2012 Groupe Bull divested itself of the Eagle System, selling it for the sum of 4 million euros to Nexa Technologies, a company run by a former Amesys CEO.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''growler''' is an [[electricity|electrical]] device used for testing insulation of a motor for shorted coils. A growler consists of a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core and connected to a source of [[alternating current]]. When placed on the armature or stator core of a motor the growler acts as the primary of a transformer and the armature coils act as the secondary. A "feeler", a thin strip of steel (hacksaw blade) can be used as the short detector.

==Motor testing==
The alternating magnetic flux set up by the growler passes through the windings of the armature coil, generating an alternating voltage in the coil. A short in the coil creates a closed circuit that will act like the secondary coil of a transformer, with the growler acting like the primary coil. This will induce an alternating current in the shorted armature that will in turn cause an alternating [[magnetic field]] to encircle the shorted armature coil. A flat, broad, flexible piece of metal containing iron is used to detect the magnetic field generated by a shorted armature. A hacksaw blade is commonly used as a feeler. The alternating magnetic field induced by a shorted armature is strong at the surface of the armature, and when the feeler is lightly touched to the iron core of an armature winding, small currents are induced in the feeler that generate a third alternating magnetic field surrounding the feeler. 

With the growler energized, the feeler is moved from slot to slot. When the feeler is moved over a slot containing the shorted coil, the alternating magnetic field will alternately attract and release the feeler, causing it to vibrate in synch with the alternating current. A strong vibration of the feeler accompanied by a growling noise indicated that the coil is shorted.

==Other uses==
Along with the standard application the growler can be used:
* to test [[series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] and interpoles (commutating) fields from a [[DC motor]]
* to determine phasing and [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] in multiwinding [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]]s
* to test [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]]s in rotating frequency changers, as well as in wound rotors
* to test shorts between turns in taped coils before installation into an armature or a stator
* as a low voltage isolation [[transformer]]
* as a high voltage [[autotransformer]] bucking or boosting for numerous tests on various types of equipment
* for preheating or baking armatures and rotors.

The '''Guizhou WZ-2000''', also known as the '''WuZhen-2000''' and previously the '''WZ-9''', is a multi-purpose 
[[Unmanned combat air vehicle]] (UCAV) developed by [[Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation|Guizhou Aviation Industry Group]] (GAIC) in the [[People's Republic of China]].

==Design and development==
Development on the WZ-2000 began in 1999. A mock up of the WZ-2000 was publicly displayed at the 2000 Zhuhai Airshow, with a more accurate model on display at the 2002 event. First flight was on 26 December 2003, and there is sketchy news that an improved version, possibly designated the WZ-2000B, was due to fly at the end of 2005.

The UAV is powered by a single WS-11 [[turbofan]] engine which sits on top of the [[empennage]] between the two V-shaped tail fins. The fins are canted at approximately 40°. The sensor package includes thermal imaging camera, synthetic aperture radar, with images transmitted via a satellite communications antenna in the nose bulge.

'''Hempcrete''' or '''Hemplime''' is [[biocomposite | bio-composite]] material, a mixture of [[hemp hurds]] (shives) and [[Lime (material)|lime]] (possibly including [[hydraulic lime|natural hydraulic lime]],&lt;ref&gt;Allin, Steve. ''Building with Hemp'', Seed Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-9551109-0-0}}.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"&gt;{{cite journal
|url=http://www.naturallifemagazine.com/0604/hemphouse.htm |title=Hemp For Houses |first=Rolf B. |last=Priesnitz |work=Natural Life Magazine |date=March–April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the [[brittleness]] of concrete and consequently does not need [[expansion joint]]s.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"/&gt; The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.

Hempcrete has been used in [[France]] since the early 1990’s to construct non-weight bearing insulating infill walls, as hempcrete does not have the requisite strength for constructing [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] and is instead supported by the frame. France continues to be an avid user of hempcrete; it is growing in popularity annually&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhydwen|first=Ranyl|date=2018-05-18|title=Building with Hemp and Lime|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265450145_Building_with_Hemp_and_Lime}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Like other plant products, [[hemp]] absorbs [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the atmosphere as it grows, retaining the [[carbon]] and releasing the [[oxygen]].  Theoretically 165&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon can be absorbed and locked up by 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of hempcrete wall during manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlimetec.com/tradical-hemcrete/|title=Tradical Hemcrete 2008 Information Pack|publisher=American Lime Technology|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical [[compressive strength]] is around 1&amp;nbsp;MPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |publisher=American Lime Technology

 |title=Tradical Hemcrete 2008 Information Pack
 |accessdate=2009-08-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 1/20 that of residential grade [[concrete]]. It is a low density material and resistant to crack under movement thus making it highly suitable for use in earthquake-prone areas. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete's [[density]] is 15% that of traditional concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''IEEE Rebooting Computing''' is a global initiative launched by [[Ieee|IEEE]] that proposes to rethink the concept of computing through a holistic look at all aspects of computing, from the device itself to the user interface.&lt;ref name = "Scientific Computing"&gt;DeBenedictis, Erik. [http://www.scientificcomputing.com/blogs/2015/04/rebooting-supercomputing Rebooting Supercomputing], ''Scientific Computing'', April 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its work, IEEE Rebooting Computing provides access to various resources like conferences and educational events, feature and scholarly articles, reports,&lt;ref name = "ITRS"&gt;{{Citation | first = T. | last = Conte |author-link = Tom Conte | first2 = P. | last2 = Gargini  | title = On The Foundation Of The New Computing Industry Beyond 2020 | url = http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/prelim-ieee-rc-itrs.pdf | year = 2015 | publisher = IEEE, International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos.

== History ==
IEEE Future Directions Committee established an "IEEE Rebooting Computing" [[working group]] in late 2012 with the broad vision of "rebooting" the entire field of computer technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pretz|first1=Kathy|title=The Future of Computing - New Rebooting Computing Working Group will tackle technological challenges|journal=The Institute|date=March 2013|pages=6–7|url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ns/quarterly_issues/timar13.pdf|accessdate=October 21, 2015|publisher=The Institute|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of this working group are carried out by the IEEE Rebooting Computing Committee, a team of volunteers from ten participating IEEE [[Professional association|Societies]] and Councils, in conjunction with IEEE Future Directions staff members.&lt;ref name ="IEEE RC" /&gt;

The term "rebooting computing" was coined by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers#Membership and member grades|IEEE Life Fellow]], [[Peter J. Denning|Peter Denning]],&lt;ref name ="Event Summary"&gt;{{cite conference | first = Robin | last = Wedewer | title = IEEE Rebooting Computing Event Summary | booktitle = IEEE Rebooting Computing Event Summary | publisher = The Wedewer Group | date = December 2013 | location = Washington, D.C. | url = http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/ieee_rebooting_computing_summary.pdf | accessdate = October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as part of an early [[U.S. National Science Foundation]]-sponsored project focused on revamping computer education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rebootingcomputing.net/content/summit |title=The Summit |publisher=RebootingComputing.net |accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to achieve its goal of rebooting computing, IEEE Rebooting Computing hosted four invitation-only summits between 2013 and 2015 in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/rc-summits |title=RC Summits |publisher=IEEE Rebooting Computing |accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These summits addressed the future of computing from a holistic point of view.&lt;ref name = "Scientific Computing" /&gt;

In 2014, IEEE Rebooting Computing adopted its new logo, consisting of an exploding infinity symbol. The logo is intended to suggest the absence of limits for future computing technology.

IEEE Rebooting Computing announced the signing of a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) with the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] (ITRS) in March 2015.&lt;ref name = "Inside HPC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidehpc.com/2015/03/ieee-is-rebooting-computing-for-what-comes-next |title=IEEE is Rebooting Computing for What Comes Next |publisher=Inside HPC |accessdate=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led in May 2016 to the formation of the ''IEEE [[International Roadmap for Devices and Systems]]'' (IRDS),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://irds.ieee.org/|title=About the IRDS - IEEE International Roadmap for Devices and Systems|website=irds.ieee.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporated the previous mission of ITRS in semiconductor device fabrication and expanded it to encompass alternative technologies, computer architectures, and system applications.

In September 2015, IEEE Rebooting Computing announced support for the [[National Strategic Computing Initiative]] (NSCI).&lt;ref name ="NSCI"&gt;{{cite press |url=http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/ieee-rc_press_release_nsci_1sep15.pdf |title=IEEE Rebooting Computing Supports National Strategic Computing Initiative |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=October 29, 2015 |date=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established under Executive Order 13072 issued by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] in July 2015, the NSCI calls for a coordinated Federal strategy in [[high-performance computing]] (HPC) research, development, and deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite executive order | number = 13702 | url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-08-03/pdf/2015-19183.pdf | date = July 29, 2015 | language = English | post = President of the United States | accessdate = October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]] (NNI), an interagency program of the U.S. government, announced a "Nanotechnology-Inspired [[Grand Challenge]] in Future Computing".&lt;ref name ="Grand Challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nano.gov/futurecomputing |title=A Nanotechnology-Inspired Grand Challenge in Future Computing |publisher=United States National Nanotechnology Initiative |accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key document cited by NNI as part of this grand challenge is a white paper, co-sponsored by IEEE Rebooting Computing and ITRS, entitled ''Sensible Machines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/archived-articles-and-videos/general/sensible-machine |title=IEEE Rebooting Computing Responds to White House Nanotechnology Grand Challenge: "Sensible Machines" That are Smaller, Faster, and Lower Power |publisher=IEEE Rebooting Computing |accessdate=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
[[Image:IEEE_Rebooting_Computing_Three_Pillars.png|thumb|The Three Pillars of Computing]]
IEEE Rebooting Computing aims to help return the computing industry to exponential computer-performance scaling,&lt;ref name = "Computer Magazine"&gt;{{Citation | last = Conte | first = Tom | author-link = Tom Conte | title = A Time of Change | journal = Computer Magazine | volume = 48 | issue = 01 | pages = 4–6 | publisher = IEEE Computer Society | date = January 2015 | url = http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/07030272.pdf | issn = 0018-9162 | doi=10.1109/mc.2015.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stalled in 2005 due to energy inefficiencies of [[CMOS]]-based classical computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nano.gov/node/1521 |title=A Nanotechnology-Inspired Grand Challenge for Future Computing |publisher=National Nanotechnology Initiative, Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee  |accessdate=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, computer processing power doubled every 18 months due to increasing densities of transistors per semiconductor unit. To alleviate challenges brought on by limitations in computer architectures and sustain regular processing performance gains, there was a move toward [[instruction-level parallelism]] and [[Superscalar processor|superscalar microprocessors]]. However, with rising costs associated with greater power consumption brought on by this approach signaling the end of [[Moore's Law]],&lt;ref name = "EE Times"&gt;{{Citation | last = Conte | first = Thomas | author-link = Tom Conte | last2 = Track | first2 = Elie | title = Computing Needs a Reboot | magazine = EE Times | date = May 5, 2015 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1326520 | accessdate = October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IEEE introduced the IEEE Rebooting Computing initiative.

Incorporating three fundamental pillars of rebooting computing, including energy efficiency, security, and Human Computer Interface (HCI), the initiative seeks to overcome setbacks and challenges relating to the deceleration of computational power and capacity. In turn, these efforts may also be applied in other technology sectors, such as the [[Internet of Things]].&lt;ref name = "ICIN"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Sin-Kuen | last2 = Hoang | first2 = Bichlien | title = How IEEE Rebooting Computing Will Help IoT | journal = ICIN 2015, Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks | pages = 121–127 | publisher = IEEE | date = February 2015 | URL = http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/hoang-hawkins_icin_2015_rc-iot_paper.pdf | doi = 10.1109/ICIN.2015.7073817 | accessdate = January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Our agreement will ensure we help fundamentally shift the computer industry’s focus, resources, time and attention on to new possibilities for computational performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |url=http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/itrs_lpirc.pdf |title=IEEE Rebooting Computing Launches Initiative to Rethink the Computer |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=October 12, 2015 |date=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2016, IEEE announced the launch of the "International Roadmap for Devices and Systems" (IRDS), operating as part of the [[IEEE Standards Association]]'s (IEEE-SA) Industry Connections program. IRDS is sponsored by IEEE Rebooting Computing in consultation with the IEEE Computer Society and ITRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |url=http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/rc_irds.pdf |title=IEEE Rebooting Computing Initiative, Standards Association, and Computer Society Introduce New International Roadmap for Devices and Systems to Set the Course for End-to-End Computing |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=May 5, 2016 |date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRDS will provide guidance on future trends in computer systems, architectures, software, chips, and other components across the entire computer industry, and is modeled on ITRS roadmaps that have previously guided the semiconductor industry during the Moore’s Law era. The first IRDS Roadmap is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2018 on the IRDS Web Portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irds.ieee.org/|title=About the IRDS - IEEE International Roadmap for Devices and Systems|website=irds.ieee.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows preliminary presentation of the roadmap components at the IRDS Conference in Washington DC in November 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irds.ieee.org/events|title=IRDS Events - IEEE International Roadmap for Devices and Systems|website=irds.ieee.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the Rebooting Computing Week set of events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Influence and impact ==
Through its summits, other educational efforts,&lt;ref name = "events" /&gt; and engagement with government, IEEE Rebooting Computing initiative has begun to influence both the technology industry and national policy efforts. The initiative plans to extend this current sphere of influence by creating and releasing the IRDS ''Roadmap of Future Computing''. This proposed roadmap will include development of performance benchmarks and standards for new classes of computer systems.&lt;ref name = "ITRS" /&gt;

Addressing roadblocks in future high-performance computing, also known as [[exascale computing]], is a key area of focus for IEEE Rebooting Computing. The initiative has been actively pursuing and aiding the industry in making progress toward possible solutions such as specialized chip architectures, [[volt|millivolt]] switches, and [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|3D integrated circuits]], as noted by Dr. Erik DeBenedictis of [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in "Power Problems Threaten to Strangle Exascale Computing".&lt;ref name ="Spectrum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/power-problems-threaten-to-strangle-exascale-computing |title=Power Problems Threaten to Strangle Exascale Computing | last = DeBenedictis | first = Erik | date = December 30, 2015 | publisher=IEEE Spectrum |accessdate= January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, IEEE Rebooting Computing Senior Program Director Bichlien Hoang and co-author Sin-Kuen Hawkins were received a "Best Presentation Award" for their paper, "How Will Rebooting Computing Help IoT". Presented at the 18th International Conference on Intelligence in Next Generation Networks (ICIN 2015) in [[Paris]], [[France]], the paper described IEEE Rebooting Computing's approach to addressing technical challenges generated by IoT other key computing trends.&lt;ref name = "ICIN" /&gt;

=== Media coverage ===
Media coverage of IEEE Rebooting Computing's efforts has increased. In May 2016, a [[New York Times]] feature article on the technological and economic implications of the ending of Moore’s Law quoted IEEE Rebooting Co-Chair, Professor Thomas M. Conte of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] as saying, "The end of Moore’s Law is what led to this. Just relying on the semiconductor industry is no longer enough. We have to shift and punch through some walls and break through some barriers."&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, John. [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/technology/moores-law-running-out-of-room-tech-looks-for-a-successor.html?_r=0 Moore’s Law Running Out of Room, Tech Looks for a Successor], ''New York Times'', May 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Dollfus''' (September 25 1800 – 21 May 1887) was a French industrialist who grew a textile company, [[Dollfus-Meig et Cie]] (D.M.C.), in Mulhouse. Dollfus was a leading figure in a philanthropic society which constructed a [[company town]] that sold houses at cost to the town's workers. Dollfus also helped publish an encyclopedia of [[needlework]].

==Life==
Jean Dollfus was born in [[Mulhouse]], France, in 1800, the son of Daniel Dollfus and Anne Marie Mieg.&lt;ref name=dmc/&gt; He was born into a family that owned a textile business established in the 18th century. His parents wrote their surname as Dollfus-Mieg, and Daniel used this name to [[Brand management|re-brand]] his uncle's textile company as  Dollfus-Mieg &amp; Compagnie, or D.M.C., in 1800.&lt;ref name=dmc/&gt; Whilst studying in Leeds, Jean Dollfus found out about [[Mercerised cotton]]. This was a new technique of chemically treating cotton to increase not only its strength but also its appearance,&lt;ref name=dmc/&gt; a discovery that he would apply to the textile business.

Dollfus was a leading member of the ''Societe Industrielle de Mulhouse''. In 1851 he published a letter to them where he advocated [[free trade]]. Dollfus noted that the French cotton trade was stagnant whilst between 1830 and 1850 the British had doubled their consumption of raw cotton. Dollfus believed that taxes levied by the French in order to protect French workers were in fact preventing industrial expansion.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Freeman|title=Merchants' Magazine and Commercial Review, Volume 25|date=1851|page=213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_I8EAAAAQAAJ|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cités_Ouvrières_de_Mulhouse_vers_1855.jpg|thumb|right|Worker's towns in [[Mulhouse]], 1855]]
In 1852 the ''Societe Industrielle de Mulhouse'' began construction on ''cités ouvrières'', or worker's towns. This philanthropic endeavor was not led by a single company but involved numerous leading citizens, although Dollfus was credited with leading the work. Henry Roberts is credited with the inspiration and Emile Muller drew up the designs. Construction continued for the next 45 years.&lt;ref name=curl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curl|first1=James Stevens|title=A dictionary of architecture and landscape architecture|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0198606788|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jIWr0IO9dYIC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was so novel and admirable that [[Napoleon III]] made 30,000 francs available to assist the project&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://dmc-threads.com/tag/dollfus-mieg-and-cie/ Taken from the DMC Historical French Chronicles], DMC Threads, retrieved 29 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and Dollfus became the Mayor of Mulhouse from 1863 to 1869. By 1885 the society had constructed 1,060 workers' houses in Mulhouse and had sold 775 of them at cost to their occupants. Each of these occupants, after about 15 years, owned a small house with a small garden.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

[[File:The Jewish Wedding (Copy after Delacroix) by Pierre August Renoir (1841-1919) - IMG 7178.JPG|thumb|left|''The Jewish Wedding'' by [[Pierre-August Renoir|Renoir]]]]
Dollfus commissioned [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] to paint a copy of a painting by [[Delacroix]]. The painting was completed by 1876 and was not a true copy, as Renoir had adapted the colours and brush work to an [[Impressionism|impressionist]] style. This painting remained in the Dollfus family until 1911 and it is now housed in the [[Worcester Art Museum]] in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=mass&gt;{{cite book|title=European paintings in the collection of the Worcester Art Museum.|date=1974|publisher=The Museum|location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=0870231693|page=276|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0870231693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 Dollfus signed an agreement with [[Thérèse de Dillmont]], a textile teacher and writer. She came from [[Vienna]] to work with him.&lt;ref name=dmc&gt;[http://www.dmccreative.co.uk/DMC-History.aspx DMC History], DMCCreative, retrieved 27 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote an [[s:Encyclopedia of Needlework|Encyclopedia of Needlework]] that was translated into 17 languages. This book had [[product placement]] as it recommended products from Dollfus' company,&lt;ref name=ledbetter&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ledbetter|first1=Kathryn|title=Victorian Needlework|date=2012|publisher=Crafts &amp; Hobbies|isbn=0313386609|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0313386609}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established Dollfus' company as a publisher of textile patterns. After Dillmont died, the brand was continued and in 2004 a Russian translation of Dillmont's book was published.&lt;ref name="Maines2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rachel Maines|Rachel P.

Dollfus died in 1887 and his business continued under the leadership of his grandchildren.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

[[File:Maxwell's demon.svg|right|310px|thumb|Schematic figure of Maxwell's demon]]

In the [[philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]], '''Maxwell's demon''' is a [[thought experiment]] created by the physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1867 in which he suggested how the [[second law of thermodynamics]] might hypothetically be violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cargill Gilston Knott |title=Life and Scientific Work of Peter Guthrie Tait |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1911 |pages=213–215 |chapter=Quote from undated letter from Maxwell to Tait | url=https://archive.org/stream/lifescientificwo00knotuoft#page/212/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the thought experiment, a [[Demon (thought experiment)|demon]] controls a small door between two chambers of gas. As individual gas molecules approach the door, the demon quickly opens and shuts the door so that only fast molecules are passed into one of the chambers, while only slow molecules are passed into the other. Because faster molecules are hotter, the demon's behaviour causes one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down, thereby decreasing [[entropy]] and violating the second law of thermodynamics.   This thought experiment has provoked debate and theoretical work on the relation between thermodynamics and [[information theory]] extending to the present day, with a number of scientists arguing that theoretical considerations rule out any practical device violating the second law in this way.

== Origin and history of the idea ==
The [[thought experiment]] first appeared in a letter [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] wrote to [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] on 11 December 1867. It appeared again in a letter to [[John William Strutt]] in 1871, before it was presented to the public in Maxwell's 1872 book on [[thermodynamics]] titled ''Theory of Heat''.&lt;ref name=Leff&gt;[[#Leff Rex 02|Leff &amp; Rex (2002)]], p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letters and books, Maxwell described the agent opening the door between the chambers as a "finite being". [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] was the first to use the word "demon" for Maxwell's concept, in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1874, and implied that he intended the mediating, rather than malevolent, connotation of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] |year=1874 |title=Kinetic theory of the dissipation of energy |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=9 |issue=232 |pages=441–444 |doi=10.1038/009441c0 |bibcode=1874Natur...9..441T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1879 |title=The sorting demon Of Maxwell |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution|volume=ix |issue=501 |page=113|bibcode=1879Natur..20Q.126. |doi=10.1038/020126a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite book |author=Alan S. Weber |year=2000 |title=Nineteenth Century Science: a Selection of Original Texts |publisher=[[Broadview Press]] |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original thought experiment ==
The second law of thermodynamics ensures (through statistical probability) that two bodies of different [[temperature]], when brought into contact with each other and isolated from the rest of the Universe, will evolve to a thermodynamic equilibrium in which both bodies have approximately the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Bennett87"&gt;{{cite journal

Maxwell conceived a thought experiment as a way of furthering the understanding of the second law. His description of the experiment is as follows:&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell (1871), reprinted in [[#Leff Rex 90|Leff &amp; Rex (1990)]] on p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... if we conceive of a being whose faculties are so sharpened that he can follow every molecule in its course, such a being, whose attributes are as essentially finite as our own, would be able to do what is impossible to us. For we have seen that molecules in a vessel full of air at uniform temperature are moving with velocities by no means uniform, though the mean velocity of any great number of them, arbitrarily selected, is almost exactly uniform. Now let us suppose that such a vessel is divided into two portions, ''A'' and ''B'', by a division in which there is a small hole, and that a being, who can see the individual molecules, opens and closes this hole, so as to allow only the swifter molecules to pass from ''A'' to ''B'', and only the slower molecules to pass from ''B'' to ''A''. He will thus, without expenditure of work, raise the temperature of ''B'' and lower that of ''A'', in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.}}In other words, Maxwell imagines one container divided into two parts, ''A'' and ''B''.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parts are filled with the same [[gas]] at equal temperatures and placed next to each other. Observing the [[molecule]]s on both sides, an imaginary [[Demon (thought experiment)|demon]] guards a trapdoor between the two parts. When a faster-than-average molecule from ''A'' flies towards the trapdoor, the demon opens it, and the molecule will fly from ''A'' to ''B''. Likewise, when a slower-than-average molecule from ''B'' flies towards the trapdoor, the demon will let it pass from ''B'' to ''A''. The average [[speed]] of the molecules in ''B'' will have increased while in ''A'' they will have slowed down on average. Since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature, the temperature decreases in ''A'' and increases in ''B'', contrary to the second law of thermodynamics.  A [[heat engine]] operating between the thermal reservoirs ''A'' and ''B'' could extract useful [[work (physics)|work]] from this temperature difference.

The demon must allow molecules to pass in both directions in order to produce only a temperature difference; one-way passage only of faster-than-average molecules from ''A'' to ''B'' will cause higher temperature and pressure to develop on the ''B'' side.

== Criticism and development ==
Several physicists have presented calculations that show that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] will not actually be violated, if a more complete analysis is made of the whole system including the demon.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BennettSchumacher"&gt;{{cite journal

That is, it would take more thermodynamic work to gauge the speed of the molecules and selectively allow them to pass through the opening between ''A'' and ''B'' than the amount of [[energy]] gained by the difference of temperature caused by this.

One of the most famous responses to this question was suggested in 1929 by [[Leó Szilárd]],&lt;ref name="Szilard"&gt;{{cite journal

Since the demon and the gas are interacting, we must consider the total entropy of the gas and the demon combined. The expenditure of energy by the demon will cause an increase in the entropy of the demon, which will be larger than the lowering of the entropy of the gas.

In 1960, [[Rolf Landauer]] raised an exception to this argument.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landauer"&gt;{{cite journal

He suggested these "reversible" measurements could be used to sort the molecules, violating the Second Law. However, due to [[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory|the connection between]] thermodynamic entropy and [[information entropy]], this also meant that the recorded measurement must not be erased. In other words, to determine whether to let a molecule through, the demon must acquire information about the state of the molecule and either discard it or store it. Discarding it leads to immediate increase in entropy but the demon cannot store it indefinitely: In 1982, [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] showed that, however well prepared, eventually the demon will run out of information storage space and must begin to erase the information it has previously gathered.&lt;ref name="Sagawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett82"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = C.

Although Bennett had reached the same conclusion as Szilard’s 1929 paper, that a Maxwellian demon could not violate the second law because entropy would be created, he had reached it for different reasons.  Regarding [[Landauer's principle]], the minimum energy dissipated by deleting information was experimentally measured by Eric Lutz ''et al.'' in 2012. Furthermore, Lutz ''et al.'' confirmed that in order to approach the Landauer's limit, the system must asymptotically approach zero processing speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=jobs |url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-unavoidable-cost-of-computation-revealed-1.10186 |title=The unavoidable cost of computation revealed : Nature News &amp; Comment |publisher=Nature.com |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Earman]] and John D. Norton have argued that Szilárd and Landauer's explanations of Maxwell's demon begin by assuming that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] cannot be violated by the demon, and derive further properties of the demon from this assumption, including the necessity of consuming energy when erasing information, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John Earman  |author2=John D.

Bennett later acknowledged the validity of Earman and Norton's argument, while maintaining that [[Landauer's principle]] explains the mechanism by which real systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charles H.

== Recent progress ==
Although the argument by Landauer and Bennett only answers the consistency between the second law of thermodynamics and the whole cyclic process of the entire system of a [[Szilard engine]] (a composite system of the engine and the demon), a recent approach based on the [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] for small fluctuating systems has provided deeper insight on each information process with each subsystem. From this viewpoint, the measurement process is regarded as a process where the correlation ([[mutual information]]) between the engine and the demon increases, and the feedback process is regarded as a process where the correlation decreases. If the correlation changes, thermodynamic relations as the second law of thermodynamics and the [[fluctuation theorem]] for each subsystem should be modified, and for the case of external control a second-law like inequality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hugo Touchette  |author2=Seth Lloyd  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000 |title=Information-Theoretic Limits of Control |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=84 |issue=6  |pages=1156–1159 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.1156|bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84.1156T |pmid=11017467|arxiv=chao-dyn/9905039  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a generalized fluctuation theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takahiro Sagawa  |author2=Masahito Ueda   |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=Generalized Jarzynski Equality under Nonequilibrium Feedback Control |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=104 |issue=9   |pages=090602 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.090602|pmid=20366975   |arxiv = 0907.4914 |bibcode = 2010PhRvL.104i0602S }}&lt;/ref&gt; with mutual information are satisfied. These relations suggest that we need extra thermodynamic cost to increase correlation (measurement case), and in contrast we can apparently violate the second law up to the consumption of correlation (feedback case).

== Applications ==
Real-life versions of Maxwellian demons occur, but all such "real demons" have their entropy-lowering effects duly balanced by increase of entropy elsewhere. Molecular-sized mechanisms are no longer found only in biology; they are also the subject of the emerging field of [[nanotechnology]]. Single-atom traps used by particle physicists allow an experimenter to control the state of individual quanta in a way similar to Maxwell's demon.

If hypothetical [[mirror matter]] exists, Zurab Silagadze proposes that demons can be envisaged, "which can act like perpetuum mobiles of the second kind: extract heat energy from only one reservoir, use it to do work and be isolated from the rest of ordinary world. Yet the Second Law is not violated because the demons pay their entropy cost in the hidden (mirror) sector of the world by emitting mirror photons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0608114 |title=Maxwell's demon through the looking glass |journal=Acta Physica Polonica B |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=101–126 |year=2007 |last1=Silagadze |first1=Z.

== Experimental work ==
In the February 2007 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[David Leigh (scientist)|David Leigh]], a professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]], announced the creation of a nano-device based on the  [[Brownian ratchet]] popularized by [[Richard Feynman]]. Leigh's device is able to drive a chemical system out of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], but it must be powered by an external source ([[light]] in this case) and therefore does not violate thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature05452 | volume=445 | issue=7127 | title=A molecular information ratchet | journal=Nature | pages=523–527 | pmid=17268466 | date=February 2007 | last1 = Serreli | first1 = V | last2 = Lee | first2 = CF | last3 = Kay | first3 = ER | last4 = Leigh | first4 = DA| bibcode=2007Natur.445..523S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, researchers including Nobel Prize winner [[Fraser Stoddart]], created ring-shaped molecules called [[rotaxane]]s which could be placed on an axle connecting two sites, ''A'' and ''B''. Particles from either site would bump into the ring and move it from end to end. If a large collection of these devices were placed in a system, half of the devices had the ring at site ''A'' and half at ''B'', at any given moment in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bissell|first1=Richard A|last2=Córdova|first2=Emilio|last3=Kaifer|first3=Angel E.|last4=Stoddart|first4=J.

Leigh made a minor change to the axle so that if a light is shone on the device, the center of the axle will thicken, restricting the motion of the ring. It only keeps the ring from moving, however, if it is at ''A''. Over time, therefore, the rings will be bumped from ''B'' to ''A'' and get stuck there, creating an imbalance in the system. In his experiments, Leigh was able to take a pot of "billions of these devices" from 50:50 equilibrium to a 70:30 imbalance within a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Katharine Sanderson |date=31 January 2007 |title=A demon of a device |publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= |doi=10.1038/news070129-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Mark G. Raizen]] developed a laser atomic cooling technique which realizes the process Maxwell envisioned of sorting individual atoms in a gas into different containers based on their energy.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raizen2009"&gt;{{cite journal

The operation of the one-way wall relies on an irreversible atomic and molecular process of absorption of a photon at a specific wavelength, followed by spontaneous emission to a different internal state. The irreversible process is coupled to a conservative force created by magnetic fields and/or light. Raizen and collaborators proposed using the one-way wall in order to reduce the entropy of an ensemble of atoms. In parallel, Gonzalo Muga and Andreas Ruschhaupt independently developed a similar concept. Their "atom diode" was not proposed for cooling, but rather for regulating the flow of atoms. The Raizen Group demonstrated significant cooling of atoms with the one-way wall in a series of experiments in 2008. Subsequently, the operation of a one-way wall for atoms was demonstrated by Daniel Steck and collaborators later in 2008. Their experiment was based on the 2005 scheme for the one-way wall, and was not used for cooling. The cooling method realized by the Raizen Group was called "single-photon cooling", because only one photon on average is required in order to bring an atom to near-rest. This is in contrast to other laser cooling techniques which use the momentum of the photon and require a two-level cycling transition.

In 2006, Raizen, Muga, and Ruschhaupt showed in a theoretical paper that as each atom crosses the one-way wall, it scatters one photon, and information is provided about the turning point and hence the energy of that particle. The entropy increase of the radiation field scattered from a directional laser into a random direction is exactly balanced by the entropy reduction of the atoms as they are trapped by the one-way wall.

This technique is widely described as a "Maxwell's demon" because it realizes Maxwell's process of creating a temperature difference by sorting high and low energy atoms into different containers.  However, scientists have pointed out that it is not a true Maxwell's demon in the sense that it does not violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]];&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzel"&gt;{{cite web

This is because the process requires more energy from the laser beams than could be produced by the temperature difference generated.  The atoms absorb low entropy photons from the laser beam and emit them in a random direction, thus increasing the entropy of the environment.&lt;ref name="Bennett87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Orzel" /&gt;

== As metaphor ==
[[Daemon (computing)|Daemons in computing]], generally processes that run on servers to respond to users, are named for Maxwell's demon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.takeourword.com/TOW146/page4.html|author=[[Fernando J. Corbató]]|title=Take Our Word for It|date=2002-01-23|accessdate=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Henry Brooks Adams]] in his manuscript ''[[The Rule of Phase Applied to History]]'' attempted to use Maxwell's demon as a historical [[metaphor]], though he misunderstood and misapplied the original principle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cater|Cater (1947)]], pp. 640–647; see also Daub (1970), reprinted in [[#Leff Rex 90|Leff &amp; Rex (1990)]], pp. 37–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams interpreted [[history]] as a process moving towards "equilibrium", but he saw [[militarism|militaristic]] nations (he felt [[Germany]] pre-eminent in this class) as tending to reverse this process, a Maxwell's demon of history. Adams made many attempts to respond to the criticism of his formulation from his scientific colleagues, but the work remained incomplete at Adams' death in 1918. It was only published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adams|Adams (1919)]], p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] incorporated Maxwell's demon into his work, "[[Raisons Pratiques]]" as a metaphor for the socioeconomic inequality among students, as maintained by the school system, the economy, and families.

==In fiction==
A machine powered by Maxwell's demon plays a role in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]''.

The demon is mentioned several times in ''[[The Cyberiad]]'', a series of short stories by the noted science fiction writer [[Stanisław Lem]]. In the book the demon appears both in its original form and in a modified form where it uses its knowledge of all particles in the box in order to surmise general (but unfocused and random) facts about the rest of the universe.

The demon is implied in [[Larry Niven]]'s short story "[[Unfinished Story Nr 2]]", within the context of a world of magic, depending on local concentrations of 'manna', a prerequirement for magic such that magic is no longer possible after manna has been locally depleted.

==Microturbine technology==
The components of any [[turbine]] engine&amp;nbsp;— the [[gas compressor]], the [[combustion chamber]], and the [[turbine]] rotor&amp;nbsp;— are fabricated from etched [[silicon]], much like [[integrated circuits]]. The technology holds the promise of ten times the operating time of a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] of the same weight as the micropower unit, and similar [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] to large [[Electricity generation|utility gas turbines]]. Researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] have thus far succeeded in fabricating the parts for such a micro turbine out of six etched and stacked silicon wafers, and are working toward combining them into a functioning engine about the size of a U.S. [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] coin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060920083253.htm] "Engine on a chip promises to best the battery," ScienceDaily, viewed 9/20/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Georgia Tech]] have built a micro generator 10&amp;nbsp;mm wide, which spins a [[magnet]] above an array of coils fabricated on a silicon chip. The device spins at 100,000 revolutions per minute, and produces 1.1 [[watt]]s of [[electric power|electrical power]], sufficient to operate a [[cell phone]]. Their goal is to produce 20 to 50 watts, sufficient to power a [[laptop]] computer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050123222705.htm] "Georgia Tech microgenerator can power electronics," ScienceDaily, 1/25/2005, viewed 9/20/2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Sanjeev Mukerjee of [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]]'s chemistry department is developing fuel cells for the military that will burn hydrogen to power portable electronic equipment, such as night vision goggles, computers, and communication equipment. In his system, a cartridge of [[methanol]] would be used to produce hydrogen to run a small fuel cell for up to 5,000 hours. It would be lighter than rechargeable batteries needed to provide the same power output, with a longer run time. Similar technology could be improved and expanded in future years to power automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/04/040421235221.htm] "Military Looks To Northeastern Professor For A Future Powered By Fuel Cells."

The [[windbelt]] is a micropower technology invented by Shawn Frayne. It is essentially an [[aeolian harp]], except that it exploits the motion of the string produced by aeroelastic flutter to create a physical oscillation that can be converted to electricity.

A '''mound system''' is an alternative to the traditional rural [[septic system]] [[drain field]].  The mound system is an engineered drain field used in areas where septic systems are more prone to failure due to having extremely [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] or impermeable soils, [[soil]] with shallow cover over porous bedrock, and soils that have a high seasonal [[water table]].&lt;ref name="WI1"&gt;Converse, J.C., and J.E. Tyler. 2000. "WISCONSIN MOUND SOIL ABSORPTION SYSTEM:." Accessed on 10 Oct. 2007. [http://www.soils.wisc.edu/sswmp/SSWMP_15.24.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary waste liquids cleaning and purification action in a drain field is performed by a [[biofilm]] in the loose fill surrounding the perforated drain tile. If the soil permeability is too low, liquid is not absorbed fast enough, resulting in surface ponding of unsanitary liquids. If the soil permeability is too high, or is exposed to  fractured bedrock, the wastewater quickly penetrates down to the water table before the biofilm has time to purify the water leading to contamination of the [[aquifer]]. In either situation, the mound system provides an ideal habitat for the biofilm and has the correct permeability to assure slow absorption of effluent into the mound before exiting as purified water into the surrounding environment.

==History==

The mound system was originally designed in the 1940s by the [[North Dakota State University|North Dakota College of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt; It was known as the Nodak Disposal System.  In 1976 the [[University of Wisconsin]] studied the mound systems under the university's Waste Management Project.  This project published the first design manual indicating the appropriate site conditions and design criteria for mounds. In 2000 a new manual was released.&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt;

==Design==
The mound system includes a [[septic tank]], a dosing chamber, and a mound.  Waste from homes is sent to the septic tank where the solid fraction settles to the bottom of the tank.  The effluent is sent to a second tank called a ''dosing chamber,'' from which the effluent is distributed to the mound at a metered rate (in ''doses'').  Wastewater is partially treated as it moves through the mound sand.  Final treatment and disposal occurs in the soil beneath the mound.  The mound system can also better handle the effluent since it doesn't all come into the mound at once allowing it to clean the effluent better which helps to keep the system from failing.

The absorption mound is built in layers at different depths. The depths of these layers are determined by the depth of the limiting layer of the soil, which may be a seasonal [[water table]], bedrock, [[fragipan]], or [[Till|glacial till]].&lt;ref name="Ohio8"&gt;Hamilton County General Health District. 2005. Household Sewage Treatment System. Hamilton County. Accessed on Oct. 15, 2007. [http://www.hamiltoncountyhealth.org/files/files/Fact%20Sheets/Water%20Quality/HSTS%20Manual/HSTS%20Manual%20Part%201.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;  Standards created by [[Ohio State University]] state that 24&amp;nbsp;inches of natural soil should be above the limiting layer in the soil. A layer of specifically sized sand is placed on top of the natural soil so that the natural soil and sand reach a depth of 4 feet. The distribution pipes that are fed by the dosing chamber are placed on top of the sand in layers of gravel. Then [[Geotextile|construction fabric]] and soil are placed on top of the gravel to help keep the pipes from freezing.  The top layer of soil also allows the mound to be planted with grass or non-woody plants in order to control erosion &lt;ref name="Ref7"&gt;7 Mancl, K. 2001. Managing Septic Tank-Mound Systems. Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet. Ohio State University. Accessed on 15 Oct 2007 [http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0753.html Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213191927/http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0753.html |date=2007-12-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When installing a mound system, the soil in the area where the mound is to be placed will not be compacted or disturbed. Any trees that are on the area are cut away at ground level, and the roots and stumps left in place.  The surface of the area for the mound is then roughened up with a [[Plow#Chisel plough|chisel plough]]. This prepares the area for the sand. Work is done from upslope of the mound area so that the ground down slope of the mound does not get compacted. Tyler tables are used to help determine the area of a mound.

Time dosing is an important aspect in the functioning of the mound system.  Research done by Darby on sand filters showed that short frequent doses of effluent onto sand filters with orifices that are closely spaced helps to improve effluent quality.&lt;ref name="Ref10"&gt;Ohio Department of Health. 2007.

This does not give the biota the proper amount of time to clean the effluent.&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt;

'''NACA Report No. 964 - The effects of variations in Reynolds number between 3.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and 25.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; upon the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of NACA 6-series airfoil sections''' was published by the United States [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1950. It contained a series of graphs showing the resulting lift and drag of several NACA 6-series airfoil sections from tests performed in a variable-density wind tunnel, in which the [[Reynolds number]] (RN) was set at three different values.

==Summary==
Results are presented of an investigation made to determine the two-dimensional lift and drag characteristics of nine NACA 6-series airfoil sections at RN of 15.0, 20.0, and 25.0 million. Also presented are data from NACA Rep. 824 for the same airfoils at RN of 3.0, 6.0, and 9.0 million. The airfoils selected represent sections having variations in the airfoil thickness, thickness form, and camber. The characteristics of an airfoil with a split flap were determined in one instance, as was the effect of surface roughness. Qualitative explanations in terms of flow behavior are advanced for the observed types of scale effect.

==Introduction==
Two-dimensional aerodynamic data obtained at RN of 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0 million are now generally available for a large number of systematically derived NACA airfoil sections. This range of RN is sufficient to satisfy engineering needs for many practical applications, but the recent trends toward both very large and very high-speed aircraft have emphasized the necessity for aerodynamic data at higher values. An investigation has accordingly been made of the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of systematically varied NACA 6-series airfoils at RN of 15.0, 20.0 and 25.0 million. The results of this investigation at high RN together with those for the same airfoils at lower RN are presented in Report No. 964. 
The NACA 63 series was chosen as the basic group for investigation because these airfoils appear to offer good low-speed characteristics with a minimum of compromise from consideration of the high-speed characteristics. In all cases, only lift and drag were measured.

==Apparatus==
All the tests were made in the [[Variable Density Tunnel|Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence pressure tunnel]]. The test section of this tunnel measures 3 x 7.5 feet, and the model completely spanned the 3-foot dimension. Seals were installed between the ends of the model and the tunnel walls to prevent air leakage.

==Test results==

===Drag===
The reaction of the minimum drag coefficient of smooth airfoils to increasing RN is attributed to the relative strengths of two interacting boundary-layer changes. A thinning of the boundary layer with increasing RN gives a gradual decrease of minimum drag. As the RN is increased beyond a certain value, however, the transition point begins to move forward and the drag increases.
The flow conditions of the thicker airfoils are more favorable for delaying the forward movement of transition.

The addition of standard roughness to the NACA 63-009 section causes a large increase in the minimum drag at all RN, but increasing the RN has a favorable effect in reducing the drag.

Increasing the RN from 9.0 to 15.0 million resulted in the almost complete disappearance of the low-drag range of all the airfoils except that of 18% thickness.

===Lift===
The [[Zero lift axis|angle of zero lift]] of the [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered airfoils]] showed almost no variation with RN.
Throughout the range of RN of this investigation, the values of the lift-curve slope for the smooth sections are very close to that predicted by [[Airfoil#Thin airfoil theory|thin-airfoil theory]] (2π per radian, or 0.110 per degree).
The effects of increasing RN on the maximum lift showed two general trends: for airfoils of 12% thickness or less, the maximum lift remains relatively constant over the lower range of RN. Increasing the RN, however, causes a rapid increase in maximum lift; the 18% thick airfoils demonstrated a steady increase of maximum lift as RN is increased.

==Concluding remarks==
The 18% thick section had a type of maximum-lift variation with the RN that was entirely different from the thinner sections. Any comparison of airfoil maximum-lift characteristics can be made only if the data for the group of airfoils under consideration are available at the same RN. The choice of an optimum airfoil for maximum lift for a given application must be determined from data corresponding to the operating RN of the application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4421">{{short description|Storage vessel for oxygen}}
An '''oxygen tank''' is an [[oxygen storage]] vessel, which is either held under [[pressure]] in [[gas cylinder]]s, or as [[liquid oxygen]] in a [[cryogenic]] storage tank.

==Uses==
Oxygen tanks are used to store gas for:

* medical [[breathing gas]] at medical facilities and at home
* breathing at altitude in aviation, either in an [[uncontrolled decompression]] emergency, or constantly (in the case of unpressurized aircraft)
* oxygen first aid kits
* [[oxygen therapy]]
* [[gas blending]], for creating diving breathing mixes such as [[nitrox]], [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] and [[heliox]] 
* open-circuit [[scuba set]]s - mainly used for accelerated [[decompression stop|decompression]] in [[technical diving]]
* some types of diving [[rebreather]]: oxygen rebreathers and fully closed circuit rebreathers
* use in climbing, "[[Bottled oxygen (climbing)|Bottled oxygen]]" refers to oxygen tanks for mountaineering
* industrial processes, including the manufacture of [[steel]] and [[monel]]
* [[oxyacetylene]] [[welding]] equipment, glass lampworking torches, and some gas [[cutting torch]]es
* use as [[liquid rocket propellants]] for [[rocket engine]]s 
* athletes, specifically on [[American football]] sidelines, to expedite recovery after exertion.&lt;ref name=brsdc48&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QM8zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v_UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7130%2C5508451 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=AP photo |title=Breather |date=November 13, 1948 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breathing oxygen is delivered from the storage tank to users by use of the following methods: [[oxygen mask]], [[nasal cannula]], [[full face diving mask]], [[diving helmet]], [[demand valve]], oxygen [[rebreather]], [[built in breathing system]] (BIBS), [[oxygen tent]], and [[hyperbaric oxygen]] chamber.

Contrary to popular belief [[scuba diving|scuba divers]] very rarely carry oxygen tanks. The vast majority of divers breathe air or [[nitrox]] stored in a [[diving cylinder]]. A small minority breathe [[trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]], [[heliox]] or other [[Breathing gas|exotic gases]]. Some of these may carry pure oxygen for accelerated decompression or as a component of a rebreather. Some shallow divers, particularly naval divers, use oxygen rebreathers or have done so historically.

Oxygen is rarely held at pressures higher than {{convert|200|bar|psi|-3}}, due to the risks of fire triggered by high temperatures caused by [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic heating]] when the gas changes pressure when moving from one vessel to another.  Medical use liquid oxygen ''airgas'' tanks are typically {{convert|350|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

All equipment coming into contact with high pressure oxygen must be "oxygen clean" and "oxygen compatible", to reduce the risk of [[fire]].&lt;ref name=navseaCleaning&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cleaning and gas analysis for diving applications handbook. |author=NAVSEA |year=2005 |journal=NAVSEA Technical Manual |volume=SS521-AK-HBK-010 |publisher=NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7563 |accessdate=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasaCompatable&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guide for Oxygen Compatibility Assessments on Oxygen Components and Systems. |author1=Rosales, KR |author2=Shoffstall, MS |author3=Stoltzfus, JM |year=2007 |volume=NASA/TM-2007-213740 |journal=NASA, Johnson Space Center Technical Report|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4861 |accessdate=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Oxygen clean" means the removal of any substance that could act as a source of [[Combustion|ignition]]. "Oxygen compatible" means that internal components must not burn readily or degrade easily in a high pressure oxygen environment.

In some countries there are legal and insurance requirements and restrictions on the use, storage and transport of pure oxygen. Oxygen tanks are normally stored in well-ventilated locations, far from potential sources of fire and concentrations of people.

'''Personal care''' or '''toiletries''' are [[consumer]] [[Product (business)|products]] used in [[personal hygiene]] and for [[beautification]].

==Subsectors==
[[Subsector]]s of personal care include [[personal hygiene]] and [[cosmetics]].

There is a distinction between [[personal hygienic]] items, which are necessities, and cosmetics, which are [[luxury good]]s solely used for beautification. In practice, such sundries are often intermixed in retail store aisles.

==Products==
[[File:Katalog vintern 1905-1906. AB Nordiska Kompaniet. Hår-, Toalett- &amp; Tandvatten, Pomada &amp; Brilliantine - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0040796.jpg|thumb|Swedish ad for toiletries, 1905/1906.]]
Personal care includes products as diverse as [[cleansing pads]], [[perfume|cologne]]s, [[cotton swab]]s, [[cotton pad]]s, [[deodorant]], [[eye liner]], [[facial tissue]], [[hair clipper]]s, [[lip gloss]], [[lipstick]], [[lip balm]], [[lotion]], [[makeup]], [[hand soap]], [[cleanser|facial cleanser]], [[body wash]], [[nail file]]s, [[pomade]], [[perfume]]s, [[razor]]s, [[shaving cream]], [[moisturizer]], [[talcum powder]], [[toilet paper]], [[toothpaste]], [[facial treatment]]s, [[wet wipe]]s, and [[shampoo]].

==Hotel application==
Typical toiletries offered at many hotels include:
* small bar of [[soap]]
* disposable shower cap
* small bottle of moisturizer
* small bottles of shampoo and conditioner
* toilet paper
* box of [[facial tissue]]
* face towels
* disposable shoe polishing cloth
* Toothpaste
* Toothbrush
* Cologne

==Corporations==
Some of the major [[corporation]]s in the personal care industry are:

'''Power-to-X''' (also '''P2X''' and '''P2Y''') has two meanings.  First, power-to-X refers to a number of [[electricity]] [[energy transformation|conversion]], [[energy storage]], and reconversion pathways that utilize surplus [[electric power]], typically during periods where fluctuating [[renewable energy]] generation exceeds load.&lt;ref name="acatech-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, power-to-X refers to conversion technologies that allow for the decoupling of power from the electricity sector for use in other sectors (such as transport or chemicals), possibly using power that has been provided by additional investments in generation.&lt;ref name="acatech-2016"/&gt;  The term power-to-x is widely used in [[Germany]] and may have originated there.

The '''X''' in the terminology can refer to one of the following: power-to-[[ammonia]], power-to-[[feedstock|chemicals]], power-to-[[fuel]], [[power to gas|power-to-gas]], power-to-[[thermal energy|heat]], [[Power to gas#Power to hydrogen|power-to-hydrogen]], power-to-[[synthetic fuel|liquid]], [[Power to gas#Power to methane|power-to-methane]], power-to-mobility, power-to-power, and power-to-[[syngas]].

Collectively power-to-X schemes which use surplus power fall under the heading of flexibility measures and are particularly useful in energy systems with high shares of renewable generation and/or with strong [[Low-carbon economy|decarbonization]] targets.&lt;ref name="acatech-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lund-etal-2015"/&gt;  A large number of pathways and technologies are encompassed by the term. In 2016 the German government funded a €30{{nbsp}}million first-phase research project into power-to-X options.&lt;ref name="rwth-2016"&gt;

Power-to-mobility refers to the charging of [[battery (electricity)|battery]] [[electric vehicle]]s (EV).  Given the expected uptake of EVs, dedicated dispatch will be required. As vehicles are idle for most of the time, shifting the charging time can offer considerable flexibility: the charging window is a relatively long 8–12{{nbsp}}hours, whereas the charging duration is around 90{{nbsp}}minutes.&lt;ref name="lund-etal-2015"/&gt; The EV batteries can also be discharged to the grid to make them work as electricity storage devices, but this causes additional wear to the battery.&lt;ref name="lund-etal-2015"/&gt;

Heat pumps with hot water storage and electric vehicles have been found to have higher potential on reduction of {{CO2}} emissions and fossil fuel use than several other power-to-X or electricity storage schemes for using surplus wind and solar power.&lt;ref name=sternberg-etal-2015/&gt;

The '''Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) 2014/68/EU (formerly 97/23/EC)'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/pressure-gas/pressure-equipment/directive_en European Commission Pressure Equipment Directive (PED): overview]&lt;/ref&gt; of the EU sets out the [[standardization|standards]] for the [[Engineering design|design]] and [[Fabrication (metal)|fabrication]] of [[pressure]] equipment ("pressure equipment" means [[steam boiler]]s, [[pressure vessel]]s, [[piping]], [[safety valve]]s and other components and assemblies subject to pressure loading) generally over one litre in volume and having a maximum pressure more than 0.5 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] gauge. It also sets the administrative procedures requirements for the "conformity assessment" of pressure equipment, for the free placing on the European market without local legislative barriers. It has been mandatory throughout the EU since 30 May 2002, with 2014 revision fully effective as of 19 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lr.org/en/news-and-insight/articles/revising-the-pressure-equipment-directive.aspx|title=Revising the Pressure Equipment Directive: Why now, and what’s changing?|website=''lr.org''|access-date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enacted in the UK as the Pressure Equipment Regulations (PER).
The set out standards and regulations regarding [[pressure vessels]] and [[boilers]] safety is also very close to the US standards defined by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME). This enables most international inspection agencies to provide both verification and certification services to assess compliance to the different pressure equipment directives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/plants_machinery_1/pressure_equipment_2/asme_1/asme.html Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspection According to ASME]&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic '''process control''' in [[Continuous production|continuous production processes]] is a combination of [[control engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]] disciplines that uses [[industrial control system]]s  to achieve a production level of consistency, economy and safety which could not be achieved purely by human manual control. It is implemented widely in industries such as oil refining, pulp and paper manufacturing, chemical processing and power generating  plants.

There is a wide range of size, type and complexity, but it enables a small number of operators to manage complex processes to a high degree of consistency. The development of large automatic process control systems was instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes, which could not be otherwise economically or safely operated.

The applications can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel, to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand [[control loop]]s.

==History==
Early process control breakthroughs came most frequently in the form of water control devices. Ktesibios of Alexandria is credited for inventing float valves to regulate water level of water clocks in the 3rd Century BC. In the 1st Century AD, Heron of Alexandria invented a water valve similar to the fill valve used in modern toilets.&lt;ref name="Young etal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=William Y|last2=Svrcek|first2=Donald P|last3=Mahoney|first3=Brent R|title=A Real Time Approach to Process Control|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Chichester, West Sussex, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1119993872|pages=1–2|edition=3|chapter=1: A Brief History of Control and Simulation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later process controls inventions involved basic physics principles. In 1620, Cornlis Drebbel invented a bimetallic thermostat for controlling the temperature in a furnace. In 1681, Denis Papin discovered the pressure inside a vessel could be regulated by placing weights on top of the vessel lid.&lt;ref name = 'Young etal'/&gt; In 1745, Edmund Lee created the fantail to improve windmill efficiency; a fantail was a smaller windmill placed 90° of the larger fans to keep the face of the windmill pointed directly into the oncoming wind.

With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 1760s, process controls inventions were aimed to replace human operators with mechanized processes.  In 1784, Oliver Evans created a water-powered flourmill which operated using buckets and screw conveyors. Henry Ford applied the same theory in 1910 when the assembly line was created to decrease human intervention in the automobile production process.&lt;ref name = 'Young etal'/&gt;

For continuously variable process control it was not until 1922 that a formal control law for what we now call [[PID control]] or three-term control was first developed using theoretical analysis, by [[Russian American]] engineer [[Nicolas Minorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Nicolas |authorlink=Nicolas Minorsky |title=Directional stability of automatically steered bodies |journal=J. Amer. Soc. Naval Eng. |year=1922 |volume=34 |pages=280–309 |issue=2 |ref=harv |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; |doi=10.1111/j.1559-3584.1922.tb04958.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy and based his analysis on observations of a [[helmsman]]. He noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error, but also on past error, as well as the current rate of change;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=VD_b81J3yFoC&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was then given a mathematical treatment by Minorsky.&lt;ref name="ben96"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His goal was stability, not general control, which simplified the problem significantly. While proportional control provided stability against small disturbances, it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance, notably a stiff gale (due to [[#Steady-state error|steady-state error]]), which required adding the integral term. Finally, the derivative term was added to improve stability and control.

==Development of modern process control operations==
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A modern control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process.

With the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control system was born.

The introduction of DCSs allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

==Hierarchy==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation.]]
The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels in a large process using processor and computer-based control.

Referring to the diagram;

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors (process value readings - PV), and final control elements (FCE), such as [[control valve]]s
* Level 1 contains the industrialised Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

==Control model==

To determine the fundamental model for any process, the inputs and outputs of the system are defined differently than for other chemical processes.&lt;ref name="Bequette"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bequette|first1=B. Wayne|title=Process control: Modeling, Design, and Simulation|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=978-0133536409|pages=57–58|edition=Prentice-Hall International series in the physical and chemical engineering science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance equations are defined by the control inputs and outputs rather than the material inputs. The control model is a set of equations used to predict the behavior of a system and can help determine what the response to change will be.

*State Variable (x) - This is a measurable variable that is a good indicator of the state of the system, such as temperature (energy balance), volume (mass balance) or concentration (component balance). 
*Input Variable (u) - This is a specified variable that commonly include flow rates. It's important to note that the entering and exiting flows are both considered control inputs. The control input can be classified as a manipulated, disturbance, or unmonitored variable.
*Parameters (p) - The parameters are usually a physical limitation and something that is fixed for the system, such as the vessel volume or the viscosity of the material.
*Output (y) - The output is the metric used to determine the behavior of the system. The control output can be classified as measured, unmeasured, or unmonitored.

==Types==
Processes can be characterized as one or more of the following forms:

*Batch –  Some applications require that specific quantities of raw materials be combined in specific ways for particular duration to produce an intermediate or end result.  One example is the production of adhesives and glues, which normally require the mixing of raw materials in a heated vessel for a period of time to form a quantity of end product. Other important examples are the production of food, beverages and medicine. Batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year (a few pounds to millions of pounds).
*Continuous – Often, a physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time.  The control of the water temperature in a heating jacket, for example, is an example of continuous process control. Some important continuous processes are the production of fuels, chemicals and plastics. Continuous processes in manufacturing are used to produce very large quantities of product per year (millions to billions of pounds). Such controls use [[feedback control|feedback]] such as in the [[PID controller]] A PID Controller includes proportional, integrating, and derivative controller functions.
*Hybrid - Applications having elements of batch and continuous process control are often called ''hybrid'' applications.

==Control loops==
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Example of a continuous flow control loop. Signalling is by industry standard 4-20 mA current loops, and a "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] ensures the [[control valve]] operates correctly.]]
The fundamental building block of any industrial control system is the [[control loop]], which controls just one process variable. An example is shown in the accompanying diagram, where the flow rate in a pipe is controlled by a PID controller, assisted by what is effectively a cascaded loop in the form of a valve servo-controller to ensure correct valve positioning.

Some large systems may have several hundreds or thousands of control loops. In complex processes the loops are interactive, so that the operation of one loop may affect the operation of another. The system diagram for representing control loops is a [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]].

Commonly used controllers are [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC), [[Distributed Control System]] (DCS) or [[SCADA]].

[[File:Auxostat schematic.svg|thumb|Example of level control system of a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]]. The flow control into the tank would be cascaded off the level control. ]]

A further example is shown. If a control valve were used to hold level in a tank, the level controller would compare the equivalent reading of a level sensor to the level setpoint and determine whether more or less valve opening was necessary to keep the level constant. A cascaded flow controller could then calculate the change in the valve position.

==Economic advantages==
The economic nature of many products manufactured in batch and continuous processes require highly efficient operation due to thin margins. The competing factor in process control is that products must meet certain specifications in order to be satisfactory. These specifications can come in two forms: a minimum and maximum for a property of the material or product, or a range within which the property must be.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=C L|title=Process Control for the Process Industries - Part 2: Steady State Characteristics|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress|date=March 2017|pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; All loops are susceptible to disturbances and therefore a buffer must be used on process set points to ensure disturbances do not cause the material or product to go out of specifications. This buffer comes at an economic cost (i.e. additional processing, maintaining elevated or depressed process conditions, etc.).

Process efficiency can be enhanced by reducing the margins necessary to ensure product specifications are met.&lt;ref name =smith/&gt; This can be done by improving the control of the process to minimize the effect of disturbances on the process. The efficiency is improved in a two step method of narrowing the variance and shifting the target.&lt;ref name =smith/&gt; Margins can be narrowed through various process upgrades (i.e. equipment upgrades, enhanced control methods, etc.). Once margins are narrowed, an economic analysis can be done on the process to determine how the set point target is to be shifted. Less conservative process set points lead to increased economic efficiency.&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; Effective process control strategies increase the competitive advantage of manufacturers who employ them.

In rhPCR, the primers are designed with a removable amplification block on the 3’ end.  Amplification of the blocked primer is dependent on the cleavage activity of a [[hyperthermophilic]] [[archaeal]] Type II [[RNase H]] enzyme during hybridization to the complementary target sequence.  This RNase H enzyme possesses several useful characteristics that enhance the PCR.  First, it has very little enzymatic activity at low temperature, enabling a “[[hot start PCR]]” without modifications to the [[DNA polymerase]].    Second, the cleavage efficiency of the enzyme is reduced in the presence of mismatches near the RNA residue.  This allows for reduced [[primer dimer]] formation&lt;ref name="dobosy_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobosy JR, Rose SD, Beltz KR, Rupp SM, Powers KM, Behlke MA, Walder JA | title = RNase H-dependent PCR (rhPCR): improved specificity and single nucleotide polymorphism detection using blocked cleavable primers | journal = BMC Biotechnology | volume = 11 | pages = 80 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21831278 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-11-80 | pmc=3224242}}&lt;/ref&gt;, detection of [[alternative splicing]] variants&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/113/31/8765.long&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbc.org/content/289/1/387.long&lt;/ref&gt;, ability to perform [[multiplex PCR]] high higher numbers of PCR primers, and the ability to detect [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deep Transcriptome Sequencing of Two Green Algae, Chara vulgaris and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Provides No Evidence of Organellar RNA Editing|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/8/2/80|first1=A.

== Principle ==
rhPCR [[DNA primer|primers]] consist of three sections.  1) The 5’ DNA section, equivalent in length and melting temperature (Tm) requirements to a standard PCR primer, is extended after cleavage by the RNase HII enzyme.  2) A single RNA base provides the cleavage site for the RNase HII.  3) A short 3’ extension of four or five bases followed by a blocker (usually a short, non-extendable molecule like a [[propanediol]]) prevents extension by a DNA polymerase until removal.  A rhPCR reaction begins with the primers and template free in solution (Figure 1).  While free in solution, these primers are not deblocked by the RNase HII enzyme, as they must be in an RNA:DNA heteroduplex with the template to be cleaved.  Once bound to the template, the rhPCR primers are cleaved by the thermostable RNase HII enzyme.  This removes the block, allowing for the DNA polymerase to extend off of the primers.  The cycling of the PCR reaction continues the process.  rhPCR primers are designed so that after cleavage by the RNase H2 enzyme, the Tm of the primers are still greater than the annealing temperature of PCR reaction.  These primers can be used in both 5’ nuclease [[Taqman]] and [[SYBR Green]] types of [[quantitative PCR]]. 

== Applications ==
rhPCR can be used for [[quantitative PCR]] and medical or environmental laboratories:

* ''[[Gene expression]]'' assays

* ''[[Alternative splicing]]''

* ''[[SNP genotyping]]''

* ''[[Multiplex PCR]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6654">In [[telecommunications]], '''return loss''' is the loss of [[power (physics)|power]] in the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] returned/reflected by a discontinuity in a [[transmission line]] or [[optical fiber]].  This discontinuity can be a mismatch with the terminating load or with a device inserted in the line.  It is usually expressed as a ratio in [[decibel]]s (dB);

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''RL''(dB) is the return loss in dB, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the incident power and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the reflected power.
Return loss is related to both [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR) and [[reflection coefficient]] (Γ).  Increasing return loss corresponds to lower SWR.  Return loss is a measure of how well devices or lines are matched.  A match is good if the return loss is high.  A high return loss is desirable and results in a lower [[insertion loss]].

Return loss is used in modern practice in preference to SWR because it has better resolution for small values of reflected wave.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

==Sign==
Properly, loss quantities, when expressed in decibels, should be positive numbers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Except for cases where an active device succeeds in reflecting back more power than was sent into it.  This is the case, for instance, with the [[negative resistance#Amplifiers|tunnel diode amplifier]].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, return loss has historically been expressed as a negative number, and this convention is still widely found in the literature.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;Trevor S. Bird, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5162049 "Definition and Misuse of Return Loss"], ''IEEE Antennas &amp; Propagation Magazine'', '''vol.51''', iss.2, pp.166-167, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct definition of return loss is the difference in dB between the incident power sent towards the Device Under Test (DUT) and the power reflected, resulting in a positive sign:

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;

However taking the ratio of '''reflected''' to '''incident''' power results in a negative sign for return loss;

:&lt;math&gt;RL'(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm r \over P_\mathrm i}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''RL'''(dB) is the negative of ''RL''(dB).
Return loss with a positive sign is identical to the magnitude of Γ when expressed in decibels but of opposite sign.  That is, return loss with a negative sign is more properly called reflection coefficient.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;  The [[S-parameter]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from [[two-port network]] theory is frequently also called return loss,&lt;ref&gt;Noel G. Barton, Jacques Periaux, "Coupling of fluids, structures, and waves in aeronautics", proceedings of a French-Australian workshop in Melbourne, Australia, 3–6 December 2001, p.187, Springer, 2003 {{ISBN|3-540-40222-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but is actually equal to Γ.

Caution is required when discussing increasing or decreasing return loss since these terms strictly have the opposite meaning when return loss is defined as a negative quantity.

==Electrical==
In metallic conductor systems, reflections of a signal traveling down a conductor can occur at a discontinuity or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] mismatch. The ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave ''V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the amplitude of the incident wave ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is known as the [[reflection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = {V_\mathrm r \over V_\mathrm i}&lt;/math&gt;

When the source and load impedances are known values, the reflection coefficient is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = { {Z_\mathrm L - Z_\mathrm S} \over {Z_\mathrm L + Z_\mathrm S} }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance toward the [[voltage source|source]] and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance toward the [[Electrical load|load]].

Return loss is the negative of the magnitude of the reflection coefficient in dB. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage, return loss is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = -20 \log_{10} \left| \mathit \Gamma \right|&lt;/math&gt;

where  the [[vertical direction|vertical]] bars indicate [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]. Thus, a large positive return loss indicates the reflected power is small relative to the incident power, which indicates good impedance match from source to load.

When the actual transmitted (incident) power and the reflected power are known (i.e., through measurements and/or calculations), then the return loss in dB can be calculated as the difference between the incident power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (in [[dBm]]) and the reflected power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (in dBm),

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = P_\mathrm i(\mathrm{dBm}) - P_\mathrm r(\mathrm{dBm})\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Optical==
In [[optics]] (particularly in [[optical fiber|fiberoptics]]) a loss that takes place at discontinuities of [[refractive index]], especially at an air-[[glass]] [[wiktionary:interface|interface]] such as a fiber endface. At those interfaces, a fraction of the optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is reflected back toward the source.  This reflection phenomenon is also called "'''[[Fresnel reflection]] loss'''," or simply "'''Fresnel loss'''."

Fiber optic transmission systems use [[laser]]s to transmit signals over optical fiber, and a high optical return loss (ORL) can cause the laser to stop transmitting correctly. The measurement of ORL is becoming more important in the characterization of optical networks as the use of [[wavelength-division multiplexing]] increases.  These systems use lasers that have a lower tolerance for ORL, and introduce elements into the network that are located in close proximity to the laser.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{ORL}(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\mathrm r&lt;/math&gt; is the reflected power and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\mathrm i&lt;/math&gt; is the incident, or input, power.

The '''Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC)''' is an American [[non-profit corporation]] that aims to "produce, establish, maintain and endorse a standardized set" of [[Benchmark (computing)|performance benchmark]]s for computers.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spec.org/spec/faq/#01SPEC.General.10whatis|accessdate=15 March 2010|title=SPEC Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPEC was founded in 1988.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spec.org/spec/|accessdate=15 March 2010|title=The SPEC Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="members"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spec.org/spec/membership.html|accessdate=15 March 2010|title=SPEC Membership}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPEC benchmarks are widely used to evaluate the performance of computer systems; the test results are published on the SPEC website.

SPEC evolved into an umbrella organization encompassing four diverse groups; Graphics and Workstation Performance Group (GWPG), the High Performance Group (HPG), the Open Systems Group (OSG) and the newest, the Research Group (RG).

== Structure ==

=== The Open Systems Group (OSG) ===

=== The High-Performance Group (HPG) ===

=== The Graphics and Workstation Performance Group (GWPG) ===

=== SPEC Research Group (RG) ===

==Membership==

Membership in SPEC is open to any interested company or entity that is willing to commit to SPEC's standards. It allows:

* Participation in benchmark development
* Participation in review of results
* Complimentary software based on group participation

The list of members is available on SPEC's membership page;[http://www.spec.org/consortium/].

==Membership Levels==

* Sustaining Membership requires dues payment and typically includes hardware or software companies.
* SPEC "Associates" pay a reduced fee and typically include Universities.
* SPEC "Supporting Contributors" are invited to participate in development of a single benchmark, and do not pay fees.

==SPEC Benchmark Suites==

The benchmarks aim to test "real-life" situations. There are several benchmarks testing Java scenarios, from simple computation (SPECjbb) to a full system with Java EE, database, disk, and network (SPECjEnterprise).

The SPEC CPU suites test [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance by measuring the run time of several programs such as the [[compiler]] [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], the chemistry program [[GAMESS_(US)|gamess]], and the weather program [[Weather_Research_and_Forecasting_model|WRF]].  The various tasks are equally weighted; no attempt is made to weight them based on their perceived importance.  An overall score is based on a geometric mean.

* SPEC 2001
* SPEC CPU89

==Portability==
SPEC benchmarks are written in a portable programming language (usually [[C (programming language)|C]], C#, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[Fortran]]), and the interested parties may [[compiler|compile]] the code using whatever compiler they prefer for their platform, but may not change the code. Manufacturers have been known to optimize their compilers to improve performance of the various SPEC benchmarks.  SPEC has rules that attempt to limit such optimizations.

==Licensing==
In order to use a benchmark, a license has to be purchased from SPEC; the costs vary from test to test with a typical range from several hundred to several thousand dollars. This pay-for-license model might seem to be in violation of the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] as the benchmarks include software such as [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] that is licensed by the GPL. However, the GPL does not require software to be distributed for free, only that recipients be allowed to redistribute any GPLed software that they receive; the license agreement for SPEC specifically exempts items that are under "licenses that require free distribution", and the files themselves are placed in a separate part of the overall software package.

==Culture==

SPEC attempts to create an environment where arguments are settled by appeal to notions of technical credibility, representativeness, or the "level playing field".   SPEC representatives are typically engineers with expertise in the areas being benchmarked.   Benchmarks include "run rules", which describe the conditions of measurement and documentation requirements.  Results that are published on SPEC's website undergo a peer review by members' performance engineers.

He thought that the "P.R" stood for [[Poor Richard]], a pseudonym Franklin used for "Richard Saunders" as the author of ''Poor Richard's Almanack.'' Franklin had a reputation for using [[cipher]]s and codes in secret communications. The printer for this work was developed by [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]], the grandson of Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref name=cipher&gt;

Friedman library collection Item 265 Wouves, P.R., A Syllabical and Steganographical Table, Philadelphia: Printed by Benjamin Franklin Bache, 1797. Photostat negative. According to William F. Friedman, an item of very great historical interest and importance. An explanatory note accompanies the item written by the book dealer i Philadelphia from whom Friedman purchased this copy. See Galland, p. 205 for explanatory details. In French and English, 1786-98: ―By means of which any sort of writings taken from either the French, English, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian languages or any languages which use the same alphabet can be converted into numerical figures. According to the extract from a letter from W.D. Witt, Book Dealer on Carlisle Street, Philadelphia, the Library of Congress does NOT have a copy of this. The New York Public Library has a copy signed by Wouves and the Philadelphia Historical Society has an unsigned copy. De Witt thought Wouves was a pseudonym for Benjamin Franklin. The publisher, Benjamin Franklin Bach was his grandson. We know Franklin made use of ciphers. P.R.=Poor Richard?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The work was of two pages and a chart. The two pages were title pages which were in English and French. Printed on the back of these pages were information and instructions for the chart that was within. This chart consisted of a large single sheet of paper of a table. It contained 62 alphabetical columns of 6,138 two-letter combinations, numbered from 1 to 99&lt;!--how are 6,138 combinations numbered 1-99?--&gt; so that words could be translated into numbers. The table chart sheet was normally kept folded for carrying around. The folded chart then was opened for using, as one would do with a [[Map folding|folded road map]].&lt;ref name=Villanova&gt;{{cite web |url=https://library.villanova.edu/Find/Record/873438/Description |title=Tableau syllabique et steganographique  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=Falvey Memorial Library |publisher=Villanova University |access-date= August 7, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chart table was to be used to put into code a message that was to be kept secret from all others except the recipient. It was a [[cipher]] system. The idea behind this was that anything written in the [[Latin alphabet]] could be put into a numerical code of a set of numbers. It was initially set up for [[English alphabet|English]] and French but could also be used for Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, or Italian. Wouves's chart for a secret correspondence method was only intended for certain of his closest friends. He was working on [[steganography]]. The initial preliminary table was printed in 1797 as a partial work. There never was an official printed edition of his total completed work.&lt;ref name=Australia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/27811119?selectedversion=NBD41468848 |title=Syllabical and steganographical table |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=Trove |publisher=National Library of Australia |access-date= August 7, 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

The sheet of the chart table when open is {{Convert|27| inch}} wide by {{Convert|19.25|inch}} deep.{{sfn|Kane|1997|p=328}} It has a copyright from Pennsylvania District number 192 issued to author "P.R. Wouves" on November 9, 1787. According to US Army cryptographer [[William F. Friedman]] the table is of significant historical importance for what it represents.&lt;ref name=cipher/&gt;

==Advantages of alpha emitters==
[[File:SEM - range of α and β− particles.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of range of α (red) and β− (white) particles]]
The primary advantage of [[alpha particle]] (α) emitters over other types of radioactive sources is their very high [[linear energy transfer]] (LET) and [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kane|first1=Suzanne Amador|title=Introduction to physics in modern medicine|date=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=9780415299633|page=243|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beta particle]] (β) emitters such as [[Yttrium-90]] can travel considerable distances beyond the immediate tissue before depositing their energy, while alpha particles deposit their energy in 70–100 μm long tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elgqvist|first1=Jörgen|last2=Frost|first2=Sofia|last3=Pouget|first3=Jean-Pierre|last4=Albertsson|first4=Per|title=The Potential and Hurdles of Targeted Alpha Therapy – Clinical Trials and Beyond|journal=Frontiers in Oncology|date=2014|volume=3|pages=324|doi=10.3389/fonc.2013.00324|pmid=24459634|pmc=3890691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpha particles are more likely than other types of radiation to cause [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|double-strand breaks]] to DNA molecules, which is one of several effective causes of [[cell death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=Richard P|title=Therapeutic Nuclear Medicine|date=2014|publisher=Springer|location=Heidelberg|isbn=9783540367192|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodgkins|first1=Paul S.|last2=O'Neill|first2=Peter|last3=Stevens|first3=David|last4=Fairman|first4=Micaela P.|title=The Severity of Alpha-Particle-Induced DNA Damage Is Revealed by Exposure to Cell-Free Extracts|journal=Radiation Research|date=December 1996|volume=146|issue=6|pages=660|doi=10.2307/3579382|pmid=8955716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Some α emitting isotopes such as [[actinium-225|&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac]] and [[bismuth-213|&lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;Bi]] are only available in limited quantities from [[thorium-229|&lt;sup&gt;229&lt;/sup&gt;Th]] decay, although [[cyclotron]] production is feasible.&lt;ref name="Seidl14"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seidl|first1=Christof|title=Radioimmunotherapy with α-particle-emitting radionuclides|journal=Immunotherapy|date=April 2014|volume=6|issue=4|pages=431–458|doi=10.2217/imt.14.16|pmid=24815783}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Apostolidis|first1=C.|last2=Molinet|first2=R.|last3=McGinley|first3=J.|last4=Abbas|first4=K.|last5=Möllenbeck|first5=J.|last6=Morgenstern|first6=A.|title=Cyclotron production of Ac-225 for targeted alpha therapy|journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes|date=March 2005|volume=62|issue=3|pages=383–387|doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2004.06.013|pmid=15607913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miederer|first1=Matthias|last2=Scheinberg|first2=David A.|last3=McDevitt|first3=Michael R.|title=Realizing the potential of the Actinium-225 radionuclide generator in targeted alpha particle therapy applications|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|date=September 2008|volume=60|issue=12|pages=1371–1382|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2008.04.009|pmc=3630456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Though many α-emitters exist, useful isotopes would have a sufficient energy to cause damage to cancer cells, and a [[half-life]] that is long enough to provide a therapeutic [[radiation dose|dose]] without remaining long enough to damage healthy tissue.

===Immunotherapy===
Several radionuclides have been studied for use in [[immunotherapy]]. Though β-emitters are more popular, in part due to their availability, trials have taken place involving &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Ac, &lt;sup&gt;211&lt;/sup&gt;At, &lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and &lt;sup&gt;213&lt;/sup&gt;Bi.&lt;ref name="Seidl14" /&gt;

===Peritoneal carcinomas===
Treatment of peritoneal carcinomas has promising early results limited by availability of α-emitters compared to β-emitters.&lt;ref name="Seidl11" /&gt;

===Bone metastases===
[[Radium-223|&lt;sup&gt;223&lt;/sup&gt;Ra]] was the first α-emitter approved by the [[FDA]] in the United States for treatment of [[bone metastases]] from [[prostate cancer]], and is a recommended treatment in the UK by [[NICE]].&lt;ref name="Dekempeneer16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radium-223 dichloride for treating hormone-relapsed prostate cancer with bone metastases|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta412/chapter/1-recommendations|website=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[phase III trial]] comparing [[Radium-223|&lt;sup&gt;223&lt;/sup&gt;Ra]] to a [[placebo]], survival was significantly improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=C.|last2=Nilsson|first2=S.|last3=Heinrich|first3=D.|last4=Helle|first4=S.I.|last5=O'Sullivan|first5=J.M.|last6=Fosså|first6=S.D.|last7=Chodacki|first7=A.|last8=Wiechno|first8=P.|last9=Logue|first9=J.|last10=Seke|first10=M.|last11=Widmark|first11=A.|last12=Johannessen|first12=D.C.|last13=Hoskin|first13=P.|last14=Bottomley|first14=D.|last15=James|first15=N.D.|last16=Solberg|first16=A.|last17=Syndikus|first17=I.|last18=Kliment|first18=J.|last19=Wedel|first19=S.|last20=Boehmer|first20=S.|last21=Dall'Oglio|first21=M.|last22=Franzén|first22=L.|last23=Coleman|first23=R.|last24=Vogelzang|first24=N.J.|last25=O'Bryan-Tear|first25=C.G.|last26=Staudacher|first26=K.|last27=Garcia-Vargas|first27=J.|last28=Shan|first28=M.|last29=Bruland|first29=Ø.S.|last30=Sartor|first30=O.|title=Alpha Emitter Radium-223 and Survival in Metastatic Prostate Cancer|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 July 2013|volume=369|issue=3|pages=213–223|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1213755|pmid=23863050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermal bag''' is a type of thermally [[insulated shipping container]] in the form of a bag which can be carried, usually made of [[Thermal insulation|thermally insulating]] materials and sometimes a refrigerant [[gel]]. It is used to help maintain the temperature of its contents, keeping cold items cold, and hot items hot.

Insulated bags have been in use for many years in industry, medical/pharmaceutical use, food delivery, lunch bags, etc.   Several designs have been available.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite patent

==Shopping bags==
Commercial thermal shopping bags, to carry temperature-sensitive purchases home without breaking the [[cold chain]], were first introduced by grocery and other shops in Europe in the mid 1980s. A thermal bag to keep pizzas being delivered hot was invented by Ingrid Kosar in 1983, and is commonly used now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysundaynews.com/2014/07/03/shes-got-it-in-the-bag/ |title=She’s got it ‘in the bag’ |publisher=My Sunday News |date=2014-07-03 |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Basecamp |url=https://thedistance.com/thermal-bags-by-ingrid/ |title=Life of Pie — The Distance |publisher=Thedistance.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cooler|cool box]] is very similar in concept, but typically larger and in the form of a rigid box.

== Medical use ==

Thermal pharmaceutical bags are designed to transport temperature-sensitive medications, protecting them from damaging temperatures, shocks, and light. Many vaccines are delicate biological substances that can lose part or all of their effectiveness if they are frozen, allowed to get too hot, or exposed to bright light. Such vaccines must be kept within a specified temperature range, typically {{convert|2|to|8|C|F}}, from manufacture to use. According to the [[World Health Organization]], at least 7% of temperature-sensitive medical products suffer significant degradation in potency in transit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

== Materials ==

Thermal bags are usually manufactured with varying quantities of the following materials:

* [[PET film (biaxially oriented)]] (Mylar, etc.)
* [[Styrofoam]]
* [[Fabric]]
* [[Nonwovens]]
* [[Polyethylene]]
* [[Polyurethane]]
* [[Polypropylene]]
*[[gel pack]]s

'''Toilet papering''' (also called '''TP-ing''', '''House Wrapping''' or '''Yard Rolling''') is the act of covering an object, such as a tree, house, or another structure with [[toilet paper]]. This is typically done by throwing numerous toilet paper rolls in such a way that they unroll in midair and thus fall on the targeted object in multiple streams. Toilet papering can be an [[initiation]], a [[joke]], a [[prank]], or an act of revenge. It is common in the [[United States]] and frequently takes place on [[Halloween]], [[April Fools' Day]], or after the completion of school events such as [[graduation]] or [[homecoming]] [[American football|football]] game.&lt;ref name=wiscnews&gt;"Police, school say no toilet papering homes." [http://www.wiscnews.com/news/local/education/article_0d3a6c7c-e0b7-11e0-8018-001cc4c002e0.html]. Retrieved 29/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
While few jurisdictions in the United States have statutes specifically against toilet papering, some police departments cite perpetrators on the grounds of [[littering]], [[trespassing]], [[disorderly conduct]], or [[criminal mischief]], especially when the homeowner's property is damaged.&lt;ref name =wiscnews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Toilet-paper prank by middle schoolers leads to indictment for mom."[http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/mom_indicted_on_charge_of_helping_middle_schoolers_toilet_paper] Retrieved 29/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pop culture ==
Throwing toilet paper is a component of the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following#Audience participation|audience participation]] activities associated with showings of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.  Rolls of toilet paper are customarily thrown in a reference to [[Scott Paper Company|Scott]] brand toilet paper after a character shouts the phrase "[[Great Scott!]]" in response to the entrance of character [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show#Cast|Dr. Everett Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rockyhorror.com/participation/proplist.php| title=Rocky Horror Picture Show Official Fan Site - Prop List| accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the collectibles and antique industry, '''toleware''' refers to kitchen-related objects created from metal, typically tin or thin steel, and are often in decorative styles such as [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] and [[Pennsylvania Dutch]].  Decorative painting on these items is common but not necessary.  This style of decorative art spread from Europe to the United States in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Art [http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/iadmetal/iadmetal-27412.html Narrative from "Toleware Box"], accessed July 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and was popular in US kitchens in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Polson, Mary Ellen [http://www.oldhouseonline.com/treen-tole-ware-in-early-america/ "Treen &amp; Tole Ware in Early America"], Early Homes, Spring/Summer 2010, accessed July 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It was painted in 1632, 8 years after his last calculating clock drawing.]]
'''Wilhelm Schickard''' (22 April 1592  &amp;ndash; 24 October 1635) was a German professor of Hebrew and Astronomy who became famous in the second part of the 20th century after Dr. [[Franz Hammer]], a biographer (along with [[Max Caspar]]) of [[Johannes Kepler]], claimed that the drawings of a calculating clock, predating the public release of [[Pascal's calculator]] by twenty years, had been discovered in two unknown letters written by Schickard to Johannes Kepler in 1623 and 1624.&lt;ref name=redis&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin p. 48 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Computing|url=http://blogs.royalsociety.org/history-of-science/2012/06/25/history-of-computing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Hammer asserted that because these letters had been lost for three hundred years, [[Blaise Pascal]] had been called&lt;ref&gt;"[...] but it was not until 1642 that Blaise Pascal gave us the first mechanical calculating machine in the sense that the term is used today." [[Howard Aiken]], Proposed automatic calculating machine, presented to IBM in 1937&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrated as&lt;ref&gt;"Pascal's invention of the calculating machine, just three hundred years ago, was made while he was a youth of nineteen.  He was spurred to it by seeing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen.  He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose ; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life.  But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use.  Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions..." [[#NAT_CHAP|Magazine Nature]], Prof. S. Chapman, ''Pascal tercentenary celebration'', London, (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; the inventor of the [[mechanical calculator]] in error during all this time.

After careful examination it was found that Schikard's drawings had been published at least once per century starting from 1718,&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/Pioneers/Schickard.html History of computers] The calculating Clock of Wilhelm Schickard. Retrieved January 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; that his machine was not complete and required additional wheels and springs&lt;ref name=UNFINISHED&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p.122 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was designed around a ''single tooth'' carry mechanism that didn't work properly when used in calculating clocks.&lt;ref name=NOTDO&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p.124,128 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Single tooth'' carry mechanisms worked well in [[pedometers]] of the 16th century and were still used in mechanical odometers and gas meters during the 20th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schickard's machine was the first of several designs of  ''direct entry'' calculating machines in the 17th century (including the designs of [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Tito Livio Burattini|Tito Burattini]], [[Samuel Morland]] and [[René Grillet de Roven|René Grillet]]).&lt;ref&gt;Please see [[Mechanical calculator#Calculating clocks]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Schickard machine was particularly notable for its integration of an ingenious system of rotated [[Napier's rods]] for multiplication with a first known design for an adding machine, operated by rotating knobs for input, and with a register of rotated numbers showing in windows for output. Taton has argued that Schickard's work had no impact on the development of mechanical calculators.&lt;ref&gt;[[#t198|René Taton, p. 81 (1969)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, whilst there can be debate about what constitutes a "mechanical calculator" later devices, such as Moreland's multiplying and adding instruments when used together, Caspar Schott's Cistula, René Grillet's machine arithmétique, and Claude Perrault's rhabdologique at the end of the century, and later, the [[Bamberger Omega]] developed in the early 20th Century, certainly followed the same path pioneered by Schickard with his ground breaking combination of a form of Napier's rods and adding machine designed to assist multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.LateModern#toc14 see for example discussion of true multiplying machines in http://things-that-count.net]&lt;/ref&gt;


==Life==
[[Image:Triquetrumastro.gif|thumb|left|Drawing of a [[Triquetrum (astronomy)|triquetrum]] by Wilhelm Schickard]]
Schickard was born in [[Herrenberg]] and educated at the University of [[Tübingen]], receiving his first degree, B.A. in 1609 and M.A. in 1611. He studied theology and oriental languages at Tübingen until 1613. In 1613 he became a Lutheran minister continuing his work with the church until 1619 when he was appointed professor of [[Hebrew]] at the [[University of Tübingen]].

Schickard was a universal scientist and taught biblical languages such as [[Aramaic]] as well as [[Hebrew]] at Tübingen. In 1631 he was appointed professor of astronomy at the University of Tübingen. His research was broad and included astronomy, mathematics and surveying. He invented many machines such as one for calculating astronomical dates and one for Hebrew grammar. He made significant advances in mapmaking, producing maps that were far more accurate than previously available.&lt;ref name="thocp"&gt;{{cite web |author=History of Computing Foundation |url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/schickard_wilhelm.html |title=Wilhelm Schickard entry at The History of Computing Project|accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was, among his other skills, a renowned wood and copperplate [[Engraving|engraver]].&lt;ref name="thocp" /&gt;

Wilhelm Schickard died of the [[bubonic plague]] in [[Tübingen]], on 23 or 24 October 1635.&lt;ref name="thocp" /&gt; In 1651, [[Giovanni Riccioli]] named the lunar crater [[Schickard (crater)|Schickard]] after him.

==Political theory==
In 1625 Schickard, a [[Christian Hebraist]], published an influential treatise, ''Mishpat ha-melek, Jus regium Hebraeorum'' (Title in both Hebrew and Latin: The King's Law)  in which he uses the [[Talmud]] and rabbinical literature to analyze ancient Hebrew political theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric M. Nelson]],  "Talmudical Commonwealthsmen and the Rise of Republican Exclusivism, The Historical Journal, 50, 4 (2007), p. 826&lt;/ref&gt;  Schickard argues that the [[Bible]] supports monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric M. Nelson]],  "Talmudical Commonwealthsmen and the Rise of Republican Exclusivism, The Historical Journal, 50, 4 (2007), p. 827&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawings of a calculating clock==

===History===
[[File:Schickardmaschine.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of Schickards calculating machine]]
[[Image:Rechenmaschine wilhelm schickard.png|thumb|Original drawing taken from F. Seck (Editor) 'Wilhelm Schickard 1592-1635, Astronom, Geograph, Orientalist, Erfinder der Rechenmaschine', Tübingen, 1978]]
Around 1621, Schickard built a machine based on gears for doing simplified multiplications involved in [[Johannes Kepler]]'s calculations of the orbit of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1107|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1623 and 1624, in two letters that he sent to [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], reported his design and construction of what he referred to as an “arithmeticum organum” (“arithmetical instrument”) that he has invented,&lt;ref&gt;Jim Falk, "Things that Count: the rise and fall of calculators", things-that-count.net 2014, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; but which would later be described as a Rechenuhr (calculating clock).  The machine was designed to assist in all the four basic functions of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).  Amongst its uses, Schickard suggested it would help in the laborious task of calculating astronomical tables. The machine could add and subtract six-digit numbers, and indicated an overflow of this capacity by ringing a bell.  The adding machine in the base was primarily provided to assist in the difficult task of adding or multiplying two multi-digit numbers.   To this end an ingenious arrangement of rotatable [[Napier's bones]] were mounted on it. It even had an additional "memory register" to record intermediate calculations.  Whilst Schickard noted that the adding machine was working his letters mention that he had asked a professional, a clockmaker named Johann Pfister to build a finished machine. Regrettably it was destroyed in a fire either whilst still incomplete, or in any case before delivery. Schickard abandoned his project soon after. He and his entire family were wiped out in 1635 by bubonic plague during the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Schickard.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schickard's machine used clock wheels which were made stronger and were therefore heavier, to prevent them from being damaged by the force of an operator input.  Each digit used a display wheel, an input wheel and an intermediate wheel.  During a carry transfer all these wheels meshed with the wheels of the digit receiving the carry.

The Institute for Computer Science at the [[University of Tübingen]] is called the Wilhelm-Schickard-Institut für Informatik in his honor.

===Priority of invention===
There has been a long-standing question about who should be given priority of invention of the mechanical calculator.  Schickard's mechanism was chronologically earlier but was never able to be used and appears to have had serious design flaws. Pascal's design was slightly later but functioned superbly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.TheModernEpochAndTheEmergenceOfTheModernCalculator#schickard discussion on Schickard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal Schickard versus Pascal: An Empty Debate?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1718 an early biographer of Kepler, [[Michael Gottlieb Hansch]], had published letters from Schickard that described the calculating machine, and his priority was also mentioned in an 1899 publication, the ''Stuttgarter Zeitschrift für Vermessungswesen''.&lt;ref&gt;In an article on the topography of [[Württemberg]] by [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]]. See [http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/Pioneers/Schickard.html The calculating Clock of Wilhelm Schickard]. (Retrieved January 31, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, [[Franz Hammer]], one of Kepler's biographers, announced that Schickard's drawings of this previously unknown calculating clock predated Pascal's work by twenty years.

[[Bruno von Freytag-Löringhoff]] built a replica of Schickard's machine in 1960, but had to improve on the design of the carry mechanism: 
{{quote | This simple-looking device actually presents a host of problems to anyone attempting to construct an adding machine based on this principle.  The major problem is caused by the fact that the single tooth must enter into the teeth of the intermediate wheel, rotate it 36 degrees (one tenth of a revolution), and exit from the teeth, all while only rotating 36 degrees itself. The most elementary solution to this problem consists of the intermediate wheel being, in effect, two different gears, one with long and one with short teeth together with a spring-loaded detente (much like the pointer used on the big wheel of the gambling game generally known as Crown and Anchor) which would allow the gears to stop only in specific locations.  '''It is not known if Schickard used this mechanism, but it certainly works well on the reproductions constructed by von Freytag Loringhoff'''.|Michael R. Williams&lt;ref name=UNFINISHED/&gt;|History of Computing Technology, IEEE (1997)}}

Pascal's invention was almost certainly independent, as "it is almost certain that Pascal would not have known of Schickard's machine."&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Williams|History of Computing Technology, IEEE (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal realized that a single-tooth gear would only be adequate for a carry that only needs to propagate a few places. For more digits, the force required to propagate extended carries would damage such gears.&lt;ref name="NOTDO"/&gt;

The two machines were essentially different in that Pascal's machine was designed primarily for addition and (with the use of [[complementary numbers]]) for subtraction.  The adding machine in Schickard's design may have jammed in the unusual case of a carry being required across too many dials, but it could smoothly subtract by reversing the motion of the input dials, in a way that was not possible in the Pascaline. (Experiments with replicas show that in the event of a jam when a carry is attempted across more than (say) three dials, it is obvious to the operator who may intervene to assist the machine to perform the additional carries.  This is not as efficient as with the Pascaline, but it is not a fatal deficiency.) The Schickard adding machine also has provision for an audible warning when an output was too large for the available dials.  This was not provided for in the Pascaline.

Pascal tried to create a smoothly functioning adding machine for use by his father initially, and later for commercialisation, while the adding machine in Schickard's design appears to have been introduced to assist in multiplication (through the calculation of partial products using Napier's rods, a process that can also be used to assist division).

'''Winemaking''' or '''vinification''' is the production of [[wine]], starting with the selection of the fruit, its [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation into alcohol]], and the bottling of the finished liquid. The [[history of wine]]-making stretches over millennia. The science of wine and winemaking is known as [[oenology]]. A [[winemaker]] may also be called a vintner. The growing of grapes is [[viticulture]] and there are [[List of grape varieties|many varieties of grapes]]

Winemaking can be divided into two general categories: still wine production (without carbonation) and [[sparkling wine production]] (with carbonation&amp;nbsp;— natural or injected). [[Red wine]], [[white wine]], and [[rosé]] are the other main categories. Although most wine is made from [[grape]]s, it may also be made from other plants, see [[fruit wine]]. Other similar light alcoholic drinks (as opposed to [[beer]] or [[spirits]]) include [[mead]], made by fermenting honey and water, and [[kumis]], made of fermented mare's milk.

==Process==
[[File:Wine grape diagram en.svg|thumb|left|Anatomy of a grape, showing the components extracted from each pressing.]]
There are five basic stages to the wine making process which begins with harvesting or picking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.winemonthclub.com/the-wine-making-process|title=Wine Making Process: How to Make Wine {{!}} Wine of the Month Club|work=The International Wine of the Month Club|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After the harvest, the grapes are taken into a winery and prepared for primary [[Fermentation (wine)|ferment]]. At this stage red wine making diverges from white wine making.
[[Red wine]] is made from the [[must]] (pulp) of red or black grapes and fermentation occurs together with the grape skins, which give the wine its color.
[[White wine]] is made by [[Fermentation|fermenting]] [[juice]] which is made by pressing crushed grapes to extract a juice; the skins are removed and play no further role. Occasionally white wine is made from red grapes; this is done by extracting their juice with minimal contact with the grapes' skins.
[[Rosé]] wines are either made from red grapes where the juice is allowed to stay in contact with the dark skins long enough to pick up a pinkish color (maceration or saignée) or by blending red wine with white wine. White and rosé wines extract little of the [[grape tannins|tannin]]s contained in the skins.

To start primary fermentation yeast may be added to the must for red wine or may occur naturally as ambient yeast on the grapes or in the air. Yeast may be added to the juice for white wine. During this fermentation, which often takes between one and two weeks, the [[yeast]] converts most of the [[sugar]]s in the grape juice into [[ethanol]] (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is lost to the atmosphere.

After the primary fermentation of red grapes the [[Pressing (wine)#Free-run versus pressed juice|free run wine]] is pumped off into tanks and the skins are pressed to extract the remaining juice and wine. The press wine is blended with the free run wine at the winemaker's discretion. The wine is kept warm and the remaining [[Sugars in wine|sugars]] are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

The next process in the making of red wine is malo-lactic conversion. This is a bacterial process which converts "crisp, green apple" [[malic acid]] to "soft, creamy" [[lactic acid]] softening the taste of the wine. Red wine is sometimes transferred to oak barrels to mature for a period of weeks or months; this practice imparts oak [[aromas (wine)|aromas]] and some tannin to the wine. The wine must be settled or clarified and adjustments made prior to bottling.

The time from harvest to drinking can vary from a few months for [[Beaujolais nouveau]] wines to over twenty years for wine of good structure with high levels of acid, [[tannin]] or sugar. However, only about 10% of all red and 5% of white wine will taste better after five years than it will after just one year.&lt;ref name="JRWC"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Jancis Robinson| title=Jancis Robinson's WINE COURSE, A guide to the world of wine|publisher=BBC worldwide Ltd.|year=2003|page=39}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the quality of grape and the target wine style, some of these steps may be combined or omitted to achieve the particular goals of the winemaker. Many wines of comparable quality are produced using similar but distinctly different approaches to their production; quality is dictated by the attributes of the starting material and not necessarily the steps taken during vinification.

Variations on the above procedure exist. With [[sparkling wine]]s such as [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]], an additional, "secondary" fermentation takes place inside the bottle, dissolving trapped carbon dioxide in the wine and creating the characteristic bubbles. [[Sweetness of wine|Sweet wines]] or off-dry wines are made by arresting fermentation before all sugar has been converted into ethanol and allowing some [[residual sugar]] to remain. This can be done by chilling the wine and adding sulphur and other allowable additives to inhibit yeast activity or sterile filtering the wine to remove all yeast and bacteria. In the case of sweet wines, initial sugar concentrations are increased by harvesting late ([[late harvest wine]]), freezing the grapes to concentrate the sugar ([[ice wine]]), allowing or encouraging botrytis cinerea fungus to dehydrate the grapes or allowing the grapes to raisin either on the vine or on racks or straw mats. Often in these high sugar wines, the fermentation stops naturally as the high concentration of sugar and rising concentration of ethanol retard the yeast activity. Similarly in fortified wines, such as [[port wine]], high [[Proof (alcohol)|proof]] neutral grape spirit ([[brandy]]) is added to arrest the ferment and adjust the alcohol content when the desired sugar level has been reached. In other cases the winemaker may choose to hold back some of the sweet grape juice and add it to the wine after the fermentation is done, a technique known in Germany as [[süssreserve]].

The process produces [[Winery Wastewater|wastewater]], [[pomace]], and [[Lees (fermentation)|lees]] that require collection, treatment, and disposal or beneficial use.

Synthetic wines, engineered wines or [[Wine fraud|fake wines]], are a product that do not use grapes at all and start with water and ethanol and then adds acids, amino acids, sugars, and organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sadler|first1=Chris|title=I Tried a Bottle of the New Synthetic Wine|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/11/ava_winery_s_new_synthetic_wine_doesn_t_taste_half_bad.html|accessdate=18 November 2017|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The grapes==
[[File:10 Sprinklers in vineyard - Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy.jpg|thumb|right|Vineyards in [[Italy]]]]
[[File:Mthomebrew grapes from harvest.JPG|thumb|right|Harvested [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] grapes]]
The quality of the grapes determines the quality of the wine more than any other factor. Grape quality is affected by variety as well as weather during the growing season, soil minerals and acidity, time of harvest, and pruning method. The combination of these effects is often referred to as the grape's ''[[terroir]]''.

Grapes are usually harvested from the [[vineyard]] from early September until early November in the northern hemisphere, and mid February until early March in the southern hemisphere. In some cool areas in the southern hemisphere, for example Tasmania, harvesting extends into May.

The most common species of wine grape is [[Vitis vinifera]], which includes nearly all varieties of European origin.

==Harvesting and destemming==
{{Main article|Harvest (wine)}}
{{See also|Ripeness in viticulture}}
[[File:Grape processing machine at Chateau Montelena Winery.gk.jpg|thumb|A mechanical destemming machine in use at [[Chateau Montelena]] winery in Napa Valley]]
[[Harvest]] is the picking of the grapes and in many ways the first step in wine production. Grapes are either harvested mechanically or by hand. The decision to harvest grapes is typically made by the winemaker and informed by the level of sugar (called [[°Brix]]), [[Acids in wine|acid]] (TA or [[Titratable Acidity]] as expressed by [[tartaric acid]] equivalents) and [[pH]] of the grapes. Other considerations include phenological ripeness, berry flavor, tannin development (seed color and taste). Overall disposition of the grapevine and weather forecasts are taken into account.

Mechanical harvesters are large tractors that straddle [[grapevine trellises]] and, using firm plastic or rubber rods, strike the fruiting zone of the grapevine to dislodge the grapes from the [[rachis]]. Mechanical harvesters have the advantage of being able to cover a large area of vineyard land in a relatively short period of time, and with a minimum investment of manpower per harvested ton. A disadvantage of mechanical harvesting is the indiscriminate inclusion of foreign non-grape material in the product, especially leaf stems and leaves, but also, depending on the trellis system and grapevine canopy management, may include moldy grapes, canes, metal debris, rocks and even small animals and bird nests. Some winemakers remove leaves and loose debris from the grapevine before mechanical harvesting to avoid such material being included in the harvested fruit. In the United States mechanical harvesting is seldom used for premium winemaking because of the indiscriminate picking and increased [[oxidation]] of the grape juice. In other countries (such as Australia and New Zealand), mechanical harvesting of premium winegrapes is more common because of general labor shortages.

[[File:Night Harvest of wine grapes. Napa, California.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Night harvest by hand of wine grapes in [[Napa, California]]]]
Manual harvesting is the hand-picking of grape clusters from the [[Vitis|grapevine]]s. In the United States, some grapes are picked into one- or two-ton bins for transport back to the winery. Manual harvesting has the advantage of using knowledgeable labor to not only pick the ripe clusters but also to leave behind the clusters that are not ripe or contain [[bunch rot]] or other defects. This can be an effective first line of defense to prevent inferior quality fruit from contaminating a lot or tank of wine.

[[File:Mthomebrew destemmer.JPG|thumb|Central component of a mechanical destemming. Paddles above the small circular slots rotate to remove the larger chunks of stems. Grapes are pulled off the stems and fall through the holes. Some small amount of stem particles are usually desired to be kept with the grapes for tannin structure.]]
Destemming is the process of separating stems from the grapes. Depending on the winemaking procedure, this process may be undertaken before crushing with the purpose of lowering the development of [[grape tannins|tannins]] and vegetal flavors in the resulting wine. Single berry harvesting, as is done with some German [[Trockenbeerenauslese]], avoids this step altogether with the grapes being individually selected.

==Crushing and primary (alcoholic) fermentation==
{{Main article|Fermentation (wine)}}
[[File:De Grey Hours f.9.r Wine pressing.jpg|thumb|In ancient times berries were crushed by foot in a barrel or pit]]
[[File:Mechanical Crusher.JPG|thumb|The corkscrew-shaped feed [[screw conveyor|auger]] sits on top of a mechanical crusher-destemmer. Grape clusters are fed into the machine, where they are first crushed, then destemmed. Stems exit at the end, while juice, skins, seeds, and some debris exit the bottom.]]

Crushing is the process when gently squeezing the berries and breaking the skins to start to liberate the contents of the berries. Destemming is the process of removing the grapes from the rachis (the stem which holds the grapes). In traditional and smaller-scale wine making, the harvested grapes are sometimes crushed by trampling them barefoot or by the use of inexpensive small scale crushers. These can also destem at the same time. However, in larger wineries, a mechanical crusher/destemmer is used.
The decision about destemming is different for red and white wine making. Generally when making white wine the fruit is only crushed, the stems are then placed in the press with the berries. The presence of stems in the mix facilitates pressing by allowing juice to flow past flattened skins. These accumulate at the edge of the press.
For red winemaking, stems of the grapes are usually removed before fermentation since the stems have a relatively high tannin content; in addition to tannin they can also give the wine a vegetal aroma (due to extraction of 2-[[methoxy]]-3-[[isopropylpyrazine]] which has an aroma reminiscent of green [[bell pepper]]s.)  On occasion, the winemaker may decide to leave them in if the grapes themselves contain less tannin than desired. This is more acceptable if the stems have 'ripened' and started to turn brown.
If increased skin extraction is desired, a winemaker might choose to crush the grapes after destemming. Removal of stems first means no stem tannin can be extracted. In these cases the grapes pass between two rollers which squeeze the grapes enough to separate the skin and pulp, but not so much as to cause excessive shearing or tearing of the skin tissues. In some cases, notably with "delicate" red varietals such as Pinot noir or Syrah, all or part of the grapes might be left uncrushed (called "whole berry") to encourage the retention of fruity aromas through partial [[carbonic maceration]].

[[File:Mthomebrew crushed grapes.JPG|left|thumb|Crushed grapes leaving the crusher]]
Most red wines derive their color from grape skins (the exception being varieties or hybrids of non-vinifera vines which contain juice pigmented with the dark Malvidin 3,5-diglucoside [[anthocyanin]]) and therefore contact between the juice and skins is essential for color extraction.
Red wines are produced by destemming and crushing the grapes into a tank and leaving the skins in contact with the juice throughout the fermentation ([[maceration (wine)|maceration]]). It is possible to produce white (colorless) wines from red grapes by the fastidious pressing of uncrushed fruit. This minimizes contact between grape juice and skins (as in the making of ''Blanc de noirs'' sparkling wine, which is derived from Pinot noir, a red vinifera grape.)

Most white wines are processed without destemming or crushing and are transferred from picking bins directly to the press. This is to avoid any extraction of tannin from either the skins or grapeseeds, as well as maintaining proper juice flow through a matrix of grape clusters rather than loose berries. In some circumstances winemakers choose to crush white grapes for a short period of skin contact, usually for three to 24 hours. This serves to extract flavor and tannin from the skins (the tannin being extracted to encourage protein precipitation without excessive [[Bentonite]] addition) as well as [[potassium]] ions, which participate in bitartrate precipitation ([[cream of tartar]]). It also results in an increase in the pH of the juice which may be desirable for overly acidic grapes. This was a practice more common in the 1970s than today, though still practiced by some Sauvignon blanc and Chardonnay producers in California.

In the case of rosé wines, the fruit is crushed and the dark skins are left in contact with the juice just long enough to extract the color that the winemaker desires.  The must is then pressed, and fermentation continues as if the winemaker was making a white wine.

[[Yeast in winemaking|Yeast is normally already present]] on the grapes, often visible as a powdery appearance of the grapes. The primary, or alcoholic fermentation can be done with this natural yeast, but since this can give unpredictable results depending on the exact types of yeast that are present, cultured yeast is often added to the must. One of the main problems with the use of wild ferments is the failure for the fermentation to go to completion, that is some sugar remains unfermented. This can make the wine sweet when a dry wine is desired. Frequently wild ferments lead to the production of unpleasant acetic acid (vinegar) production as a by product.

[[File:Red wine cap.jpg|thumb|left|A cap of grape skins forms on the surface of fermenting red wine.]]
During the primary fermentation, the yeast cells feed on the sugars in the must and multiply, producing carbon dioxide gas and [[alcohol]]. The temperature during the fermentation affects both the taste of the end product, as well as the speed of the fermentation. For red wines, the temperature is typically 22 to 25&amp;nbsp;°C, and for white wines 15 to 18&amp;nbsp;°C.
For every gram of sugar that is converted, about half a gram of alcohol is produced, so to achieve a 12% alcohol concentration, the must should contain about 24% sugars. The sugar percentage of the must is calculated from the measured density, the [[must weight]], with the help of a specialized type of [[hydrometer]] called a [[saccharometer]]. If the sugar content of the grapes is too low to obtain the desired alcohol percentage, sugar can be added ([[chaptalization]]). In commercial winemaking, chaptalization is subject to local regulations.

Alcohol of more than 12% can be achieved by using yeast that can withstand high alcohol.  Some yeasts can produce 18% alcohol in the wine however extra sugar is added to produce a high alcohol content.

During or after the alcoholic fermentation, a secondary, or [[malolactic fermentation]] can also take place, during which specific strains of bacteria (lactobacter) convert [[malic acid]] into the milder [[lactic acid]]. This fermentation is often initiated by inoculation with desired bacteria.

===Pressing===
[[Pressing (wine)|Pressing]] is the act of applying pressure to grapes or pomace in order to separate juice or wine from grapes and grape skins. Pressing is not always a necessary act in winemaking; if grapes are crushed there is a considerable amount of juice immediately liberated (called free-run juice) that can be used for vinification. Typically this free-run juice is of a higher quality than the press juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Enzymes in food processing |date=1993 |publisher=Academic Press |last=Nagodawithana |first=Tilak W. |last2=Reed |first2=Gerald |isbn=9780125136303 |edition=3rd |location=San Diego |pages= |oclc=27034539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressed juice is typically lesser in quality due to the release and increase of total phenolic compounds, as well as browning index and the C6-alcohol levels. These compounds are responsible for the herb-like taste perceived in wine with pressed grapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Selli |first=Serkan |last2=Bagatar |first2=Berfu |last3=Sen |first3=Kemal |last4=Kelebek |first4=Haşim |title=Evaluation of Differences in the Aroma Composition of Free-Run and Pressed Neutral Grape Juices Obtained from Emir (Vitis vinifera L.) |journal=Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=1776–1782 |doi=10.1002/cbdv.201100053}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most wineries do use presses in order to increase their production (gallons) per ton, as pressed juice can represent between 15%-30% of the total juice volume from the grape.

Presses act by positioning the grape skins or whole grape clusters between a rigid surface and a movable surface and slowly decrease the volume between the two surfaces. Modern presses dictate the duration and pressure at each press cycle, usually ramping from 0 [[Bar (unit)|Bar]] to 2.0 Bar. Sometimes winemakers choose pressures which separate the streams of pressed juice, called making "press cuts." As the pressure increases the amount of tannin extracted from the skins into the juice increases, often rendering the pressed juice excessively tannic or harsh. Because of the location of grape juice constituents in the berry (water and acid are found primarily in the [[mesocarp]] or pulp, whereas tannins are found primarily in the [[exocarp]], or [[skin]], and [[seed]]s), pressed juice or wine tends to be lower in acidity with a higher pH than the free-run juice.

[[File:Antique Wine Press.jpg|thumb|right|Antique wooden wine press in front of World Heritage vineyards]]
Before the advent of modern winemaking, most presses were [[wine press|basket press]]es made of wood and operated manually. Basket presses are composed of a cylinder of wooden slats on top of a fixed plate, with a moveable plate that can be forced downward (usually by a central ratcheting threaded screw.) The press operator would load the grapes or pomace into the wooden cylinder, put the top plate in place and lower it until juice flowed from the wooden slats. As the juice flow decreased, the plate was ratcheted down again. This process continued until the press operator determined that the quality of the pressed juice or wine was below standard, or all liquids had been pressed. Since the early 1990s, modern mechanical basket presses have been revived through higher-end producers seeking to replicate the gentle pressing of the historical basket presses. Because basket presses have a relatively compact design, the press cake offers a relatively longer pathway for the juice to travel before leaving the press. It is believed by advocates of basket presses that this relatively long pathway through the grape or pomace cake serves as a filter to solids that would otherwise affect the quality of the press juice.

With red wines, the must is pressed after primary fermentation, which separates the skins and other solid matter from the liquid. With white wine, the liquid is separated from the must before fermentation . With rose, the skins may be kept in contact for a shorter period to give color to the wine, in that case the must may be pressed as well. After a period in which the wine stands or ages, the wine is separated from the dead yeast and any solids that remained (called [[lees (fermentation)|lees]]), and transferred to a new container where any additional fermentation may take place.

===Pigeage===
{{main article|Maceration (wine)}}
Pigeage is a [[French language|French]] winemaking term for the traditional [[grape stomping]] in open [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] tanks. To make certain types of wine, grapes are put through a crusher and then poured into open fermentation tanks. Once fermentation begins, the grape skins are pushed to the surface by carbon dioxide gases released in the fermentation process. This layer of skins and other solids is known as the cap. As the skins are the source of the [[grape tannins|tannin]]s, the cap needs to be mixed through the liquid each day, or "punched," which traditionally is done by stomping through the vat.

==Cold stabilization==
{{See also|Clarification and stabilization of wine}}
''Cold stabilization'' is a process used in winemaking to reduce [[tartrate]] crystals (generally [[potassium bitartrate]]) in wine. These tartrate crystals look like grains of clear sand, and are also known as "wine crystals" or "wine diamonds". They are formed by the union of tartaric acid and potassium, and may appear to be [sediment] in the wine, though they are not. During the cold stabilizing process after fermentation, the temperature of the wine is dropped to close to freezing for 1–2 weeks. This will cause the crystals to separate from the wine and stick to the sides of the holding vessel. When the wine is drained from the vessels, the tartrates are left behind. They may also form in wine bottles that have been stored under very cold conditions.

==Secondary (malolactic) fermentation and  bulk aging==
[[File:FermentationVessels.jpg|thumb|right|Stainless steel fermentation vessels and new oak barrels at the Three Choirs Vineyard, [[Gloucestershire]], England]]
During the secondary fermentation and [[aging process (wine)|aging process]], which takes three to six months, the fermentation continues very slowly. The wine is kept under an [[Fermentation lock|airlock]] to protect the wine from oxidation. [[Protein]]s from the grape are broken down and the remaining yeast cells and other fine particles from the grapes are allowed to settle. [[Potassium bitartrate]] will also precipitate, a process which can be enhanced by [[cold stabilization]] to prevent the appearance of (harmless) tartrate crystals after bottling. The result of these processes is that the originally cloudy wine becomes clear. The wine can be [[racking|racked]] during this process to remove the [[Lees (fermentation)|lees]].

The secondary fermentation usually takes place in large [[stainless steel]] vessels with a volume of several cubic meters, oak barrels or glass demijohns (also referred to as carboys), depending on the goals of the winemakers.  Unoaked wine is fermented in a barrel made of stainless steel or other material having no influence in the final taste of the wine. Depending on the desired taste, it could be fermented mainly in stainless steel to be briefly put in oak, or have the complete fermentation done in stainless steel. Oak could be added as chips used with a non-wooden barrel instead of a fully wooden barrel. This process is mainly used in cheaper wine.

Amateur winemakers often use glass carboys in the production of their wine; these vessels (sometimes called ''demijohns'') have a capacity of {{convert|4.5-54|L}}.  The kind of vessel used depends on the amount of wine that is being made, the grapes being used, and the intentions of the winemaker.

==Malolactic fermentation==
[[Malolactic fermentation]] occurs when [[lactic acid bacteria]] metabolize [[malic acid]] and produce [[lactic acid]] and carbon dioxide. This is carried out either as an intentional procedure in which specially cultivated strains of such bacteria are introduced into the maturing wine, or it can happen by chance if uncultivated lactic acid bacteria are present.

Malolactic fermentation can improve the taste of wine that has high levels of malic acid, because malic acid, in higher concentration, generally causes an unpleasant harsh and bitter taste sensation, whereas lactic acid is more gentle and less sour.  Lactic acid is an acid found in dairy products. Malolactic fermentation usually results in a reduction in the amount of total acidity of the wine. This is because malic acid has two acid radicals (-COOH) while lactic acid has only one. However, the pH should be monitored and not allowed to rise above a pH of 3.55 for whites or a pH of 3.80 for reds.  pH can be reduced roughly at a rate of 0.1 units per 1 gram/litre of tartaric acid addition.

The use of lactic acid bacteria is the reason why some chardonnays can taste "buttery" due to the production of [[diacetyl]] by the bacteria.  Most red wines go through complete malolactic fermentation, both to lessen the acid of the wine and to remove the possibility that malolactic fermentation will occur in the bottle.
White wines vary in the use of malolactic fermentation during their making. Lighter aromatic wines such as Riesling, generally do not go through malolactic fermentation. The fuller white wines such as barrel fermented chardonnay, are more commonly put through malolactic fermentation. Sometimes a partial fermentation, for example, somewhere less than 50% might be employed.

==Laboratory tests==
Whether the wine is aging in tanks or barrels, tests are run periodically in a [[laboratory]] to check the status of the wine. Common tests include [[Brix]], [[pH]], titratable [[Acids in wine|acidity]], [[residual sugar]], free or available sulfur, total sulfur, [[volatile acidity]] and percent alcohol. Additional tests include those for the crystallization of cream of tartar ([[potassium hydrogen tartrate]]) and the precipitation of [[Proteins in wine|heat unstable protein]]; this last test is limited to white wines. These tests may be performed throughout the making of the wine as well as prior to bottling. In response to the results of these tests, a winemaker can decide on appropriate remedial action, for example the addition of more sulfur dioxide. Sensory tests will also be performed and again in response to these a winemaker may take remedial action such as the addition of a protein to soften the taste of the wine.

[[File:Aeration Oxidation apparatus during an AO SO2 test.jpg|thumb|upright|Testing wine for sulphur dioxide level]]
Brix (°Bx) is one measure of the soluble solids in the grape juice and represents not only the sugars but also includes many other soluble substances such as salts, acids and tannins, sometimes called [[total dissolved solids]] (TDS). Because sugar is the dominant compound in grape juice, these units are effectively a measure of sugar level. The level of sugar in the grapes determines the final alcohol content of the wine as well as indirect index of grape maturity. °Bx is measured in grams per hundred grams of solution, so 20 °Bx means that 100&amp;nbsp;grams of juice contains 20gm of dissolved compounds. There are other common measures of sugar content of grapes, [[specific gravity]], [[Oechsle scale|Oechsle]] (Germany) and [[Baumé scale|Baumé]] (France). °Bx is usually measured with a refractometer while the other methods use a hydrometer which measures specific gravity. Generally, hydrometers are a cheaper alternative. In the French Baumé (Be° or Bé°  for short) one Be° corresponds approximately to one percent alcohol. One Be° is equal to 1.8 °Bx, that is 1.8&amp;nbsp;grams of sugar per one hundred grams. Therefore, to achieve one percent alcohol the winemaker adds sugar at a rate of 1.8&amp;nbsp;grams per 100 ml (18&amp;nbsp;grams per liter)&amp;nbsp;— a practice known as [[chaptalization]], which is illegal in some countries and in California.

Volatile acidity test verifies if there is any steam distillable acids in the wine. Mainly present is [[acetic acid]] (the dominant component of [[vinegar]]), but [[lactic acid|lactic]], [[butyric acid|butyric]], [[propionic acid|propionic]], and [[formic acid]] can also be found. Usually the test checks for these acids in a cash still, but there are other methods available such as HPLC, gas chromatography and enzymatic methods. The amount of volatile acidity found in sound grapes is negligible, because it is a by-product of microbial metabolism. Because acetic acid bacteria require oxygen to grow, eliminating any air in wine containers as well as addition of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) will limit their growth. Rejecting moldy grapes also prevents possible problems associated with acetic acid bacteria. Use of sulfur dioxide and inoculation with a low-V.A. producing strain of ''Saccharomyces'' may deter acetic acid producing yeast. A relatively new method for removal of volatile acidity from a wine is reverse osmosis. Blending may also help—a wine with high V.A. can be filtered (to remove the microbe responsible) and blended with a low V.A. wine, so that the acetic acid level is below the sensory threshold.

Sulphur dioxide can be readily measured with relatively simple laboratory equipment. There are several methods available; a typical test involves acidification of a sample with phosphoric acid, distillation of the liberated SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and capture by hydrogen peroxide solution. The SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and peroxide react to form sulphuric acid, which is then titrated with NaOH to an end point with an indicator, and the volume of NaOH required is used to calculate the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level. This method has inaccuracies associated with red wine, inefficient condensers, and excessive aspiration rate, although the results are reproducible, having an accuracy with just a 2.5-5% error,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title={{chem|S|O|2}} Determination by Aeration-Oxidation: A Comparison with Ripper |first=J.

==Blending and fining==
Different batches of wine can be mixed before bottling in order to achieve the desired taste.  The winemaker can correct perceived inadequacies by mixing wines from different grapes and batches that were produced under different conditions.   These adjustments can be as simple as adjusting acid or tannin levels, to as complex as blending different varieties or vintages to achieve a consistent taste.

Fining agents are used during winemaking to remove [[tannins (wine)|tannins]], reduce astringency and remove microscopic particles that could cloud the wines. The winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year).&lt;ref name="fining"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vineyards |first=Jost |url=http://tastebetter.com/features/booze/type=wine |title=The Vegan wine guide |publisher=Tastebetter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531104809/http://tastebetter.com/features/booze/type=wine |archivedate=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelatin [gelatine] has been used in winemaking for centuries and is recognized as a traditional method for wine fining, or [[clarifying (wine)|clarifying]]. It is also the most commonly used agent to reduce the tannin content. Generally no gelatin remains in the wine because it reacts with the wine components, as it clarifies, and forms a [[sediment]] which is removed by filtration prior to bottling.

Besides gelatin, other fining agents for wine are often derived from animal products, such as micronized potassium casseinate ([[casein]] is milk protein), [[egg white]]s, egg [[albumin]], [[bone char]], [[bull]]'s blood, [[isinglass]] (Sturgeon bladder), [[Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone|PVPP]] (a synthetic compound), [[lysozyme]], and [[Powdered milk|skim milk powder]].&lt;ref name="fining" /&gt;

Some aromatized wines contain [[honey]] or egg-yolk extract.&lt;ref name="fining" /&gt;

Non-[[Animal product|animal-based]] filtering agents are also often used, such as [[bentonite]] (a volcanic clay-based filter), [[diatomaceous earth]], [[cellulose]] pads, paper filters and membrane filters (thin films of plastic [[polymer]] material having uniformly sized holes).

==Preservatives==
The most common preservative used in winemaking is sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), normally added in one of the following forms: liquid sulfur dioxide, sodium or [[potassium metabisulphite]]. Another useful preservative is [[potassium sorbate]].

Sulfur dioxide has two primary actions, firstly it is an anti microbial agent and secondly an anti oxidant. In the making of white wine it can be added prior to fermentation and immediately after alcoholic fermentation is complete. If added after alcoholic ferment it will have the effect of preventing or stopping [[malolactic fermentation]], bacterial spoilage and help protect against the damaging effects of oxygen. Additions of up to 100&amp;nbsp;mg per liter (of sulfur dioxide) can be added, but the available or free sulfur dioxide should be measured by the [[aspiration method]] and adjusted to 30&amp;nbsp;mg per liter. Available sulfur dioxide should be maintained at this level until bottling. For rose wines smaller additions should be made and the available level should be no more than 30&amp;nbsp;mg per liter.

In the making of red wine, sulfur dioxide may be used at high levels (100&amp;nbsp;mg per liter) prior to ferment to assist in color stabilization. Otherwise, it is used at the end of malolactic ferment and performs the same functions as in white wine. However, small additions (say, {{convert|20|mg/L}}) should be used to avoid bleaching red pigments and the maintenance level should be about 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Furthermore, small additions (say 20&amp;nbsp;mg per liter) may be made to red wine after alcoholic ferment and before malolactic ferment to overcome minor oxidation and prevent the growth of acetic acid bacteria.

Without the use of sulfur dioxide, wines can readily suffer bacterial spoilage no matter how hygienic the winemaking practice.

Potassium sorbate is effective for the control of fungal growth, including [[yeast]], especially for sweet wines in bottle. However, one potential hazard is the metabolism of sorbate to [[geraniol]] which is a potent and unpleasant by-product. The production of geraniol occurs only if [[sorbic acid]] is present during malo-lactic fermentation. To avoid this, either the wine must be sterile bottled or contain enough sulfur dioxide to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Sterile bottling includes the use of [[filtration]].

Some winemakers practice natural wine making where no preservative is added. Once the wine is bottled and corked, the bottles are put into refrigeration with temperatures near {{convert|5|°C}}.

==Filtration==
Filtration in winemaking is used to accomplish two objectives, clarification and microbial stabilization. In clarification, large particles that affect the visual appearance of the wine are removed. In microbial stabilization, organisms that affect the stability of the wine are removed therefore reducing the likelihood of re-fermentation or spoilage.

[[File:Wine labels machine - 20091205.jpg|thumb|upright|A wine labelling machine with adhesive labels in France]]
The process of clarification is concerned with the removal of particles; those larger than {{convert|5|–|10|mm}} for coarse polishing, particles larger than 1–4 micrometers for clarifying or polishing.  [[Microbial]] stabilization requires a filtration of at least 0.65 micrometers for yeast retention and 0.45&amp;nbsp;µm for bacteria retention. However, filtration at this level may lighten a wine's color and body. Microbial stabilization does not imply [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterility]], i.e. eliminating (removing) or killing (deactivating) of all forms of life and other biological agents. It simply means that a significant amount of yeast and bacteria has been removed to a harmless level for the wine stability.

Clarification of the wine can take place naturally by putting the wine into refrigeration at {{convert|35|°F}}. The wine takes about a month to settle and it is clear. No chemicals are needed.

==Bottling==
A final dose of [[sodium metabisulfite|sulfite]] is added to help preserve the wine and prevent unwanted fermentation in the bottle. The wine bottles then are traditionally sealed with a [[cork (material)|cork]], although [[alternative wine closures]] such as synthetic corks and screwcaps, which are less subject to [[cork taint]], are becoming increasingly popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Sales of Screw-Capped Wine Grow 51 Percent Over 2005 |author=Mary-Colleen Tinney |url=http://www.winebusiness.com/ReferenceLibrary/webarticle.cfm?dataId=43364 |magazine=Wine Business Monthly |date=June 2006 |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final step is adding a capsule &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Capsule Manufacturers Raise Quality Bar |author=Cathy Fisher |url=http://www.winebusiness.com/wbm/?go=getArticle&amp;dataId=50900 |magazine=Wine Business Monthly |date=September 2007 |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the top of the bottle which is then heated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Successfully Applying Capsules on the Bottling Line |author=Bill Pregler |url=http://www.winebusiness.com/wbm/?go=getArticle&amp;dataId=45648 |magazine=Wine Business Monthly |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a tight seal.

==Winemakers==
Traditionally known as a ''vintner'', a [[winemaker]] is a person engaged in making wine. They are generally employed by [[winery|wineries]] or [[:Category:Wine companies|wine companies]].
