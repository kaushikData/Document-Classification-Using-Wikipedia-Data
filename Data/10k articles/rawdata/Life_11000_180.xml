      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3834">'''Abd al-Baqi Yazdi''' ({{lang-fa|عبدالباقی یزدی}}), was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] nobleman, who was the third person to serve as the ''vakil'' ([[vicegerent]]) of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Empire]].

== Biography ==
A native of [[Yazd]], Abd al-Baqi was the son of [[Na'im-al-Din Nematollah Sani]], who was descended from [[Shah Nematollah]], the founder of the [[Ni'matullāhī|Nematollahi]] order.{{sfn|Soucek|1982|pp=105-106}} In the early 16th-century, Abd al-Baqi succeeded his father as the leader of the Nematollah order. Later in 1511, Abd al-Baqi took part in a celebration at the camp of the Safavid ruler [[Ismail I]] (r. 1501–1524). 

One year later, Abd al-Baqi served under the vakil [[Najm-e Sani]], who was after a few months killed in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] by [[Uzbeks]]. Abd al-Baqi was then appointed as the new vakil by Ismail I. Abd al-Baqi participated in the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514, where the Safavids, however, were defeated and Abd al-Baqi himself was killed. Another Iranian, [[Mirza Shah Hossein]], was then appointed as the new ''vakil'' after having found Ismail's favorite wife, who was lost after the battle.{{sfn|Roemer|1986|p=231}}

Abd al-Baqi had a son named [[Mir Abd al-Baqi Yazdi]] (d. 1564), who was appointed as the governor of Yazd when Ismail's son [[Tahmasp I]] ascended the Safavid throne in 1524. He also later in 1535/6 married one of Tahmasp's sisters, who bore him an unnamed daughter, who later married Tahmasp's son [[Ismail II]].{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=33}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12690">[[File:Amadeus_III_of_Geneva.png|thumb|Seal of Amadeus III]]
'''Amadeus III''' (29 March 1311&lt;ref&gt;Amadeus' date of birth is indicated in an inscription appearing in the book of hours of his mother, Agnes of Savoy : {{cite journal |last1=Gagnebin |first1=Bernard |title=Le livre d'heures d'Agnès de Savoie, comtesse de Genève |journal=Genava : revue d'histoire de l'art et d'archéologie |date=1963 |volume=11 |page=318-319 |doi=10.5169/seals-727980 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 18 January 1367) was the [[Count of Geneva]] from 1320 until his death. He ruled the [[Genevois (province)|Genevois]], but not the city of [[Geneva]] proper, and it was during his time that the term "Genevois" came to be used as it is today. He was the eldest son and successor of [[William III of Geneva|William III]] and Agnes, daughter of [[Amadeus V of Savoy]]. He played a major rôle in the politics of the [[House of Savoy]], serving consecutively as regent and president of the council, and also sitting on the [[Feudalism|feudal]] tribunal—one of three tribunals of the ''Audiences générales''—of the [[Duchy of Aosta]].

==Conflict with Savoy==
After the city and castle of [[Annecy]] were devastated in a fire in 1320, Amadeus moved his court to [[La Roche-sur-Foron|La Roche]], which had been the seat of the counts of Geneva between 1124 and 1219. In 1325 Amadeus joined the coalition formed by [[Guigues VIII of Viennois]] against [[Edward of Savoy]]. On 7 August he fought in the victory of the [[Battle of Varey]] over the Savoyards.&lt;ref name=cox37&gt;Eugene L. Cox (1967), ''The Green Count of Savoy: Amadeus VI and Transalpine Savoy in the Fourteenth Century'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press), 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1326 the envoys of [[Charles IV of France]] negotiated a truce so that both counts, of Geneva and of Savoy, could join the king's expedition against [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] in 1327–28. In January 1329 the new [[Aimone, Count of Savoy|Count Aymon of Savoy]] came to terms with Amadeus, and the two established a commission to investigate the disputed territory between the [[Duingt]] and the [[Faverges]]. Ultimately Amadeus became a vassal of Aymon for at least a part of his territories. In 1338 another commission was established to deal with further boundary issues. The relationship between the peaceable and unambitious counts of Geneva and Savoy were, after 1337, always friendly.&lt;ref name=cox37/&gt;

In 1336 Amadeus donated the village of [[Vésenaz]] to the monastery of [[Collonge-Bellerive|Bellerive]].

[[File:Chateaunuit.JPG|thumb|left|The Castle of Chambéry, showing the Sainte-Chapelle where Amadeus III stood godfather at his cousin's baptism, and where later he lived during his regency of the county of Savoy.]]

==Regency of Savoy==
On 11 January 1334 Amadeus stood godfather to his first cousin [[Amadeus VI of Savoy]] in the Sainte-Chapelle, then under construction, at [[Chambéry]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Louis II of Vaud]] were designated by Aymon as regents for the young Amadeus, which roles they assumed on Aymon's death on 22 June 1343. On 26 June, after Aymon's funeral, the young Amadeus was crowned as Count of Savoy and Amadeus of Geneva was the first to swear the oath of fealty. The count of Geneva and the lord of Vaud moved into the [[:fr:Château des ducs de Savoie|Castle of Chambéry]] and signed a written agreement, still preserved, whereby neither could act without the consent of the other, and all acts were to be committed to writing for purposes of review.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cox, 34–36, for the details of the regency council laid down in Aymon's will.&lt;/ref&gt; In the details of this agreement considerable mutual suspicion can be detected. The lord of Vaud was the senior statesman of the House of Savoy, while Amadeus III was the head of its chief rival.

The first concern of the regents of Savoy after 1343 was securing the succession against the claims of Joan, daughter of Edward of Savoy, who died on 29 June 1344, but not before ceding her claims to [[Philip of Valois, Duke of Orléans|Philip, Duke of Orléans]]. Amadeus and Louis sent an embassy to [[Pope Clement VI]], seeking his support against Joan and Philip. In 1345 Philip signed a treaty relinquishing his claims in return for an annual stipend of 5,000 ''[[livres tournois]]''. The treaty was finalised at Paris and ratified at Chambéry on 25 February 1346.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 55–56. The royal treasury records Philip's receipt of the first payment on 19 November.&lt;/ref&gt;

==President of the council of Savoy==
In 1347–48 Amadeus spent a long stay at the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignonese ''curia'']] of Clement VI, who was then concerned with settling disputes in the [[Piedmont]] and [[Lombardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 1348 the count of Savoy came of age and the regency ended, although it continued in practice, as Amadeus VI was only fourteen years old. Later that year the lord of Vaud died and Amadeus III was left as sole regent, overseeing the "council of Savoy" or "count's council", as the former regency council was then known.&lt;ref name=cox76&gt;Cox, 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The Savoyard historians [[Jehan Servion]] and [[Jean Cabaret d'Oronville]] record that the council elected one of its members, [[Guillaume de la Baume]], to co-rule with the count of Geneva, who was still not trusted by the Savoyards. Guillaume's election may have been due to French influence.&lt;ref name=cox76/&gt;

In 1348, [[Alamand de Saint-Jeoire]], the [[Bishop of Geneva]], placed two of his castles under the protection of the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], future king of France, in an effort to stem the influence of the counts both of Geneva and of Savoy. Amadeus III's officials took reprisals against the diocese, bringing down the condemnation of Clement VI, who nonetheless maintained his good relations with the counts. Amadeus was not deterred. He seized the two castles and removed the Dauphin's banners, replacing them with his own.&lt;ref name=cox76/&gt; On 8 October 1349 an alliance was sealed at [[Cirié]] between Amadeus III of Geneva, Amadeus VI of Savoy, [[Galeazzo II Visconti|Galeazzo II of Milan]], and [[James of Piedmont]]. This alliance was sealed by the marriage of the count of Savoy's sister [[Bianca of Savoy|Bianca]] to Galeazzo on 28 September 1350, which was followed by the creation of the [[Order of the Black Swan]], of which Amadeus of Geneva was named one of the three ''grans seignours'' (along with the count of Savoy and Galeazzo).&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 9 July 1351, Amadeus had fallen out with the rest of the council of Savoy and its anti-French policy. On that day, presiding over a meeting of the council at [[Saint-Genix]], he ordered that his opposition to hearing some ambassadors from [[Edward III of England]] be recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 80. Edward III was then at war with France, the so-called [[Edwardian War]].&lt;/ref&gt; Amadeus and the Savoyard chancellor, Georges de Solerio, were largely responsible for the subsequent treaty signed with France on 27 October at [[Avignon]].

In 1351 the peasantry of the [[Valais]] rebelled against the lordship of the [[Bishop of Sion]], then [[Guichard Tavel]], of Genevan family and Savoyard allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;For the causes and background of the rebellion, cf. Cox, 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 January 1352 the rebels were excommunicated by Clement VI. In March an army, led by Amadeus of Savoy, Amadeus of Geneva, [[John II, Marquess of Montferrat|John II of Montferrat]], and [[Peter IV of Gruyère]] was gathering at [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland|Saint-Maurice]] to crush the rebels. The inhabitants of the Valais were so intimidated, however, that they surrendered without a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes with Savoy==
In May 1352 Amadeus VI of Savoy nullified the treaty of Avignon negotiated by Amadeus III, maligning (probably without basis) the count of Geneva's integrity. In July Amadeus formally withdrew from the council of Savoy and challenged the lords of [[La Baume]], whom he considered his archenemies at the Savoyard court, to war.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1355, after the conclusion of a war between the count of Savoy and the Dauphin Charles, Amadeus III refused to do homage to his cousin for those fiefs he held of the Dauphin. Amadeus also interfered with the count of Savoy's attempts to militarily occupy the barony of [[Faucigny]] that year, although he did not actively intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his attempts he was unable to induce [[John II of France]] to intervene in the Faucignerans' favour.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July in the [[Franciscan]] monastery at Geneva, Amadeus III did homage to his former ward the count of Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The issues in dispute had by this time been brought before the [[Emperor Charles IV]], the overlord of the entire region. On 21 August he ordered the count of Savoy not to interfere in the Faucigny or the County of Geneva and put both under his direct protection pending an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annecy-1a.jpg|thumb|The Palais de l'Isle in Annecy, once the seat of the count of Geneva, was a mint under Amadeus III.]]

In May 1358 the Emperor exempted Amadeus III of the jurisdiction of Savoy and granted him the right to appeal to the Emperor all decisions by any other court, whether French or Savoyard. Amadeus, but not his successors, was granted the right to coin money (at the [[Palais de l'Isle]]), legitimise bastards, and create notaries.&lt;ref name=cox129&gt;Cox, 129–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop of Geneva immediately opposed the count's right of coinage to the pope. Amadeus of Savoy ordered Amadeus III to renew his oath of homage, but the latter instead asked for the arbitration of [[Jean de Bertrand]], the [[Archbishop of Tarentaise]].&lt;ref name=cox129/&gt; On 2 August the archbishop ruled that Amadeus had the right to mint coins, but not to refuse to renew the oath of homage nor to appeal outside of the courts of the count of Savoy. The count of Geneva refused to accept the result, accusing the archbishop of an "unjust and iniquitous" verdict and vowing to appeal to the Emperor personally (''[[Word of mouth|viva voce]]'').&lt;ref name=cox129/&gt; The two counts came to terms by 21 December. Amadeus III agreed to render homage at Geneva for his fiefs Duingt, Annecy, La Roche, [[Clermont en Genevois|Clermont]], [[Thônes]], [[Gruffy]], [[Arlod]], [[Châtel-Saint-Denis|Châtel]], [[La Bâtie]], and [[Gaillard]], and for the [[Subinfeudation|"sub-fiefs"]] of his own vassals Thomas de Menthon, Guillaume de Compey, and Aymon de Pontverre.&lt;ref name=cox129/&gt; In return Amadeus VI declared the archiepiscopal decision void.

==Order of the Collar and the crusade==
In January 1364 Amadeus III was named the second knight of the newly founded [[Order of the Collar]].&lt;ref&gt;The date comes from Cox, 180–81, who cites Jean Servion as the only source for the original membership of the order.&lt;/ref&gt; While the formation of the Order was connected with the launch of [[:File:Military campaign of Amadeus VI against Bulgaria (1366-67).png|Amadeus VI's crusade]], Amadeus III did not accompany the crusaders. He sent his eldest son, [[Aymon III of Geneva|Aymon III]], in his place, and he himself died only months after the crusaders departed, which suggests that he was in poor health at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 184 and 207–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1334 Amadeus married Mathilde or Mahaut d'Auvergne, also called "de Boulogne", with whom he had numerous offspring, four of whom were counts of Geneva in succession:
*[[Aymon III of Geneva|Aymon III]], successor as Count of Geneva
*[[Amadeus IV of Geneva|Amadeus IV]], succeeded his brother as Count of Geneva
*[[John of Geneva|John]], succeeded his brother as Count of Geneva
*[[Peter of Geneva|Peter]], succeeded his brother as Count of Geneva
*Robert, later the [[Antipope Clement VII]], succeeded his brother as Count of Geneva
*Mary, who married first (1361) [[Jean II de Chalon-Arlay]] (died 1362), then (1366) [[Humbert VII de Thoire]], who thus inherited the county of Geneva after the death of Robert
*Joan (died 1389), married (1358) [[Raymond V of Baux]], [[Prince of Orange]]
*Blanche (died 1420), lady of [[Frontenay]], married (1363) [[Hugh II of Chalon-Arlay]]
*Catherine (died 1407), married (1380) [[Amadeo, Prince of Achaea]]
*Yolanda, married [[Aimery VI of Narbonne]]
*Agnes, became a nun
*Louise, married Guillaume III le Sage, lord of Saint-Georges

The proponents arguing for anti-individualism in these areas have in common the view that what seems to be internal to the individual is to some degree dependent on the [[social environment]], thus self-knowledge, intentions, [[reason]]ing and [[Value theory|moral value]] may variously be seen as being determined by factors outside the person.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jessica: 2004, ''Anti-Individualism and Knowledge''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The position has been supported by Sanford Goldberg&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Sanford (2007). ''Anti-individualism: mind and language, knowledge and justification''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and by other thinkers such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Tyler Burge]].&lt;ref name=burge/&gt;

== Overview ==
Academic discussion negotiating anti-individualism as a reasonable stance started with [[Tyler Burge]]'s 1988 ''Individuation and Self-Knowledge''&lt;ref name=Burge2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burge|first1=Tyler|title=Individuation and Self-Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=November 1988|volume=85|issue=11|pages=649–663|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1007312.files/Week%2013/burge%20individualism.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; being particularly influential. In it, Burge set out to argue for a limited agreement with the Cartesian model of self-cognition as being Authoritative, but also pointed out that knowledge of self-cognition was not always absolute, allowing for the individuation of thought to originate from both the external content of our environment as well as from the internal landscape of our self-knowledge as it is still being discovered: "One can know what one's mental events are and yet not know relevant general facts about the conditions for  individuating those events. It is simply not true that the cogito gives us knowledge of the individuation conditions of our thoughts which enables us to "shut off" their individuation conditions  from the physical environment".&lt;ref name=Burge2/&gt;

Michael McKinsey builds on this in 1991 discussing Burge's view in his paper ''Anti-Individualism and Privileged Access''&lt;ref name=Mckinsey/&gt; arguing that there is no [[Theory of justification|warrant]] to an [[Epistemology|epistemic]] narrow state of mind (i.e. privileged access) and that there is only a wide state of mind as influenced by the conditions of individuation of thought. Anthony Brueckner then questions McKinsey's take on Burge and McKinsey replies in his ''Accepting the Consequences of Anti-individualism''.&lt;ref name=McKinsey2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinsey|first1=Michael|title=Accepting the Consequences of Anti-individualism|journal=Analysis|date=April 1994|volume=54|issue=2|pages=124–128|url=https://www.academia.edu/8199013/Accepting_the_Consequences_of_Anti-Indiividualism|accessdate=26 December 2014|doi=10.2307/3328832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the essays found in Hilary Putnam's ''The Twin Earth Chronicles'' are considered early formative works for the anti-individualist model from the analytic perspective.&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilary|first1=Putnam|title=The Twin Earth Chronicles: Twenty Years of Reflection on Hilary Putnam's "The Meaning of 'Meaning'"|date=1 July 1996|publisher=M.E.

==History==
[[File:Lion Reintron Sites in India.png|thumbnail|right|Historical and proposed lion reintroduction sites in India]]
The distribution of Asiatic lion, once found widely in West and South Asia, dwindled to a single population in the Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in India.&lt;ref name="Wild Cats of the World"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sunquist|first1=Mel|last2=Sunquist|first2=Fiona|title=Wild Cats of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFbJWMh9-OAC&amp;pg=PA304|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=15 August 2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-77999-7|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population at Gir declined to 18 animals in 1893 but increased due to protection and conservation efforts to 284 in 1994.&lt;ref name="Pride in Place"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paulson |first1=Mark |year=1999 |title=Pride in Place: Reintroduction of Asiatic Lions in Gir Forest, India |journal=Restoration and Reclamation Review |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages= |publisher=Dept of Horticultural Science, University of Minnesota |doi= |url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/59294/1/4.3.Paulson.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901034324/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/59294/1/4.3.Paulson.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gir Wildlife Sanctuary is now highly overpopulated with lions, the 2015 census showed the strength to be 523 lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/GUJ-AHD-asiatic-lions-gujarat---s-roar-in-court-lacked-substance-4236798-NOR.html |title=Asiatic lions: Gujarat’s roar in court lacked substance |last1=Shah |first1=Jumana  |date=16 April 2013 |work=DailyBhaskar.com |publisher=DB Corp Ltd., Noida, UP, India |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are numerous deaths in the population annually because of ever increasing competition between the human and animal overcrowding. Asiatic lion prides require large [[territory (animal)|territories]] but there is limited space at Gir wildlife sanctuary, which is boxed in on all sides by heavy human habitation.&lt;ref name="Field Days"/&gt; Gir lions have started moving outwards from the sanctuary and establishing homes outside the protected areas. The lions are now spread over {{convert|16000|km2|sqmi}} in the vicinity of 1050 villages in three contiguous districts - [[Amreli]], [[Bhavnagar]] and [[Junagadh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-15/flora-fauna/40588939_1_asiatic-lions-gir-forest-sasan-gir |title=Asiatic lions have homes in over 1,000 Saurashtra villages |author=Parmar, Vijaysinh |date=15 July 2013 |website=ndiatimes.com |accessdate=23 July 2013|publisher=Bennett &amp; Coleman Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheopur introduction of 1904===
The [[Maharaja of Gwalior]], on being encouraged by [[Lord Curzon]] in 1904, imported cubs of [[African lion]]s and attempted to introduce them in the wild in the forests near Sheopur. The introduced lions took to raiding livestock and some even turned to [[man-eater|man-eating]], subsequent to which they were all eventually tracked down and shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-17/ahmedabad/31747947_1_lions-palpur-kuno-three-cubs ''Past efforts to settle lions in Madhya Pradesh had failed''], May 17, 2012, Ahmedabad (Gujarat) Edition, Times of India.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Chandraprabha relocation of 1957===
The concept of reintroduction for purposes of conservation was accepted in 1956 by the Indian Wildlife Board during a meeting of their executive committee at Sasan Gir and the offer by the state government of [[Uttar Pradesh]] to host a second population in the Chakia forests was accepted. In 1956 one lion and two lionesses were captured from Gir, placed in the Sakkarbuagh Zoo in Junagadh for nine months and translocated in 1957 to the {{convert|96|km2|sqmi}} [[Chandra Prabha Sanctuary]], newly established for the reintroduction, near [[Varanasi]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. An enclosure was created with a {{convert|3|m|ft}} high barbed wire fence within the sanctuary in which the lions were temporarily housed before being released in the sanctuary. Initially the lions prospered increasing in number to four in 1958, five in 1960, seven in 1962 and eleven in 1965 after which the population died out inexplicably.

Johnsingh (2006) attributes the failure of the translocation to three causes – inadequate area, lack of systematic monitoring using scientific techniques and unrestricted movement of grazing animals throughout the sanctuary possibly leading to conflict with the herders.&lt;ref name="Field Days"/&gt; Small size of area, the long period of captivity in Junagadh zoo, absence of education of the local villagers and lack of conflict resolution mechanism are also listed as contributory factors in Chellam and Johnsingh (1999).&lt;ref name="Chellam &amp; Johnsingh(1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chellam |first1=Ravi |last2=Johnsingh |first2=A.J.T. |year=1999 |title=Translocating Asiatic Lions, India |journal=Re-introduction News |issue=18 |pages=11–13 |publisher= |issn=1560-3709 |url=http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/rsg/rsgcdrom/PDFs/RNews18.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081003120756/http://iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/rsg/rsgcdrom/pdfs/rnews18.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wildlife Institute of India initiative===
The [[Wildlife Institute of India]] (WII) began studying the Asiatic lion in its habitat in from 1986 onwards and collected fundamental data about the lion, its feeding, use of habitat and ranging habits. Key findings of the study were that the lions largely preyed upon the wild herbivores such as [[sambar deer|sambar]] (''Rusa unicolor'') and [[chital]] (''Axis axis'') and that the size of home range was {{convert|70|km2|sqmi}} for females and {{convert|140|km2|sqmi}} for the males.&lt;ref name="Chellam &amp; Johnsingh(1999)"/&gt; In 1990, the WII proposed the creation of a second wild population of Asiatic lions to safeguard the species against potential calamities in Gujarat's Gir National Park.&lt;ref name="Science Trumps Politics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tehelka.com/science-trumps-politics/ |title=Science Trumps Politics |last1=Mazoomdar |first1=Jay |last2= |first2= |date=27 April 2013 |work=Tehelka magazine |publisher=Tehelka.com |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6G4EcRM80?url=http://tehelka.com/science-trumps-politics/ |archivedate=April 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1993 PHVA report==
In 1993, a workshop was held on the Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) of Asiatic lion and the report was presented to the state forest departments in [[Vadodara]], Gujarat. State forest departments were asked to suggest suitable sites for reintroduction and provide the basic ecological data.&lt;ref name="Chellam &amp; Johnsingh(1999)"/&gt;

During the workshop, a number of teams were formed to focus on varied aspects of the conservation biology of the Asiatic lion such as monitoring, habitat (further subdivided into Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan sub-groups), population modelling, prey-base requirements, lion-human interactions, translocation, captive zoo animals, public education, veterinary, reproductive and genetic aspects etc.&lt;ref name = "PHVA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zooreach.org/downloads/ZOO_CAMP_PHVA_reports/1993_Asiatic_Lion_PHVA_report.pdf |title=Asiatic Lion Report |editor1-last = Ashraf |editor1-first= N.V.K. |editor2-last = Chellam |editor2-first= Ravi |editor3-last = Sharma |editor3-first= D. |editor4-last = Molur |editor4-first= Sanjay |editor5-last = Walker |editor5-first= Sally

The sites were assessed and ranked for suitability as follows:&lt;ref name = "PHVA"/&gt;
* [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] - found most suitable for reintroduction.&lt;ref name="Field Days"/&gt;
* [[Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary]] - later rejected due to human interference and inadequate prey population.&lt;ref name="Field Days"/&gt;
* [[Darrah National Park|Darrah]] - [[Jawahar Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary]] - later rejected due to degraded habitat and unsuitable geography.&lt;ref name="Field Days"/&gt;
* [[Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary]] - assessed as having limited area, unsuitable terrain, limited water and prey base as well as disturbance.&lt;ref name = "PHVA"/&gt;
* [[Barda Wildlife Sanctuary]] - assessed as having scarcity of water, prey and forage, as well as encroachment and disturbance.&lt;ref name = "PHVA"/&gt;

The PHVA report strongly favoured the scientific management of reintroduction of Asiatic lions to another site:&lt;ref name = "PHVA"/&gt;
{{quote|The overwhelming consensus of the Workshop was that an alternative habitat for the Asiatic lion must be established with all possible speed, but without compromise of the accepted strategies and principles governing systematic and scientific reintroduction. This should be done simultaneously with strengthening effective protection and management of the Gir Forest and assuring the viability of the captive population and alternative genetic resources.}}

The PHVA deliberations were followed by visits to the three most promising site, viz Kuno, Darrah-Jawaharsagar and Sitamata WLS by a survey team of WII headed by Dr [[Ravi Chellam]]. The team evaluated sites over various parameters and compared the same with respect to Gir Forest for determining the suitability of sites. They presented their findings in 1995 to the Government of India and the state forest departments.&lt;ref name="Chellam &amp; Johnsingh(1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "PHVA"/&gt; WII researchers confirmed that the Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary was the most promising location to re-establish a free ranging population of the Asiatic lions and in 2007 certified it ready to receive its first batch of translocated lions.&lt;ref name="JSSPGQQ2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnsingh |first1=A.J.T. |last2=Goyal |first2=S.P. |last3=Qureshi|first3=Qamar|year=2007 |title=Preparations for the reintroduction of Asiatic lion Panthera leo persica into Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, Madhya Pradesh, India |journal=Oryx |volume= |issue=41 |pages=93–96 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/S0030605307001512 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=851224 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project framework==
The framework of the Lion Introduction Project emerged from the transformation of a Monitoring Committee, set up by the Government of India, which met on 10 March 2004 for effective implementation of the reintroduction at Kuno.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Verdict"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=40278 |title=Supreme Court judgement - Centre for Environment Law, WWF-I Versus Union of India &amp; Others : On the issue of a second home for Asiatic Lion|date=16 April 2013 |website=The Judgement Information System |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the meeting the WII Site Survey was examined and it was understood that Kuno Palpur Sanctuary was the most suitable site for reintroduction. The Committee formulated a three phase framework for the conservation project to last for two decades as follows :&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Verdict"/&gt; 
* During the first phase, slated from 1995-2000, the 24 villages would be shifted out of the sanctuary and the habitat would be improved.
* The second phase would last from 2000 to 2005 and would include fencing off of the lion reintroduction site, the actual trans-location, as well as research and monitoring.
* The final phase III would last from 2005 to 2015 and would focus on eco-development of the region.

At that point in time, the project was in Phase II and 18 of the 24 villages had been rehabilitated from Kuno. The refusal of Gujarat state to provide lions was mentioned during this meeting by the Chief Wildlife Warden of Gujarat. A number of steps were approved with consensus which included the engaging of the Gujarat State Government as to the necessity of the project, preparation of a trans-location road map, fresh assessment of prey base of Kuno by WII and continued funding support for welfare measures and habitat improvement for the existing fauna at Kuno.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Verdict"/&gt;

===Establishing the wildlife sanctuary===
The Madhya Pradesh state forest department notified {{convert|345|sqkm|sqmi}} of the Kuno Palpur area as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpforest.org/kuno.html |title=Kuno Sanctuary |publisher=Madhya Pradesh State Forest Department |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2002, a separate Wildlife Division was established for Kuno, effectively increasing the protected area for wildlife to {{convert|1268.861|sqkm|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Verdict"/&gt;

===Rehabilitation of villagers===
Twenty four villages of the [[Sahariya]] tribe, comprising 1545 families, were moved out from the core area and rehabilitated by the state government with assistance from the Central Government. Due to a paucity of suitable revenue lands in the vicinity of Kuno, the state government proposed relocating the villages on degraded protected forests, a move approved by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] (MOEF) of the Government of India, which granted its approval under Section 2 of the [[Forest (Conservation) Act 1980]] for diversion of {{convert|3395.9|ha|acre}}. By 2002-2003, all 24 villages and the identified families were relocated outside Kuno and the former village area converted into grasslands.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Verdict"/&gt;

==Opposition by the Gujarat government==
In 2004, the state government refused to part with the first pride of 19 animals planned for relocation. The state considers the lions as "heritage of the state" and the issue of handing over lions has become a political issue.&lt;ref name="Mitra2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitra|first=Sudipta|title=Gir Forest and the saga of the Asiatic lion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0rME6RjC1sC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=22 April 2013|year=2005|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-7387-183-2|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mangubhai Patel, then State Forest Minister, went on record to state that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-09-02/ahmedabad/27162985_1_asiatic-lion-gir-forest-gir-national-park |title=Gir will be lions' only home: Gujarat |author=Times News Network |date=2 September 2004 |work=The [[Times of India]] - City - Ahmedabad |publisher=Bennet &amp; Coleman|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
::{{quote|''There is no need to shift lions from Gir. We will ensure their survival here.''}}

As early as 2009, the continued opposition of the Gujarat state government led to the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department's exploration of the possibility of procuring zoo-bred Asiatic lions and shifting them and their descendants to Palpur-Kuno.&lt;ref name="DH-6-10-09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/29405/zoo-bred-asiatic-lions-mp.html|title=Zoo-bred Asiatic lions for MP jungles?|author=Kaushik, Himanshu|date=6 October 2009 |website=DeccanHerald.com |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gujarat]] state government has, over time, made various arguments against translocating lions to Madhya Pradesh (MP), such as that the Kuno sanctuary was not suitable lion habitat and that it had inadequate prey base, that MP had been unable to provide adequate protection to tigers in its [[Panna National Park]] and the lions if reintroduced there would be in danger, that the proposed [[Cheetah reintroduction in India|introduction]] of [[Southern African cheetah]]s to Kuno rendered it unsuitable for lion reintroduction.&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22154756 |title=Gujarat's Asiatic lions must be shared - Indian court |author= |date=15 April 2013 |work=BBC News Asia |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gujarat State Wildlife Department proposed new homes for lions in the [[Barda Wildlife Sanctuary]]&lt;ref name="Barda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://girasiaticlion.blogspot.in/2012/04/lions-roar-to-echo-in-porbandars-barda.html |title=Lions' roar to echo in Porbandar's Barda Sanctuary|website=DNA| author=Jha, Paras K.| author2=Gagdekar, Roxy| last-author-amp=yes |date= 4 April 2012|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bhavnagar Amreli Forest]] instead.&lt;ref name="Jesar"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-03-19/ahmedabad/27789455_1_gir-sanctuary-asiatic-lions-mitiala |title=New sanctuary for lions to come up at Jesar|date=19 March 2006 |author=Pathak, Anil |accessdate=13 June 2013 |work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gir's lions have spread beyond the protective area and the measures of the state to engage this phenomenon are being portrayed as providing adequate dispersal to the lion population to prevent disease. Gujarat also played an emotional card by declaring before the Supreme Court that the lion was inextricably bound to the culture of Gujarat and that it was a "family member", hence could not be provided for translocation to Kuno.

This stand of Gujarat suffered a setback when on 15 April 2013, the [[Supreme Court of India]] acknowledged translocation to Kuno as being in the best interest of the species and rejected the Gujarat Government's objections, instead ordering the translocation to be carried out within six months.  A ''bandh'' was called in the villages adjoining the Sasan Gir region on 18 April 2013 protesting the Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Gujarat/Sasan-bandh-against-SC-verdict-on-trans-location-of-lions/Article1-1046408.aspx |title=Sasan bandh against SC verdict on trans-location of lions |author=PTI |date=18 April 2013 |work=[[Hindustan Times]] |publisher=HT Media Ltd. |accessdate=23 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421090548/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Gujarat/Sasan-bandh-against-SC-verdict-on-trans-location-of-lions/Article1-1046408.aspx |archivedate=21 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court verdict and aftermath==
In light of the State Government of Gujarat's refusal to permit the reintroduction of Asiatic lions, a writ petition was filed in 1995 by the Centre for Environment Law and WWF-I in the Indian Supreme Court to get the Gujarat State Government to release a few prides of Asiatic lions for the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary. The Indian Supreme Court fast-tracked the case and delivered a judgement on 16 April 2013 permitting the reintroduction of lions to Kuno, over-ruling the objections of the Gujarat Government.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Verdict"/&gt;

The Gujarat Government filed on 1 July 2013 for a review in the Supreme Court of its 16 April ruling. In its petition, the Gujarat state government claimed that:
::{{quote|''top carnivores have never been successfully translocated''}}
The state has put forward the argument that translocation would break social bonds between members of groups or prides, which are vital for lion survival. The reported presence of tiger cubs in Palpur-Kuno was emphasised, saying that it could result in conflict between these top predators. The state proposed, instead, a second home for lions within Gujarat itself, claiming it would have numerous advantages including being in tune with international guidelines.&lt;ref name="Reluctant"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-02/india/40328037_1_asiatic-lions-kuno-palpur-kuno-wildlife-sanctuary |title=Reluctant to part with lions, Gujarat moves SC |author=Mahapatra, Dhananjay |date=2 July 2013 |work=Times of India |publisher=Bennett &amp; Coleman |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The continued reluctance of the state to part with lions for translocation has come under criticism from prominent environmentalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/environmentalists-slam-gujarat-s-fight-over-gir-lions-387050 |title=Environmentalists slam Gujarat's fight over Gir lions |author=Agence France-Presse |date=2 July 2013 |work=NDTV.com |publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post the verdict, fears have been voiced by Gujarati environmentalists over the gun culture of Madhya Pradesh and number of firearms in Sheopur, the region where the Kuno Palpur sanctuary is located and it is suggested that translocation to such an area would be in violation of IUCN norms on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-29/flora-fauna/38903035_1_asiatic-lion-gir-kuno-palpur |title=Can't send lions to gun country: International Union for Conservation of Nature norms |last1=Kaushik |first1=Himanshu |date=29 April 2013 |website=Times of India |publisher=Bennett &amp; Coleman |accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the release of [[IUCN]] guidelines on translocation, opponents of the project have cited from the provisions and also claimed that the history of translocations especially in India is dismal and hence translocation is not favoured.&lt;ref name="IUCN Guidelines"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/Translocating-animals-outside-home-turf-is-high-risk-International-Union-for-Conservation-of-Nature/articleshow/21154628.cms |title=Translocating animals outside home turf is high risk: International Union for Conservation of Nature |author=Kaushik, Himanshu | date=19 July 2013 |website=Indiatimes.com |publisher=Bennett &amp; Coleman Ltd. |accessdate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Empower"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-28/ahmedabad/40255333_1_translocation-gir-lions-manas |title=10 translocations have failed worldwide |author=Kaushik, Himanshu | date=28 Jun 2013 |website=Indiatimes.com |publisher=Bennett &amp; Coleman Ltd. |accessdate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural spread of over-populated lions from an original range of over {{convert|1412|km2|sqmi}} to an area extending over {{convert|10500|km2|sqmi}}, is considered to mitigate against the risk of epidemic disease.&lt;ref name="ModiChouhan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-translocation-of-asiatic-lions-asiatic-lion-gir-forests-kuno-palpur-sanctuary/1/305463.html |title=Modi, Chouhan continue sparring over translocation of lions |author=Chaturvedi, Devika | date=4 September 2013 |website=IndiaToday.in |publisher=Living Media India Limited. |accessdate=28 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
The Gujarat's government's curative petition against relocation of the wild Asiatic lions from the Gir Forest to Madhya Pradesh was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 14 August 2014.&lt;ref name="TOI-15-08-14"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/MP-had-plan-to-shift-zoo-bred-lions-looking-at-Modis-objection-on-those-in-wild/articleshow/40306682.cms|title=MP had plan to shift zoo-bred lions, looking at Modi's objection on those in wild|author=Naveen, P.|date=15 August 2014 |website=Indiatimes.com |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of continued opposition, the Madhya Pradesh government is considering an alternate plan to release zoo-bred lions from [[Nehru Zoological Park|Hyderabad]] and [[Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden|Sakkarbaug]], a move which has been criticised in the light of the deaths of two newly translocated zoo-bred lions in the [[Etawah Safari Park|safari park at Etawah]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="TOI-05-12-14"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/No-sign-of-Gir-transfer-MP-seeks-to-shift-zoo-lions-to-Kuno/articleshow/45379624.cms|title=No sign of Gir transfer, MP seeks to shift zoo lions to Kuno|author=Naveen, P.|date=5 December 2014 |website=Indiatimes.com |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dismissal of the Gujarat State petition, two NGOs from Gujarat have filed separate petitions against the translocation order, one on the grounds that certain relevant facts have not been brought to the notice of the apex court, the other stating that the importance of Kuno-Palpur as a corridor for migrating tigers between [[Ranthambore National Park]] in Rajasthan and [[Madhav National Park]] in Madhya Prdesh had been downplayed.&lt;ref name="TOI-15-08-14"/&gt;

===2017===
As of December 2017, Madhya Pradesh still has not received lions from Gujarat. For this reason, it may have given up on trying to acquire them.&lt;ref name="TOI 2017"&gt;{{cite news |work=Times of India |title=Tired of Gujarat reluctance on Gir lions, MP to release tigers in Kuno |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/tired-of-gujarat-reluctance-on-gir-lions-mp-to-release-tigers-in-kuno/articleshow/61937836.cms |date=2017-12-05 |accessdate=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HT 2017"&gt;{{cite news |work=Hindustan Times |title=Stalemate on translocation of Gir lions Kuno Palpur in Madhya Pradesh to be used as tiger habitat now |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/stalemate-on-translocation-of-gir-lionskuno-palpur-in-madhya-pradesh-to-be-used-as-tiger-habitat-now/story-hX8ELtxSSL4I8GeLTh6xYI.html |date=2017-12-07 |accessdate=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translocation plan within Gujarat==
The plan is to [[reintroduction of a species|reintroduce]] a pride or two of wild, free-ranging Asiatic lions from [[Gir Forest]] in the neighboring Indian state of [[Gujarat]] to start with.&lt;ref name="Bunsha2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bunsha, Dionne |url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2210/stories/20050520000106500.htm |title=A kingdom too small |journal=Frontline |volume=22 |issue=10 |date=20 May 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212165913/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2210/stories/20050520000106500.htm |archivedate=12 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In compliance with the Supreme Court order of 15 April 2013, the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] has constituted a panel for deciding the best course of action in translocation of animals to Gir. The panel comprises 12 members including member secretary [[National Tiger Conservation Authority]], the Chief Wildlife Wardens of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, member [[Wildlife Institute of India]], and scientists Drs Ravi Chellam, Y.V. Jhala, NK Ranjeet Singh and PR Sinha. The panel will advice both the states on technical aspect of transloction, decide the composition of animals to be translocated, select the prides and animals, supervise the translocation, monitor it and periodically report to the Ministry.&lt;ref name="GirRoarMP"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/Gir-lions-to-roar-in-MP-soon/articleshow/21263193.cms |title=Gir lions to roar in MP soon |author=Naveen, P. |website=timesofindia.com |publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd. | date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first deliberations on 29 July 2013, the panel acceded the need to follow the recent IUCN translocation guidelines but brushed aside Gujarat's objections against the process. A two-member team comprising Dr Ravi Chellam and Dr Y.V. Jhala has been set up to decide the translocation protocol and report within six weeks.&lt;ref name="TOI-15-08-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TransPanel"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Translocation-of-Asiatic-lions-Gujarats-objections-brushed-aside/articleshow/21475800.cms | title=Translocation of Asiatic lions: Gujarat’s objections brushed aside |author= Kaushik, Himanshu |author2= Naveen, P. |last-author-amp= yes| website=timesofindia.com | publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd. | date=30 July 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gujarat objected to meeting of the 12-member panel on 29 July 2013 before its petition had been reviewed and also to the presence of tiger experts on the panel, claiming that lion experts from Gujarat had been ignored, however that petition was rejected by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Object"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-27/flora-fauna/40832735_1_gir-lions-asiatic-lions-gujarat-government|title=Gujarat objects to tiger experts on panel to shift Gir lions|author=Kaushik, Himanshu|date=27 July 2013 |website=Indiatimes.com |publisher=Bennett &amp; Coleman Ltd. |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further development, in April 2015, the Union government has admitted that Madhya Pradesh will have to enlarge the wildlife sanctuary's size, from {{convert|349|km2|sqmi}} to {{convert|700|km2|sqmi}} in order to implement the translocation of the Asiatic lions to Kuno-Palpur from Gujarat's Sasan Gir, a suggestion made in the original project report. This is the first time that the Government of India has accepted that the sanctuary needs to be enlarged. However, the expansion would require the relocation of several big villages, a move the Madhya Pradesh government is not keen to undertake. The Madhya Pradesh Forest Department is of the view that the present sanctuary area and its buffer total over 700&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and are therefore adequate, but have made no mention of notifying the buffer zone area also as a sanctuary.&lt;ref name="TOI-22-04-15"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Kuno-expansion-must-to-house-lions/articleshow/47007365.cms|title=Kuno expansion must to house lions|author=Himanshu Kaushik|website=Indiatimes.com|date=22 April 2015|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a reversal of position, the Ministry of Environment and Forests decided in a meeting in June 2015 against translocation at present on the grounds that it would be detrimental to the breeding and survival of the lions as they lived in social prides. The turn-around of stance has been attributed by environmentalists supporting the translocation to [[Narendra Modi]] who had as Chief Minister of Gujarat stated that the lion was the pride of Gujarat and had publicly declared his opposition to the transfer of lions outside the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/niSTqjTWnYXmlhogS55tuM/Gir-Lions-Forest-ministry-cites-challenges-in-Madhya-Prades.html |title=Gir lions’ relocation to Madhya Pradesh faces hurdle |website=LiveMint |author=Aggarwal, Mayank |date=18 June 2015 |accessdate=19 Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biosatellite''' is an [[satellite| artificial satellite]] designed to carry plants or animals in [[outer space]].{{CN|date=June 2018}} They are used to research the effects of space (cosmic radiation, weightlessness, etc.) on biological matter while in orbit around a [[celestial body]]. The first satellite carrying an animal (a dog, "[[Laika]]") was [[USSR|Soviet]] [[Sputnik 2]] on November 3, 1957. On August 20, 1960 Soviet [[Sputnik 5]] launched and recovered dogs from orbit Earth orbit. 

NASA launched three satellites between 1966 and 1969 for the [[Biosatellite program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/B/Biosatellite.html Biosatellite], [[David J. Darling|David Darling]]'s ''Internet Encyclopedia of Science''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/b/biosatellite.html Biosatellite], ''[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous biosatellites include:
* [[Biosatellite program]] launched by [[NASA]] between 1966 and 1969.
* [[Bion (satellite)|Bion space program]] by Soviet Union
* The [[Mars Gravity Biosatellite]]
* [[Orbiting Frog Otolith]] (OFO-A)

'''Caenogenesis''' (also variously spelled '''cainogenesis''', '''cenogenesis''', '''kainogenesis''', '''kenogenesis''') is the introduction during [[embryon]]ic development of characters or structure not present in the earlier [[evolution]]ary history of the strain or [[species]], as opposed to [[palingenesis]]. Notable examples include the addition of the [[placenta]] in [[mammal]]s.

Caenogenesis constitutes a violation to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[biogenetic law]] and was explained by Haeckel as adaptation to the peculiar conditions of the [[organism]]'s individual development. Other authorities, such as [[Wilhelm His, Sr.]], on the contrary saw embryonic differences as precursors to adult differences.

'''Carina Curto''' (born 15 April 1978) is an American [[mathematician]], an Associate Professor at [[Pennsylvania State University]], and a [[Sloan Research Fellowship|Sloan Research Fellow]].&lt;ref name=":200"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.math.unl.edu/newsletter/data/2011Department_of_Mathematics_Newsletter.pdf|title=UNL Math News - Winter 2011|last=|first=|date=|work=Math News|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.psu.edu/mathbio/faculty/|title=Faculty {{!}} Mathematical Biology at Penn State|website=sites.psu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known for her work on mathematical [[neuroscience]], including the applications of mathematics in both theoretical and [[computational neuroscience]]. Her recent work is funded by the [[BRAIN Initiative]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-carina-curto-thinks-like-a-physicist-to-solve-neuroscience-problems-20180619/|title=Mathematician Carina Curto Thinks Like a Physicist to Solve Neuroscience Problems {{!}} Quanta Magazine|work=Quanta Magazine|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is an Associate Editor at SIAGA, a [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] journal on Applied [[Algebra]] and [[Geometry]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/cpc16/|title=Carina's website|website=www.personal.psu.edu|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Curto was born to [[Argentines|Argentine]] parents and grew up in [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://physicsoflivingsystems.org/brainstructureandfunction/bios/|title=Bios|date=2013-05-03|work=Physical and Mathematical Principles of Brain Structure and Function|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Iowa City West High School]]. During her school years, she attended courses at [[University of Iowa]], including advanced [[mathematics]] classes, [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[French literature]], and more.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 2018|title=In Honor of Women's History Month - Notices of the American Mathematical Society|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201803/201803FullIssue.pdf|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|volume=65|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, she began studying for an [[A.B. degree|A.B]]. in [[Physics]] at [[Harvard University]]. During her time at Harvard, she was awarded prizes including the Detur Book Prize, one of Harvard's oldest awards, and the [[American Physical Society]] minority scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/programs/minorities/honors/scholarship/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Curto&amp;first_nm=Carina&amp;year=1997|title=Prize Recipient|website=www.aps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/206746689/|title=Iowa City Press-Citizen, Friday, January 16, 1998|last=|first=|date=1998-01-16|work=Iowa City Press-Citizen|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Harvard in 2000 and being awarded the [[NSF-GRF|NSF Graduate Research Fellowship]], Curto started a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in mathematics at [[Duke University]]. Curto's Ph.D focused on mathematical [[string theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her thesis was titled 'Matrix Model Superpotentials and [[Calabi–Yau manifold|Calabi-Yau Spaces]]: an ADE Classification'.&lt;ref name=":201" /&gt;

== Career and research ==
Once Curto gained her Ph.D, she moved to [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]], working as a Postdoctoral Associate in a neuroscience lab at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After three years at Rutgers, she returned to working in mathematics, focusing on neuroscience from a more mathematical perspective, and moved to the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences|Courant Institute of Mathematics]] at [[New York University]], then to the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska-Lincoln]], followed by the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. Curto is as an Associate Professor of mathematics, the co-head of their mathematical neuroscience lab, and a member of the Center for Neural Engineering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.unl.edu/research/areas/mathematical_biology/|title=Mathematical Biology {{!}} Department of Mathematics {{!}} Nebraska|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=www.math.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network Connectivity ===
Her research focuses on the interplay between the connectivity and dynamics of the [[brain]] and involves studying neural recordings and analysing the patterns of the activities. This network analysis aims to understand the connections between the [[neuron]]s and their patterns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditionally, neuroscientists rely on tools from [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://neurosciencenews.com/math-method-neural-activity-2912/|title=New Math Method Reveals Structure of Neural Activity|date=2015-10-20|work=Neuroscience News|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Curto's approach uses tools from pure mathematics, particularly [[algebraic geometry]], which is applied to the activity data of the neurons. Curto's research is significant in the field of [[connectomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2018/04/02/cross-pollination-at-cosyne-2018/|title=Cross-Pollination at Cosyne 2018 {{!}} Simons Foundation|website=www.simonsfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06|date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one study showed how neural activities can drastically change by slightly changing the structure of the networks, which has implications for the study of brain disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":200" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2018/05/03/simple-networks-generate-complex-dynamics/|title=Simple Networks Generate Complex Dynamics {{!}} Simons Foundation|website=www.simonsfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06|date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Katherine Morrison from the [[University of Northern Colorado]], and with funding from the government's BRAIN Initiative grant and the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], Curto is working on Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Networks, CTLNs. These models enable the observations of emergent patterns, such as neuronal sequences and complex rhythms, and can also be used to predict features of the dynamics, something that has been seemingly difficult to predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Morrison|first=Katherine|last2=Curto|first2=Carina|date=2018-04-04|title=Predicting neural network dynamics via graphical analysis|eprint=1804.01487|class=q-bio.NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/graphs-neural-networks-and-emergent-dynamics-brain|title=Graphs, neural networks, and emergent dynamics in the brain {{!}} Division of Applied Mathematics|website=www.brown.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aligned with her research, Curto, alongside Morrison, also created a project called Network Songs, which originally started out as a gimmick. This is a collection of songs, that show the rhythmic activity of the networks. The basis of the songs were created by assigning a note on the piano to each neuron. Curto explains that sometimes certain patterns are better distinguished by the ear, than by the eye, hence the purpose of this particular representation of the network data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slideplayer.com/slide/9703374/|title=NETWORK SONGS !! created by Carina Curto &amp; Katherine Morrison January 2016 Input: a simple directed graph G satisfying two rules: 1. G is an oriented. -  ppt download|website=slideplayer.com|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and personal life ==
Curto has been the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including becoming a [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation|Woodrow Wilson National Fellow]] and an [[Sloan Research Fellowship|Alfred Sloan Research Fellow]]. Additionally, in 2012, Curto was named a [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|UNL]] Academic Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.unl.edu/department/awards/faculty|title=Faculty Awards {{!}} Department of Mathematics {{!}} Nebraska|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=www.math.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, the [[American Mathematical Society]], AMS, included Curto in a list of 27 female mathematicians in honour of [[Women's History Month]], publishing a profile of her in the [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society|AMS Notices journal]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Throughout her years as a mathematician, Curto has taken part in many events and boards to promote women in mathematics. This includes being involved with the Women In Math club at [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|UNL]] and being part of the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics, NCUWM, organizing committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.unl.edu/math-club/events/archive|title=Math Club Events Archive {{!}} Department of Mathematics {{!}} Nebraska|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=www.math.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.math.unl.edu/~ncuwm/16thAnnual/ncuwm_aboutus.php|title=Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics {{!}} About Us|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=www.math.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curto is also an amateur [[tennis]] player. In 1995, when at high school, she became the Double State Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iowacityschools.org/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=28282&amp;dataid=38664&amp;FileName=State%20Championships.pdf|title=Trojan Hall of Fame - Iowa City Schools|last=|first=|date=2018-05-24|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1996-1997 she was the Varsity Letter Winner for Women's tennis at Harvard.

Curto lives in [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] with her husband and two children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">'''Christian Afrikaner''' (born before 1820, died 15 June 1863) was the oldest son of [[Jonker Afrikaner]] and Beetje Boois. He became the fifth Captain of the mixed-race [[Oorlam (ethnic group)|Orlam]] Afrikaners in [[South-West Africa]], after the death of his father in 1861.&lt;ref name="Dierks"&gt;{{cite web

Christian was born at [[Bethanie, Namibia|Bethanie]], in what is now [[Namibia]], at some time before 1820. He became leader of the Orlams while still in his twenties, at a time when his people were in constant conflict with the [[Herero people|Herero]] over land and cattle but did not have the support of the European traders in Otjimbingwe, particularly [[Charles John Andersson|Karl Johan Andersson]] and [[Frederick Thomas Green|Frederick Green]]. They considered that the war was bad for trade, and helped organising and leading the Herero army. Consequently, the Herero were better equipped and gradually took over military dominance. 

Christian Afrikaner died in an attack on [[Maharero]]'s settlement at [[Otjimbingwe]] on 15 June 1863. This incident marked the beginning of the erosion of power of the Orlam Afrikaners.&lt;ref name="Dierks"/&gt;

'''Christopher Bainbridge''' ([[circa|c.]] 1462/1464 – 1514) was an English [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church]]. He served as [[Archbishop of York]] from 1508 until his death.&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge&gt;{{cite web |last=Miranda |first=Salvador |title=Christopher Bainbridge |url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1511.htm |work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church |accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The cardinal came from a [[Westmorland]] family with roots in [[Bainbridge, North Yorkshire]] and was a maternal nephew of [[Thomas Langton]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], which may account for his charmed early life. He was granted an [[indult]] in 1479 which allowed him to hold church [[benefice]]s while still unordained and under the age of 16, and another in 1482 that allowed him to hold more than one benefice concurrently. He was said to have been fifty years old at his death and must therefore have been born about 1464.&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge/&gt;

He was described as a magister, or scientist, by 1486; at [[Bologna]] he was admitted [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] in 1492; he was in Rome between 1492–1494. Appointed [[Provost (education)|Provost]] of [[Queen's College, Oxford]] in 1496, and [[Master of the Rolls]] in 1504, he was incorporated at [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 20 January 1505. By 1497, he had become chaplain to [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]; in 1503 [[Dean (religion)|dean]] of York; in 1505 he was [[Dean of Windsor|Dean]] of [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor]]. He was appointed [[Bishop of Durham]] on 27 August 1507.&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge/&gt;

==Archbishop of York and Cardinal==
Bainbridge was [[translation (religion)|translated]] to York on 22 September 1508, a sign of the favour he enjoyed at court. On 24 September 1509, King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (whose coronation he had attended) appointed Bainbridge to be his ambassador to [[Pope Julius II]].

Just at this time Julius had taken alarm at the invasion of Italy by [[Louis XII of France]], and the support of England was therefore of great importance.&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge/&gt;

Julius left Rome to relieve [[Bologna]], and was nearly taken prisoner in the war. A group of pro-French cardinals summoned a council in opposition to him at [[Pisa]], which Julius opposed by calling another council at Rome, the [[Fifth Lateran Council]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesco Guicciardini]], Storia d'Italia, Lib.10, cap.2&lt;/ref&gt; in the course of which he created (in March 1511) several new Cardinals, of which Bainbridge was one, with the title of "Cardinal of St. Praxed's" or [[Santa Prassede]].&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge/&gt;

Bainbridge was immediately sent with an army to lay siege to [[Ferrara]], but the creation of the [[War of the League of Cambrai|Holy League]] relieved the papacy of some pressure by involving Spain against the French forces. Pope Julius II was succeeded on his death by [[Pope Leo X]], who was initially willing to grant the title of ''Christianissimus Rex'' (Most Christian King) to Henry, after Francis had automatically forfeited the title by waging war on the Pope. However, Henry's making peace with France in 1514 probably ended these hopes.&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge/&gt;

Bainbridge died on 14 July 1514, having been poisoned by one of his own chaplains, [[Rinaldo de Modena]]. Rinaldo was imprisoned and confessed to the crime. He also implicated [[Silvestro de' Gigli|Silvester de Giglis]], then [[Bishop of Worcester]], as the instigator of the plot. De Giglis was the resident English ambassador at Rome, and regarded Bainbridge as a threat to his position: he also had sufficient power and influence to make Rinaldo retract his confession and have him killed in prison.&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge/&gt;

[[Richard Pace]] and [[John Clerk (bishop)|John Clerk]], the cardinal's executors, were eager to prosecute De Giglis, but he maintained that the priest was a madman whom he had dismissed from his own service some years before in England, and his defence was accepted as sufficient.&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge/&gt;

Bainbridge was buried in the chapel of St Thomas of Canterbury at the English hospice in Rome, which later became the [[Venerable English College]].&lt;ref name=mirandabainbridge/&gt;

The '''Daleks''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Mgm_pronunciation_Dalek.ogg|ˈ|d|ɑː|l|ɛ|k|s}} {{Respell|DAH|leks}}) are a fictional [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] race of [[mutant]]s principally portrayed in the British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The Daleks were conceived by science-fiction writer [[Terry Nation]] and first appeared in the 1963 ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The Daleks]]'', in the shells designed by [[Raymond Cusick]].

Drawing inspirations from the real-life example of the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s, Nation portrayed the Daleks as violent, merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens, who demand total conformity to their will,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2015/doctor-who-50-things-you-didnt-know/ The Daleks were based on the Nazis...]&lt;/ref&gt; bent on the conquest of the universe and the [[Genocide|extermination]] of what they see as inferior races. 

In the programme's narrative, the Daleks were engineered by the scientist [[Davros]] during the final years of a thousand-year war between his people, the Kaleds, and their enemies the [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]]s. With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like, [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s protagonist, the [[Time Lord]] known as "[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]". Later in the programme's run, the Daleks acquired [[time travel in fiction|time travel technology]] and engaged the Time Lords in a brutal [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] affecting most of the universe, with battles taking place across all of history. 

They are the show's most popular villains and their returns to the series over the decades have gained media attention and their frequent order to "Exterminate!" has become common usage.

==Creation==
The Daleks were created by writer [[Terry Nation]] and designed by [[BBC]] designer [[Raymond Cusick]].&lt;ref name=Cusick&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=Asa |authorlink=Asa Briggs |title=The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom |year=1995 |volume=vol. 5 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0pRGjVGtUvwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A019215964X&amp;pg=PA422#v=onepage&amp;q= |accessdate=20 March 2010 |isbn=0-19-215964-X }}&lt;br/&gt;Designer Raymond Cusick said that he got the idea of their appearance "whilst fiddling with a pepperpot" and had them produced in fibreglass, at a cost of under &amp;pound;250 each.&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced in December 1963 in the second ''Doctor Who'' serial, colloquially known as ''[[The Daleks]]''.&lt;ref name=B2&gt;{{cite episode

They have become as synonymous with ''Doctor Who'' as the Doctor himself, and their behaviour and catchphrases are now part of British [[popular culture]].

==Entry into popular culture==
As early as one year after first appearing on ''Doctor Who'', the Daleks had become popular enough to be recognized even by non-viewers. In December 1964 [[editorial cartoonist]] [[Leslie Gilbert Illingworth]] published a cartoon in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' captioned "THE DEGAULLEK", caricaturing French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] arriving at a [[NATO]] meeting as a Dalek with de Gaulle's prominent nose.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cartoons.ac.uk/record/06435&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Dalek" has entered major dictionaries, including the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines "Dalek" as "a type of robot appearing in 'Dr. Who'{{sic}}, a B.B.C. Television science-fiction programme; hence used allusively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=J. A. |editor1-last=Simpson |editor1-link=John Simpson (lexicographer) |editor2-first=E. S.

For example, [[John Birt]], the [[Director-General of the BBC]] from 1992 to 2000, was called a "croak-voiced Dalek" by playwright [[Dennis Potter]] in the MacTaggart Lecture at the 1993 [[Edinburgh International Television Festival|Edinburgh Television Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Externally, Daleks resemble human-sized [[salt and pepper shakers|pepper pots]]&lt;ref name="Cusick"/&gt; with a single mechanical eyestalk mounted on a rotating dome, a gun mount containing an energy weapon ("gunstick" or "[[death ray]]") resembling an egg whisk, and a telescopic manipulator arm usually tipped by an appendage resembling a sink [[plunger]].

The lower half of a Dalek's shell is covered with hemispherical protrusions, or "Dalek bumps", which are shown in the episode "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" to be spheres embedded in the casing.&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt; Both the BBC-licensed ''Dalek Book'' (1964) and ''The Doctor Who Technical Manual'' (1983) describe these items as being part of a sensory array,&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1983), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; whilst in the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|2005 series]] episode "Dalek", they are integral to a Dalek's [[self-destruct]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt; Their armour has a forcefield that evaporates most bullets and resists most types of energy weapons. The forcefield seems to be concentrated around the Dalek's midsection (where the mutant is located), as normally ineffective firepower can be concentrated on the eyestalk to blind a Dalek.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Remembrance of the Daleks'', there are two Dalek factions (Imperial and Renegade) and the creatures inside have a different appearance in each case, one resembling the amorphous creature from ''Resurrection'', the other the crab-like creature from the original Dalek serial. As the creature inside is rarely seen on screen, a common misconception exists that Daleks are wholly mechanical robots.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor – Inside a Dalek |work=The Times |location=UK |first=Terrance |last=Dicks |authorlink=Terrance Dicks |date=20 December 1974 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|new series]] Daleks are [[retcon]]ned to be [[mollusc]]-like in appearance, with small tentacles, one or two eyes, and an exposed brain.&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt;

Daleks' voices are electronic; when out of its casing the mutant is only able to squeak.&lt;ref name=Resurrection1/&gt; Once the mutant is removed, the casing itself can be entered and operated by humanoids; for example, in ''[[The Daleks]]'', [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (actor)|William Russell]]) enters a Dalek shell to masquerade as a guard as part of an escape plan.&lt;ref name=B3/&gt;

===Prop details===
The non-humanoid shape of the Dalek did much to enhance the creatures' sense of menace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mithilareview.com/mukherjee_04_17/|title=Aliens with a Human Face: The Human-like Non-Humans of Doctor Who {{!}} Mithila Review|date=2017-04-11|work=Mithila Review|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of familiar reference points differentiated them from the traditional "[[bug-eyed monster]]" of science fiction, which ''Doctor Who'' creator [[Sydney Newman]] had wanted the show to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), pp. 3, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; The unsettling Dalek form, coupled with their alien voices, made many believe that the props were wholly mechanical and operated by remote control.&lt;ref name="dalek companion"&gt;Howe (2004), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daleks were actually controlled from inside by short operators,&lt;ref name="Monsters-82"&gt;Howe (1997), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; who had to manipulate their eyestalks, domes, and arms, as well as flashing the lights on their heads in sync with the actors supplying their voices. The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section, and then the top would be secured. The operators looked out between the cylindrical louvres just beneath the dome, which were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.&lt;ref name="Monsters-82"/&gt;

In addition to being hot and cramped, the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for operators to hear the director's commands or studio dialogue. [[John Scott Martin]], a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: "You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger. If you were related to an octopus then it helped."&lt;ref name="Monsters_85"&gt;Howe (1997), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Doctor Who'''s 21st-century revival the Dalek casings retain the same overall shape and dimensional proportions of previous Daleks, although many details have been re-designed to give the Dalek a heavier and more solid look.&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Arnopp |first=Jason |date=July 2005 |title=Tucker's Luck |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] Special Edition |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|Royal Tunbridge Wells]], Kent |issue=11 |pages=62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes include a larger, more pointed base; a glowing eyepiece; an all-over metallic-brass finish (specified by Davies); thicker, nailed strips on the "neck" section; a housing for the eyestalk pivot; and significantly larger dome lights.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt; The new prop made its on-screen debut in the 2005 episode "Dalek".&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt; These Dalek casings use a short operator inside the housing while the 'head' and eyestalk are operated via remote control. A third person, [[Nicholas Briggs]], supplies the voice in their various appearances.&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Briggs |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Briggs |date=25 May 2005 |title=Diary of a Dalek |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|Royal Tunbridge Wells]], Kent |issue=356 |pages=23–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 season, a new, larger model appeared in several colours representing different parts of the Dalek command hierarchy.

====Movement====
Terry Nation's original plan was for the Daleks to glide across the floor. Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1997), pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.&lt;ref name="Monsters_85"/&gt;

Later versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.&lt;ref name="Monsters_85"/&gt; This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the "new series" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2006), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voices====
The [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone, and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by voice actors [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who would vary the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. Although the exact sound-processing devices used have varied, the original 1963 effect used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&amp;nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which director [[Graeme Harper]] deliberately used less distortion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC – Doctor Who – Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',&lt;ref name=Planet&gt;''[[Planet of the Daleks]].''

BBC1, London. 7 April–12 May 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the one-off anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]''. [[Michael Wisher]], the actor who originated the role of Dalek creator Davros in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', provided Dalek voices for that same story, as well as for ''[[Frontier in Space]]'', ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'', and ''[[Death to the Daleks]]''.

In a 2006 BBC Radio interview, Briggs said that when the BBC asked him to do the voice for the new television series, they instructed him to bring his own analogue ring modulator that he had used in the audio plays. The BBC's sound department had changed to a digital platform and could not adequately create the distinctive Dalek sound with their modern equipment. Briggs went as far as to bring the voice modulator to the actors' readings of the scripts.&lt;ref name="Briggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dalek confidential"/&gt;

Four fully functioning props were commissioned for the first serial "The Daleks" in 1963, and were constructed from BBC plans by Shawcraft Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/b.html |title=The Daleks |accessdate=9 March 2010 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |date=24 July 2006 |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)}}&lt;/ref&gt; These became known in fan circles as [[Dalek variants#Mark I Daleks|"Mk I Daleks"]]. Shawcraft were also commissioned to construct approximately 20 Daleks for the two Dalek movies in 1965 and 1966 (see [[#Other appearances|below]]). Some of these movie props filtered back to the BBC and were seen in the televised serials, notably ''The Chase'', which was aired before the first movie's debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/r.html |title=The Chase |accessdate=9 March 2010 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |date=14 January 2010 |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining props not bought by the BBC were either donated to charity or given away as prizes in competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), pp. 132, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC's own Dalek props were reused many times, with components of the original Shawcraft "Mk I Daleks" surviving right through to their final classic series appearance in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/remembrance-of-the-daleks.htm |title=Dalek 6388 Remembrance |work=Dalek 6388 – A Dalek Prop History – Remembrance of the Daleks |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But years of storage and repainting took their toll. By the time of the [[Sixth Doctor]]'s ''Revelation of the Daleks'' new props were being manufactured out of [[fibreglass]]. These models were lighter and more affordable to construct than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Monsters_92"&gt;Howe (1997), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These newer models were slightly bulkier in appearance around the mid-shoulder section, and also had a redesigned skirt section which was more vertical at the back. Other minor changes were made to the design due to these new construction methods, including altering the fender and incorporating the arm boxes, collars, and slats into a single fibreglass moulding.&lt;ref name="Monsters_92"/&gt; These props were repainted in grey for the [[Seventh Doctor]] serial ''Remembrance of the Daleks'' and designated as "[[Dalek variants#Renegade Daleks|Renegade Daleks]]"; another redesign, painted in cream and gold, became the "[[Dalek variants#Imperial Daleks|Imperial Dalek]]" faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7h.html |title=Remembrance of the Daleks |accessdate=9 March 2010 |last=Sullivan |first=Shannon Patrick |work=A Brief History of Time (Travel)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Dalek props were built for the 21st century version of ''Doctor Who''. The first, which appeared alone in the 2005 episode "[[Dalek (episode)|Dalek]]", was built by modelmaker [[Mike Tucker]].&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt; Additional Dalek props based on Tucker's master were subsequently built out of fibreglass by [[Cardiff]]-based Specialist Models.&lt;ref name="Specialist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialistmodels.co.uk/services/film_and_tv/bbc_wales_dr_who_daleks_fibreglass_props |title=BBC Wales Dr Who Daleks Fibreglass Props |date=21 March 2010 |publisher=Specialist Models &amp; Displays |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904183235/http://www.specialistmodels.co.uk/services/film_and_tv/BBC_Wales_Dr_Who_Daleks_Fibreglass_Props |archivedate=4 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Wishing to create an alien creature that did not look like a "man in a suit", Terry Nation stated in his script for the first Dalek serial that they should have no legs.&lt;ref name=";Monsters-80"&gt;Howe (1997), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; He was also inspired by a performance by the [[Georgian National Ballet]], in which dancers in long skirts appeared to glide across the stage.&lt;ref name=";Monsters-80"/&gt; For many of the shows, the Daleks were operated by retired ballet dancers wearing black socks while sitting inside the Dalek.&lt;ref name="dalek companion"/&gt; Raymond Cusick was given the task of designing the Daleks when [[Ridley Scott]], then a designer for the BBC, proved unavailable after having been initially assigned to their debut serial.&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;Howe (1994), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; An account in Jeremy Bentham's ''Doctor Who—The Early Years'' (1986) says that after Nation wrote the script, Cusick was given only an hour to come up with the design for the Daleks, and was inspired in his initial sketches by a pepper shaker on a table.&lt;ref name="bentham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=Doctor Who—The Early Years |date=May 1986 |publisher=W.H. Allen |location=England |isbn=0-491-03612-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cusick himself, however, states that he based it on a man seated in a chair, and only used the pepper shaker to demonstrate how it might move.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2006), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Cusick is generally given sole credit for the design of the Dalek,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Nation (1979), p. 42, Howe (1992), p. 124, Peel (1988) pp. 18–20)&lt;/ref&gt; but Jeremy Rewse-Davies is occasionally described as the Daleks' co-designer.&lt;ref name="rewsedavies"&gt;{{cite news |title=No more transports of delight |first=Jonathan |last=Glancey |authorlink=Jonathan Glancey |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/no-more-transports-of-delight-1584494.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=1 June 1995 |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

In 1964 Nation told a ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reporter that the Dalek name came from a dictionary or encyclopaedia volume, the spine of which read "Dal – Lek" (or, according to another version, "Dal – Eks").&lt;ref name="Peel2122"&gt;Peel (1988), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; He later admitted that this book and the origin of the Dalek name was completely fictitious, and that anyone bothering to check out his story would have found him out.&lt;ref name="Peel2122"/&gt; The name had in reality simply rolled off his typewriter.&lt;ref name="companion 13"&gt;Howe (1998), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nation was pleasantly surprised to discover that in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] the word "dalek" means "far", or "distant".&lt;ref name="30 years"&gt;Davies, Kevin (director) (1993). ''More than 30 Years in the TARDIS'' London, UK: BBC Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nation grew up during World War II, and remembered the fear caused by German bombings. He consciously based the Daleks on the [[Nazism|Nazis]], conceiving the species as faceless, authoritarian figures dedicated to conquest and complete conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The allusion is most obvious in the Dalek stories penned by Nation, in particular ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' (1964) and ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Miles (2006), pp. 105–109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1998), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/genesisofdaleks/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide – Genesis of the Daleks – Details |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Howe |first=David J. |authorlink=David J. Howe|author2=[[Stephen James Walker]] |origyear=1998|year=2003 |work=official ''Doctor Who'' website |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to writing the first Dalek serial, Nation was a scriptwriter for comedian [[Tony Hancock]]. The two men had a falling out, and Nation either resigned or was fired.&lt;ref name=";Monsters-80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peel2122"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles (2006), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock worked on several series proposals, one of which was called ''From Plip to Plop'', a comedic history of the world which would have ended with a nuclear apocalypse, the survivors being reduced to living in dustbin-like robot casings and eating radiation to stay alive. According to biographer Cliff Goodwin, when Hancock saw the Daleks, he allegedly shouted at the screen, "That bloody Nation—he's stolen my robots!"&lt;ref name="hancock"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |first=Cliff |title=When the Wind Changed: The Life and Death of Tony Hancock |date=Nov 2000 |publisher=Arrow |location=England |isbn=0-09-960941-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming of early ''Doctor Who'' stories is complex and sometimes controversial.&lt;ref name="pixley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.bw.edu/~jcurtis/Pixley_3.htm |title=By Any Other Name |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Pixley |first=Andrew |date=15 January 2001 |work=Earthbound Timelords}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1998), unpaginated "Authors' Note"&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |title=Doctor Who—The Legend: 40 Years of Time Travel |last=Richards |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Richards |year=2003 |publisher=[[BBC Books]] |location=London |isbn=0-563-48602-3 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Dalek serial is called, variously, ''The Survivors'' (the pre-production title), ''The Mutants'' (its official title at the time of production and broadcast, later taken by [[The Mutants|another unrelated story]]), ''Beyond the Sun'' (used on some production documentation), ''The Dead Planet'' (the on-screen title of the serial's first episode), or simply ''[[The Daleks]]''.&lt;ref name="pixley"/&gt;

The instant appeal of the Daleks caught the BBC off-guard,&lt;ref name="Peel2122"/&gt; and transformed ''Doctor Who'' into a national phenomenon. Children were alternately frightened and fascinated by the alien look of the monsters, and the ''Doctor Who'' production office was inundated by letters and calls asking about the creatures. Newspaper articles focused attention on the series and the Daleks, further enhancing their popularity.&lt;ref name="dalek companion"/&gt;

Nation jointly owned the intellectual property rights to the Daleks with the BBC, and the money-making concept proved nearly impossible to sell to anyone else; he was dependent on the BBC wanting to produce stories featuring the creatures.&lt;ref name="dioe notes"&gt;On-screen production notes, ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' London, UK: BBC Video, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Several attempts to market the Daleks outside of the series were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Peel (1988), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1997), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Since Nation's death in 1997, his share of the rights is now administered by his former agent, Tim Hancock.&lt;ref name="daleksback"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3535588.stm|title=Daleks back to fight Doctor Who|publisher=BBC News |date=4 August 2004|accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early plans for what eventually became the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television movie]] included radically redesigned Daleks whose cases unfolded like spiders' legs.&lt;ref&gt;Segal (2000), pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for these "[[Spider Dalek]]s" was abandoned, but picked up again in several [[Doctor Who spin-offs|''Doctor Who'' spin-offs]].&lt;ref name="spider"&gt;{{Cite comic

==Fictional history==
{{Main article|History of the Daleks}}

Dalek in-universe history has seen many [[retcon|retroactive changes]], which have caused [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Peel (1988), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; When the Daleks first appeared, they were presented as the descendants of the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]] races 500 years ago. This race of Daleks is destroyed when their power supply is wrecked.&lt;ref name=B&gt;''[[The Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[Christopher Barry]], Producer [[Verity Lambert]]. ''Doctor Who''. [[BBC]], London. 21 December 1963 – 1 February 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when they reappear in ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'', they have conquered Earth in the 22nd century. Later stories saw them develop time travel and a space empire. In 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in ''Genesis of the Daleks'', where the Dals were now called [[Kaled]]s (of which "Daleks" is an [[anagram]]), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist and evil genius, Davros.&lt;ref name=Genesis&gt;''[[Genesis of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[David Maloney]], Producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 8 March–12 April 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war of [[attrition warfare|attrition]], fought with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapon]]s which caused widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in [[tank]]-like "travel machines" whose design was based on his own life-support chair.&lt;ref name="Genesis"/&gt;

''Genesis of the Daleks'' marked a new era for the depiction of the species, with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely referred to again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory2.shtml |title=The second history of the Daleks |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Cornell |first2=Martin |last2=Day |authorlink2=Martin Day |first3=Keith |last3=Topping |authorlink3=Keith Topping |year=1995 |work=Official Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future stories in the original ''Doctor Who'' series, which followed a rough [[story arc]],&lt;ref&gt;Parkin (2006), p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; would also focus more on Davros, much to the dissatisfaction of some fans who felt that the Daleks should take centre stage rather than merely becoming minions of their creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=David J. Howe |last1=Howe |first1=David J |first2=Stephen James |last2=Walker |authorlink2=Stephen James Walker | year = 1998 | title = Doctor Who: The Television Companion | edition = 1st | page = 455 | location = London | publisher=BBC Books | isbn = 1-903889-51-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davros made his last televised appearance for 20 years in ''Remembrance of the Daleks'', which depicted a civil war between two factions of Daleks. One faction, the "Imperial Daleks", were loyal to Davros, who had become their Emperor, whilst the other, the "Renegade Daleks", followed a black Supreme Dalek. By the end of the story, both factions have been wiped out and the Doctor has tricked them into destroying Skaro, though Davros escapes.&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;

A single Dalek appeared in "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]", written by [[Rob Shearman|Robert Shearman]], which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005. This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] which had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt; A [[Emperor Dalek|Dalek Emperor]] returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with genetic material harvested from human subjects. It saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. These Daleks and their fleet were destroyed in "[[The Parting of the Ways]]".&lt;ref name=Parting/&gt; The 2006 season finale "[[Army of Ghosts]]"/"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]" featured a squad of four Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the [[Cult of Skaro]], led by a black Dalek known as "[[Dalek Sec|Sec]]", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the [[The Void (Doctor Who)|Void]] between dimensions. They emerged, along with the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison vessel containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the [[Torchwood Institute]] and [[Cyberman#Revived series|Cybermen from a parallel world]]. This resulted in a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London, which was resolved when the [[Tenth Doctor]] caused both groups to be sucked back into the Void. The Cult survived by utilising an "emergency temporal shift" to escape.&lt;ref name=Doomsday/&gt;&lt;ref name="army"&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[Army of Ghosts]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = Cardiff | airdate = 1 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four Daleks - Sec, Jast, Thay and Caan - returned in the two-part story "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]"/"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]", in which whilst stranded in 1930s New York, they set up a base in the partially built [[Empire State Building]] and attempt to rebuild the Dalek race. To this end, Dalek Sec merges with a human being to become a Human/Dalek hybrid. The Cult then set about creating "Human Daleks" by "formatting" the brains of a few thousand captured humans, with the intention of producing hybrids which remain fully human in appearance but with Dalek minds.&lt;ref name=Evolution&gt;{{cite episode | title = Evolution of the Daleks | episodelink = Evolution of the Daleks | series = Doctor Who | serieslink = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Helen Raynor]], Director [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC1 | location = Cardiff | airdate = 28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalek Sec, however, starts to become so human that he changes the DNA to make the hybrids more human. This angers the rest of the Cult, resulting in mutiny and the death of Sec, Thay and Jast as well as the wiping out of all the hybrids. This leaves Dalek Caan as the last Dalek in existence. When the Doctor makes Caan realise that he is the last of his kind, Caan uses emergency temporal shift and escapes once more.&lt;ref name=Evolution/&gt;

The Daleks returned in the 2008 season's two-part finale, "[[The Stolen Earth]]"/"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]", accompanied once again by their creator Davros. The story reveals that Caan's temporal shift sent him into the Time War whence he rescued Davros, in the process gaining the ability to see the future at the cost of his own sanity. Davros has created a new race using his own body's cells. The episode depicts a Dalek invasion of Earth, which with other planets is taken to the Medusa Cascade, led by a red Supreme Dalek, who has kept Caan and Davros imprisoned in "The Vault", a section of the Dalek flagship, the ''Crucible''. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a "reality bomb" for which they need the stolen planets. The plan fails due to the interference of [[Donna Noble]], a companion of the Doctor, and Caan himself, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed.&lt;ref name=Stolen&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[The Stolen Earth]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Journey&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daleks returned in the 2010 episode "[[Victory of the Daleks]]", the third episode of the series; Daleks who escaped the destruction of Davros' empire fell back in time and, by chance, managed to retrieve the "Progenitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532/doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |publisher=BBC | title=BBC concept artwork for Dalek Progenator | last=McKinstry | first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a tiny apparatus which contains 'original' Dalek DNA. The activation of the Progenitor results in the creation of a "new paradigm" of Daleks. The [[The New Daleks|New Paradigm Daleks]] deem their creators inferior and exterminate them; their creators make no resistance to this, deeming themselves inferior as well. They are organised into different roles (drone, scientist, strategists, supreme and eternal), which are identifiable with colour-coded armour instead of the identification plates under the eyestalk used by their predecessors. They escape the Doctor at the end of the episode via time travel with the intent to rebuild their Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=3 March 2010 |title=The Eleventh Doctor is coming! |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=418 |page=5 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|Royal Tunbridge Wells]], Kent |issn=0957-9818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daleks only appeared briefly in subsequent finales "[[The Pandorica Opens]]"/"[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]" (2010) and [[The Wedding of River Song]] (2011) as Steven Moffat decided to "give them a rest" and stated "There's a problem with the Daleks. They are the most famous of the Doctor's adversaries and the most frequent, which means they are the most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13594932 | publisher=BBC News | title=Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat to 'rest' Daleks | date=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They next appear in "[[Asylum of the Daleks]]" (2012), where the Daleks are shown to have greatly increased numbers and have a Parliament; in addition to the traditional "modern" Daleks, several designs from both the original and new series appear. All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In "[[The Time of the Doctor]]", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.

The [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, "[[Into the Dalek]]" (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In "[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]"/"[[The Witch's Familiar]]" (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In "[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]" (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.

==Dalek culture==
Daleks have little, if any, individual personality,&lt;ref name=Doomsday/&gt; ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt; and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.&lt;ref name=Evil&gt;''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]], Director Derek Martinus, Producer [[Innes Lloyd]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 20 May–1 July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalek speech is characterised by repeated phrases, and by orders given to themselves and to others.&lt;ref&gt;Peel (1988), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the stereotypical emotionless robots often found in science fiction, Daleks are often angry; author [[Kim Newman]] has described the Daleks as behaving "like toddlers in perpetual hissy fits", gloating when in power and flying into a rage when thwarted.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be excitable and will repeat the same word or phrase over and over again in heightened emotional states, most famously "Exterminate! Exterminate!"

Daleks are extremely aggressive, and seem driven by an instinct to attack. This instinct is so strong that Daleks have been depicted fighting the urge to kill&lt;ref name=Evolution/&gt;&lt;ref name=Resurrection/&gt; or even attacking when unarmed.&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Death&gt;''[[Death to the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[Michael E. Briant]], Producer [[Barry Letts]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 23 February–16 March 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifth Doctor]] characterises this impulse by saying, "However you respond [to Daleks] is seen as an act of provocation."&lt;ref name=Resurrection/&gt; The fundamental feature of Dalek culture and psychology is an unquestioned belief in the superiority of the Dalek race,&lt;ref name=Evil/&gt; and their default directive is to destroy all non-Dalek life-forms.&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt; Other species are either to be exterminated immediately or enslaved and then exterminated once they are no longer useful.&lt;ref name=Resurrection&gt;''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Eric Saward]], Director [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 8–15 February 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalek obsession with their own superiority is illustrated by the schism between the Renegade and Imperial Daleks seen in ''Revelation of the Daleks'' and ''Remembrance of the Daleks'': the two factions each consider the other to be a perversion despite the relatively minor differences between them.&lt;ref name=Remembrance&gt;''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Ben Aaronovitch]], Director [[Andrew Morgan (director)|Andrew Morgan]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 5–26 October 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; This intolerance of any "contamination" within themselves is also shown in "Dalek",&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt; ''The Evil of the Daleks''&lt;ref name=Evil/&gt; and in the [[Big Finish Productions]] [[radio drama|audio play]] ''[[The Mutant Phase]]''.&lt;ref name=Mutant&gt;''[[The Mutant Phase]]''. Writer and Director [[Nicholas Briggs]]. Producers [[Gary Russell]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]]. [[Big Finish Productions]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This superiority complex is the basis of the Daleks' ruthlessness and lack of compassion.&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evil/&gt; This is shown in extreme in "[[Victory of the Daleks]]", where the new, pure Daleks destroy their creators, impure Daleks, with the latters' consent. It is nearly impossible to negotiate or reason with a Dalek, a single-mindedness that makes them dangerous and not to be underestimated.&lt;ref name="Dalek (episode)"/&gt; The [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) is later puzzled in the "Asylum of the Daleks" as to why the Daleks don't just kill the sequestered ones that have "gone wrong". Although the Asylum is subsequently obliterated, the Prime Minister of the Daleks explains that "it is offensive to us to destroy such divine hatred", and the Doctor is sickened at the revelation that hatred is actually considered beautiful by the Daleks.

Dalek society is depicted as one of extreme scientific and technological advancement; the Third Doctor states that "it was their inventive genius that made them one of the greatest powers in the universe."&lt;ref name=Death/&gt; However, their reliance on logic and machinery is also a strategic weakness which they recognise,&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;&lt;ref name=Destiny/&gt; and thus use more emotion-driven species as agents to compensate for these shortcomings.&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;&lt;ref name=Resurrection/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evil/&gt;

Although the Daleks are not known for their regard for [[due process]], they have taken at least two enemies back to Skaro for a "trial", rather than killing them immediately. The first was their creator, Davros, in ''Revelation of the Daleks'',&lt;ref name=Revelation&gt;''[[Revelation of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Eric Saward]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 23–30 March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second was the renegade [[Time Lord]] known as [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] in the 1996 television movie.&lt;ref name=TVM&gt;''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]''. Writer [[Matthew Jacobs]], Director [[Geoffrey Sax]], Executive Producer [[Philip Segal]]. 1996. DVD. [[BBC Video]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the Master's trial, and why the Doctor would be asked to retrieve the Master's remains, have never been explained on screen. The ''Doctor Who Annual 2006'' implies that the trial may have been due to a treaty signed between the Time Lords and the Daleks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell T Davies|Davies, Russell T.]] "Meet the Doctor." ''Doctor Who Annual 2006''. Ed. [[Clayton Hickman]]. [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]]: [[Panini Comics|Panini]], 2005. pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The framing device for the ''[[I, Davros: Innocence|I, Davros]]'' audio plays is a Dalek trial to determine if Davros should be the Daleks' leader once more.&lt;ref&gt;''[[I, Davros: Innocence]]''. Writer Gary Hopkins, Director [[Gary Russell]]. Producers [[Gary Russell]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]]. [[Big Finish Productions]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin-off novels contain several [[tongue-in-cheek]] mentions of Dalek poetry, and an anecdote about an opera based upon it, which was lost to posterity when the entire cast was exterminated on the opening night. Two stanzas are given in the novel ''[[The Also People]]'' by Ben Aaronovitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaronovitch |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Aaronovitch| year=1995 |title=[[The Also People]]| location=London |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=0-426-20456-5| page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative timeline]] portrayed in the [[Big Finish Productions]] audio adventure ''[[The Time of the Daleks]]'', the Daleks show a fondness for the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Time of the Daleks]]''. Writer [[Justin Richards]], Director [[Nicholas Briggs]], Producers [[Gary Russell]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]]. [[Big Finish Productions]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar idea was satirised by comedian [[Frankie Boyle]] in the BBC comedy quiz programme ''[[Mock the Week]]''; he gave the fictional Dalek poem "Daffodils; EXTERMINATE DAFFODILS!" as an "unlikely line to hear in ''Doctor Who''".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mock the Week]]''. 7 July 2007. Season 5, episode 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Doctor has defeated the Daleks so often, he has become their collective [[Archenemy|arch-enemy]] and they have standing orders to capture or exterminate him on sight. In later fiction, the Daleks know the Doctor as ''"Ka Faraq Gatri"'' ("Bringer of Darkness" or "Destroyer of Worlds"), and "The Oncoming Storm".&lt;ref name=Parting/&gt;&lt;ref name="Journey"/&gt; Both the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) and [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) suggest that the Doctor is one of the few beings the Daleks fear. In "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]", Rose notes that while the Daleks see the extermination of five million [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as "pest control", "one Doctor" visibly un-nerves them (to the point they physically recoil).&lt;ref name="Doomsday"/&gt; To his indignant surprise, in "Asylum of the Daleks", the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) learns that the Daleks have designated him as "The Predator".

As the Doctor escapes the Asylum (with companions Amy and Rory), a Dalek-converted-human (Oswin Oswald) prisoner provides critical assistance, which culminates in completely deleting the Doctor from the Dalek hive-consciousness (the PathWeb), thus wiping the slate entirely blank. However, this was reversed in "[[The Time of the Doctor]]", when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.

=== Measurements ===
A ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]", "[[Evolution of the Daleks]]" and "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]", counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).

The ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.

==Licensed appearances==
[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels. The first panel contains the title "The Daleks" in jagged white letters. Subsequent panels show Dalek cylinders (slightly narrower than those depicted in previous images) and blue-skinned humanoids with bulbous heads. The last panel shows a gold-coloured Dalek-like shape with a large spherical top.|A page from the TV 21 comic strip, featuring the creation of the Emperor Dalek]]
Two ''Doctor Who'' movies starring [[Peter Cushing]] featured the Daleks as the main villains: ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'', and ''[[Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD]]'', based on the television serials ''The Daleks'' and ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'', respectively. The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called "Dr. Who" who built a time-travelling device named ''Tardis'', instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called "the TARDIS".&lt;ref&gt;Peel (1988), p. 96; Howe (1992), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Four books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s. ''[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#The Dalek Book|The Dalek Book]]'' (1964, written by Terry Nation and [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]]), ''The Dalek World'' (1965, written by Nation and Whitaker) and ''The Dalek Outer Space Book'' (1966, by Nation and Brad Ashton) were all hardcover books formatted like [[annual publication#British annuals|annuals]], containing text stories and comics about the Daleks, along with fictional information (sometimes based on the television serials, other times made up for the books).&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Nation also published ''The Dalek Pocketbook and Space-Travellers Guide'', which collected articles and features treating the Daleks as if they were real.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (2003), pp.126–127&lt;/ref&gt; Four more annuals were published in the 1970s by World Distributors under the title ''Terry Nation's Dalek Annual'' (with cover dates 1976–1979, but published 1975–1978).&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;  Two original novels by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]], ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' (1997) and ''[[Legacy of the Daleks]]'' (1998), were released as part of the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series of ''Doctor Who'' novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[War of the Daleks]] |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |year=1997 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-40573-2}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Legacy of the Daleks]] |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |year=1998 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-40574-0}}&lt;br/&gt;Howe (2003), pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;  A novella, ''[[The Dalek Factor]]'' by [[Simon Clark (novelist)|Simon Clark]], was published in 2004, and two books featuring the Daleks and the [[Tenth Doctor]] (''[[I am a Dalek]]'' by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], 2006, and ''[[Prisoner of the Daleks]]'' by [[Trevor Baxendale]], 2009) have been released as part of the [[New Series Adventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Dalek Factor]] |last=Clark |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Clark (novelist) |year=2004 |publisher=[[Telos Publishing]] |location=[[Tolworth]], Surrey |isbn=1-903889-30-8}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |title=[[I am a Dalek]] |last=Roberts |first=Gareth |authorlink=Gareth Roberts (writer) |year=2006 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=1-84607-641-2}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Prisoner of the Daleks]] |last=Baxendale |first=Trevor |authorlink=Trevor Baxendale |year=2009 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-48648-1}}&lt;br/&gt;Howe (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Nation authorised the publication of the comic strip ''[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#TV Century 21|The Daleks]]'' in the comic ''[[TV Century 21]]'' in 1965. The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and "heroes", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the "Trods" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |title=Countdown / TV Action Strips and Stories featuring the Third Doctor |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |publisher=Doctor Who Reference Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other licensed appearances have included a number of stage plays (see [[#Stage plays|Stage plays]] below) and television adverts for [[Wall's ice cream|Wall's]] "Sky Ray" ice lollies (1966), [[Weetabix]] breakfast cereal (1977), [[Kit Kat]] chocolate bars (2001),&lt;ref name=bignell187 &gt;{{cite book |title=Terry Nation |last1=Bignell |first1=Jonathan |last2=O'Day |first2=Andrew |year=2004 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |location=[[Manchester]] |page=187 |isbn=0-7190-6547-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=grv8uA0MtXkC |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, pp. 35, 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ Bank]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anz.com/about-us/our-company/profile/advertising/ |title=Advertising |publisher=[[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ Bank]] |accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;br/&gt;

==Other appearances==

===Non–''Doctor Who'' television and film===
Daleks have made cameo appearances in television programmes and films unrelated to ''Doctor Who'' from the 1960s to the present day.

* Dalek toys are seen in a [[department store]] in "Death at Bargain Prices", a 1965 episode of the fantasy/thriller series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', which like ''Doctor Who'' was created by Sydney Newman, although broadcast on the rival [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theavengers.tv/forever/peel1-4.htm|title=Death at Bargain Prices|publisher=The Avengers Forever|first=David K.|last=Smith|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Daleks appear in a 1972 episode of BBC TV's ''[[Vision On]]'', performing a short ballet sequence to the music of [[Manuel de Falla]]'s "[[Ritual Fire Dance]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=1972 | title = "Daleks on "Vision On" (RIP Tony Hart)" |medium = television |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKgyL0xio-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 1992 Christmas special of the comedy series ''[[Mr. Bean]]'', "[[Merry Christmas Mr. Bean]]", the title character uses children's toys to play out a bizarre [[nativity scene]] in which a Marx Dalek exterminates a tiny lamb and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=1992 | title = "Merry Christmas Mr. Bean" |medium = television |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDOO3FvGsZ4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the television special ''[[Red Dwarf#Red Dwarf Night|The Red Dwarf A–Z]]'', two Daleks are shown (under "E" for "Exterminate") arguing that all Earth television is human propaganda, and the works more commonly attributed to [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] were actually written by Daleks, although they deny having written "[[Mandy (Barry Manilow song)|Mandy]]" by [[Barry Manilow]]; subsequently, one of them remarks that the "change the bulb" joke from the episode "[[Legion (Red Dwarf episode)|Legion]]" was funny, and is promptly exterminated by the other for the crime of "not behaving like a true Dalek".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

In the context of the dangers of [[solar flare]]s, he said, "Because we are exploring the frontiers of technology, some people think Concorde will be avoiding solar flares like Dr. Who avoiding Daleks.

Daleks have appeared on magazine covers promoting ''Doctor Who'' since the "Dalekmania" fad of the 1960s. ''[[Radio Times]]'' has featured the Daleks on its cover several times, beginning with the 21–27 November 1964 issue which promoted ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/galleries/doctorwhocovers/02/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20081203002552/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/galleries/doctorwhocovers/02/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 December 2008 |title=Doctor Who covers: The Dalek Invasion of Earth |accessdate=24 March 2010 |work=Radio Times |publisher=BBC Magazines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other magazines also used Daleks to attract readers' attention, including ''Girl Illustrated''.&lt;ref name=porn&gt;Howe (1996), pp. 60–61, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, ''Radio Times'' created a special cover to commemorate both the return of the Daleks to the screen in "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" and the forthcoming [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/shows/doctor-who/gallery/gallery-twenty/001/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110524004825/http://www.radiotimes.com/shows/doctor-who/gallery/gallery-twenty/001/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 May 2011 |title=Doctor Who – The greatest magazine cover of all time |accessdate=24 March 2010 |work=Radio Times |publisher=[[BBC Magazines]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cover recreated a scene from ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' in which the Daleks were seen crossing [[Westminster Bridge]], with the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in the background.

Daleks have been the subject of many [[parody|parodies]], including [[Spike Milligan]]'s "[[Doctor Who spoofs#Pakistani Dalek (1975)|Pakistani Dalek]]" sketch in his comedy series ''[[Q (Spike Milligan series)|Q]]'',&lt;ref name="crapsketch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Q6 – BBC2 |work=The Times |location=UK |first=Alan |last=Coren |authorlink=Alan Coren |date=12 December 1975 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mingmongs"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lyons |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Lyons (writer) |author2=Chris Howarth |date=10 February 1999 |title=But Doctor, I haven't got the Ming-Mongs! |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=274 |pages=29–30 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], Kent |issn=0957-9818}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Lewis-Smith]]'s "Gay Daleks".&lt;ref name="mingmongs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Doctor stuck in a time warp |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/newsfeatures/2005/0312/1110452198946.html |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |location=Dublin |date=12 March 2005 |accessdate=3 February 2010 |first=Shane |last=Hegarty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the BBC has used the Daleks to parody other subjects: in 2002, [[BBC Worldwide]] published the ''Dalek Survival Guide'', a parody of ''[[Worst-Case Scenario series|The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbooks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Richards |author2=[[Nicholas Briggs]] |author3=[[Stephen Cole (writer)|Stephen Cole]] |author4=[[Jacqueline Rayner]] |author5=[[Mike Tucker]] |editor=Ben Dunn (editor)|title=Dalek Survival Guide |year=2002 |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]] |location=London |isbn=0-563-48600-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[Eddie Izzard]] has an extended stand-up routine about Daleks, which was included in his 1993 stand-up show "[[Live at the Ambassadors]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eddie Izzard: The tough transvestite who can take care of himself |first=Rampton |last=James |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=23 May 2004 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/eddie-izzard-the-tough-transvestite-who-can-take-care-of-himself-564108.html |accessdate=3 February 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daleks made two brief appearances in a [[pantomime]] version of ''[[Aladdin]]'' at the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] which starred ''[[Torchwood]]'' star [[John Barrowman]] in the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aladdin @ Hippodrome |first=Holly |last=Beaumont-Wilkes |publisher=BBC News |date=28 December 2007 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2007/12/28/aladdin_review_feature.shtml |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224182547/http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2007/12/28/aladdin_review_feature.shtml |archivedate=24 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A joke-telling robot, possessing a Dalek-like boom, and loosely modelled after the Dalek, also appeared in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Funnybot]]", even spouting out "exterminate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/1166181 |title=South Park: "Funnybot" Review – IGN |publisher=M.ign.com |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820095438/http://m.ign.com/articles/1166181 |archivedate=20 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dalek can also be seen in the background at timepoints 1:13 and 1:17 in the [[Sam &amp; Max]] animated series episode [[The Trouble With Gary]]. In the ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' parody of ''Doctor Who'' called ''Inspector Spacetime'', they are referred to as Blorgons.

==Merchandising==
The BBC approached Walter Tuckwell, a New Zealand-born entrepreneur who was handling product merchandising for other BBC shows, and asked him to do the same for the Daleks and ''Doctor Who''.&lt;ref name="tuckwell"&gt;Howe (1994), p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Tuckwell created a glossy sales brochure that sparked off a Dalek craze, dubbed "Dalekmania" by the press, which peaked in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toys and models===
[[File:1966Dalek.JPG|thumb|right|A Louis Marx &amp; Co. Dalek model]]
The first Dalek toys were released in 1965 as part of the "Dalekmania" craze.&lt;ref name=1965toys&gt;Howe (2003), pp. 475–483&lt;/ref&gt; These included battery-operated, [[friction drive]] and "Rolykins" Daleks from [[Louis Marx and Company|Louis Marx &amp; Co.]], as well as models from Cherilea, Herts Plastic Moulders Ltd and Cowan, de Groot Ltd, and "Bendy" Daleks made by Newfeld Ltd.&lt;ref name=1965toys/&gt; At the height of the Daleks' popularity, in addition to toy replicas, there were Dalek board games and activity sets, slide projectors for children and even Dalek playsuits made from PVC.&lt;ref name="merchandise"&gt;Howe (1992), pp. 137–152&lt;/ref&gt; Collectible cards, stickers, toy guns, music singles, punching bags and many other items were also produced in this period.&lt;ref name="merchandise"/&gt; Dalek toys released in the 1970s included a new version of Louis Marx's battery-operated Dalek (1974), a "talking Dalek" from [[Palitoy]] (1975) and a Dalek board game (1975) and Dalek [[action figure]] (1977), both from [[Denys Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David J.

In 1984, Sevans Models released a self-assembly model kit for a one-fifth scale Dalek, which ''Doctor Who'' historian [[David J. Howe|David Howe]] has described as "the most accurate model of a Dalek ever to be released".&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1996a), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;. Comet Miniatures released two Dalek self-assembly model kits in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (2003), p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Bally released a [[Doctor Who (pinball)|Doctor Who pinball machine]] which prominently featured the Daleks both as a primary playfield feature and as a motorised toy in the topper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=738 |title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: Midway 'Doctor Who' |publisher=Ipdb.org |date=4 November 1992 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bluebird Toys]] produced a Dalek-themed ''Doctor Who'' playset in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (2003), p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2000, Product Enterprise (who later operated under the names "Iconic Replicas" and "Sixteen 12 Collectibles") produced various Dalek toys. These included {{nowrap|one-inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm)}} Dalek "Rolykins" (based on the Louis Marx toy from 1965); push-along "talking" {{nowrap|7-inch (17.8&amp;nbsp;cm)}} Daleks; {{nowrap|2½-inch (6.4&amp;nbsp;cm)}} Dalek "Rollamatics" with a pull back and release mechanism; and a {{nowrap|one-foot (30.5&amp;nbsp;cm)}} remote control Dalek.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (2003), pp. 492–496&lt;/ref&gt;

A pair of [[Lego]] based Daleks were included in the [[Lego Ideas]] ''Doctor Who'' set, and another appeared in the ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' Cyberman Fun-Pack.

===Video games===
Licensed ''Doctor Who'' games featuring Daleks include 1984's ''[[The Key to Time]]'', a text adventure game for the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Richard |date=December 1984 |title=Have Tardis will travel |journal=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=33 |page=38 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=London |issn=0262-5458 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue033/Pages/SinclairUser03300038.jpg |accessdate=14 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daleks also appeared in minor roles or as thinly disguised versions in other, minor games throughout the 80s, but did not feature as central adversaries in a licensed game until 1992, when Admiral Software published ''[[Dalek Attack]]''.&lt;ref name="bingegamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bingegamer.net/2009/greatest-games-youve-never-played-dalek-attack/ |title=Greatest Games You’ve Never Played: Dalek Attack |last=Walker |first=James |date=8 July 2009 |work=Binge Gamer |accessdate=16 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126001019/http://www.bingegamer.net/2009/greatest-games-youve-never-played-dalek-attack/ |archivedate=26 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game allowed the player to play various Doctors or companions, running them through several environments to defeat the Daleks.&lt;ref name="bingegamer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dalek-attack |title=Dalek Attack |last1=Stryker |first1=B.L. |last2=Smith |first2=Martin |work=[[MobyGames]] |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/1017/Dalek+Attack.html |title=Dalek Attack |author=Sebatianos |work=[[Abandonia]] |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Nash |date=July 1993 |title=Doctor Who: Dalek Attack |journal=[[Your Sinclair]] |issue=91 |pages=8–9 |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |location=[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue91/Pages/YourSinclair9100008.jpg |accessdate=14 January 2010 |issn=0269-6983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the BBC released a [[Personal computer|PC]] game entitled ''[[Destiny of the Doctors]]'' which also featured the Daleks, among other adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gillatt |first=Gary |date=22 October 1997 |title=The game's up! |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=257 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unauthorized games featuring Daleks continued to appear through the 1990s and 2000s, including Dalek-based [[mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] of ''[[Dark Forces]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', and ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', and even more recently, a mod of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''; many of these can be found online, including an [[Adobe Flash]] game, ''Dalek:Dissolution Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ludodoesjudo.com/dalek.html |title=Dalek: Dissolution Earth |accessdate=24 March 2010 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103085852/http://ludodoesjudo.com/dalek.html |archivedate=3 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 ''QWho'', a [[mod (computer gaming)|modification]] for ''Quake'', featured the Daleks as adversaries. This also formed the basis of ''TimeQuake'', a total conversion written in 2000 which included other ''Doctor Who'' monsters such as [[Sontaran]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otranto.demon.co.uk/timequake/ |title=Doctor Who – Timequake |accessdate=24 March 2010 |last=Williams |first=Giles |author2=Christian Darkin |author3=Conrad Feinson |date=11 August 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103063647/http://www.otranto.demon.co.uk/timequake/ |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another unauthorised game is ''DalekTron'', a based on ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'' written to coincide with the 2005 series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalektron.org/ |title=DalekTron |accessdate=24 March 2010 |last=Bower |first=Andy |author2=James Bower |date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One authorised online game is ''The Last Dalek'', a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game created by New Media Collective for the BBC. It is based on the 2005 episode "Dalek" and can be played at the official BBC ''Doctor Who'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/lastdalek/index.shtml |title=The Last Dalek |accessdate=24 March 2010 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=BBC ''Doctor Who'' website |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823095245/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/lastdalek/index.shtml |archivedate=23 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Doctor Who'' website also features another game, ''Daleks vs Cybermen'' (also known as ''Cyber Troop Control Interface''), based on the 2006 episode "Doomsday"; in this game, the player controls troops of Cybermen which must fight Daleks as well as [[Torchwood Institute]] members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/game13/index.shtml |title=Cyber Troop Control Interface |accessdate=24 March 2010 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=BBC ''Doctor Who'' website |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926023759/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/game13/index.shtml |archivedate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2010, the BBC released the first of four official computer games on its website, ''Doctor Who: The Adventure Games'', which are intended as part of the official TV series adventures. In the first of these, 'The City of the Daleks', the Doctor in his 11th incarnation and Amy Pond must stop the Daleks re-writing time and reviving Skaro, their homeland.

They also appear in the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Wii]] games ''[[Doctor Who: Evacuation Earth]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who: Return to Earth]]''.

Several Daleks appear in the [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] game ''[[Doctor Who: The Mazes of Time|The Mazes of Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;Release of Mazes of Time http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/doctor-who-mazes-of-time-out-now-12916.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as rare enemies the player faces, appearing only in the first and final levels.

The robot model ''883'' in the game ''[[Paradroid]]'' for the ''[[Commodore 64]]'' looks like a Dalek. The game was later ported to other platforms, and several [[free software]] clones have been developed since, among them ''Freedroid Classic''. Based on this game is a ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' style role-playing game called ''Freedroid RPG'' where several Dalek-like robots appear. The base version is called ''Dalex'', its powerful, but slow weapon, the ''Exterminator'', is also available to the player.

The Daleks also appear in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' where they ally themselves with Lord Vortech and possess the size-altering scale keystone. When Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle encounter them, they assume that they are allies of the Doctor and attack the trio. The main characters continue to fight the Daleks until they call the Doctor to save them. A Dalek saucer also appears in the level based on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], in which the top of it serves as the stage for the boss battle against [[Sauron]] and includes Daleks among the various enemies summoned to attack the player. A Dalek is also among the elements summoned by the player to deal with the obstacles in the ''[[Portal 2]]'' story level.

===Full-size reproductions===

'''Brandon Emmett Crisp''' (January 18, 1993 – c. October 13, 2008) was a teenage Canadian boy who disappeared on October 13, 2008, when he ran away from his home in [[Barrie|Barrie, Ontario]], [[Canada]] after his parents took away his [[Xbox 360]] due to failing grades and excessive play of ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]''.&lt;ref name="citynews1"&gt;[http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_28582.aspx CityNews: Barrie Police End Ground Search For Missing Teen Brandon Crisp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101101934/http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_28582.aspx |date=2008-11-01 }}, Citynews.ca.

==Disappearance==

On October 13, 2008, Brandon was involved in an argument with his parents over what his parents described as obsessive playing of the video game ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'' on his [[Xbox 360]], after they took the system away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartley|first1=Matt|title=Microsoft doubles reward for missing Ontario boy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article719061.ece|accessdate=12 September 2016|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=27 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316100205/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article719061.ece|archivedate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandon filled a yellow and grey backpack with clothes and left home riding his bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_28467.aspx CityNews: Missing Teen's Backpack Not Found, Despite Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028091142/http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_28467.aspx |date=2008-10-28 }}, Citynews.ca.

According to police, two witnesses claimed to have last seen him on a trail near [[Shanty Bay, Ontario]]. The first reported that he had seen him having mechanical trouble with his bicycle on the trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orilliatoday.com/orilliatoday/article/119990 |title=Witness links Brandon to bike's location |publisher=Orilliatoday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second witness reported seeing Brandon later walking along the trail further east, but due to communications mix-ups this information was not passed along to searchers until the end of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simcoe.com/article/121087|title=Second Witness Confirms Sighting|date=2006-09-26|publisher=simcoe.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206140721/http://www.simcoe.com/article/121087|archive-date=December 6, 2008|accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brandon's [[missing person]] file was flagged nationally by the [[Canadian Police Information Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/457904|title=TheSpec.com - BreakingNews - Police look abroad for help finding Barrie teen|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202125608/http://www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/457904|archive-date=December 2, 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandon's parents reported him to [[Barrie Police Service]] as missing on the morning of October 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staynersun.ca/staynersun/pictorial/119729|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117041602/http://www.staynersun.ca/staynersun/pictorial/119729|archive-date=2013-01-17|title=Eight long days for local family|date=|publisher=Staynersun.ca|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police began their search October 18, using [[Thermographic camera|heat-sensitive cameras]] and officers with the [[Police dog|K-9 unit]]. On October 20, police located his mountain bike, which had originally been abandoned near where he was last witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staynersun.ca/staynersun/pictorial/120200 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115221953/http://www.staynersun.ca/staynersun/pictorial/120200 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-15 |title=Volunteers join in search for lost teen |publisher=Staynersun.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned members of the public organised their own search parties, at times consisting of more than 1,600 individuals, some from areas as far away as [[London, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxaBcwDzO_mzrFotPLQE0RABqqaA AFP: Microsoft offers reward for missing Xbox gamer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005133833/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxaBcwDzO_mzrFotPLQE0RABqqaA |date=2012-10-05 }}, Afp.google.com.

On October 27, [[Microsoft]] announced that they would be adding [[Canadian dollar|C$]]25,000 of matching funds to the reward already offered by a local newspaper and the Crisps' [[Internet service provider]], bringing the total reward to $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dabrowski |first=Wojtek |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE49Q5N320081027 |title=Microsoft matches reward for missing Canadian teen &amp;#124; Technology |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ground searches were progressing, there was also speculation that Brandon had been lured by a fellow [[Xbox Live]] player, despite there being no evidence for this; Microsoft offered assistance to the police effort by helping to identify players on Brandon's online friends list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simcoe.com/article/120307 |title=Microsoft doubles reward to find Brandon |publisher=Simcoe.com |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2012-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301210117/http://www.simcoe.com/article/120307 |archivedate=March 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Police ended the ground search for Brandon on October 30, 2008, but made clear that the investigation was on-going and continuing around-the-clock.&lt;ref name="citynews1" /&gt; One week later, on November 5, hunters discovered Brandon's body in an overgrown area near what had been the police search area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20081105/081105_brandon_crisp/20081105/?hub=CP24Home |title=Body found believed to be that of missing Barrie boy Brandon Crisp - CTV News, Shows and Sports - Canadian Television |publisher=CP24 |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy confirmed the identity of the teen via dental records and determined the cause of death to be "injuries to the chest area that are consistent with a fall from a tree". Barrie Police noted that no foul play was suspected, and that the investigation was ongoing to determine an exact timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/533566 |title=Brandon likely died after fall from tree |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2008-11-09 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | first1=Robyn | last1=Doolittle | first2=Rita | last2=Trichur}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a police spokesman stated "We're doing the best to come up with the answers everybody wants", no further details or updates have been released to the public.

==Media coverage and response==
Within a week of Brandon Crisp's disappearance the case received significant media coverage throughout Ontario. Toronto-based outlets such as ''The [[Toronto Star]]'', [[Citytv]], [[CP24]], and others covered the story, and national outlets such as the ''[[National Post]]'', [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] soon picked it up as well. A Facebook page started by Brandon's classmates at St. Joseph's Catholic High School in Barrie, titled "Where is Brandon Crisp", grew to almost 22,000 members by the time his body was found.&lt;ref name="torontosun1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2008/11/09/7352301-sun.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205101258/http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2008/11/09/7352301-sun.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-05 |title=www.torontosun.com |publisher=www.torontosun.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of the discovery of Brandon Crisp's body also made national news throughout Canada, with coverage on all major national TV networks and both Ontario and national newspapers. The Toronto Sun published it as the front-page headline and picture on November 6, 2008. Thousands of people also flooded the Facebook group and other internet forums with expressions of grief and sympathy for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simcoe.com/brandon_crisp/article/121392 |title='20,000 people are crying' |publisher=Simcoe.com |date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217100656/http://www.simcoe.com/brandon_crisp/article/121392 |archivedate=February 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story generated Internet coverage from bloggers and others trying to help find Brandon, such as the creation of the now-defunct website findbrandoncrisp.com, discussions of the video game related issues,&lt;ref name="www.gamepolitics.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/category/topics/brandon-crisp|title=www.gamepolitics.com|date=|publisher=www.gamepolitics.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029054453/http://www.gamepolitics.com/category/topics/brandon-crisp|archive-date=October 29, 2008|accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussions of how the tragedy emotionally affected the community, police involved, and even strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inmemorybrandoncrisp.blogspot.com |title=inmemorybrandoncrisp.blogspot.com |publisher=inmemorybrandoncrisp.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report of Brandon's death also generated an amount of anonymous internet [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]], with many messages and photos posted to the Facebook group that most group members and friends found to be upsetting and disturbing, resulting in the group being shut down;&lt;ref name="torontosun1" /&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2016}} an example of what Mattathias Schwartz of ''The New York Times'' has called "Malwebolence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html |title=Mattathias Schwartz (2008-08-03). "Malwebolence". The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandon Crisp was laid to rest in Barrie on November 14, 2008, in a service attended by more than 1,700 fellow students, friends, family, and community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/11/14/crisp-funeral.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722190849/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/11/14/crisp-funeral.html |archive-date=2012-07-22 |title=www.cbc.ca Brandon Crisp in 'VIP section up in heaven,' 1,700 funeral-goers told |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2012-10-04 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; National media covered the service, featured as the lead-item on most Ontario newscasts. The Crisp family has created the ''Brandon Crisp Endowment Fund'', working with [[Canadian Tire]]'s JumpStart charity program for assisting families in financial need to participate in minor sports and recreational activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simcoe.com/brandon_crisp/article/122020 |title=www.simcoe.com Brandon's parents join Canadian Tire to help kids |date= |publisher=Simcoe.com |accessdate=2012-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217100706/http://www.simcoe.com/brandon_crisp/article/122020 |archivedate=February 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By October 2009 over $140,000 has been raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b101fm.com/home/NewsInfo/GeneralNewsDetail/tabid/1044/Default.aspx?id=10354|title=B101 News - One Year Anniversary|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084341/http://www.b101fm.com/home/NewsInfo/GeneralNewsDetail/tabid/1044/Default.aspx?id=10354|archive-date=July 21, 2011|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandon's story continues to be referenced in discussions about [[video game addiction]] and influence, with debate about whether Brandon's obsession with the ''Call of Duty'' actually was a contributing factor to his death, or whether this case was just a tragedy that began with an ordinary teen-parent argument.&lt;ref name="www.gamepolitics.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/searchengine/blog/2008/12/podcast_13_is_up.html#more www.cbc.ca Jesse Brown Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.tech.yahoo.com/news/canadianpress/article/1011|title=Canadian Press - Combating video game addiction must be made priority|work=Yahoo News Canada|accessdate=6 October 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2009, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s national news program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]'' aired an hour-long report on [[video game addiction]] and the Brandon Crisp story, titled ''"Top Gun"'', subtitled ''"When a video gaming obsession turns to addiction and tragedy"''. The program had sent a team to Barrie to interview Brandon's parents and friends before Brandon's body had been found, and those segments were combined with interviews of gaming industry representatives and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2008-2009/top_gun/ CBC/the fifth estate 'Top Gun']&lt;/ref&gt; While the program did acknowledge that video gaming was not directly responsible for Brandon's death, many journalists and bloggers felt that the program was not balanced and fair, singling out the video game industry and focusing less on the need for parents to educate themselves about video games. Columnist Steve Tilley of the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' newspaper called the report "Lazy, cheap and disappointingly one-sided", though he does admit that the report succeeds "in exploring why Brandon Crisp might have become so addicted to ''Call Of Duty 4''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/columnists/steve_tilley/2009/03/06/8647976-sun.html|title=Toronto Sun Columnist Steve Tilley March 6, 2009|work=Toronto Sun|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keith Henry Blakelock''' was a London [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] constable who was murdered on 6 October 1985 [[Broadwater Farm riot|during rioting]] at the [[Broadwater Farm]] housing estate in [[Tottenham]], north London. The trouble broke out after a local black woman died of heart failure during a police search of her home, and took place against a backdrop of unrest in several English cities and a breakdown of relations between the police and black communities.&lt;ref name=Brainp106&gt;{{harvnb|Brain|2010|pp=106–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

PC Blakelock had been assigned on the night of his death to Serial 502, a unit of 11 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of around 50 people, he received over 40 injuries inflicted by [[machete]]s or similar, and was found with a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up to the hilt.{{sfn|Brain|2010|p=113}} He was the third officer to be killed in a riot in the London area since 1833, when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in [[Clerkenwell]].{{efn|Tony Moore (2015): "Three police officers have been killed in riots in the [[Metropolitan Police District]] since its formation in 1829. The first was Police Constable Robert Culley in 1833. The second was Station Sergeant Thomas Green in 1919 and the third was Police Constable Keith Blakelock in 1985."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2015|p=19}}; for Culley, see [http://digital.nls.uk/broadsides/broadside.cfm/id/15389 "Broadside entitled 'Dreadful Riot in London'"], ''The Word on the Street'', National Library of Scotland, citing the ''Caledonian Mercury'', 16 May 1833.{{pb}}

Detectives came under enormous pressure to find those responsible, amid tabloid coverage that was sometimes openly racist.{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=77}} Faced with a lack of forensic evidence—because for several hours it had not been possible to secure the crime scene—the police arrested 359 people, interviewed most of them without lawyers, and laid charges based on untaped confessions.&lt;ref&gt;For the crime scene, see {{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=86–87}} and {{harvnb|Moore|2015|pp=142–144}}.

British journalist [[David Rose (journalist)|David Rose]] writes that by 1976 the Farm was already seen as a [[sink estate]], and that by 1980 a [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] report had suggested demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=27–30}}; Rayner, Jan (19 October 2003).

[[File:1981 Brixton Riots.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Police line up with shields (left) by [[Coldharbour Lane]] during the [[1981 Brixton riot]]s.]]

The riots in which Blakelock died took place within a wave of social unrest across England. Since the [[1980 St. Pauls riot]] in Bristol, and particularly since the [[1981 Brixton riot]] in south London, a series of incidents had sparked violent confrontations between black youths and largely white police officers. These riots largely took place in deprived areas with high rates of unemployment, with a significant of these riots taking places in areas with large ethnic minority communities.&lt;ref name=Brainp106/&gt;

On 9 September 1985, a month before Blakelock's murder, the arrest of a black man for a traffic offence triggered the [[1985 Handsworth riots]] in Birmingham; two people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Nick (20 October 2005). [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/oct/30/race.politicalcolumnists "Politics of the ghetto"], ''The Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September, a black woman, Dorothy "Cherry" Groce, was accidentally shot by police while they searched her home in [[Brixton]] looking for her son, [[Michael Groce]], who was wanted on suspicion of robbery and firearms offences.{{sfn|Brain|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wQBSI4U3E7IC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;pg=PA109 109]}} Believing she had died in the shooting — in fact, she had survived but was left paralysed from the waist down — a group of protesters gathered outside Brixton police station, sparking the [[1985 Brixton riot]] that saw police lose control of the area for 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8483471/Woman-whose-shooting-sparked-Brixton-riots.html "Woman whose shooting sparked Brixton riots"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 29 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A photojournalist, 29-year-old David Hodge, was killed when a [[breeze block]] was dropped on his head while he photographed the looting.{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=53}}

Rumours spread throughout London at the end of September 1985 that more rioting was imminent, including in [[Bermondsey]] and the [[The Mall Wood Green|Wood Green shopping centre]] near Broadwater Farm. On 1 October there were disturbances in [[Toxteth]], Liverpool.

On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a week after the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on suspicion of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion that turned out to be groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, [[Walter Somerville]], told the inquest that Mrs. Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=57}}

The police, without a search warrant, had let themselves into the house using Floyd Jarrett's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while his mother and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer had pushed Mrs. Jarrett, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said she had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Brain|2010|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Mrs. Jarrett had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gifford|1986|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Rose|1992|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Crimes That Shook Britain]]''. 2017, 00:07:41.&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters began to gather outside Tottenham police station, a few hundred yards from Broadwater Farm, around 1:30&amp;nbsp;am on Sunday morning, 6 October. Four of the station's windows were smashed, but the Jarrett family asked the crowd to disperse. Later that day, two police officers were attacked with bricks and paving stones at the Farm, and a police inspector was attacked in his car.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=61–62, 64}}

The next few hours saw some of the most violent rioting the country had experienced. By early evening a crowd of 500 mostly young black men had gathered on the estate, setting fire to cars, throwing petrol bombs and bricks, and dropping concrete blocks and paving stones from the estate's outdoor walkways, knocking several police officers unconscious, despite their [[Riot protection helmet|NATO helmet]]s.&lt;ref name=Brainp112&gt;{{harvnb|Brain|2010|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=wQBSI4U3E7IC&amp;pg=PA112 112]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The local council's community relations officer said there was a "shifting convoy of ambulances: as soon as one was loaded up with injured officers, another would move up to take its place".{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=67}}

Four senior officers were in control of police deployment in the area that night: Chief Superintendent Colin Couch, who was the Tottenham Division Chief, Chief Superintendent David French, Superintendent William Sinclair and Chief Inspector John Hambleton.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, David (20 March 1987).

At 9:45 pm the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Kenneth Newman, authorized the deployment of specialist police armed with [[plastic bullet]]s and [[CS gas]] to be used "as a last resort should all else fail"; it would have been the first use of plastic bullets during a riot in Britain. The unit arrived at 10:20 pm, but the senior officers at the scene refused to use them, to the apparent dismay of junior officers.

The firemen made their way back up an enclosed staircase inside Tangmere with Serial 502 behind them. Dozens of rioters suddenly appeared at the top of the stairs. Pengelly explained that they were helping the firefighters put out a fire, then they would leave. Suddenly the rioters began blowing whistles, throwing bottles and hacking at the police shields with machetes. Pengelly ordered the officers and firefighters to retreat. They were forced to run backwards down the unlit narrow staircase, fearful of tripping over the fire hoses, which had been flat before but were now full of water.&lt;ref name=Coombes2010&gt;"Interview with Richard Coombes", BBC Crimewatch, 26 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2015|p=149}}; interview with Richard Coombes and Steve Martin, from 15:49&lt;/ref&gt; PC Coombes, armed with just a short truncheon, recalled that the noise—"Kill the pigs!"—was deafening, and he could barely see through the scratched Perspex visor on his helmet.&lt;ref name=Craig3Oct2004/&gt;

There were rioters at the bottom of the stairs too, wearing masks or crash helmets, and carrying knives, machetes, baseball bats, bricks, petrol bombs and paving stones. The bombs started exploding, the paving stones were thrown at the officers' helmets, and the riot shields were the only defence against the machetes.{{sfn|Moore|2015|pp=149–150}} As the firefighters and police ran out of the stairwell toward a car park and a patch of grass, one of the firemen, Divisional Fire Officer Trevor Stratford, saw that Blakelock had tripped: "He just stumbled and went down and they were upon him. It was just mob hysteria.&amp;nbsp;... There were about 50 people on him."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brain|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wQBSI4U3E7IC&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;pg=PA113 113]}}; for the quote from Stratford, Brain cites ''The Times'', 8 October 1985, p. 1; {{harvnb|Rose|1992|p=71}}, writes that there were at least 30, perhaps 50 or more, people around Blakelock.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rioters removed Blakelock's protective helmet, which was never found. The pathologist, David Bowen, found 54 holes in Blakelock's overalls, and 40 stabbing or slashing injuries, eight of them to his head, caused by a weapon such as a machete, axe or sword. A six-inch-long knife was buried in his neck up to the hilt. His body was covered in marks from having been kicked or stamped on. His hands and arms were badly cut, and he had lost several fingers trying to defend himself. There were 14 stab wounds on his back, one on the back of his right thigh, and six on his face. Stabbing injuries to his armpits had penetrated his lungs. His head had been turned to one side, and his jawbone smashed by a blow that left a six-inch gash across the right side of his head. Bowen said the force of this blow had been "almost as if to sever his head", which gave rise to the view that an attempt had been made to decapitate him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=71, 85–86}}; Rose, David (29 January 1987).

Dave Pengelly kept a rearguard barrier between us and the rioters, standing in the middle of it all with just a shield and a truncheon, trying to fend them off, which is an image I'll never forget.

Between us all we managed to manhandle Keith out to the road, and safety. He was already unconscious when I'd got to him on the ground. I started mouth-to-mouth and heart massage on him, but his injuries were just horrific.

He had a knife embedded up to the handle in the back of his neck. We could see he had multiple stab wounds and some of his fingers were missing. I just kept working on him with another officer, and I think we got some response, but only very limited.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Paul (18 February 2010).

Rose writes that there was a racist media frenzy after the killing, placing intense external pressure on detectives to solve the case.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=76–77}} ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper reportedly compared the Labour leader of Haringey Council and Labour's prospective candidate for Tottenham, [[Bernie Grant]]—who had immigrated from Guyana in 1963—to an ape, writing that he had spoken to reporters while, in Rose's words, "peeling a banana and juggling an orange".{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=78}} Grant caused uproar with his comments after the killing. He told reporters that "the police got a bloody good hiding",&lt;ref&gt;Pallister, David (9 October 1985). "Anger smoulders in Tottenham". ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; and: "Maybe it was a policeman who stabbed another policeman."{{sfn|Griffiths|1985|loc=col. 373–374}} Censured by [[Neil Kinnock]],{{efn|Kinnock wrote to Grant, around 12 October 1985: "What is required and what the Government has signally failed to provide is effective action to get at the roots of the violence. I understand that consideration is being given by your council to attempting to withhold the rates precept paid to the police. The withholding of the precept would be a fruitless course of action that would benefit no one.{{pb}}"It cannot help anyone either to allocate blame for tragedy and uproar exclusively to the police or to be dismissive of a horrific and brutal murder that cannot be justified on any grounds whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;Carvel, John (14 October 1985). "Haringey responds to Kinnock plea". ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} then Labour leader, Grant later described the violence as "inexcusable".{{sfn|Brain|2010|p=114}}

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, [[Kenneth Newman]], told reporters that groups of [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] had orchestrated the violence, a theme picked up by the ''Daily Telegraph'' and others. Falling for a story from media hoaxer [[Rocky Ryan]], the ''Daily Express'' reported on 8 October 1985 that a "Moscow-trained hit squad gave orders as mob hacked PC Blakelock to death", alleging that "crazed left-wing extremists" trained in Moscow and Libya had coordinated the riots.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=78–79}}

There was also internal pressure on detectives from the rank and file, who saw their superior officers as sharing the blame for Blakelock's death.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=80–81}} The [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]]'s journal, ''Police'', argued that senior officers had pursued a policy at Broadwater Farm of avoiding confrontation at all costs, and that "community policing" had led to compromises with criminals, rather than maintaining a focus on upholding the law. As a result, the journal wrote, officers had failed to appreciate the seriousness of the situation that had developed on the estate.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=82–83}}

===Det Ch Supt Graham Melvin{{anchor|Melvin}}===
Detective Chief Superintendent Graham Melvin of the Serious Crime Squad was placed in charge of the investigation a few hours after the killing, at 2:00 am on 7 October.{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=75}} With 150 officers assigned full-time, the inquiry became the largest in the history of the Metropolitan Police. Born in Halifax in 1941, Melvin had joined the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the [[Criminal Investigation Department]]. He had studied at [[Bramshill Police College]], served with the [[Flying Squad]], and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of [[Kenneth Erskine]], the Stockwell Strangler. He became a [[Detective Chief Superintendent|detective chief superintendent]] in March 1985, when he joined the elite International and Organised Crime Squad (SO1).&lt;ref name=Victor1994&gt;Victor, Peter (31 July 1994). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/silcott-officer-will-return-in-triumph-graham-melvin-will-receive-a-heros-welcome-when-he-re-enters-1417283.html "Silcott officer will return in triumph"], ''The Independent on Sunday''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interviews===
{{Blakelock timeline}}
Melvin's first problem was that there was no forensic evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved had been allowed to leave without giving their names, and objects that might have held fingerprints had not been collected. Police had not been allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4&amp;nbsp;am on 7 October, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during [[Haringey Council]]'s clean-up operation.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=86–87}}

Melvin therefore resorted to arresting suspects—including juveniles, some of them regarded as vulnerable—and holding them for days without access to lawyers.&lt;ref name=Pallister19March1991&gt;Pallister, David (19 March 1991). [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1991/mar/19/prisons-and-probation "Relatives renew Tottenham Three case plea"], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 359 people arrested in connection with the inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed in the presence of a lawyer. Many of the confessions that resulted, whether directly about the murder, or about having taken part in the rioting, were made before the lawyer was given access to the interviewee.{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=110}}

When people did confess to even a minor role in the rioting, such as throwing a few stones, they were charged with [[affray]]. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, are they going to come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?&amp;nbsp;... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gifford|1986|pp=132, 144}}; {{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=111–112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melvin defended his decision to hold people without access to legal advice by arguing that lawyers, unwittingly or otherwise, might pass information they had gleaned during interviews to other suspects. He said under cross-examination during the 1987 murder trial that, in his view, "the integrity of some firms of solicitors left a lot to be desired"; he believed solicitors were being retained by people who had an interest in learning what other suspects had said.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=174–175}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rose20March1987/&gt; The Crown prosecutor, Roy Amlot QC, told the court, during the first trial, that the police had one effective weapon, namely that suspects did not know who else had spoken to police and what they had said, and that "the use of that weapon by the police was legitimate and effective".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===(1985–1986) Murder charges===
====Mark Pennant====
Mark Pennant, aged 15, was arrested on 9 October 1985 and charged with murder two days later, the first to be charged. Born in England to West-Indian parents, Pennant had been raised in the [[British West Indies|West Indies]] until he was nine, after which he returned to the UK; he was diagnosed with learning difficulties and was attending a special school. Arrested and handcuffed at school, he was taken to Wood Green Police Station and interviewed six times over the course of two days, with a teacher in attendance. His mother was not told that he had been taken into custody, and the police reportedly told him that she had refused to help him. He told the police that he had cut Blakelock and kicked him twice, and he named Winston Silcott as the ringleader, and several others, including another juvenile, Mark Lambie.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=104–109}} When charged with the murder, he asked the teacher who accompanied him: "Does that mean I have to go and live with you?"&lt;ref name=Rose20March1987/&gt;

====Jason Hill====
Jason Hill, a 13-year-old white boy who lived on Broadwater Farm, was seen looting from a store in the Tangmere block during the riot, near where Blakelock was killed. He was arrested on 13 October and taken to Leyton Police Station, where he was held for three days without access to a lawyer. He reported being kept in a very hot cell, which he said made sleeping and even breathing difficult. His clothes and shoes were removed for forensic tests and he was interviewed wearing only underpants and a blanket, the latter of which by the third day of detention was stained with his own vomit. Hyacinth Moody of the Haringey Community Relations Council sat in as an "appropriate adult"; she was criticized by the judge for having failed to intervene.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=50, 141, 145–146}}

Over the course of several interviews, Hill told police that he had witnessed the attack and named Silcott and others, including Mark Lambie.&lt;ref name=Rose1992p142&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He described almost a ritualistic killing and said that Silcott—whom he called "Sticks"—had forced him to make his "mark" on Blakelock with a sword. According to David Rose, Hill described inflicting injuries to Blakelock's chest and leg that did not match the autopsy report.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=142, 144–145}}&lt;ref name=Rose20March1987/&gt; After he had cut Blakelock, Hill said, Silcott told him he was cool and asked what he had seen. Hill said he had replied, "Nothing", and that Silcott had said, "Well, you can go."{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=145}} Hill said the aim of the attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick.&lt;ref name=Rose1992p142/&gt; In 1991 he told Rose that, throughout the interview, the police had said, "Go on, admit it, you had a stab," and "It was Sticks, wasn't it?" He said they had threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks and said he would never see his family again. "They could have told me it was Prince Charles and I would have said it was him."{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=152}}

====Mark Lambie====
Mark Lambie, aged 14, was the third juvenile to be charged with murder. He was named by Mark Pennant and Jason Hill, and was interviewed with his father and a solicitor present.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=116, 136}} Lambie admitted to having taken part in the rioting, but denied involvement in the murder. One witness said during the trial that he had seen Lambie force his way through the crowd to reach Blakelock, although the testimony was discredited; the witness was caught in several lies and admitted he had offered evidence only to avoid a prison sentence.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=138–139}} (Seventeen years later, in May 2002, Lambie was jailed for 12 years for kidnap and blackmail after detaining and torturing two men; newspapers described him at that time as a [[Yardie]] gang leader.)&lt;ref&gt;Bennetto, Jason (21 May 2002).

According to David Rose, a former detective inspector called the Blakelock investigation a "pre-scientific inquiry, it was all about how to get Winston Silcott convicted, not discovering who killed Keith Blakelock."{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=115}} By the time of the murder, local police saw Silcott as the "biggest mafioso in Tottenham&amp;nbsp;... running the mugging gangs, paying them with drugs", according to another former senior officer in Tottenham.&lt;ref name=Rose89&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silcott was 26 years old when he was arrested, the oldest of the six charged with murder. He was born in Tottenham in 1959; his parents, both [[Seventh-day Adventists]], had arrived in England from [[Montserrat]] two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Casciani, Dominic (20 October 2003). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3208724.stm "Winston Silcott: An infamous past"], BBC News, 20 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He told Rose that he had experienced racism throughout his entire upbringing, particularly from the police. After leaving school at 15, he took a series of low-paying jobs and in 1976 began breaking into houses. The following year he was convicted of nine counts of burglary and sent to [[borstal]] for a few months, and in 1979 he was sentenced to six months for wounding.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=21–24, 26–27, 91}} In September 1980 he stood trial for the murder of 19-year-old Lennie McIntosh, a postal worker, who was stabbed and killed at a party in Muswell Hill in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Bennetto, Jason (16 October 2003).

In 1983 Silcott was given a government grant to open a greengrocer's on the deck of the Tangere block of Broadwater Farm. More convictions followed: in October that year he was fined for possessing a flick knife and in March 1984 for obstructing police. In 1985 he made the news when he told [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], who was on an official visit to Broadwater Farm, that she should not have come without bringing jobs, which ''The Sun'' interpreted as a threat.{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=93–94}}&lt;ref&gt;Rose, David (20 September 1998). [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/focus-in-the-face-of-prejudice-1199525.html "Focus: In the Face of Prejudice"], ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1984 Silcott was arrested for the murder of a 22-year-old boxer, Anthony Smith, at a party in Hackney. Smith had been slashed more than once on his face, there were two wounds to his abdomen, a lung had been lacerated and his [[aorta]] cut. Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985 and was out on bail when Blakelock was killed in October that year. At first he told police he had not known Smith and had not been at the party, although at trial he acknowledged having been there. He said Smith had started punching him, and that he had pushed Smith back but had not been carrying a knife. Silcott was convicted of Smith's murder in February 1986, while awaiting trial for the Blakelock murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment; he was released in 2003 after serving 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=230–233}}; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3208140.stm "Silcott freed from jail"], BBC News, 20 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conviction he told his lawyer he had indeed known Smith, that there had been bad blood between them, and that he had stabbed the man in self-defence, because one of Smith's friends had had a knife.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=234–235}}

=====Disputed interview=====
Known as "Sticks" locally, Silcott was living in the Martlesham block of Broadwater Farm at the time of the riots,&lt;ref name=McKillop20Mar1987/&gt; and was running his greengrocer's shop in the Tangmere block, the block near the spot where Blakelock was killed.&lt;ref name=Barling27Feb2004/&gt; He told David Rose in 2004 that he had been in the Tangmere block on the night of the death, and had stopped someone from throwing a scaffolding pole through the window of his shop.

Silcott was arrested for Blakelock's murder on 12 October 1985, six days after the riot; he was interviewed five times over 24 hours; Det Ch Supt Melvin asked the questions and Det Insp Maxwell Dingle took the notes. During the first four interviews, Silcott stayed mostly silent and refused to sign the detectives' notes, but during the fifth interview on 13 October, when Melvin said he knew Silcott had struck Blakelock with a machete or sword, his demeanour changed, according to the notes.&lt;ref name=Bennett29June1994/&gt;

The notes show him asking: "Who told you that?"&lt;ref name=Bennett29June1994/&gt; When the detectives said they had witnesses, he reportedly said: "They are only kids. No one is going to believe them." The notes say he walked around the interview room with tears in his eyes, saying: "You cunts, you cunts", and "Jesus, Jesus", then: "You ain't got enough evidence. Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep me away from them." The notes show him saying of the murder weapons: "You're too slow, man, they gone." He was at that point charged with murder, to which he reportedly responded: "They won't give evidence against me."&lt;ref name=Rose132&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=132–133, 187}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this interview that led to Silcott's [[#Appeal|conviction for murder being overturned]].

Nineteen-year-old Engin Raghip, of Turkish–Cypriot descent, was arrested on 24 October 1985 after a friend mentioned his name to police, the only time anyone had linked him to the murder.&lt;ref name=Rose1992p160/&gt; During his trial, the court heard from an expert that Raghip was "in the middle of the mildly mentally handicapped range", although this testimony was withheld from the jury.{{sfn|Fennell|1994|p=64}} His mental impairment became a key issue during his successful appeal in 1991 in ''R v Raghip and others'', when the court accepted that it had rendered his confession unsafe.{{sfn|Rose|1992|p=218}}

Raghip's parents had moved from Cyprus to England in 1956. Raghip left school at age 15, illiterate, and by the time of the murder had three convictions, one for burglary and two for stealing cars. He had a common-law wife, Sharon Daly, with whom he had a two-year-old boy, and he worked occasionally as a mechanic. He had little connection with Broadwater Farm, although he lived in nearby [[Wood Green]] and had gone to the Farm with two friends to watch the riot, he said. One of those friends, John Broomfield, gave an interview to the ''Daily Mirror'' on 23 October 1985, boasting about his involvement. When Broomfield was arrested, he implicated Raghip. Broomfield was later convicted of an unrelated murder.&lt;ref name=Rose1992p160&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=160–161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Raghip's arrest, he had been drinking and smoking cannabis for several days, and his common-law wife had just left him, taking their son with her. He was held for two days without representation, first speaking to a solicitor on the third day, who said he had found Raghip distressed and disoriented.&lt;ref name=Gudjonssonp464&gt;{{harvnb|Guðjónsson|2003|pp=464, 616}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed by Det Sgt van Thal and Det Insp John Kennedy ten times over a period of four days. He made several incriminating statements, first that he had thrown stones, then during the second interview that he had seen the attack on Blakelock. During the third, he said he had spoken to Silcott about the murder, and that Silcott owned a hammer with a hook on one side. After the fifth interview he was charged with affray, and during the sixth he described the attack on Blakelock: "It was like you see in a film, a helpless man with dogs on him. It was just like that, it was really quick." He did not sign this interview, Rose writes, and after it he vomited.&lt;ref name=Rose162&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=162–164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a seventh interview the next day, Raghip described noises he said Blakelock had made during the attack. During the eighth interview, he said he had armed himself that night with a broom handle, and had tried to get close to what was happening to Blakelock, but there were too many people around him: "I had a weapon when I was running toward the policeman, a broom handle." He said he might have kicked or hit him had he been able to get close enough. Rose writes that Raghip also offered the order in which Blakelock's attackers had launched the assault. He was held for another two days, released on bail, then charged with murder six weeks later, in December 1985, under the doctrine of [[common purpose]].&lt;ref name=Rose162/&gt;

Aged 18 when Blakelock was killed, Mark Braithwaite was a rapper and disc jockey living with his parents in [[Islington]], London, [[N postcode area|N1]]. He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm, with whom he had a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was mentioned for the first time to detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=169–170}}

Braithwaite was taken to Enfield Police Station and interviewed by Det Sgt Dermot McDermott and Det Con Colin Biggar.

He at first denied being anywhere near the Farm, then during interview four said he had been there and had thrown stones, and during interview five said he had been at the Tangmere block, but had played no role in the murder. During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.&lt;ref name=Rose172&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=172–173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Amlot QC told the court that Blakelock had been stabbed 40 times by at least two knives and a machete. There were eight injuries to his head, and one of the weapons had penetrated his jawbone.

==Campaign on behalf of the "Tottenham Three"==
===Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign===
A campaign to free the "Tottenham Three" gathered pace, organized by the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign. They published an 18-page report in 1987 by [[Margaret Burnham]] and Lennox Hinds, two American law professors who had attended part of the trial, and who wrote that Silcott's conviction "represents a serious miscarriage of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tompson|1988|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5P9A1R1ggakC&amp;pg=PA49 49]}}, citing Burnham, Margaret (1987).

In May 1989 the [[London School of Economics]] students' union elected Silcott as the college's honorary president, to the dismay of its director and governors. Silcott resigned shortly afterwards, saying he did not want the students to become scapegoats.&lt;ref name=LSE&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3qYeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Pc4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3265,717142&amp;dq=silcott+london-school-of-economics&amp;hl=en "Britons vexed by election of cop killer"], Associated Press, 2 May 1989.{{pb}}

===(1988) Raghip's application for leave to appeal===

Engin Raghip's solicitor was by now [[Gareth Peirce]]—who had represented the [[Guildford Four]] and [[Birmingham Six]]—and his barrister [[Michael Mansfield]]. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession could not be relied upon, and arranged for him to be examined by Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Gísli Guðjónsson]] of the [[Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience|Institute of Psychiatry]], a specialist in suggestibility. Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by [[Barbara Mills]] and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire on the deck of the Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=201–203}}

[[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]], then [[Lord Chief Justice of England]], dismissed the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip that the jury had had ample opportunity to form its own opinion of him.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=201, 204–205}} [[Amnesty International]] criticized the decision, pointing to the problems with confessions made in the absence of a lawyer, and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary [[Douglas Hurd]], who said Amnesty had abandoned its impartiality.&lt;ref name="Pallister19March1991"/&gt;

There was disquiet that the application to appeal had failed. During a BBC ''[[Newsnight]]'' discussion, [[Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman|Lord Scarman]], a former [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]], said the convictions ought to be overturned. Gareth Peirce obtained another psychologist's report about Raghip and, supported by Raghip's MP [[Michael Portillo]], asked the Home Secretary to review the case. She also submitted an application to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], arguing that the way Raghip had been interviewed breached the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. In December 1990 Home Secretary [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] referred Raghip's case back to the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Rose 1992, pp. 206–207, 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

===(1990) Electrostatic detection analysis{{anchor|ESDA}}===
In parallel with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview—the notes he said were fabricated—could be submitted for an [[Electrostatic detection device|electrostatic detection analysis]] (ESDA). The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.&lt;ref name=Rose214/&gt;

In Silcott's case, according to the scientist who conducted the ESDA test, Robert Radley, the notes from the section of the fifth interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself had been inserted after the other notes were written.&lt;ref name=Rose18Jan2004/&gt; The seventh and final page of the fifth interview, where the participants would normally sign, was missing.&lt;ref name=Rose214&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1992|pp=214–215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ESDA test suggested that, on the third to sixth pages of the interview, no impressions had been left from previous pages, although these earlier impressions appeared throughout the rest of the notes. According to Will Bennett in ''[[The Independent]]'', the test "also revealed an imprint of a different page five from the one submitted in evidence which was clearly the same interview with Silcott but in which he made no implicit admissions".&lt;ref name=Bennett29June1994/&gt; In addition to this, David Baxendale, a Home Office forensic scientist who was asked to investigate by Essex police, said that the paper on which the disputed notes were written came from a different batch of paper from the rest of the interview.{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=215–216}}

The disputed section of the interview had been written down by Det Insp Maxwell Dingle. It said that, when the police told Silcott that they had witness statements saying he had attacked Blakelock, Silcott replied: "They are only kids. No one is going to believe them"; he reportedly said later: "Those kids will never go to court, you wait and see."&lt;ref name=Bennett29June1994/&gt; As a result of the ESDA test evidence, the Home Secretary added Silcott and Braithwaite to Raghip's appeal.&lt;ref name=Rose214/&gt;

The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] heard Silcott's appeal on 25 November 1991 and took just 90 minutes to overturn the conviction, delivering its 74-page decision on 5 December.&lt;ref&gt;Rose 1992, pp. 214, 217; John Mullin, [http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344869239433/Tottenham-riots-Silcott-c-001.jpg?guni=Article:in%20body%20link "Court clear Silcott"], ''The Guardian'', 25 November 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Raghip and Braithwaite's appeal was heard a few days later and was also swiftly overturned. ''R v Raghip and others'' is regarded as a landmark ruling because it recognized that "interrogative suggestibility" might make a confession unreliable.&lt;ref name=Gudjonssonp464/&gt;

The court heard that Silcott's interview notes were contaminated, and that Raghip's suggestibility and Braithwaite's having been denied a lawyer rendered their confessions unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-99TY5gpVeIC&amp;pg=PA50 50]}}; {{harvnb|Rix|1997|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown prosecutor, Roy Amlot, conceded that the apparent contamination rendered all three convictions unsafe: "[W]e would not have gone on against Braithwaite, against Raghip, against any other defendants, having learned of the apparent dishonesty of the officer in charge of the case. I say that because the Crown has to depend on the honesty and integrity of officers in a case&amp;nbsp;... The impact is obviously severe." Rose writes that the statement was "one of the more sensational speeches in English legal history."{{sfn|Rose|1992|pp=14–15}}

Braithwaite and Raghip were released immediately.&lt;ref name=Brainp185&gt;Brain 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wQBSI4U3E7IC&amp;pg=PA185 185–186].&lt;/ref&gt; Silcott remained in jail for the 1984 murder of Anthony Smith. He received £17,000 compensation in 1991 for his conviction in the Blakelock case, and in 1995 was offered up to £200,000 in [[Legal aid#England and Wales|legal aid]] to sue the police for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The Metropolitan Police settled out of court in 1999, awarding him £50,000 for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/476414.stm "Silcott police pay-out 'disgraceful'"], BBC News, 16 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on licence in October 2003 having served 17 years for Smith's murder.&lt;ref name=BBC20Oct2003&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3208140.stm "Silcott freed from jail"], BBC News, 20 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second investigation and detectives' trial==
===(1992–1994) Commander Perry Nove===
A second criminal inquiry was opened in 1992 under Commander [[Perry Nove]], who appealed for help from the local black community. In January 1993 the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) drew a distinction between the "kickers and the stabbers"—those who had kicked or punched Blakelock and those who had used weapons—and decided that the former could be called as witnesses in exchange for immunity from prosecution. By the end of 1993, Rose writes, Nove had identified nine suspects against whom at least two eyewitnesses would testify, supported by evidence such as photographs.&lt;ref name=Rose1996p300&gt;Rose 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;300–301; for "kickers and stabbers", see Halliday, Josh (10 March 2014).

It transpired during Jacobs' trial that two of the witnesses who testified against him had been paid expenses to the tune of thousands of pounds during Nove's inquiry.&lt;ref name=Barrett9April2014/&gt;

In parallel with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/police-face-trial-1532792.html "Police face trial"], ''The Independent'', 12 July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, on the grounds that it might help their clients; anything that implicated Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.&lt;ref name=Rose1996p300/&gt; Nove fought the application because he had promised his witnesses confidentiality, but he agreed to give the lawyers access to relevant passages from seven witness statements that implicated Silcott. The witnesses themselves refused to testify, so the passages were read out to the jury during the detectives' trial.&lt;ref name=Rose1996p300/&gt; According to Rose, only one of the statements seriously implicated Silcott, alleging that he had acted "like a general, sending out his little troops", and that he had joined in the attack himself.&lt;ref name=Rose1996p302&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1996|p=302}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the detectives' trial began in 1994, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that the nine suspects would not be prosecuted because it was not in the public interest.{{sfn|Rose|1996|p=305}}

The trial of Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle opened in June 1994 at the Old Bailey before [[Edwin Jowitt|Mr. Justice Jowitt]]. Only three people had been present during the [[#Disputed interview|disputed interview]] with Silcott—Melvin, Dingle and Silcott himself—and none of them gave evidence.&lt;ref name=Bennett29June1994/&gt;{{sfn|Rose|1996|p=298}}

[[David Calvert-Smith]], for the prosecution, alleged that the detectives' reportedly contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews.&lt;ref name=Bennett29June1994&gt;Bennett, Will (29 June 1994).

You wait and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep me away from them." Silcott denied ever having said those words.&lt;ref name=Rose132/&gt;

[[Richard Ferguson (barrister)|Richard Ferguson]] QC, for the defence, argued that [[#ESDA|the ESDA test]], which suggested that the disputed words had been added to the notes later, was not reliable. The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries, seven of them excerpts from Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry and seven from the original investigation in 1985; the latter were read out to the jury as statements H to N.&lt;ref name=Rose1996p302/&gt; One of the 1985 statements said that Silcott had been carrying a knife with a two-foot-long blade on the night of the murder, and that he had attacked Blakelock.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Will (27 July 1994).

Several of the statements H–N originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included [[#Juveniles|Jason Hill]], the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, without access to his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.)

Detectives began re-examining 10,000 witness statements, and submitting items for forensic tests not available in 1985. In September 2004 the back garden of a terraced council house in Willan Road, near the Broadwater Farm estate, was excavated after a tip-off. A female friend of Cynthia Jarrett, the woman whose death sparked the Broadwater Farm riot, lived alone at the house between 1984 and 1989, and according to the &lt;!-- ARTICLE USES THE TITLE SINCE 2009. --&gt;''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' was one of the first on the scene when police raided Jarrett's house.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Davenport, [https://archive.is/20130421122039/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-13457259-house-link-to-death-that-sparked-riot.do "House link to death that sparked riot"], ''Evening Standard'', 28 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists dug up the garden, while surveyors used infra-red beams to create a three-dimensional map of the area.

Jacobs was living with his mother in Manor Road, Tottenham, at the time of the riot. He had spent time in a [[Residential treatment center|residential school]] in Reading in 1983–1984 as a result of a care order, and in 1985 he joined a Tottenham gang, the Park Lane Crew.

"in connection with the murder of PC Blakelock", according to police records. The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb, a basket of rocks, and a crate.

The main prosecution witnesses were three pseudonymous men who testified from behind a curtain with their voices distorted. Two of them, "John Brown" and "Rhodes Levin", had offered testimony to Nove during his 1992–1994 investigation; the third, "Q", was Brown's cousin.&lt;ref name=Tottenham9April2014&gt;[http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/pc_blakelock_murder_trial_the_witnesses_in_detail_1_3538056 "PC Blakelock murder trial: The witnesses in detail"], ''Tottenham and Wood Green Journal'', 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Whittam QC, for the prosecution, told the court that all three had admitted kicking or hitting Blakelock and would normally face murder charges themselves, but the CPS had decided during Commander Perry Nove's inquiry to offer the "kickers" immunity in exchange for testimony against the "stabbers".&lt;ref&gt;Geoghegan, Ben (3 March 2014).

"John Brown", aged 20 at the time of the attack, had served a sentence for affray for his role in the rioting. He was a member of the Park Lane Crew, a Tottenham gang that he said Jacobs had also joined. Approached by police again during Nove's second inquiry, Brown said in a statement in August 1993 that Jacobs was a "nutter" who was "out to get blood" that night. He said Jacobs had "broadcast it everywhere that he was going to try and do a copper", and that the Park Lane Crew had stored weapons and petrol bombs in preparation for such an attack.&lt;ref name=Halliday4March2014/&gt; Brown admitted to having kicked Blakelock up to ten times, and said that he had seen Jacobs attack Blakelock with a machete or similar.&lt;ref name=Barrett4March2014&gt;Barrett, David (4 March 2014).

Afterwards, Levin said, Jacobs told him he had "got a couple of jukes [stabs] in". Levin testified that Blakelock's helmet had been passed around as a trophy; he said he could not recall the names of those who had handled it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/17/blakelock-murder-trial-police-helmet-passed-trophy "Blakelock murder trial: police helmet was 'passed around like a trophy'"], Press Association, 17 March 2014; for the knife found in Blakelock's neck, see {{harvnb|Rose|1992|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Levin was interviewed by police in November 1985, when he said Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete; he told the court in 2014 that that had been a mistake.

"Q", the third witness, first told police in 2009 that he had seen the attack, after they posted a note through his letterbox asking for witnesses. The court heard that Q had a long history of using drugs and alcohol. He said he had known Nicholas Jacobs all his life and had seen him attack Blakelock with a "mini sword" or similar, making "repeated stabbing motions" toward Blakelock.&lt;ref name=Barrett4March2014/&gt; The defence lawyer told the court that Q was a fantasist.&lt;ref name=Peachey25March2014&gt;Peachey, Paul (25 March 2014).

==Awards and legacy==
[[File:PC Keith Blakelock memorial Muswell Hill.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Blakelock in [[Muswell Hill]], London]]
Blakelock was buried in [[East Finchley Cemetery]]. For his funeral service at St. James's Church, Muswell Hill—conducted by the Rt Rev [[Brian Masters (bishop)|Brian Masters]], [[Bishop of Edmonton (London)|Bishop of Edmonton]]; the Rev [[Michael Bunker]]; and Archdeacon [[Robert Coogan (priest)|Robert Coogan]]—the church's seating capacity had to be extended from 600 to 800, and a further 300 police officers in a nearby [[British Legion]] hall joined in by closed-circuit television. A public-address system was installed to allow 500 people standing outside the church to hear the service. {{sfn|Moore|2015|p=158}} A memorial for Blakelock, commissioned by the [[Police Memorial Trust]], stands by the roundabout at Muswell Hill, north London, where he was a homebeat officer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110709100422/http://www.policememorial.org.uk/Police_Memorial_Trust/PMT_Local_Memorials/PMT-Blakelock-1985/PMT-Blakelock-1985.htm "1985 PC Keith Blakelock"], Police Memorial Trust.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque on the estate's Broadwater Farm Garden, opened in July 1988, is "dedicated to those who died and suffered on 5th and 6th October 1985"; the deaths on 5 and 6 October were Cynthia Jarrett and Keith Blakelock.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Louise (5 August 2018).

PC Dick Coombes, badly injured during the attack, went back to work part-time in July 1986 but was forced to retire in 1991, partly because of the epilepsy that developed as a result of brain damage. His eyesight deteriorated and he was left barely able to stand.{{sfn|Moore|2015|p=163}} In January 1988 every member of Serial 502 was awarded a High Commendation by Sir [[Peter Imbert]], then [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]] of the Metropolitan Police.{{sfn|Moore|2015|p=160}} In August that year, all the constables, including Blakelock, were awarded the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]] for "outstanding bravery and devotion to duty"; Blakelock's wife attended the ceremony on his behalf. Sgt David Pengelly, who single-handedly fought to hold the crowd away from Blakelock and Richard Coombes after they fell, received the [[George Medal]], awarded for acts of great bravery, for having acted "with total disregard for his own safety".&lt;ref name=award/&gt; Trevor Stratford of the London Fire Brigade was also awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal; he and another firefighter, Graham Holloway, received commendations from the fire brigade for outstanding bravery. Two other firefighters, James Ryan and David Kwai, received the Chief Fire Officer's letter of congratulations.{{sfn|Moore|2015|p=160}}

A lack of clarity about who was in charge of the police operation on the night of Blakelock's death led to a failure to deploy reinforcements and equipment in a timely manner. To ensure that such a situation was never repeated, a new "[[gold–silver–bronze command structure]]" (strategic–tactical–operational) was created in 1985 that replaced ranks with roles. It is used by all British emergency services at every type of major incident.{{sfn|Henry|2017|p=183}}

'''Emperor Ping''' ([[9 BC]] – [[3 February]] [[6 CE]])&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 228.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[emperor of China|emperor]] of the Chinese [[Han Dynasty]] from 1 BC to AD 5. After Emperor Ai died childless, the throne was passed to his cousin Emperor Ping—then a child of eight years old.  [[Wang Mang]] was appointed regent by the [[Grand Empress Dowager Wang]].  Dissatisfied with his father's dictatorial regency, in AD 3, Wang's son Wang Yu (王宇) conspired with Emperor Ping's maternal uncles of the Wei clan against Wang, but after they were discovered, Wang had not only Wang Yu and the Weis (except Consort Wei) put to death, but also used this opportunity to accuse many actual or potential political enemies as being part of the conspiracy and to execute or exile them.  From here onwards, the Han Dynasty existed only in name. Furthermore, Wang Mang also designated his daughter as the empress consort to Emperor Ping to codify his legitimacy to power.  Emperor Ping was allegedly poisoned by Wang Mang after reigning less than six years, because Wang was concerned that he would avenge his uncles, and his successor, the infant [[Emperor Ruzi of Han|Emperor Ruzi]], would be chosen by none other than Wang Mang himself.

== Family background and life as imperial prince ==
Then-Liu Jizi was born in 9 BC.  His father [[Prince Xing of Zhongshan|Liu Xing]] (劉興) was the youngest son of [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Emperor Yuan]] and the younger brother of [[Emperor Cheng of Han|Emperor Cheng]].  His mother was one of Prince Xing's consorts, Consort Wei (衛姬).  Prince Jizi had three sisters (whose names are not recorded in history) but no brother.  He was born with a heart ailment, which, when affliciting him, causes him to have circulation problems, manifesting itself outwardly as having his lips and appendages turn blue.  He was raised by his paternal grandmother [[Consort Feng Yuan]], a [[concubine]] of Emperor Yuan, who then had the title princess dowager in Prince Xing's principality.

Around the time of Prince Jizi's birth, Prince Xing was considered a potential imperial heir, because Emperor Cheng had no heirs, but eventually Emperor Cheng chose his nephew (Prince Jizi's cousin) [[Emperor Ai of Han|Liu Xin]] (劉欣), because Emperor Cheng considered Prince Xin to be more capable than Prince Xing, and also wanted to adopt Prince Xin and make him his own son.  When Emperor Cheng died in 7 BC, Prince Xin took the throne as Emperor Ai.

Also in 7 BC, when Prince Jizi was just 2, Prince Xing died, and Prince Jizi inherited his principality as the Prince of Zhongshan (roughly modern [[Baoding]], [[Hebei]]).  He continued to be periodically afflicted with his heart disorder.  As a result, his grandmother Princess Dowager Feng hired many physicians and often prayed to the gods.  In 6 BC, Emperor Ai, hearing about his cousin's illness, sent imperial physicians along with his attendant Zhang You (張由) to go to Zhongshan to treat Prince Jizi.  This, however, would have dire consequences of Princess Dowager Feng.

The imperial attendant Zhang was himself afflicted with a psychiatric condition (probably [[bipolar disorder]]), and when he got to Zhongshan, he suddenly, in a rage, left there and returned to the capital [[Chang'an]]. Once he did and was ordered to explain his conduct, he made up a false reason—that he had discovered that Princess Dowager Feng was using witchcraft to curse Emperor Ai and his grandmother, [[Consort Fu|Empress Dowager Fu]]. Empress Dowager Fu and Princess Dowager Feng were romantic rivals when they were both consorts to Emperor Yuan, and Empress Dowager Fu decided to use this opportunity to strike at Princess Dowager Feng. She sent a eunuch, Shi Li (史立), to serve as investigator, and Shi tortured a good number of Princess Dowager Feng's relations (including her sister Feng Xi (馮習) and her sister-in-law Junzhi (君之)), some to death, but still could not build a solid case against Princess Dowager Feng. Shi Li decided to show Princess Dowager Feng who was actually behind the investigation, by referring to an incident in which then-Consort Feng defended Emperor Yuan against a bear which had broken loose. Princess Dowager Feng, realizing that Empress Dowager Fu was behind the investigation, went back to her palace and committed suicide. In total, 17 members of the Feng clan died as a result of the investigations.  Prince Jizi, then still a toddler, was spared.  (Princess Dowager Feng's reputation would be restored, and her accusers severely punished, in 1 BC, after the deaths of Emperor Ai and Empress Dowager Fu.)

In 1 BC, Emperor Ai died without an heir.  His stepgrandmother, [[Empress Wang Zhengjun|Grand Empress Dowager Wang]], quickly seized power back from Emperor Ai's male favorite (and probable lover) [[Dong Xian]], and recalled her nephew Wang Mang as regent.  Wang Mang quickly carried out a wave of retaliation against Dong Xian and Emperor Ai's Fu and Ding (relatives of his mother [[Consort Ding]]) relations, purging them from government, and at the same time purging many actual or potential political enemies, while at the same time pretending to Grand Empress Dowager Wang to be faithful to Han.  Prince Jizi, as the only surviving male descendant of Emperor Yuan (both Emperors Cheng and Ai having died without issue), was considered the logical successor, and he was welcomed to Chang'an to succeed his cousin.

== Early reign and Wang Mang's aggrandization of power ==
Almost immediately after Emperor Ping took the throne, Wang Mang began to carry out a regime to return governmental structure to ancient days of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] and the even more ancient [[Xia Dynasty]] and [[Shang Dynasty]].  He also aggressively pursued a program to build up a [[personality cult]] about himself, wanting to have himself recognized as a holy regent on the scale of the [[Duke of Zhou]].  In 1 CE, for example, after having his political allies convincing Grand Empress Dowager Wang of his great faithfulness and great achievements, he was created the Duke of Anhan (安漢公, literally "Duke who made Han secure"), even though there had not been a single duke created in Han history up to that point.  Further, to appease both the disaffected nobility and the people, Wang Mang instituted a program to restore marquess titles to descendants of past imperial princes and marquesses, started a pension system for retired officials, and reduced taxes.  He also bribed vassal states into making offerings of rare animals, viewed as signs of heavenly blessing, to Han.  With all people praising Wang Mang, he managed to persuade Grand Empress Dowager Wang, then already 69 years old, to have him make the important state decisions, rather than have her do so, and Wang Mang immediately became the most powerful figure in the empire.

To prevent Emperor Ping's Wei relations from becoming powerful potential rivals at court, Wang Mang limited the titles of Emperor Ping's uncles to acting marquesses (關內侯) and his mother Consort Wei to "Princess Xiao of Zhongshan" ("Prince Xiao" being Prince Xing's posthumous name), and only created Emperor Ping's three sisters ladies (君).  He also ordered that the Weis, including Consort Wei, and Emperor Ping's sisters not to be allowed to go to Chang'an to see him, but were to remain in Zhongshan.

In 2 CE, to reduce the burden of the people in [[naming taboo]], Emperor Ping's name was changed to Kan (衎), since Ji and Zi were commonly used characters.

Also in 2 CE, Wang Mang decided to have his [[Empress Wang (Ping)|daughter]] married to Emperor Ping to further affirm his position.  Initially, he started a selection process of eligible noble young ladies (after declaring, in accordance with ancient customs, that Emperor Ping will have one wife and 11 [[concubines]]).  However, then, in an act of false modesty intended to create the opposite result, he petitioned Grand Empress Dowager Wang that his daughter not be considered—and then started a petition drive by the people to have his daughter be selected as empress.  The petitioners stormed the outside of the palace, and Grand Empress Dowager Wang, overwhelmed by the display of affection for Wang Mang, ordered that Wang Mang's daughter be made empress.

== The Lü Kuan Incident and Wang Mang's seizure of absolute power ==
Wang Mang's son Wang Yu (王宇) disagreed with his father's dictatorial regime and program to build up his personality cult, afraid that in the future the Wangs would receive a backlash when Emperor Ping was grown.  He therefore formed friendships with Emperor Ping's Wei uncles, and told Consort Wei to offer assurances to Wang Mang that she would not act as Emperor Ai's mother and grandmother did, trying to become an empress dowager.  Wang Mang still refused to let her visit the capital.

In 3 CE, Wang Yu formed a [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]] with his teacher Wu Zhang (吳章), his brother-in-law Lü Kuan (呂寬), and the Weis, to try to see what they can do to break Wang Mang's dictatorial hold.  They decided that they would create what appear to be supernatural incidents to make Wang Mang concerned, and then have Wu try to persuade Wang Mang to transfer power to the Weis.  Wang Yu told Lü to toss a bottle of blood onto Wang Mang's mansion door to create that effect—but Lü was discovered by Wang Mang's guards.  Wang Mang then arrested Wang Yu, who then committed suicide, and his wife (Lü Kuan's sister) Lü Yan (呂焉) was executed.  Wang Mang then executed the entire Wei clan, except for Consort Wei.  Wu was cut in half and then drawn and quartered.  (It is not known what happened to Lü, but it would appear that there would be no way for him to escape death.)

Wang Mang then took this opportunity to further wipe out potential enemies—by torturing Wang Yu and Lü's coconspirators and then arrest anyone that they mentioned, and then have them either executed or forced them to commit suicide.  The victims of this purge included Emperor Yuan's sister Princess Jingwu (敬武長公主), Wang Mang's own uncle Wang Li (王立), and his own cousin Wang Ren (王仁).  He told Grand Empress Dowager Wang, however, falsely, that they had died of illnesses.  Many other officials who were not willing to follow Wang Mang were also victimized in this purge.  After this, Wang Mang's hold on power became absolute.

In 4 CE, Emperor Ping officially married Wang Mang's daughter and created her empress.

In 5 CE, Wang Mang revived an ancient ceremony intended for those who have made great contributions to the state, and had himself given the [[nine bestowments]].  (The "nine bestowments" would, after Wang Mang, thereafter become a customary step for usurpers to receive before they usurp the throne.)

== Death ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Kangling 1.jpg|thumb|Kangling (康陵), tomb of Emperor Ping, in [[Xianyang]], Shaanxi]]
Circa 5 AD, Emperor Ping, having grown older, appeared to have grown out of his earlier heart condition, and it became fairly plain that he resented Wang Mang for slaughtering his uncles and not allowing his mother to visit him in Chang'an.  Wang Mang therefore resolved to murder the emperor.  In winter 5 AD, Wang Mang submitted pepper wine (considered in those days to be capable of chasing away evil spirits) to the 13-year-old emperor, but had the wine spiked with poison.  As the emperor was suffering the effects of the poison, Wang Mang wrote a secret petition to the gods, in which he offered to substitute his life for Emperor Ping's, and then have the petition locked away.  (Historians generally believed that Wang Mang had two motives in doing this—one was, in case Emperor Ping recovered from the poisoning, to use this to try to absolve himself of involvement in the poisoning, and the second was to leave for posterity evidence of his faithfulness.)  After a few days of suffering, Emperor Ping died.  The throne would lie vacant for the next few years, as although Emperor Ping's [[cousin-once-removed]], the infant [[Emperor Ruzi of Han|Emperor Ruzi]], would be selected as emperor, he would never actually take the throne.  Wang Mang would serve as acting emperor and usurp the Han throne officially in 8 AD.

===Tomb===
Emperor Ping's burial mound is found in Zhouling district of [[Xianyang]]. The grave sits in a field with only a rudimentary sign and low fence to distinguish it. The latter has not proven effective in discouraging climbers, as there are worn paths leading up and down the hill.

'''Enantiostasis''' is the ability of an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]], especially a living [[organism]], to maintain and conserve its metabolic and physiological functions in response to variations in an unstable environment. Estuarine organisms typically undergo enantiostasis in order to survive with constantly changing salt concentrations. The Australian [[Board of Studies|NSW Board of Studies]] defines the term in its Biology syllabus as "the maintenance of metabolic and physiological functions in response to variations in the environment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsc.csu.edu.au/biology/core/balance/9_2_3/923net.html HSC Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Enantiostasis is not a form of classical [[homeostasis]], meaning "standing at a similar level," which focuses on maintenance of internal body conditions such as pH, oxygen levels, and ion concentrations. Rather than maintaining homeostatic (stable ideal) conditions, enantiostasis involves maintaining only functionality in spite of external fluctuations. However, it can be considered a type of homeostasis in a broader context because functions are kept relatively consistent. Organic compounds such as [[Taurine]] have been shown to still properly function within environments that have been disrupted from an ideal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yan|first=Chong Chao|date=1996|title=Effects of Taurine and Guanidinoethane Sulfonate on Toxicity of the Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Monocrotaline|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.uregina.ca:2048/science/article/pii/000629529502185X?via%3Dihub|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=51 |issue=3|pages=321–329|doi=10.1016/0006-2952(95)02185-X|issn=0006-2952|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''enantiostasis'' was proposed by Mangum and Towle.&lt;ref name="MagnumTowle"&gt;{{cite journal |author=C. P. Mangum &amp; D. W. Towle |year=1977 |title=Physiological adaptation to unstable environments |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=65 |pages=67–75 |pmid=842933 |bibcode=1977AmSci..65...67M}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ἐναντίος}} (''{{lang|el|[[:wikt:enantio-|enantio-]]}}''; opposite, opposing, over against) and {{lang|el|[[:wikt:στάσις|στάσις]]}} (''{{lang|el|[[:wikt:stasis|stasis]]}}''; to stand, posture).

== Trehalose ==
* Fruit Flies Drosophila use the non-toxic sugar trehalose that is found in the hemolymph of insects to cope with changes in environmental conditions. Trehalose levels can spike up to 2% in the hemolymph in response to temperature changes, salinity and osmotic and oxidative stress.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/carbohydrates-comprehensive-studies-on-glycobiology-and-glycotechnology/carbohydrate-metabolism-in-drosophila-reliance-on-the-disaccharide-trehalose|title=Carbohydrate Metabolism in Drosophila: Reliance on the Disaccharide Trehalose|last=Reyes-DelaTorre|first=Alejandro|last2=Teresa|first2=Maria|last3=Rafael|first3=Juan|date=2012|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/50633}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Yeast cells accumulate Trehalose in order to withstand heat stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Estuarine Environments ==
Examples of organisms which undergo enantiostasis in an estuarine environment include:

* The oxygen binding effectiveness of [[hemocyanin]] in the blue crab ''[[Callinectes sapidus]]'' varies according to the concentration of two factors, calcium ion concentration, and hydrogen ion concentration.  When these concentrations are varied in the same direction, they have a counterbalancing effect. To stabilize oxygen binding at low ionic concentrations, the crab increases its internal pH (decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration) to allow the hemocyanin to continue to function efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charlotte P. Mangum |year=1997 |title=Adaptation of the oxygen transport system to hypoxia in the blue crab, ''Callinectes sapidus'' |journal=[[American Zoologist]] |volume=37| issue=6 |pages=604–611 |doi=10.1093/icb/37.6.604}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dungeness crab]], ''Cancer magister'', relies on the magnesium ion (Mg2+) for its [[hemocyanin]] oxygen affinity. In the juvenile stage, the crab has higher magnesium ion concentrations resulting in higher hemocyanin oxygen affinity. This changes throughout development, such that the adult ''Cancer magister'' has less magnesium ion and thus, less hemocyanin oxygen affinity. Intrinsic oxygen affinity is inversely proportional magnesium ion concentrations in the crab, which counterbalances the hemocyanin oxygen affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terwilliger|first=Nora B.|last2=Ryan|first2=Margaret|date=2001-10-01|title=Ontogeny of Crustacean Respiratory Proteins|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/41/5/1057/342224/Ontogeny-of-Crustacean-Respiratory-Proteins1|journal=American Zoologist|language=en|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1057–1067|doi=10.1093/icb/41.5.1057|issn=1540-7063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== High Salt Environments ==

* [[Halophiles]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; have adapted to high salt environments by using energy from the sun to maintain a high internal potassium ion concentration and by using biological proteins that can function in the varying, high internal potassium ion concentrations. These adaptions allow halophiles to thrive by increasing internal osmolarity to compensate for the high sodium concentrations of the external environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Mary F|date=2005-08-04|title=Organic compatible solutes of halotolerant and halophilic microorganisms|journal=Saline Systems|volume=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1746-1448-1-5|issn=1746-1448|pmc=1224877|pmid=16176595}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prevents the movement of water out of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rippon|first=John W.|date=2015-01-07|title=Biochemical Adaptation by Peter W.

"'''Escape Clause'''" is episode six of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. It originally aired on November 6, 1959 on [[CBS]].

==Opening narration==
{{cquote| You're about to meet a hypochondriac.  Witness Mr. Walter Bedeker age forty-four. Afraid of the following: death, disease, other people, germs, draft, and everything else. He has one interest in life and that's Walter Bedeker. One preoccupation, the life and well-being of Walter Bedeker. One abiding concern about society, that if Walter Bedeker should die ''how will it survive without him''?}}

==Plot==
Mean-spirited, abusive [[hypochondriac]] Walter Bedeker sells his soul to the [[devil]] (appearing as a rotund rogue who calls himself "Mr. Cadwallader" here) [[Deal with the Devil|in exchange for immortality]], adding enough conditions to keep him out of Cadwallader's clutches forever. Cadwallader readily agrees to his demands, only stipulating an [[escape clause]] which allows Bedeker to choose the time of his death if he tires of being immortal.

Bedeker uses his newfound invulnerability to collect insurance money and cheap thrills by hurling himself into life-threatening accidents. Soon growing bored with this, he comes to the realization that his constant fear of fatal illness was the one thing which gave him any interest in life. He tells his wife that he is going to attempt to regain the thrill by jumping off the roof of their apartment building. 

While trying to stop him, his wife accidentally falls off the edge herself. Bedeker tells the authorities he murdered his wife, hoping to experience the electric chair. 

However, due to his lawyer's defense strategy, he is instead sentenced to life in prison without parole. Cadwallader visits Bedeker in his holding cell to remind him of the escape clause. Realizing he will face eternity in prison if he does not use it, Bedeker nods and suffers a fatal [[Myocardial Infarction|heart attack]]. The guard discovers his lifeless body and sighs, "Poor devil..."

==Closing narration==
{{cquote| There's a saying, "Every man is put on Earth condemned to die, time and method of execution unknown."  Perhaps this is as it should be.  Case in point: Walter Bedeker, lately deceased.  A little man with such a yen to live.  Beaten by the devil, by his own boredom, and by the scheme of things in this, the Twilight Zone.}}

==Cast==
* [[David Wayne]] as Walter Bedeker
* [[Thomas Gomez]] as [[Satan|Mr. Cadwallader]]
* [[Virginia Christine]] as Ethel Bedeker
* [[Dick Wilson]] as insurance man #1 (Jack)
* [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]] as insurance man #2 (Steve)
* Wendell Holmes as Bedeker's lawyer
* [[Raymond Bailey]] as Bedeker's doctor

==Production==
"Escape Clause" was one of the three episodes-in-production mentioned by Rod Serling in his 1959 promotional film pitching the series to potential sponsors, the others being "[[The Lonely (The Twilight Zone)|The Lonely]]" and "[[Mr. Denton on Doomsday]]" (referred to as "Death, Destry, and Mr. Dingle").

==Impact==
"Here was a little gem.  Good work, Rod Serling.  This little piece about a hypochondriac who gets tangled up with an obese, clerical devil ranked with the best that has ever been accomplished in half-hour filmed television." —''Excerpt from the [[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] review.''

[[Disney]]'s [[Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]] has a reference to this episode located in the basement of the attraction. The elevators have a certificate of inspection plaque, signed by "Cadwallader", bearing the inspection number "10259". These numbers represent October 2, 1959, the date ''The Twilight Zone'' first aired.

A '''fracton''' is an [[Emergence#Nonliving, physical systems|emergent]] [[quasiparticle]] excitation that is immobile when in isolation.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1505.02576|last1=Vijay|first1=Sagar|title=A New Kind of Topological Quantum Order: A Dimensional Hierarchy of Quasiparticles Built from Stationary Excitations|journal=Physical Review B|volume=92|issue=23|pages=235136|last2=Haah|first2=Jeongwan|last3=Fu|first3=Liang|year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.92.235136|bibcode=2015PhRvB..92w5136V}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1803.11196|last1=Nandkishore|first1=Rahul M|title=Fractons|last2=Hermele|first2=Michael|class=cond-mat.str-el|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetric Tensor Gauge Theory==

The immobility of fractons in symmetric tensor gauge theory can be understood as a generalization of [[charge conservation|electric charge conservation]] resulting from a modified [[Gauss's law]].
For example, in the U(1) scalar charge model, the fracton charge density (&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) is related to a symmetric electric field tensor (&lt;math&gt;E_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, a theoretical generalization of the usual [[electric field|electric vector field]]) via &lt;math&gt;\rho = \partial_i \partial_j E_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, where the repeated spatial indices &lt;math&gt;i,j=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; are [[Einstein notation|implicitly summed]] over.
Both the fracton charge (&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;) and [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] (&lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;) can be shown to be conserved:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
q &amp;= \int \rho \; d^3x = \int \partial_i (\partial_j E_{ij}) \; d^3x = 0 \\
p_i &amp;= \int x_i \rho \; d^3x = \int x_i \partial_j \partial_k E_{jk} \; d^3x = - \int \partial_k E_{ik} \; d^3x = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
When [[Integration by parts|integrating by parts]], we have assumed that there is no electric field at spatial infinity.
Since the total fracton charge and dipole moment is zero under this assumption, this implies that the charge and dipole moment is conserved.
Because moving an isolated charge changes the total dipole moment, this implies that isolated charges are immobile in this theory.
However, two oppositely charged fractons, which forms a fracton dipole, can move freely since this does not change the dipole moment.
&lt;ref name=PretkoSubdimensional/&gt;

==Applications==

Fractons were originally studied as an analytically tractable realization of quantum [[Amorphous solid|glassiness]] where the immobility of isolated fractons results in a slow relaxation rate
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=cond-mat/0404182|last1=Chamon|first1=Claudio|title=Quantum Glassiness|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=94|issue=4|pages=040402|year=2005|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.040402|pmid=15783534|bibcode=2005PhRvL..94d0402C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This immobility has also been shown to be capable of producing a partially [[Stabilizer code|self-correcting]] [[Qubit|quantum memory]], which could be useful for making an analog of a [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]] for a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]]

'''George Henry William Jerram''' (15 August 1904 – 20 May 1948) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL).

Jerrem, a utility, was used as a half forward flanker, [[back pocket]] and in the ruck during his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmesby|first=Russell|last2=Main|first2=Jim|title=The Encyclopedia Of AFL Footballers| publisher=BAS Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-1-920910-78-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An interstate player in just his second season, Jerram represented the VFL in the [[1927 Melbourne Carnival]]. He also finished equal sixth in the Brownlow Medal that year, after a good season with Geelong. In 1930 he switched to North Melbourne and didn't miss a game in his first two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/G/George_Jerram.html| title=George Jerram| publisher=AFL Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his last appearance with North Melbourne in 1935 and the following year went to [[Williamstown Football Club|Williamstown]], who he captain-coached in 1938.

In 144 VFL games, Jerram was never reported by the umpires and off the field worked as a policeman. After leaving the police force, Jerram became a boiler attendant.

He died in 1948, from a fractured skull as well as other injuries sustained when he fell on a South Melbourne footpath. Accounts of how he fell varied, with the inquest having an open finding, unable to determine whether it was accidental or as a result of an alleged brawl.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]'', [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22687932 "Open Finding On Ex-Policeman's Death"], 1 July 1948. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy of science]], '''intertheoretic reduction''' occurs when a reducing theory makes predictions that perfectly or almost perfectly match the predictions of a reduced theory, while the reducing theory explains or predicts a wider range of phenomena under more general conditions. [[general relativity|Special relativity]],  for example, can be reduced to  [[Newtonian mechanics]] for velocities far less than ''[[Speed of light|c]]''.

According to [[Alexander Rosenberg]] philosophers mostly these days believe that reduction between sciences is possible ''in principle'' but concepts we currently have do not allow reductions even in many cases in which [[natural science]]s are involved, for instance from [[biology]] to [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Rosenberg - Philosophy of Social Science, second edition, page 140, published in 1995 by Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the extent to which one theory can be said to be reduced to another theory is complicated by the existence of [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. Furthermore, there is the issue of by what criteria one judges one theory as more fundamental than another. Often, this notion is ambiguous. For instance, a quintessential example of intertheoretic reduction is often considered to be the reduction of [[phenomenological thermodynamics]] to [[statistical mechanics]]. However, it has been argued that there are some phenomena (e.g. phase transitions and critical phenomena) that cannot be reductively explicated in terms of the "more fundamental" theory of statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Batterman, Robert (2009) Emergence, Singularities, and Symmetry Breaking.&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially [[psychology]] is seen often as a "scientific dead-end" due to its intentional concepts (though psychology does not necessarily have to use intentional concepts). Logical analysis has suggested that intentional concepts are not reducible to non-intentional concepts used by [[neurophysiology]] in which is the discipline "underlying" the psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg's book, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Mark "Jerry" Bryant''' (1826 &amp;ndash; 10 December 1881) was an Australian [[cricket]]er. He played [[first-class cricket]] matches for [[Surrey cricket team|Surrey]] and [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]]. He was born in England in 1826, being [[infant baptism|christened]] on 24 October of that year at [[Caterham]], [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name="Cricinfo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/4403.html |title=James Bryant |accessdate=13 February 2015 |work=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant was an instrumental figure at the outset of [[Australian rules football]], providing footballs, equipment and amenities for many of the earliest recorded matches in the parklands of [[Melbourne]]. His hotel, the Parade Hotel, near the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], is where the [[Laws of Australian rules football#Melbourne Rules of 1859|first laws]] of the game were codified by members of the [[Melbourne Football Club]] in May 1859.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3077">'''Juliana''' (died 1946) was a medal-winning [[Great Dane]]. She was awarded two [[The Blue Cross|Blue Cross medals]], the first for extinguishing an [[incendiary device|incendiary bomb]] and the second for alerting her masters to a fire that had started in their shop. In September 2013 the second of these medals, along with a portrait of Juliana, sold at auction for £1,100. The discovery and sale of these items uncovered the story of Juliana's heroic acts.

==Honours==
[[File:Luftwaffe 1kg Incendiary Bomb.jpg|thumb|Juliana extinguished a German incendiary device similar to this one.]]
In April 1941, two years into [[World War II]], incendiary bombs were being dropped across Britain during [[The Blitz]].&lt;ref name="Mail040913" /&gt; One such device is believed to have fallen through the roof of the house in which Juliana and her owner lived. The dog is reported to have stood over the bomb and urinated on it, extinguishing the fire and preventing it from spreading.&lt;ref name="Telegraph040913" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC060913" /&gt; She was awarded her first Blue Cross medal for her actions.&lt;ref name="Telegraph040913" /&gt;

Juliana was celebrated as a hero for a second time when, in November 1944, she again helped to save the lives of her owners. After a fire had taken hold in their shoe shop, she alerted her master's family to the impending danger. For this she was awarded a second medal.&lt;ref name="Telegraph040913" /&gt;

The second medal, along with a portrait of Juliana, was discovered during a [[house clearance]] in Bristol. The items were sold together at a Gloucestershire auction in September 2013, with the auctioneer describing Juliana as "a Great Dane with a great bladder". Initially expected to achieve £60, the sale reached £1,100 with the winning bid coming from an anonymous buyer.&lt;ref name="Telegraph040913" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC060913" /&gt;

==Death==
Juliana died from poisoning in 1946 after a substance was posted through her owner's letterbox.&lt;ref name="Telegraph040913" /&gt;

The '''Late Devonian extinction''' was one of five major [[extinction event]]s in the history of life on Earth. A major extinction, the [[Late Devonian extinction#The Kellwasser event|Kellwasser event]], occurred at the boundary that marks the beginning of the last phase of the [[Devonian]] period, the [[Famennian]] [[faunal stage]] (the Frasnian–Famennian boundary), about 376–360 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Racki, 2005"&gt;Racki, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGhee"&gt;McGhee, George R., Jr, 1996. The Late Devonian Mass Extinction: the Frasnian/Famennian Crisis (Columbia University Press) {{ISBN|0-231-07504-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 19% of all families and 50% of all genera became extinct.&lt;ref name="ucr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/extinction|title= John Baez, ''Extinction,'' April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second, distinct mass extinction, the [[Hangenberg event]], closed the Devonian period.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan and Bustin, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Although it is clear that there was a massive loss of biodiversity in the Late Devonian, the timespan of this event is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 500,000 to 25 million years, extending from the mid-Givetian to the end-Famennian.&lt;ref name="Stigall, 2011"&gt;Stigall, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} Nor is it clear whether there were two sharp mass extinctions or a series of smaller extinctions, though the latest research suggests multiple causes and a series of distinct extinction pulses during an interval of some three million years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003AM/finalprogram/abstract_61972.htm Racki, Grzegorz, "Toward understanding of Late Devonian global events: few answers, many questions" GSA Annual meeting, Seattle 2003 (abstract)]; McGhee 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the extinction to be as many as seven distinct events, spread over about 25 million years, with notable extinctions at the ends of the [[Givetian]], [[Frasnian]], and [[Famennian]] stages.&lt;ref name="sole"&gt;Sole, R. V., and Newman, M., 2002. "Extinctions and Biodiversity in the Fossil Record - Volume Two, The earth system: biological and ecological dimensions of global environment change" pp. 297-391, ''Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change'' John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Late Devonian, the land had been colonized by [[plants]] and [[insects]]. In the oceans were massive [[reef]]s built by corals and [[Stromatoporoidea|stromatoporoids]]. [[Euramerica]] and [[Gondwana]] were beginning to converge into what would become [[Pangaea]]. The extinction seems to have only affected marine life. Hard-hit groups include [[brachiopod]]s, [[trilobite]]s, and reef-building [[organism]]s; the reef-building organisms almost completely disappeared. The causes of these extinctions are unclear. Leading hypotheses include changes in sea level and ocean [[anoxic event|anoxia]], possibly triggered by global cooling or oceanic volcanism. The impact of a [[comet]] or another extraterrestrial body has also been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;Sole, R. V., and Newman, M. [http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/99-12-079.pdf Patterns of extinction and biodiversity in the fossil record]&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Siljan Ring]] event in Sweden. Some statistical analysis suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a decrease in [[speciation]] than by an increase in extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Bambach | first=R.K. | last2=Knoll | first2=A.H. | last3=Wang | first3=S.C. | title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity | journal=Paleobiology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=522–542 | date=December 2004 | url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;issn=0094-8373&amp;volume=30&amp;page=522 | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0522:OEAMDO&gt;2.0.CO;2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stigall, 2011"/&gt; This might have been caused by invasions of cosmopolitan species, rather than by any single event.&lt;ref name="Stigall, 2011"/&gt; Surprisingly, [[jawed vertebrate]]s seem to have been unaffected by the loss of reefs or other aspects of the Kellwasser event, while [[agnathan]]s were in decline long before the end of the Frasnian.&lt;ref name="Sallan and Coates, 2010"&gt;Sallan and Coates, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==The Late Devonian world==
{{Fish graphical timeline}}
[[File:Tiktaalik restoration by ObsidianSoul 01.png|thumb|left|190px|A restored ''[[Tiktaalik]]'']]
During the Late Devonian, the continents were arranged differently from today, with a supercontinent, [[Gondwana]], covering much of the Southern Hemisphere. The [[continent]] of [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] occupied the Northern Hemisphere, while an equatorial continent, [[Laurussia]] (formed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and [[Laurentia]]), was [[continental drift|drifting]] towards Gondwana, closing the [[Iapetus ocean]]. The Caledonian mountains were also growing across what is now the Scottish Highlands and Scandinavia, while the [[Appalachians]] rose over America.&lt;ref name=McKerrow&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKerrow |first1=W.S. |last2=Mac Niocaill |first2=C. |last3=Dewey |first3=J.F. |date=2000 |title=The Caledonian Orogeny redefined |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=157 |pages=1149–1154 |doi=10.1144/jgs.157.6.1149 |bibcode=2000JGSoc.157.1149M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biota was also very different. Plants, which had been on land in forms similar to mosses, liverworts, and lichens since the [[Ordovician]], had just developed roots, seeds, and [[vascular|water transport]] systems that allowed them to survive away from places that were constantly wet—and consequently built huge forests on the highlands. Several different clades had developed a shrubby or tree-like habit by the Late Givetian, including the [[Cladoxylopsid|cladoxylalean]] [[fern]]s, [[lepidosigillarian|lepidosigillarioid]] [[lycopsid]]s, and [[aneurophyte]] and [[archaeopteris|archaeopterid]] [[progymnosperm]]s.&lt;ref name=Algeo1998/&gt; Fish were also undergoing a huge radiation, and the first tetrapods, such as ''[[Tiktaalik]]'', were beginning to evolve leg-like structures.

==Duration and timing of the extinction events==
Extinction rates appear to have been higher than the background rate, for an extended interval covering the last 20–25 million years of the Devonian. During this time, about eight to ten distinct events can be seen, of which two stand out as particularly severe.&lt;ref name=Algeo2001&gt;{{cite book|author=Algeo, T.J., S.E. Scheckler and J. B.

===The Kellwasser event===
The Kellwasser event, named for its ''locus typicus'', the Kellwassertal in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany, is the term given to the extinction pulse that occurred near the Frasnian–Famennian boundary. Most references to the "Late Devonian extinction" are in fact referring to the Kellwasser, which was the first event to be detected based on marine invertebrate record. There may in fact have been two closely spaced events here, as shown by the presence of two distinct anoxic shale layers.

===The Hangenberg event===
The [[Hangenberg event]] is found on or just below the Devonian–Carboniferous boundary and marks the last spike in the period of extinction. It is marked by an anoxic black shale layer and an overlying sandstone deposit.&lt;ref name="Brezinski et al. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence for long-term climate change in Upper Devonian strata of the central Appalachians |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.10.010 |author1=Brezinski, D.K. |author2=Cecil, C.B. |author3=Skema, V.W. |author4=Kertis, C.A. |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=284 |year=2009|pages=315–325 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223209616_Evidence_for_long-term_climate_change_in_Upper_Devonian_strata_of_the_central_Appalachians}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Kellwasser event, the Hangenberg event affected both marine and terrestrial habitats.&lt;ref name="Sallan and Coates, 2010"/&gt;

==Effects of the events==
The extinction events were accompanied by widespread oceanic [[anoxic event|anoxia]]; that is, a lack of oxygen, prohibiting decay and allowing the preservation of organic matter. This, combined with the ability of porous reef rocks to hold oil, has led to Devonian rocks being an important source of oil, especially in the USA. &lt;!--Anoxic conditions in the sea-bed of late Devonian ocean basins produced some oil shales.--&gt;

===Biological impact===
The Kellwasser event and most other Later Devonian pulses primarily affected the marine community, and had a greater effect on shallow warm-water organisms than on cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by the Kellwasser event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems, including the [[stromatoporoid]]s, and the [[rugosa|rugose]] and [[tabulate]] [[coral]]s. Reefs of the later Devonian were dominated by sponges and calcifying bacteria, producing structures such as [[oncolite]]s and [[stromatolites]]. The collapse of the reef system was so stark that bigger reef-building by new families of carbonate-secreting organisms, the modern [[scleractinia|scleractinian or "stony" corals,]] did not recover until the Mesozoic era.

Further taxa to be starkly affected include the [[brachiopod]]s, [[trilobite]]s, [[ammonite]]s, [[conodont]]s, and [[acritarch]]s. Both [[graptolites]] and [[cystoids]] disappeared during this event. The surviving taxa show morphological trends through the event. Trilobites evolved smaller eyes in the run-up to the Kellwasser event, with eye size increasing again afterwards. This suggests vision was less important around the event, perhaps due to increasing water depth or turbidity. The brims of trilobites (i.e. the rims of their heads) also expanded across this period. The brims are thought to have served a respiratory purpose, and the increasing anoxia of waters led to an increase in their brim area in response. The shape of conodonts' feeding apparatus varied with [[Δ18O|the oxygen isotope ratio]], and thus with the sea water temperature; this may relate to them occupying different [[trophic level]]s as nutrient input changed.&lt;ref name="Balter"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Record of climate-driven morphological changes in 376&amp;nbsp;Ma Devonian fossils |date=November 2008 |journal=Geology |doi=10.1130/G24989A.1 |volume=36 |pages=907 |last1=Balter |first1=Vincent |last2=Renaud |first2=Sabrina |last3=Girard |first3=Catherine |last4=Joachimski |first4=Michael M. |issue=11 |bibcode=2008Geo....36..907B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most extinction events, specialist taxa occupying small niches were harder hit than generalists.&lt;ref name="McGhee"/&gt;

The Hangenberg event affected both marine and freshwater communities. This mass extinction affected [[ammonite]]s and [[trilobite]]s, as well as jawed vertebrates, including [[tetrapod]] ancestors.&lt;ref name="Sallan and Coates, 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korn, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=incomplete|date=January 2015}} The Hangenberg is linked to the extinction of 44% of high-level vertebrate [[clade]]s, including all placoderms and most [[sarcopterygian]]s, and the complete turnover of the vertebrate biota.&lt;ref name="Sallan and Coates, 2010"/&gt; 97&amp;nbsp;per cent of vertebrate species disappeared, with only smaller forms surviving. After the event only sharks less than a meter and most fishes and tetrapods less than 10&amp;nbsp;centimeters remained, and it would take 40 million years before they started to increase in size again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3315741/Mass-extinctions-hit-large-animals-hardest-Small-vertebrates-flourish-deadly-global-catastrophes.html |title=Mass extinctions hit large animals the hardest: Small vertebrates flourish after deadly global catastrophes |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the establishment of the modern vertebrate fauna in the [[Carboniferous]], consisting mostly of [[actinopterygii|actinopterygians]], [[chondrichthyes|chondrichthyans]], and [[tetrapod]]s. [[Romer's gap]], a 15&amp;nbsp;million-year hiatus in the early Carboniferous tetrapod record, has been linked to this event.&lt;ref name="Sallan and Coates, 2010"/&gt; Also, the poor Famennian record for marine invertebrates suggests that some of the losses attributed to the Kellwasser event likely actually occurred during the Hangenberg extinction.&lt;ref name="Sallan and Coates, 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foote, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=incomplete|date=January 2015}}

===Magnitude===
The late Devonian crash in [[biodiversity]] was more drastic than the familiar [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction event]] that closed the [[Cretaceous]]. A recent survey (McGhee 1996) estimates that 22% of all the '[[family (biology)|families]]' of marine animals (largely [[invertebrate]]s) were eliminated. The family is a great unit, and to lose so many signifies a deep loss of ecosystem diversity. On a smaller scale, 57% of genera and at least 75% of species did not survive into the Carboniferous. These latter estimates&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The species estimate is the toughest to assess and most likely to be adjusted.&lt;/ref&gt; need to be treated with a degree of caution, as the estimates of species loss depend on surveys of Devonian marine taxa that are perhaps not well enough known to assess their true rate of losses, so it is difficult to estimate the effects of differential preservation and [[sampling bias]]es during the Devonian.

==Causes of the extinctions==
Since the Kellwasser-related extinctions occurred over such a long time, it is difficult to assign a single cause, and indeed to separate cause from effect. The sedimentary record shows that the late Devonian was a time of environmental change,&lt;!--this needs to be more specific to transmit information--&gt; which directly affected organisms and caused extinction. What caused these changes is somewhat more open to debate.

From the end of the Middle Devonian, into the Late Devonian, several environmental changes can be detected from the sedimentary record. Evidence exists of widespread anoxia in oceanic bottom waters;&lt;ref name=Algeo1998/&gt; the rate of carbon burial shot up,&lt;ref name=Algeo1998/&gt; and [[benthic zone|benthic]] organisms were devastated, especially in the tropics, and especially reef communities.&lt;ref name=Algeo1998/&gt; Good evidence has been found for high-frequency sea-level changes around the Frasnian–Famennian Kellwasser event, with one [[sea level rise]] associated with the onset of anoxic deposits.&lt;ref name=Bond2008&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.02.015|title=The role of sea-level change and marine anoxia in the Frasnian-Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction|year=2008|author1=David P. G. Bond |author2=Paul B. Wignalla |volume=263|journal=  Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|pages=107–118|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hangenberg event has been associated with sea-level rise followed swiftly by glaciation-related sea-level fall.&lt;ref name="Brezinski et al. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Algeo et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=incomplete|date=January 2015}}

Possible triggers are as follows:

===Bolide impact===
[[Bolide]] impacts can be dramatic triggers of mass extinctions. An asteroid impact was proposed as the prime cause of this faunal turnover,&lt;ref name="McGhee" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Digby McLaren, 1969;&lt;/ref&gt; but no secure evidence of a specific extraterrestrial impact has been identified in this case. Impact craters, such as the Kellwasser-aged [[Alamo bolide impact|Alamo]] and the Hangenberg-aged [[Woodleigh crater|Woodleigh]], cannot generally be dated with sufficient precision to link them to the event; others dated precisely are not contemporaneous with the extinction.&lt;ref name="Racki, 2005"/&gt; Although some minor features of meteoric impact have been observed in places (iridium anomalies and microspherules), these were probably caused by other factors.&lt;ref name=Algeo1995/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang K, Attrep M, Orth CJ |date=December 2017 |title=Global iridium anomaly, mass extinction, and redox change at the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary |journal=Geology |volume=21 |pages=1071–1074 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021&lt;1071:giamea&gt;2.3.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant evolution===
During the Devonian, land plants underwent a hugely significant phase of evolution. Their maximum height went from 30&amp;nbsp;cm at the start of the Devonian, to 30 m&lt;ref&gt;Archaeopterids, see Beck (1981) in Algeo 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=incomplete|date=January 2015}} at the end of the period. This increase in height was made possible by the evolution of advanced vascular systems, which permitted the growth of complex branching and rooting systems.&lt;ref name=Algeo1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Algeo, T.J.|year=1998|title=Terrestrial-marine teleconnections in the Devonian: links between the evolution of land plants, weathering processes, and marine anoxic events|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=353|issue=1365|pages=113–130|doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0195|last2=Scheckler|first2=S. E.|pmc=1692181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this, the development of seeds permitted reproduction and dispersal in areas which were not waterlogged, allowing plants to colonise previously inhospitable inland and upland areas.&lt;ref name=Algeo1998/&gt; The two factors combined to greatly magnify the role of plants on the global scale. In particular, ''[[Archaeopteris]]'' forests expanded rapidly during the closing stages of the Devonian.

====Effect on weathering====
These tall trees required deep rooting systems to acquire water and nutrients, and provide anchorage. These systems broke up the upper layers of bedrock and stabilised a deep layer of soil, which would have been of the order of metres thick. In contrast, early Devonian plants bore only rhizoids and rhizomes that could penetrate no more than a few centimetres. The mobilisation of a large portion of soil had a huge effect: soil promotes [[weathering]], the chemical breakdown of rocks, releasing ions which are nutrients for plants and algae.&lt;ref name=Algeo1998/&gt; The relatively sudden input of nutrients into river water may have caused [[eutrophication]] and subsequent anoxia. For example, during an algal bloom, organic material formed at the surface can sink at such a rate that decomposing organisms use up all available oxygen by decaying them, creating anoxic conditions and suffocating bottom-dwelling fish. The fossil reefs of the Frasnian were dominated by stromatolites and (to a lesser degree) corals—organisms which only thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Therefore, the postulated influx of high levels of nutrients may have caused an extinction, just as phosphate run-off from Australian farmers is causing immeasurable damage to the Great Barrier Reef today.&lt;ref name=Algeo1998/&gt; Anoxic conditions correlate better with biotic crises than phases of cooling, suggesting anoxia may have played the dominant role in extinction.&lt;ref name=Algeo1995&gt;{{cite journal|author=Algeo, T.J.|author2=Berner, R.A. |author3=Maynard, J.B. |author4=Scheckler, S.E. |author5= Archives, G.S.A.T. |year=1995|title=Late Devonian Oceanic Anoxic Events and Biotic Crises: "Rooted" in the Evolution of Vascular Land Plants?|journal=GSA Today|volume=5|issue=3|url=ftp://rock.geosociety.org/pub/GSAToday/gt9503.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect on {{CO2}}====
The "greening" of the continents occurred during the Devonian. The covering of the planet's continents with massive photosynthesizing land plants in the first forests may have reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the atmosphere. Since {{co2}} is a greenhouse gas, reduced levels might have helped produce a chillier climate. Evidence such as glacial deposits in northern Brazil (near the Devonian South Pole) suggests widespread glaciation at the end of the Devonian, as a broad continental mass covered the polar region. A cause of the extinctions may have been an episode of global cooling, following the mild climate of the Devonian period. The Hangenberg event has also been linked to glaciation in the tropics equivalent to that of the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]].&lt;ref name="Brezinski et al. 2009"/&gt;

The weathering of silicate rocks also draws down CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. This acted together with the burial of organic matter to decrease atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations from about 15 to three times present levels. Carbon in the form of plant matter would be produced on prodigious scales, and given the right conditions, could be stored and buried, eventually producing vast coal measures (e.g. in China) which locked the carbon out of the atmosphere and into the [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Carbon locked in Devonian coal, the earliest of Earth's coal deposits, is currently being returned to the atmosphere.&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction in atmospheric {{co2}} would have caused global cooling and resulted in at least one period of late Devonian glaciation (and subsequent sea level fall),&lt;ref&gt;(Caputo 1985; Berner 1992, 1994) in Algeo 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=incomplete|date=January 2015}} probably fluctuating in intensity alongside the 40ka [[Milankovic cycle]]. The continued drawdown of organic carbon eventually pulled the Earth out of its [[Greenhouse Earth]] state into the Icehouse that continued throughout the Carboniferous and Permian.

=== Magmatism ===

[[Magmatism]] was suggested as a cause of the Late Devonian extinction in 2002.&lt;ref name=Krav2002&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kravchinsky, V.A., K.M. Konstantinov, V. Courtillot, J.-P. Valet, J.I. Savrasov, S.D. Cherniy, S.G. Mishenin, B.S.

The end of the Devonian Period was a time of extremely widespread trap magmatism and rifting in the Russian and Siberian platforms, which were situated above the hot mantle plumes and suggested as a cause of the Frasnian / Famennian and end-Devonian extinctions.&lt;ref name=Krav2012&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kravchinsky |first=V. A. |year=2012 |title=Paleozoic large igneous provinces of Northern Eurasia: Correlation with mass extinction events |journal=Global and Planetary Change |volume=86–87 |pages=31–36 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818112000082 |doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.01.007 |bibcode=2012GPC....86...31K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Viluy and Pripyat-Dniepr-Donets large igneous provinces were suggested to correlate with the Frasnian / Famennian extinction and the Kola and Timan-Pechora magmatism was suggested to correspond to the end Devonian-Carboniferous extinction.&lt;ref name=Krav2012/&gt;

Most recently, scientists have confirmed a correlation between Viluy traps (in the [[Vilyuysk]] region) on the [[Siberian Craton]] and the Kellwasser extinction by Ar/Ar dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Preliminary dating of the Viluy traps (Eastern Siberia): Eruption at the time of Late Devonian extinction events? |authors=Courtillot, V. et al. |year=2010 |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters  |volume=102 |pages=29–59 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2010.06.004 |bibcode=2010ESRv..102...29K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar and K–Ar ages of the Viluy traps (Eastern Siberia): Further evidence for a relationship with the Frasnian–Famennian mass extinction |authors=Ricci, J. et al. |year=2013 |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=386 |pages=531–540 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Viluy Large igneous province covers most of the present day north-eastern margin of the Siberian Platform. The triple-junction rift system was formed during the Devonian Period; the Viluy rift is the western remaining branch of the system and two other branches form the modern margin of the Siberian Platform. Volcanic rocks are covered with post Late Devonian–Early Carboniferous sediments.&lt;ref name=Kuz2010&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kuzmin, M.I., Yarmolyuk, V.V., Kravchinsky, V.A. |year=2010 |title=Phanerozoic hot spot traces and paleogeographic reconstructions of the Siberian continent based on interaction with the African large low shear velocity province |journal=GEarth-Science Reviews |volume=148 |pages=1–33 |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825210000681 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2010.06.004 |bibcode=2010ESRv..102...29K}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Volcanic rocks, [[Dike (geology)|dyke belts]], and [[Sill (geology)|sills]] that cover more than 320&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a gigantic amount of magmatic material (more than 1000&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) formed in the Viluy branch.&lt;ref name=Kuz2010/&gt;

Ages show{{clarification needed|date=September 2018}} that the two volcanic phase hypotheses are well supported and the weighted mean ages of each volcanic phase are 376.7&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;3.4 and 364.4&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;3.4&amp;nbsp;Ma or 373.4&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;2.1 and 363.2&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;2.0&amp;nbsp;Ma, which the first volcanic phase is in agreement with the age of 372.2&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;3.2&amp;nbsp;Ma proposed for the Kellwasser event.

=== Other suggestions ===

Other mechanisms put forward to explain the extinctions include [[tectonic]]-driven [[climate change]], sea-level change, and oceanic overturning{{clarify|date=March 2017}}. These have all been discounted because they are unable to explain the duration, selectivity, and periodicity of the extinctions.&lt;ref name=Algeo1995/&gt;

'''MV ''Fairwind'' (MSL 251)''' was an Australian [[120ft Motor Lighter|Motor Stores Lighter]] wrecked off the [[New South Wales]] coast in 1950. MSL 251 and her sister ship, MSL 252 (later {{HMAS|Paluma|1945|6}}), were built by [[Tulloch Limited|Tulloch's Pty Ltd]] for the [[Australian Army]]. Completed in September 1946, the vessel was loaned to the Department of External Affairs and used for fishery surveys by the [[Papua and New Guinea Administration]]. The Department renamed the vessel MV ''Fairwind''.&lt;ref name=fishrock&gt;{{Cite web |last=Siviero |first=Damien |title=Wreck of the Fairwind found near South West Rocks |publisher=Fishrock.com |date= |url=http://fishrock.com.au/wreck-of-fairwind.html |accessdate=1 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831022600/http://fishrock.com.au/wreck-of-fairwind.html |archivedate=31 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Beatification|Blessed]] Maria Cristina of Savoy''' (Maria Cristina Carlotta Giuseppa Gaetana Efisia; 14 November 1812 – 21 January 1836) was the first [[Queen consort]] of [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]]. She died as a result of childbirth.

==Family==
Maria Cristina was the youngest daughter of King [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia]] and [[Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este (1773-1832)|Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este]].

Her maternal grandparents were [[Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este]] and [[Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este]]. Ferdinand was the fourteenth child and third son born to [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. Maria Beatrice was the eldest daughter of [[Ercole III d'Este]] and [[Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina]], [[Duchy of Massa and Carrara|Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara]].

==Queen==
[[File:Maria cristina of savoy.jpg|thumb|left|Maria Cristina as queen]]

On 21 November 1832, Maria Cristina married [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies]]. The bride was twenty years old and the groom twenty-two.

Maria Cristina was described as beautiful but also timid and shy: modest and reserved, she was never comfortable at the royal court. Her relationship to Ferdinand was not happy, and he had little patience for her nervous modesty.

She died at the age of 23, after having given birth 5 days before to her only child, [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]].

On 10 July 1872 she was declared to be a Servant of God, on 6 May 1937 a Venerable Servant of God, and on 3 May 2013 Pope Francis authorised a decree recognising a miracle due to her intercession, a further stage on her process to beatification.&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Information Service press release, [http://visnews-en.blogspot.com/2013/05/promulgation-of-decrees-by-congregation.html 3 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Her beatification took place on 25 January 2014 at the [[Basilica of Santa Chiara (Naples)]], where she is buried, making her Blessed Maria Cristina of Savoy.

==Plot==

Twenty-six-year-old Louisa Clark lives with her working-class family. Unambitious and with few qualifications, she feels constantly outshone by her younger sister, Treena, an outgoing single mother. Louisa, who helps support her family, loses her job at a local café when the café closes. She goes to the Job Centre and, after several failed attempts, is offered a unique employment opportunity: help care for Will Traynor, a successful, wealthy, and once-active young man who developed [[tetraplegia|quadriplegia]] in a pedestrian-motorcycle accident two years earlier. Will's mother, Camilla, hires Louisa despite her lack of experience, believing Louisa can brighten his spirit. Louisa meets Nathan, who cares for Will's medical needs, and Will's father, Steven, a friendly upper-class businessman whose marriage to Camilla is strained.

Louisa and Will's relationship starts out rocky due to his bitterness and resentment over being disabled. Things worsen after Will's ex-girlfriend, Alicia, and best friend Rupert reveal that they are getting married. Under Louisa's care, Will gradually becomes more communicative and open-minded as they share experiences together. Louisa notices Will's scarred wrists and later overhears his mother and sister discussing how he attempted suicide shortly after Camilla refused his request to end his life through [[Dignitas (Swiss non-profit organisation)|Dignitas]], a Swiss-based assisted suicide organisation. Horrified by his attempt, Camilla promised to honour her son's wish, but only if he agreed to live six more months. Camilla intends to prove that, in time, he will believe his life's worth living.

Louisa conceals knowing about Will and Camilla's agreement. However, she tells Treena, and together they devise ways that will help convince Will to abandon his death wish. Over the next few weeks, Will loosens up and lets Louisa shave his beard and cut his shaggy hair. Louisa begins taking Will on outings and the two grow closer.

Through their frequent talks, Louisa learns that Will has travelled extensively; his favourite place is a café in Paris. Noticing how limited her life is and that she has few ambitions, Will tries to motivate Louisa to change.

Louisa continues seeing her longtime boyfriend of 6 years, Patrick, though they eventually break up due to her relationship with Will. Meanwhile, Louisa's father loses his job, causing more financial difficulties. Mr. Traynor offers Mr. Clark a position. Louisa realises that Will is trying to help her secure her freedom from her family. The two attend Alicia and Rupert's wedding where they dance and flirt. Will tells Louisa that she is the only reason he wakes in the morning.

Louisa convinces Will to go on a holiday with her, but before they can leave, Will contracts near-fatal pneumonia. Louisa cancels the plans for a whirlwind trip. Instead, she takes Will to the island of [[Mauritius]]. The night before returning home, Louisa tells Will that she loves him. Will says he wants to confide something, but she admits that she already knows about his plans with Dignitas. Will says their time together has been special, but he cannot bear to live in a wheelchair. He will be following through with his plans. Angry and hurt, Louisa storms off and does not speak to him for the remainder of the trip. When they return home, Will's parents are pleasantly surprised by his good physical condition. Louisa, however, resigns as his caretaker, and they understand that Will intends to end his life.

On the night of Will's flight to Switzerland, Louisa visits him one last time. They agree that the past six months have been the best in their lives. He dies shortly after in the clinic, and it is revealed that he left Louisa a considerable inheritance, meant to continue her education and to fully experience life. The novel ends with Louisa at a café in Paris, reading Will's last words to her in a letter, that tell her to 'live well'.

'''Microchimerism''' is the presence of a small number of cells that originate from another individual and are therefore genetically distinct from the cells of the host individual. This phenomenon may be related to certain types of [[autoimmune diseases]]; however, the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are unclear.

In humans (and perhaps in all [[placentals]]), the most common form is '''fetomaternal microchimerism''' (also known as ''fetal cell microchimerism'' or ''fetal chimerism'') whereby cells from a [[fetus]] pass through the [[placenta]] and establish cell lineages within the mother. Fetal cells have been documented to persist and multiply in the mother for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=DW|author2=Zickwold GK |author3=Weil GJ |author4=Sylvester S |author5=DeMaria MA. |title=Male fetal progenitor cells persist in maternal blood for as long as 27 years postpartum|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|year=1996|volume=93|pages=705–708|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.2.705|pmc=40117|issue=2|pmid=8570620}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Evans PC, Lambert N, Maloney S, Furst DE, Moore JM, Nelson JL | title=Long-term fetal microchimerism in peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets in healthy women and women with scleroderma| journal=Blood | year=1999 | pages=2033–2037 | volume=93|pmid= 10068676|issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact [[phenotype]] of these cells is unknown, although several different cell types have been identified, such as various immune lineages, [[mesenchymal stem cells]], and placental-derived cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pritchard |first=Stephanie |author2=Wick HC |author3=Slonim DK |author4=Johnson KL |author5=Bianchi DW |title=Comprehensive analysis of genes expressed by rare microchimeric fetal cells in the maternal mouse lung |journal=Biology of Reproduction |date=August 2012 |volume=87 |pages=42 |pmid=22674387 |url=http://www.biolreprod.org/content/87/2/42.long |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204002/http://www.biolreprod.org/content/87/2/42.long |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-23 |issue=2 |doi=10.1095/biolreprod.112.101147 |pmc=3431427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], Seattle, has detected cells with the [[Y chromosome]] in multiple areas of the brains of deceased women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in the human female brain|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0045592|pmid=23049819|pages=e45592|pmc=3458919|vauthors=Chan WF, Gurnot C, Montine TJ, Sonnen JA, Guthrie KA, Nelson JL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetomaternal microchimerism occurs during pregnancy and shortly after giving birth for most women. However, not all women who have had children contain fetal cells. Studies suggest that fetomaternal microchimerism could be influenced by killer-cell immunoglobin-like (KIR) [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]].&lt;ref name="fetomaternal microchimerism" /&gt; [[Lymphocytes]] also influence the development of persisting fetomaternal microchimerism since [[natural killer cells]] compose about 70% of lymphocytes in the first trimester of pregnancy. KIR patterns on maternal natural killer cells of the mother and KIR ligands on the fetal cells could have an effect on fetomaternal microchimerism. In one study, mothers with KIR2DS1 exhibited higher levels of fetomaternal microchimerism compared to mothers who were negative for this activating KIR.&lt;ref name="fetomaternal microchimerism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruchen|first1=Anne|last2=Stahl|first2=Tanja|last3=Gieseke|first3=Friederike|last4=Binder|first4=Thomas|last5=Oezcan|first5=Zakir|last6=Meisel|first6=Roland|last7=Kreyenberg|first7=Hermann|last8=Bader|first8=Peter|last9=Gruhn|first9=Bernd|last10=Greil|first10=Johann|last11=Pfeieffer|first11=Matthias|last12=Doering|first12=Michaela|last13=Handgretinger|first13=Rupert|last14=Fehse|first14=Boris|last15=Mueller|first15=Ingo|title=Fetomaternal Microchimerism Is Associated with Better Outcome in Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|journal=Blood|date=2014|volume=124|issue=21|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/124/21/1242.abstract?sso-checked=true|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential health consequences of these cells are unknown. One hypothesis is that these fetal cells might trigger a [[Graft-versus-host disease|graft-versus-host reaction]] leading to [[autoimmune disease]]. This offers a potential explanation for why many autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in middle-aged women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=JL|title=Maternal-fetal immunology and autoimmune disease: is some autoimmune disease auto-alloimmune or allo-autoimmune?|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=1996|volume=39|issue=2|pages=191–194|doi=10.1002/art.1780390203|pmid=8849367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that fetal cells home to injured or diseased maternal tissue where they act as [[stem cells]] and participate in repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khosrotehrani|first=K|author2=Johnson KL |author3=Cha DH |author4=Salomon RN |author5=Bianchi DW |title=Transfer of fetal cells with multilineage potential to maternal tissue|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|year=2004|volume=292|pages=75–80|doi=10.1001/jama.292.1.75|pmid=15238593|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nguyen Huu|first=S|last2=Oster |first2=M |last3=Avril |first3=MF |last4=Boitier |first4=F |last5=Mortier |first5=L |last6=Richard |first6=MA |last7=Kerob |first7=D |last8=Maubec |first8=E |last9=Souteyrand |first9=P |last10=Moguelet |first10=P |last11=Khosrotehrani |first11=K |last12=Aractingi |first12=S |title=Fetal microchimeric cells participate in tumour angiogenesis in melanomas occurring during pregnancy|journal=Am J Cardiovasc Pathol|year=2009|volume=174|issue=2|pages=630–637|doi=10.2353/ajpath.2009.080566|pmc=2630570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that the fetal cells are merely innocent bystanders and have no effect on maternal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=KL|author2=Bianchi DW|title=Fetal cells in maternal tissue following pregnancy: what are the consequences?|journal=Hum Reprod Update|year=2004|volume=10|issue=6|pages=497–502|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh040|pmid=15319378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, about 50–75% of women carry fetal immune cell lines. Maternal immune cells are also found in the offspring yielding in '''maternal→fetal microchimerism''', though this phenomenon is about half as frequent as the former.&lt;ref name="labinvest"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loubičre LS, Lambert NC, Flinn LJ, Erickson TD, Yan Z, Guthrie KA, etal | title=Maternal microchimerism in healthy adults in lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages and NK cells| journal= Lab Invest | year=2006| volume=86 | pages=1185–92|pmid= 16969370|issue= 11|doi= 10.1038/labinvest.3700471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microchimerism had also been shown to exist after [[blood transfusion]]s to a severely [[immunocompromised]] population of patients who suffered [[Physical trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Reed W, Lee TH, Norris PJ, Utter GH, Busch MP | title=Transfusion-associated microchimerism: a new complication of blood transfusions in severely injured patients| journal=Seminars in Hematology | year=2007 | pages=24–31 | volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1053/j.seminhematol.2006.09.012 | pmid=17198844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible sources of microchimerism include [[gestation]],&lt;ref&gt;Shree, Raj, et al. "Fetal Microchimerism by Mode of Delivery in Healthy Term Gestations." ''REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES''. Vol. 24. 2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; an individual's older sibling, twin sibling, or vanished twin, with the cells being received in utero. Fetal-maternal microchimerism is especially prevalent after abortion or miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The influence of fetal loss on the presence of fetal cell microchimerism: a systematic review|first1=Kiarash|last1=Khosrotehrani|first2=Kirby L.|last2=Johnson|first3=Joseph|last3=Lau|first4=Alain|last4=Dupuy|first5=Dong Hyun|last5=Cha|first6=Diana W.|last6=Bianchi|date=1 November 2003|journal=Arthritis Rheum.|volume=48|issue=11|pages=3237–3241|doi=10.1002/art.11324|pmid=14613289}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that unprotected intercourse with ejaculation may be another source of microchimerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Male microchimerism in women without sons: quantitative assessment and correlation with pregnancy history|first1=Zhen|last1=Yan|first2=Nathalie C.|last2=Lambert|first3=Katherine A.|last3=Guthrie|first4=Allison J.|last4=Porter|first5=Laurence S.|last5=Loubiere|first6=Margaret M.|last6=Madeleine|first7=Anne M.|last7=Stevens|first8=Heidi M.|last8=Hermes|first9=J.

===Animal===
Microchimerism occurs in most pairs of twins in [[cattle]]. In cattle (and other [[Bovinae|bovine]]s), the [[placenta]]e of fraternal twins usually fuse and the twins share blood circulation, resulting in exchange of cell lines.  If the twins are a male-female pair, the male hormones from the bull calf have the effect of partially masculinising the heifer (female), creating a ''martin heifer'' or ''[[freemartin]]''.  Freemartins appear female, but are infertile and so cannot be used for breeding or [[dairy farming|dairy production]].  Microchimerism provides a method of diagnosing the condition, because male genetic material can be detected in a blood sample.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theriojournal.com/article/0093-691X(95)00039-B/abstract A. Fujishiro, K. Kawakura, Y-I. Miyake, Y. Kaneda, "A fast, convenient diagnosis of the bovine freemartin syndrome using polymerase chain reaction", ''Theriogenology'', '''43''' (5), pp 883–891 (1 April 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with autoimmune diseases and breast cancer==
Microchimerism has been implicated in autoimmune diseases. Independent studies repeatedly suggested that microchimeric cells of fetal origin may be involved in the [[pathogenesis]] of [[systemic sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Artlett CM, Smith JB, Jimenez SA | title=Identification of fetal DNA and cells in skin lesions from women with systemic sclerosis| journal=New England Journal of Medicine| year=1998 | pages=1186–1196|issue= 17|pmid= 9554859 | volume=338|doi= 10.1056/NEJM199804233381704 | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/17/1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, microchimeric cells of maternal origin may be involved in the pathogenesis of a group of autoimmune diseases found in children, i.e. juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (one example would be [[juvenile dermatomyositis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Artlett CM, Ramos R, Jimenez SA, Patterson K, Miller FW, Rider LG | title=Chimeric cells of maternal origin in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Childhood Myositis Heterogeneity Collaborative Group| journal=Lancet| year=2000 | pages=2155–2156 | volume=356|doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03499-1|pmid= 11191545|issue= 9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microchimerism has now been further implicated in other autoimmune diseases, including [[Lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson KL, McAlindon TE, Mulcahy E, Bianchi DW | title=Microchimerism in a female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus| journal=Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism| year=2001 | pages=2107–2111 | volume=44|doi= 10.1002/1529-0131(200109)44:9&lt;2107::AID-ART361&gt;3.0.CO;2-9 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/85512936/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|issue= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, an alternative hypothesis on the role of microchimeric cells in lesions is that they may be facilitating tissue repair of the damaged organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Gilliam AC | title=Microchimerism and skin disease: true-true unrelated?| journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology | year=2006 | pages=239–241 | volume=126|doi= 10.1038/sj.jid.5700061|pmid= 16418731|issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, fetal immune cells have also been frequently found in breast cancer stroma as compared to samples taken from healthy women. It is not clear, however, whether fetal cell lines promote the development of tumors or, contrarily, protect women from developing breast carcinoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gadi VK, Nelson JL | title=Fetal microchimerism in women with breast cancer| journal=Cancer Research | year=2007| pages=9035–9038 | volume=67|doi= 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4209|pmid= 17909006|issue= 19 | url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/67/19/9035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dubernard G, etal | title=Breast cancer stroma frequently recruits fetal derived cells during pregnancy| journal=Breast Cancer Research | year=2008| pages=R14 | volume=10|doi= 10.1186/bcr1860|pmid= 18271969|issue= 1|pmc= 2374970 | url=http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/10/1/R14#B38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic lupus erythematosus===

The presence of fetal cells in mothers can be associated with benefits when it comes to certain autoimmune diseases. In particular, male fetal cells are related to helping mothers with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. When kidney biopsies were taken from patients with lupus nephritis, DNA was extracted and run with [[PCR]]. The male fetal DNA was quantified and the presence of specific Y chromosome sequences were found. Women with lupus nephritis containing male fetal cells in their kidney biopsies exhibited better [[renal system]] functioning. Levels of [[serum creatinine]], which is related to kidney failure, were low in mothers with high levels of male fetal cells.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt; In contrast, women without male fetal cells who had lupus nephritis showed a more serious form of [[glomerulonephritis]] and higher levels of serum creatinine.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florim|first1=Greiciane|last2=Cardas|first2=Helosia|last3=de Melo|first3=Julio|last4=Baptista|first4=Maria Alice|last5=Fernandes|first5=Ida|last6=Savoldi-Barbosa|first6=Marcela|last7=Goldman|first7=Gustavo|last8=Abbud-Filho|first8=Mario|title=Fetal microchimerism in kidney biopsies of lupus nephritis patients may be associated with a beneficial effect|journal=Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy|volume=17|date=15 April 2015|url=https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-015-0615-4|accessdate=3 December 2016|doi=10.1186/s13075-015-0615-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific role that fetal cells play in microchimerism related to certain autoimmune diseases is not fully understood. However, one hypothesis states that these cells supply [[antigens]], causing inflammation and triggering the release of different foreign antigens.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt; This would trigger autoimmune disease instead of serving as a therapeutic. A different hypothesis states that fetal microchimeric cells are involved in repairing tissues. When tissues get inflamed, fetal microchimeric cells go to the damaged site and aid in repair and regeneration of the tissue.&lt;ref name="systemic lupus" /&gt;

===Thyroid disease===

Fetal maternal microchimerism may be related to autoimmune thyroid diseases. There have been reports of fetal cells in the lining of the blood and thyroid glands of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. These cells could become activated after delivery of the baby after immune suppression in the mother is lost, suggesting a role of fetal cells in the pathogenesis of such diseases.&lt;ref name="thyroid" /&gt; Two types of thyroid disease, [[Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis]] (HT) and [[Graves Disease|Graves’ Disease]] (GD) show similarities to [[graft vs host disease]] which occurs after [[hematopoietic stem cell]] transplants. Fetal cells colonize maternal tissues like the thyroid gland and are able to survive many years postpartum. These fetal microchimeric cells in the thyroid show up in the blood of women affected by thyroid diseases.&lt;ref name="thyroid"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lepez |first1=Trees |last2=Vandewoestyne |first2=Mado |last3=Deforce |first3=Dieter |title=Fetal microchimeric cells in autoimmune thyroid diseases |journal=Chimerism |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=111–118 |date=20 May 2013 |doi=10.4161/chim.25055 |pmc=3921191 |pmid=23723083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stem cells==

===Animal models===

Fetomaternal microchimerism has been shown in experimental investigations of whether fetal cells can cross the blood brain barrier in mice. The properties of these cells allow them to cross the blood brain barrier and target injured brain tissue.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt; This mechanism is possible because [[umbilical cord]] blood cells express some proteins similar to [[neurons]]. When these umbilical cord blood cells are injected in rats with brain injury or stroke, they enter the brain and express certain nerve cell markers. Due to this process, fetal cells could enter the brain during pregnancy and become differentiated into neural cells. Fetal microchimerism can occur in the maternal mouse brain, responding to certain cues in the maternal body.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Xiao-Wei|last2=Liao|first2=Hong|last3=Sun|first3=Li|last4=Okabe|first4=Masaru|last5=Xiao|first5=Zhi-Cheng|last6=Dawe|first6=Gavin|title=Fetal Microchimerism in the Maternal Mouse Brain: A Novel Population of Fetal Progenitor or Stem Cells Able to Cross the Blood–Brain Barrier?|journal=Stem Cells|date=1 November 2005|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1443–1452|doi=10.1634/stemcells.2004-0169|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1634/stemcells.2004-0169/full|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health implications==

Fetal microchimerism could have an implication on maternal health. Isolating cells in cultures can alter the properties of the stem cells, but in pregnancy the effects of fetal stem cells can be investigated without in vitro cultures. Once characterized and isolated, fetal cells that are able to cross the blood brain barrier could impact certain procedures.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt; For example, isolating stem cells can be accomplished through taking them from sources like the umbilical cord. These fetal stem cells can be used in intravenous infusion to repair the brain tissue. Hormonal changes in pregnancy alter neurogenesis, which could create favorable environments for fetal cells to respond to injury.&lt;ref name="stem cells (mice)" /&gt;

The true function on fetal cells in mothers is not fully known, however, there have been reports of positive and negative health effects. The sharing of genes between the fetus and mother may lead to benefits. Due to not all genes being shared, health complications may arise as a result of resource allocation.&lt;ref name="maternal health" /&gt; During pregnancy, fetal cells are able to manipulate the maternal system to draw resources from the placenta, while the maternal system tries to limit it.&lt;ref name="maternal health"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boddy|first1=Amy|last2=Fortunato|first2=Angelo|last3=Wilson Sayres|first3=Melissa|title=Fetal microchimerism and maternal health: A review and evolutionary analysis of cooperation and conflict beyond the womb|journal=BioEssays|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1106–18|date=28 August 2015|doi=10.1002/bies.201500059|pmid=26316378|pmc=4712643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''midwife''' is a [[health professional]] specializing in [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], [[postpartum]], women's sexual and [[reproductive health]] (including annual [[gynecology|gynecological]] exams, [[family planning]], [[menopausal]] care and others), and newborn care.&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Essential Competencies"/&gt; Their education and training in [[midwifery]] equips them to recognise the variations of normal progress of labor, and understand how to deal with deviations from normal. They may intervene in high risk situations such as [[breech birth]]s, [[twin birth]]s and births where the baby is in a [[Presentation (obstetrics)|posterior position]], using non-invasive techniques. When a pregnant woman requires care beyond the midwife's [[scope of practice]], they refer women to [[obstetricians]] or [[Maternal-fetal medicine|perinatologists]], who are [[medical specialist]]s in complications related to pregnancy and birth, including surgical and instrumental deliveries.&lt;ref name="business-being-born"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/movies/09born.html|title=The Business of Being Born (film)|last=Epstein|first=Abby|accessdate=30 October 2009|work=The New York Times|date=9 January 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213155538/http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/movies/09born.html|archivedate=13 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Midwifery around the World: A study in the role of midwives in local communities and healthcare systems|last=Carson|first=A|date=May–June-2016|website=annals of global health|publisher=Elsevier Inc|doi=10.1016/j.aogh.2016.04.617|volume=82|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many parts of the world, these professions work in tandem to provide care to childbearing women. In others, only the midwife is available to provide care, and in yet other countries many women elect to utilize obstetricians primarily over midwives.

Many [[developing countries]] are investing money and training for midwives as these services are needed all over the world. Some [[primary care]] services are currently lacking due to the shortage of money being funded for these resources.

According to the definition of the [[International Confederation of Midwives]], which has also been adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]]:&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt;

{{quote|A midwife is a person who has successfully completed a [[midwifery]] education programme that is recognised in the country where it is located and that is based on the ICM Essential Competencies for Basic Midwifery Practice&lt;ref name="Essential Competencies"/&gt; and the framework of the ICM Global Standards for Midwifery Education;&lt;ref name="Global Standards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://internationalmidwives.org/what-we-do/education-coredocuments/global-standards-education/ | title=Global Standards for Basic Midwifery Education | publisher=International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) | accessdate=2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925091426/http://internationalmidwives.org/what-we-do/education-coredocuments/global-standards-education/ | archivedate=25 September 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who has acquired the requisite qualifications to be registered and/or legally licensed to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title ‘midwife’; and who demonstrates competency in the practice of [[midwifery]].}}

The word derives from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:mid#Old English|mid]]'', "with" and ''[[wikt:wif#Old English|wif]]'', "woman", and thus originally meant "with-woman", that is, the person who is ''with'' the ''mother'' (woman) at childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= midwife|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118259|publisher=The Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Midwife: Word History|url= https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=midwife|publisher= The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition.

The midwife is recognised as a responsible and accountable professional who works in partnership with women to give the necessary support, care and advice during pregnancy, labour and the postpartum period, to conduct births on the midwife’s own responsibility and to provide care for the newborn and the infant. This care includes preventative measures, the promotion of normal birth, the detection of complications in mother and child, the accessing of medical
care or other appropriate assistance and the carrying out of emergency measures.

The midwife has an important task in health counselling and education, not only for the woman, but also within the family and the community. This work should involve antenatal education and preparation for parenthood and may extend to women’s health, sexual or reproductive health and child care.

A midwife may practise in any setting including the home, community, hospitals, clinics or health units.&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt;

===Australia===
'''Education, training and regulation'''

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programs are three-year full-time university programs leading to a bachelor's degree in midwifery (Bachelor of Midwifery) with additional one-year full-time programs leading to an honours bachelor's degree in midwifery (Bachelor of Midwifery (Honours)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahpra.gov.au/Education/Approved-Programs-of-Study.aspx |title=Approved Programs of Study |publisher=Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526032729/http://www.ahpra.gov.au/Education/Approved-Programs-of-Study.aspx |archivedate=26 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The postgraduate midwifery programs (for registered midwives) lead to master's degrees in midwifery (Master in Midwifery, Master in Midwifery (Research), MSc Midwifery). There are also postgraduate midwifery programs (for registered nurses who wish to become midwives) leading to a bachelor's degree or equivalent qualification in midwifery (Bachelor of Midwifery, Graduate Diploma in Midwifery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midwivesaustralia.com.au/?page_id=224 |title=Becoming a Midwife |publisher=Midwives Australia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605072655/http://www.midwivesaustralia.com.au/?page_id=224 |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives in Australia must be registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency in order to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title 'midwife' or 'registered midwife'.

'''Practice'''

Midwives work in a number of settings including hospitals, birthing centres, community centres and women’s homes. They may be employed by health services or organisations, or self-employed as privately practising midwives. All midwives are expected to work within a defined scope of practice and conform to ongoing regulatory requirements that ensure they are safe and autonomous practitioners.

===Canada===


Midwifery was reintroduced as a regulated profession in most of [[Canada]]'s ten provinces in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schroff |first=F. |year=1997 |title=The New Midwifery |location=Toronto |publisher=Women's Press |isbn=0-88961-224-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this legalization, some midwives had practiced in a legal "grey area" in some provinces.&lt;ref name="sask"&gt;[https://www.saskatchewanmidwives.com/midwifery-in-saskatchewan/ Midwifery in Saskatchewan], Midwives Association of Saskatchewan&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, a midwife in BC was charged with practicing without a medical license.&lt;ref name="mic"&gt;[https://www.lawnow.org/midwifery-canada/ Midwifery in Canada], Law Now&lt;/ref&gt;

After several decades of intensive political [[lobbying]] by midwives and consumers, fully integrated, regulated and publicly funded [[midwifery]] is now part of the health system in the provinces of [[British Columbia]] (regulated since 1995), [[Alberta]] (regulated since 2000, fully funded since 2009) [[Saskatchewan]] (regulated since 1999), [[Manitoba]] (regulated since 1997), [[Ontario]] (regulated since 1991), [[Quebec]] (regulated since 1999), and [[Nova Scotia]] (regulated since 2006), and in the [[Northwest Territories]] (regulated since 2003) and [[Nunavut]](regulated since 2008).&lt;ref name="mic"/&gt;  In 2010, Midwifery legislation was proclaimed in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Only [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Yukon]] have no legislation in place for the practice of [[midwifery]].&lt;ref name="mic"/&gt;

====Education, training and regulation====

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programs are four-year full-time university programs leading to bachelor's degrees in midwifery (B.H.Sc. in Midwifery, Bachelor of Midwifery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianmidwives.org/midwifery-education.html |title=Midwifery Education in Canada |publisher=Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121150504/http://www.canadianmidwives.org/midwifery-education.html |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In British Columbia, the program is offered at the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwifery.ubc.ca|title=Home - Midwifery Program|author=|date=|website=www.midwifery.ubc.ca|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307230944/https://midwifery.ubc.ca/|archivedate=7 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta offers a Bachelor of Midwifery program. In Ontario, the Midwifery Education Program (MEP) is offered by a consortium of [[McMaster University]], [[Ryerson University]] and [[Laurentian University]]. In Manitoba the program is offered by [[University College of the North]]. In [[Quebec]], the program is offered at the [[Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières]]. In northern Quebec and Nunavut, Inuit women are being educated to be midwives in their own communities.{{fact|date=June 2018}} 

There are also "bridging programs" for internationally educated midwives at [[Ryerson University]] in Ontario and at the University of British Columbia.  A federally funded pilot project called the Multi-jurisdictional Midwifery Bridging Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwiferybridging.ca |title=midwiferybridging.ca |publisher=midwiferybridging.ca |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been offered in [[Western Canada]] in the past, but funding was discontinued when they expanded their midwifery program.  A new program was reinstated through the University of British Columbia in 2016 called the Internationally Educated Midwives Bridging Program IEMBP.

Midwives in Canada must be registered, after a process of assessment by the provincial regulatory bodies, in order to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title 'midwife',  'registered midwife' or, the French-language equivalent, 'sage femme'.

====Practice====

From the original 'alternative' style of [[midwifery]] in the 1960s and 1970s, [[midwifery]] practice is offered in a variety of ways within regulated provinces: midwives offer continuity of care within small group practices, choice of birthplace, and a focus on the woman as the primary decision-maker in her maternity care. When women or their newborns experience complications, midwives will work in consultation with an appropriate specialist. Registered midwives have access to appropriate diagnostics like blood tests and ultrasounds and can prescribe some medications. Founding principles of the Canadian model of [[midwifery]] include informed choice, choice of birthplace, continuity of care from a small group of midwives and respect for the woman as the primary decision maker. Midwives typically have hospital privileges and support women's right to choose where she will have her baby.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The legal recognition of [[midwifery]] has brought midwives into the mainstream of [[health care in Canada|health care]] with universal funding for services, hospital privileges, rights to prescribe medications commonly needed during pregnancy, birth and postpartum, and rights to order blood work and ultrasounds for their own clients and full consultation access to physicians. To protect the tenets of [[midwifery]] and support midwives to provide woman-centered care, the regulatory bodies and [[Professional body|professional associations]] have legislation and standards in place to provide protection, particularly for choice of birth [[home birth|place]], informed choice and continuity of care. All regulated midwives have malpractice insurance. Any unregulated person who provides care with 'restricted acts' in regulated provinces or territories is practicing [[midwifery]] without a license and is subject to investigation and prosecution.

Prior to legislative changes, very few Canadian women had access to [[midwifery]] care, in part because it was not funded by the [[health care system]]. Legalizing [[midwifery]] has made midwifery services available to a wide and diverse population of women and in many communities the number of available midwives does not meet the growing demand for services. [[Midwifery]] services are free to women living in provinces and territories with regulated [[midwifery]].

The national professional associations in Canada is the Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianmidwives.org/ |title=Canadian Association of Midwives (CAM) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109174414/http://www.canadianmidwives.org/ |archivedate=9 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====

On 16 March 1995, the BC government announced the approval of regulations governing [[midwifery]] and establishing the College of Midwives of BC. In 1996, the Health Professional Council released a draft of Bylaws for the College of Midwives of BC which received Cabinet approval on 13 April 1997. In 1998, midwives were officially registered with the College of Midwives of BC.&lt;ref name="cmbc.bc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmbc.bc.ca |title=cmbc.bc.ca |publisher=cmbc.bc.ca |date=1 January 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917090243/http://www.cmbc.bc.ca/ |archivedate=17 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In BC, midwives are primary care providers for women in all stages of pregnancy, from prenatal to six weeks postpartum. Midwives also care for newborns. To see the approximate proportion of women whose primary birth attendant was a midwife in British Columbia see, "What Mothers Say: The Canadian Maternity Experiences Survey. Public Health Agency of Canada. Ottawa, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/rhs-ssg/pdf/survey-eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610144203/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/rhs-ssg/pdf/survey-eng.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives in BC can deliver natural births in hospitals or homes. If a complication arises in a pregnancy, labour, birth or postpartum, a midwife will consult with a specialist such as an obstetrician or paediatrician.
Core competencies and restricted activities are included in the BC Health Professions Act Midwives Regulation.
As of April 2009, the scope of practice for midwives allows them to prescribe certain prescription drugs, use acupuncture for pain relief, assist a surgeon in a caesarean section delivery and to perform a vacuum extraction delivery. These specialized practices require additional education and certification.

As of November 2015, the College of Midwives of British Columbia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmbc.bc.ca/pdf.shtml?List-of-Registrants|title=Register of Current &amp; Former Registrants |publisher=College of Midwives of British Columbia |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported  247 General, 2 Temporary, 46 Non-practicing Registrant midwives. There were 2 midwives per 100,000 people in BC in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Institute for Health Information document titled, Number of Health Personnel in Selected Professions by Registration Status, 2006. This data has the following proviso, "Due to the variation in regulatory requirements, interprofessional comparison should be interpreted with caution."&lt;/ref&gt;

A midwife must be registered with the College of Midwives of BC in order to practice. To continue licensure midwives must maintain regular recertification in neonatal resuscitation and management of maternal emergencies, maintain the minimum volume of clinical care (40 women), participate in peer case reviews and continuing education activities.&lt;ref name="cmbc.bc.ca"/&gt;

The University of British Columbia (UBC) has a four-year Bachelor of Midwifery program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwifery.ubc.ca/midwifery.htm|title=Home - Midwifery Program|author=|date=|website=www.midwifery.ubc.ca|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UBC [[midwifery]] program is poised to double in size thanks to an increase in government funding. Graduation of students will increase to 20 per year.

In terms of proffesional associations, BC has both the College of Midwives of BC&lt;ref name="cmbc.bc.ca"/&gt; and the Midwives Association of BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcmidwives.com |title=bcmidwives.com |publisher=bcmidwives.com |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021021749/http://www.bcmidwives.com/ |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mozambique ===
When a 16-year civil war ended in 1992, Mozambique's health care system was devastated and one in ten women were dying in childbirth. There were only 18 [[obstetrician]]s for a population of 19 million. In 2004, Mozambique introduced a new health care initiative to train midwives in emergency obstetric care in an attempt to guarantee access to quality medical care during pregnancy and childbirth. The newly introduced midwives system now perform major surgeries including [[Cesareans]] and [[hysterectomies]]. 

As the figures now stand, Mozambique is one of the few countries on track to achieve the [[United Nations Millennium Development Goal|MDG]] of reducing the maternal death rate by 75% by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/birth-of-a-surgeon/introduction/747/ PBS documentary ''Birth of a Surgeon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225081550/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/birth-of-a-surgeon/introduction/747/ |date=25 December 2014 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
'''Education, training and regulation'''

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programs are four-year full-time university programs leading to a bachelor's degree in midwifery (HBO-bachelor Verloskunde).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knov.nl/samenwerken/tekstpagina/489/midwifery-in-the-netherlands/|publisher=The Royal Dutch Organisation of Midwives (KNOV): |title=Midwifery in the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four colleges for midwifery in the Netherlands: in Amsterdam, Groningen, Rotterdam and Maastricht. Midwives are called ''vroedvrouw'' (knowledge woman), ''vroedmeester'' (knowledge master, male), or ''verloskundige'' (deliverance experts) in Dutch.

Midwives are independent specialists in physiologic birth. In the Netherlands, home birth is still a common practice, although rates have been declining during the past decades. Between 2005-2008, 29% of babies were delivered at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/gezondheid-welzijn/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2009/2009-2696-wm.htm?Languageswitch=on|publisher=CVZ, Central Bureau of Statistics|title=Fewer women give birth at home|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001075455/http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/gezondheid-welzijn/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2009/2009-2696-wm.htm?Languageswitch=on|archivedate=1 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure fell to 23% delivered at home between 2007-2010 according to [[Midwifery]] in the Netherlands, a 2012 pamphlet by The Royal Dutch Organization for Midwives.&lt;ref name="The Royal Dutch Organization of Midwives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Midwifery in the Netherlands |url=http://www.knov.nl/docs/uploads/Midwifery_in_The__Netherlands__20120730__groot.pdf |publisher=(KNOV)|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 it has dropped further to 13.4%.[https://assets.perined.nl/docs/353d9249-9875-4cb3-9c86-f078ae3f7aef.pdf perined.nl/jaarboek2104.pdf].

Midwives are generally organized as private practices, some of those are hospital-based. In-hospital outpatient childbirth is available in most hospitals. In this case, a woman's own midwife delivers the baby at the delivery room of a hospital, without intervention of an obstetrician. In all settings, midwives will transfer care to an obstetrician in case of a complicated childbirth or need for emergency intervention.

Apart from childbirth and immediate postpartum care, midwives are the first line of care in pregnancy control and education of mothers-to-be. Typical information that is given to mothers includes information about food, alcohol, life style, travel, hobbies, sex, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verloskundigestadspraktijk.nl/ |language=Dutch |publisher= |title=Obstetric Practice in the City of Groningen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[midwifery]] practices give additional care in the form of preconceptional care and help with fertility problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchmidwife.com/voor-zwangeren/zwanger-worden/kinderwensspreekuur/|language=Dutch|title=Preconceptional care|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113201201/http://www.dutchmidwife.com/voor-zwangeren/zwanger-worden/kinderwensspreekuur/|archivedate=13 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All care by midwives is legal and it is totally reimbursed by all insurance companies. This includes prenatal care, childbirth (by midwives or obstetricians, at home or in the hospital), as well as postpartum/postnatal care for mother and baby at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expatarrivals.com/article/having-a-baby-in-the-netherlands |title=Having a baby in the Netherlands |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010084408/http://www.expatarrivals.com/article/having-a-baby-in-the-netherlands |archivedate=10 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvz.nl/zorgpakket  |publisher=CVZ, College for Healthcare Insurances |title=Care package}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midwifery]] is a regulated profession with no connection to Nursing.  Midwifery is a profession with a distinct body of knowledge and its own scope of practice, code of ethics and standards of practice. The midwifery profession has knowledge, skills and abilities to provide a primary complete maternity service to childbearing women on its own responsibility.

'''Education, training and regulation'''

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programmes are three-year full-time (three trimesters per year) tertiary programmes leading to a bachelor's degree in midwifery (Bachelor of Midwifery or Bachelor of Health Science (Midwifery)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.midwife.org.nz/education/where-to-start-becoming-a-midwife |title=Where to Start... Becoming a Midwife |publisher=New Zealand College of Midwives |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121185138/https://www.midwife.org.nz/education/where-to-start-becoming-a-midwife |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These programmes are offered by [[Otago Polytechnic]] in Dunedin, [[Ara Institute of Canterbury]] (formally CPIT) in Christchurch, [[Waikato Institute of Technology]] in Hamilton and [[Auckland University of Technology]] (AUT) in Auckland. Several schools have satellite programmes such as Otago with a programme in Southland, Wanaka, Wellington, Palmerston North, Wanganui, and Wairarapa - and AUT with student cohorts in various sites in the upper North Island.&lt;ref name="New Zealand College of Midwives"/&gt; The postgraduate midwifery programmes (for registered midwives) lead to postgraduate degrees or equivalent qualifications in midwifery (Postgraduate Certificate in Midwifery, Postgraduate Diploma in Midwifery, Master of Midwifery, PhD Professional Doctorate).

The Midwifery First Year of Practice Programme (MFYP) is a compulsory national programme for all New Zealand registered midwifery graduates, irrespective of work setting. The New Zealand College of Midwives (the NZCOM) is contracted by the funder, Health Workforce New Zealand (HWNZ), to provide the programme nationally in accordance with the programme specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Midwifery First Year of Practice Programme |url= https://www.midwife.org.nz/quality-practice/midwifery-first-year-of-practice/ |publisher= New Zealand College of Midwives |accessdate= 2015 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180128211540/https://www.midwife.org.nz/quality-practice/midwifery-first-year-of-practice |archivedate= 28 January 2018 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives in New Zealand must be registered with the  Midwifery Council of New Zealand in order to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title 'midwife'.

'''Practice'''

Women may choose a midwife, a [[General practitioner|General Practitioner]] or an Obstetrician to provide their maternity care. About 78 percent choose a midwife (8 percent GP, 8 percent Obstetrician, 6 percent unknown).&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Health Information Service: "Report on Maternity - Maternal and Newborn Information 2003."&lt;/ref&gt; Midwives provide maternity care from early pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum. The [[midwifery]] scope of practise covers normal pregnancy and birth. The midwife will either consult or transfer care where there is a departure from a normal pregnancy. Antenatal care is normally provided in clinics, and postnatal care is initially provided in the woman’s home. Birth can be in the home, a primary birthing unit, or a hospital. [[Midwifery]] care is fully funded by the Government.  (GP care may be fully funded. Private obstetric care will incur a fee in addition to the government funding.)

Increase in midwifery education has led to advances in impoverished countries. In [[Somalia]], 1 in 14 women die while giving birth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/features/2013/somalia_skilled_birth_attendants/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Midwives at heart of Somalia’s new reproductive health strategy|website=www.who.int|access-date=2016-12-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220190840/http://www.who.int/features/2013/somalia_skilled_birth_attendants/en/|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior reproductive and maternal health adviser at UNFPA, Achu Lordfred claims, “the severe shortage of skilled health personnel with obstetric and midwifery skills means the most have their babies delivered by traditional birth attendants. But, when complications arise, these women either die or develop debilitating conditions, such as obstetric fistula, or lose their babies.” UNFPA is striving to change these odds by opening seven midwifery schools and training 125 midwives so far.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/91/11/13-021113/en/|title=WHO {{!}} More midwives needed to improve maternal and newborn survival|website=www.who.int|access-date=2016-11-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104754/http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/91/11/13-021113/en/|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
'''Education, training and regulation'''

The undergraduate [[midwifery]] programs are three-year full-time university programs leading to honours bachelor's degrees in midwifery: BSc (Hons) Midwifery, Bachelor of Midwifery (Hons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmc.org.uk/education/becoming-a-nurse-or-midwife/becoming-a-midwife/ |title=Becoming a midwife |publisher=The Nursing and Midwifery Council |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118040809/http://www.nmc.org.uk/education/becoming-a-nurse-or-midwife/becoming-a-midwife |archivedate=18 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The postgraduate midwifery programs (for registered midwives) lead to master's degrees in midwifery (MSc Midwifery, MSc Advanced Practice Midwifery). There are also undergraduate and postgraduate midwifery programs (for graduates with a relevant degree who wish to become midwives) leading to degrees or equivalent qualifications in midwifery (BSc (Hons) Midwifery, Bachelor of Midwifery (Hons), Graduate Diploma in Midwifery, Postgraduate Diploma in Midwifery, MSc Midwifery).
[[Midwifery]] training consists of classroom-based learning provided by select universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://studentmidwife.net/tobe/universities.330/|title=Midwifery Universities in the UK|author=|date=|website=studentmidwife.net|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032348/https://studentmidwife.net/tobe/universities.330/|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with hospital- and community-based training placements at [[NHS Trusts]].

[[Midwifery]] students do not pay tuition fees and are eligible for additional financial support while training. Funding varies depending on which country within the UK the student is located in: students are eligible for NHS bursaries in addition to a grant of 1,000 pounds a year, and neither has to be repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/Typesoffinance/DG_171537 |title=Student Finance, Loans and Universities - GOV.UK |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date=1 September 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003032953/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/UniversityAndHigherEducation/StudentFinance/Typesoffinance/DG_171537 |archivedate=3 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortened-course students, who are already registered adult nurses, have different funding arrangements, are employed by the local NHS Trust via the Strategic Health Authority (SHA), and are paid salaries. This varies between universities and SHAs, with some students being paid their pre-training salaries, while others are employed as a Band 5 and still others are paid a proportion of a Band 5 salary.

Midwives must be registered with the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] in order to practice [[midwifery]] and use the title 'midwife' or 'registered midwife', and must also have a Supervisor of Midwives through their local supervising authority.

'''Practice'''

Midwives are practitioners in their own right in the [[United Kingdom]].  They take responsibility for the [[antenatal]], [[childbirth|intrapartum]] and [[postnatal]] care of women up until 28 days after the birth, or as required thereafter. Midwives are the lead [[Health profession|health care professional]] attending the majority of births, whether at home, in a midwife-led unit or in a hospital (although most births in the UK occur in hospitals).

In December 2014 the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] updated its guidance regarding where women should give birth. The new guidance states that midwife-led units are safer than hospitals for women having straightforward (low risk) pregnancies. Its updated guidance also confirms that home birth is as safe as birth in a midwife-led unit or a traditional labour ward for the babies of low-risk pregnant women who have already had at least one child previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/midwife-care-during-labour-safest-women-straightforward-pregnancies|title=NICE confirms midwife-led care during labour is safest for women with straightforward pregnancies|author=|date=|website=nice.org.uk|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105213256/https://www.nice.org.uk/news/press-and-media/midwife-care-during-labour-safest-women-straightforward-pregnancies|archivedate=5 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intrapartum Care"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg190/evidence/cg190-intrapartum-care-full-guideline3 |title=Care of Healthy Women and Their Babies During Childbirth |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |work=National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health |date=December 2014 |accessdate=21 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212090530/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg190/evidence/cg190-intrapartum-care-full-guideline3 |archivedate=12 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many midwives also work in the community. The role of community midwives includes making initial appointments with pregnant women, managing [[clinic]]s, undertaking postnatal care in the home and attending [[home birth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcm.org.uk/college/your-career/students/student-life-e-newsletter/student-life-october-2010/career-profile-community-midwife/?locale=en |title=Career Profile: Community Midwife - Royal College of Midwives |publisher=Rcm.org.uk |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101022138/http://www.rcm.org.uk/college/your-career/students/student-life-e-newsletter/student-life-october-2010/career-profile-community-midwife/?locale=en |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A community midwife typically has a pager, is responsible for a particular area and can be contacted by ambulance control when needed.  Sometimes they are paged to help out in a hospital when there are insufficient midwives available.

Most midwives work within the [[National Health Service]], providing both hospital and community care, but a significant proportion work independently, providing total care for their clients within a community setting. However, recent government proposals to require insurance for all health professionals is threatening independent [[midwifery]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6435279.stm |title=Threat to Independent Midwifery |publisher=BBC News |date=10 March 2007 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408062448/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6435279.stm |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives are at all times responsible for the women they are caring for. They must know when to refer complications to medical staff, act as the women's advocate, and ensure that mothers retain choice and control over [[childbirth]].

Most practising midwives in the United Kingdom are female: men account for less than 0.5 per cent of midwives on the register of the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|NMC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmc-uk.org/Documents/Statistical%20analysis%20of%20the%20register/NMC-Statistical-analysis-of-the-register-202006-202007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Practice'''

Midwives work with women and their families in many settings. They generally support and encourage [[natural childbirth]] in all practice settings. Laws regarding who can practice [[midwifery]] and in what circumstances vary from state to state. Many states have [[birthing center]]s where a midwife may work individually or as a group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.birthcenters.org/open-abc/bc-regs.php |title=Birth Center Regulations &amp;#124; American Association of Birth Centers |publisher=Birthcenters.org |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides additional clinical opportunities for student midwives.

CPMs provide on-going care throughout pregnancy and continuous, hands-on care during labor, birth and the immediate postpartum period. They practice as autonomous health professionals working in a network of relationships with other maternity care professionals who can provide consultation and collaboration when needed. Although qualified to practice in any setting, they have particular expertise in providing care in homes and free-standing birth centers, and own or work in over half of the birth centers in the U.S. today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nacpm.org/about-cpms/professional-standards/scope-of-practice/ |title=CMP Scope of Practice |publisher=National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM) |accessdate=21 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805140052/http://nacpm.org/about-cpms/professional-standards/scope-of-practice/ |archivedate=5 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nacpm.org/about-cpms/who-are-cpms/ |title=Who are CPMs |publisher=National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM) |accessdate=21 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220081826/http://nacpm.org/about-cpms/who-are-cpms/ |archivedate=20 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNMs and CMs work in a variety of settings including private practices, hospitals, birth centers, health clinics, and home birth services. They supervise not only pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period care for women and their newborns, but also provide gynecological care for all women and have autonomy and prescriptive authority in most states. They manage women's healthcare from puberty through post-menopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwife.org/Our-Scope-of-Practice|title=Our Scope of Practice|author=|date=|website=www.midwife.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029042700/http://midwife.org/Our-Scope-of-Practice|archivedate=29 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With appropriate training, they can also first assist in cesarean (operative) deliveries and perform limited ultrasound examinations.

== Men in midwifery ==
[[File:Jordmor jim- oslo.jpeg|thumb|A male midwife in [[Oslo, Norway]]]]

Men rarely practice midwifery for cultural and historical reasons. In ancient Greece, midwives were required by law to have given birth themselves, which prevented men from joining their ranks. In 17th century Europe, some [[barber surgeons]], all of whom were male, specialized in births, especially births requiring the use of surgical instruments. This eventually developed into a professional split, with women serving as midwives and men becoming [[obstetricians]]. Men who work as midwives are called ''midwives'' (or ''male midwives'', if it is necessary to identify them further) or ''accoucheurs''; the term ''midhusband'' (based on a misunderstanding of the etymology of ''midwife'') is occasionally encountered, mostly as a joke. In previous centuries, they were called ''man-midwives'' in English.&lt;ref name="Pilkenton 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Midwifery: A career for men in nursing |last = Pilkenton |first = Deanna |last2 = Schorn|first2 = Mavis N |date = February 2008 |journal = Men In Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Smellie]] is credited with innovations on the shape of [[forceps]]. This invention corresponds with the development towards obstetrics. He advised male midwives to wear dresses in order to reduce controversy over having a man present at birth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Midwifery: A Career for Men in Nursing|journal=Men in Nursing Journal|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 21st century, most developed countries allow men to train as midwives. However, it remains very rare. In the United Kingdom, even after the passing of the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Royal College of Midwives]] barred men from the profession until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11202075/No-job-for-a-man-Meet-the-male-midwives.html|title=No job for a man?

In the US, there remain a small, stable or minimally declining number of male midwives with full scope training (CNMs/CMs), comprising approximately 1% of the membership of the [[American College of Nurse-Midwives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midwife.org/ACNM/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000001720/CoreDataSurvey_2010_one-pager.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nursing.vanderbilt.edu/msn/pdf/nmw_midwiferyformen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320052445/https://nursing.vanderbilt.edu/msn/pdf/nmw_midwiferyformen.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Southeast Asian cultures, some or even most of the traditional midwives are men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rosemary |last=Gianno |title='Women are not brave enough' Semelai male midwives in the context of Southeast Asian cultures |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |volume=160 |issue=1 |year=2004 |pages=31–71 |jstor=27868101 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7926">'''Morrnah Nalamaku Simeona''' (May 19, 1913 – February 11, 1992) was recognized as a ''kahuna lapa{{okina}}au'' (healer) in Hawai{{okina}}i and taught her updated version of [[Hoʻoponopono|ho{{okina}}oponopono]] throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe.

==Kahuna lapa{{okina}}au==
Morrnah was born May 19, 1913, in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], to Kimokeo and Lilia Simeona, both native Hawaiians.&lt;ref&gt;Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Fifteenth Census (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Lilia, was one of the last recognized ''kahuna la{{okina}}au kahea'' or priest who heals with words.&lt;ref&gt;Rodman, Julius Scammon, ''The Kahuna Sorcerers of Hawaii, Past and Present'', p. 195 (Exposition, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Morrnah was a practitioner of [[lomilomi massage]] and for 10 years owned and operated health spas at the Kahala Hilton and Royal Hawaiian hotels.&lt;ref&gt;''Morrnah Simeona, kahuna lapa{{okina}}au'', Honolulu Advertiser, p. C4 (Feb. 17, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Among her massage clients at the Hilton spa were [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Jackie Kennedy]], and [[Arnold Palmer]].&lt;ref&gt;Dye, Bob, ''Hawai{{okina}}i Chronicles II: Contemporary Island History from the Pages of Honolulu Magazine'', p. 298-301 (Pitzer, Pat, ''Kahuna, The Keepers of the Secrets'', Nov. 1984), University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press (1997) {{ISBN|0-8248-1984-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, she was recognized as a ''[[kahuna]] lapa{{okina}}au'' (healer) and honored as a "[[Living Treasure of Hawai'i]]" by the [[Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawai'i]].&lt;ref&gt;''Five persons are named as Living Treasures'', Honolulu Star Bulletin (Feb. 12, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ho{{okina}}oponopono==
{{main|Ho'oponopono}}
In 1976 she began to modify the traditional Hawaiian forgiveness and reconciliation process of ho{{okina}}oponopono to the realities of the modern day. Her version of ho{{okina}}oponopono was influenced by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China, and [[Edgar Cayce]]. The combination of Hawaiian traditions, praying to the Divine Creator, and connecting problems with [[Reincarnation]] and [[Karma]] resulted in a unique new problem solving process, that was self-help rather than the traditional Hawaiian group process. She had no qualms about adapting traditional concepts to contemporary applications, though she was criticized by some Hawaiian purists. "Her system uses ho{{okina}}oponopono techniques to create a working partnership among the three parts of the mind or self, which she calls by Hawaiian names, as well as by the terms subconscious, conscious, and superconscious."&lt;ref name="Dye Bob, Pitzer Pat"&gt;Dye Bob, Pitzer Pat&lt;/ref&gt; 

She presented trainings and lectures on ho{{okina}}oponopono to the [[United Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;Chai, Makana Risser, ''Na Mo{{okina}}olelo Lomilomi: The Traditions of Hawaiian Massage &amp; Healing'', p. 47, Bishop Museum Press (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-58178-046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in nearly a dozen states in the U.S., and in more than 14 countries, among them Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Russia, and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka, ''In Memory of Morrnah Nalamaku Simeona'', Congressional Record, Proceedings and Debates of the 102d Congress, Second Session, Vol. 138, No. 43 (March 25, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; She presented to schools of higher learning, such as the University of Hawai{{okina}}i and [[Johns Hopkins University]], to medical facilities, religious institutions and business organizations. In 1982 she organized the ''First World Symposium of Identity of Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Nadine W., ''Kahuna to Explore the Ancient Ways'', Honolulu Star Bulletin (July, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter noted: "There was something very calming and soothing about Simeona's presence and her voice, a sense of serenity about her, as she talks about teaching people how to relieve stress and attain peace of mind."&lt;ref name="Dye Bob, Pitzer Pat"/&gt;

To spread her ho{{okina}}oponopono process, she founded Pacifica Seminars in the 1970s and in 1980 The Foundation of ‘I’, Inc. (Freedom of the Cosmos). In 1990, she started Pacifica Seminars in Germany. Simeona wrote three textbooks ''Self-Identity through Ho{{okina}}oponopono, Basic 1'' (128 pg), ''Basic 2'' (to use after two years of practicing) and ''Basic 3'' (to use after five years). The recommended waiting times for Basic 2 and 3 was for developing deep respect for the "Divine presence." In 1990, the English original of ''Basic 1'', 8th edition, was officially translated and printed in German and French.&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, Morrnah, ''Selbst-Identität durch Ho{{okina}}oponopono'', 128 pg, Pacifica Seminars (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simeona, Morrnah, ''L'Identité de Soi-Même par Ho{{okina}}oponopono'', 128 pg, Pacifica Seminars (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

In late fall 1990, her last journey for lectures and seminars took her through Europe to Jerusalem. On January 16, 1991, she came back to Germany, where she lived quietly at a friend's house in Kirchheim, near [[Munich]], until her death on February 11, 1992.

== Statue of Freedom ==
[[File:Emancipation-Hall 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Statue of Freedom'''s plaster model cast now resides in the [[Capitol Visitor Center]]]]
On March 25, 1992, U. S. Senator [[Daniel Akaka]] (D - Hawaii), eulogized Simeona in the [[Congressional Record]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Akaka"&gt;Daniel Akaka&lt;/ref&gt; He noted she had learned that the original plaster cast of the cast-iron Statue of Freedom, which stands on the top of the dome of the [[United States Capitol]], was being kept in storage. She raised $25,000 to refurbish and restore it, and as a result it was moved and placed on display in the Russell Senate Office Building (now in the [[Capitol Visitor Center]]) where, Akaka said, it would serve as a remembrance of Simeona.&lt;ref name="Daniel Akaka"/&gt;

PC '''Sharon Beshenivsky''' (14 January 1967 – 18 November 2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Sharon Beshenivsky info], findmypast.co.uk; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[West Yorkshire Police]] [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|constable]] shot dead by a criminal gang during a robbery in [[Bradford]] on 18 November 2005, becoming the seventh female police officer in Great Britain to be killed on duty. Another police officer, PC Teresa Millburn, was also shot in the incident, being seriously injured but surviving. Millburn had joined the force less than two years earlier; Beshenivsky had served only nine months in the force at the time of her death.

[[Closed-circuit television camera]]s tracked a car rushing from the scene and used an [[automatic number plate recognition]] system to trace its owners. This led to six suspects being arrested; three were later convicted of murder, robbery and firearms offences; two of [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]], robbery and firearms offences; and one of robbery. A seventh suspect remains at large.

==Background==
Beshenivsky had been serving as a police officer for nine months. She had previously been a [[police community support officer]] (collar #268)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMAJQ1_PC_Sharon_Beshenivsky_memorial_at_City_Hall_Memorial_Garden_Bradford_UK Sharon Beshenivsky memorial at City Hall Memorial Garden], waymarking.com; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with West Yorkshire Police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sharon-beshenivsky.gonetoosoon.org Profile], sharon-beshenivsky.gonetoosoon.org; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Having been a constable for just nine months, she was classed as a probationer under the supervision of an experienced colleague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/5402094.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Shot policewoman 'loved by all'|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
On the afternoon of 18 November 2005, Beshenivsky and Millburn responded to reports that an attack alarm had been activated at a travel agent on Morley Street in [[Bradford]]. Upon arrival the officers encountered three men who had robbed the agent of £5,405; two were armed with a gun, another with a knife. One of the gunmen fired at them immediately at point-blank range, fatally wounding Beshenivsky in the chest and also hitting Millburn in the chest, before all three men made a getaway in a convoy of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-life-and-death-of-pc-sharon-beshenivsky-516152.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=The life and death of PC Sharon Beshenivsky | date=20 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beshenivsky was the seventh female officer to die in the line of duty in England and Wales, the second female officer to be fatally shot (the first was [[Murder of Yvonne Fletcher|Yvonne Fletcher]] in [[London]] in 1984), and the first female officer to die in an 'ordinary' gun crime (Fletcher was shot during a protest at the Libyan embassy in London).

She had three children and two stepchildren, and died on her youngest daughter's fourth birthday. Beshenivsky's funeral took place on 6 January 2006 at [[Bradford Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/4598286.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=City remembers murdered officer | date=11 January 2006 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests==
On 25 November 2005, police named [[Somalia|Somali]] brothers Mustaf Jama, aged 25, and Yusaf Jama, aged 19, as well as 24-year-old Muzzaker Imtiaz Shah as prime suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4470286.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Police name Pc shooting suspects | date=25 November 2005 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yusaf Jama was arrested in [[Birmingham]] the following day and was subsequently charged with murder and robbery. On 12 December 2005, Shah was arrested in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], South Wales; he was later also charged with Beshenivsky's murder. Mustaf Jama had fled to Somalia but was extradited two years later. The use of recently installed [[automatic number plate recognition]] technology in Bradford city centre played a vital role in identifying the suspects prior to their arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/4455918.stm | work=BBC News | title=CCTV network tracks 'getaway' car | date=21 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convictions===
On 18 December 2006, Yusuf Jama was found guilty of all charges against him, including the murder of Sharon Beshenivsky. He was sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|life imprisonment]] with a minimum term of 35 years. This was expected to keep Yusuf Jama imprisoned until at least 2040 and the age of 60.

Muzzaker Shah was also sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 35 years, which was also expected to keep him in prison until at least 2040 and the age of 60.

Faisal Razzaq, a 25-year-old from London, was cleared of murder but found guilty of [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]]. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 11 years before being considered for parole. This was expected to keep him imprisoned until at least 2017 and the age of 36. He had driven the lead car of the gang's convoy from Leeds to Bradford and acted as a lookout during the robbery.

On 2 March 2007, Hassan Razzaq, the 26-year-old brother of Faisal, was also convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He had also acted as a lookout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/6410633.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Beshenivsky killer gets 20 years | date=2 March 2007 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raza Ul-Haq Aslam was a third lookout and was sentenced to eight years in prison for a single robbery offence.

All of the suspects except Aslam were also found guilty of robbery and a series of firearms offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/6203517.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Pc murderers must serve 35 years | date=22 December 2006 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2007, Mustaf Jama was extradited from Somalia after an undercover Home Office operation and taken into police custody at Bridewell police station in [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/7073338.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Man in court on Pc murder charge | date=2 November 2007 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged the next day with the murder of Beshenivsky, appeared before Leeds magistrates, and was remanded into custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/7073338.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Man in court on Pc murder charge | date=2 November 2007 | accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Appeals===
Yusuf Jama and Muzzaker Shah appealed for their sentences to be reduced. The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] heard their appeals but agreed with the trial judge's recommended minimum term for both men and rejected the appeals. In November 2010, Mustaf Jama made an application for permission to appeal his sentence. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] rejected his application in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23936210-killer-of-police-officer-sharon-beshenivsky-loses-conviction-bid.do "Killer of police officer Sharon Beshenivsky loses bid to appeal conviction"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301202554/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23936210-killer-of-police-officer-sharon-beshenivsky-loses-conviction-bid.do |date=1 March 2012 }}, thisislondon.co.uk; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hewan Gordon was jailed for eighteen months in 2007 for helping Shah evade capture. In 2010 he won an appeal against a government bid to deport him back to Somalia. His appeal was understood to have been made on human rights grounds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8675618.PC_Sharon_Beshenivsky_s_widower_tells_of__upset__at_killer_s_appeal Hewan Gordon appeals deportation bid by UK government on human rights grounds], thetelegraphandargus.co.uk; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and drew heavy criticism from police, politicians and Beshenivsky's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2811038/Fury-as-Somali-who-hid-WPC-Sharon-Beshenivskys-killer-is-allowed-to-stay-in-UK.html|location=London, UK|work=The Sun|first1=Mike|last1=Sullivan|title=Somali who hid WPC Sharon's killer is allowed to stay in the UK|date=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unapprehended suspect===
The alleged mastermind of the robbery, Piran Ditta Khan, remains unapprehended. It has been reported that the 50-year-old fled to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.asianimage.co.uk/feeds/1089351.mastermind_hiding_in_village/ | work=Asian Image | title=Mastermind 'hiding in village' | date=22 December 2006 | accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reward of £20,000 has been offered for information leading to his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/files/docs/Wanted%20poster.pdf | work=West Yorkshire Police | title=Wanted – Piran Ditta Khan – 20,000 reward offered | date=18 November 2009 | accessdate=3 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/4744839.__20_000_bounty_on_last_suspect_for_murder_of_PC_Sharon/ | work=The Telegraph &amp; Argus | title=

In 2014 police renewed their appeal for information that might lead to Khan's arrest. Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson said: "This investigation is not yet complete and will not be until everyone involved in any way in the murder of PC Beshenivsky is brought to justice. We have not, and will not leave any stone unturned in our search for justice. The £20,000 reward on offer remains and I would like to take this opportunity to appeal again to the people of Pakistan or to anyone who knows where this man is to get in contact."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-murdered-cop-sharon-beshenivsky-4719895&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
In June 2007, Muzzaker Imtiaz Shah received an additional nine years to his sentence for firearms offences committed during a [[car chase]] in 2004.

In December 2007, Yusuf Jama was also convicted of conspiracy to rape and handed an additional twelve years to his sentence. The case related to the [[Types of rape#Gang rape|gang rape]] of a woman at a house party in Birmingham some days after Beshenivsky's murder.

In March 2008, both Shah and Yusuf Jama received a further four years imprisonment for [[Grievous bodily harm|wounding]] with intent after they stabbed another inmate at [[Frankland (HM Prison)|Frankland prison]] in [[Brasside]], County Durham.

Faisal Razzaq was handed an additional seven-and-a-half-year sentence in June 2007 for possessing prohibited firearms in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/sharon_beshenivsky_s_killers_long_sentences_for_a_crime_that_shocked_the_nation_1_2362386&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August 2006, the rugby league club [[Bradford Bulls]] made a presentation on the pitch at their home stadium during the half-time interval of a match with [[Castleford Tigers]], in Beshenivsky's honour. Her widower Paul, along with the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [[Colin Cramphorn]], were guests as Bradford Bulls chairman [[Peter Hood]] unveiled a [[memorial bench]] in her honour, which was to be placed in the club's reception area. On 8 May 2009, a memorial to Beshenivsky was unveiled at the location of her death. At the unveiling, then-Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] paid tribute to the officer's "dedication, professionalism and courage". [[Michael Winner]], chairman of the [[Police Memorial Trust]], also praised Beshenivsky and police officers across the country, saying: "Take them away and there's total anarchy and we are devoured by the forces of evil."

In November 2008, the far right [[British National Party]] was condemned for using the murder as an example of racially motivated crime in a piece of literature which was circulated to potential voters. Opponents of the party's policies were keen to point out that there was no obvious racial motive to the murder, and that the killers would obviously have killed anyone of any ethnic background who might have attempted to foil them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/3874331.BNP_condemned_for_Sharon_claims/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quality management''' ensures that an organization, product or service is consistent. It has four main components: quality [[planning]], [[quality assurance]], [[quality control]] and [[quality improvement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Kenneth H.|title=Project Quality Management: Why, What and How|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b5F08Z0QRosC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Quality+management+quality+planning+quality+control#v=onepage&amp;q=Quality%20management%20quality%20planning%20quality%20control&amp;f=false|date=July 2005|publisher=J. Ross Publishing|location=Fort Lauderdale, Florida|isbn=1-932159-48-7|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality management is focused not only on product and [[service quality]], but also on the means to achieve it. Quality management, therefore, uses quality assurance and control of processes as well as products to achieve more consistent [[Quality (business)|quality]].

==Evolution==
Quality management is a recent phenomenon but important for an organization. Civilizations that supported the arts and crafts allowed clients to choose goods meeting higher quality standards rather than normal goods. In societies where arts and crafts are the responsibility of master craftsmen or artists, these masters would lead their studios and train and supervise others. The importance of craftsmen diminished as mass production and repetitive work practices were instituted. The aim was to produce large numbers of the same goods. The first proponent in the US for this approach was [[Eli Whitney]] who proposed (interchangeable) parts manufacture for muskets, hence producing the identical components and creating a musket assembly line. The next step forward was promoted by several people including [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. He is sometimes called "the father of scientific management." He was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and part of his approach laid a further foundation for quality management, including aspects like standardization and adopting improved practices. [[Henry Ford]] was also important in bringing process and quality management practices into operation in his assembly lines. In Germany, [[Karl Benz]], often called the inventor of the motor car, was pursuing similar assembly and production practices, although real mass production was properly initiated in Volkswagen after World War II. From this period onwards, North American companies focused predominantly upon production against lower cost with increased efficiency.

[[Walter A. Shewhart]] made a major step in the evolution towards quality management by creating a method for quality control for production, using statistical methods, first proposed in 1924. This became the foundation for his ongoing work on statistical quality control. [[W. Edwards Deming]] later applied statistical process control methods in the United States during World War II, thereby successfully improving quality in the manufacture of munitions and other strategically important products.

Quality [[leadership]] from a national perspective has changed over the past decades. After the second world war, Japan decided to make quality improvement a national imperative as part of rebuilding their economy, and sought the help of [[Shewhart]], [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] and [[Joseph M. Juran|Juran]], amongst others. [[W. Edwards Deming]] championed Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. He is probably best known for his management philosophy establishing quality, productivity, and competitive position. He has formulated [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|14 points]] of attention for managers, which are a high level abstraction of many of his deep insights. They should be interpreted by learning and understanding the deeper insights. These [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|14 points]] include key concepts such as:
* Break down barriers between departments
* Management should learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership
* Supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job
* Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service
* Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement

In the 1950s and 1960s, Japanese goods were synonymous with cheapness and low quality, but over time their quality initiatives began to be successful, with Japan achieving high levels of quality in products from the 1970s onward. For example, Japanese cars regularly top the [[J.D. Power]] customer satisfaction ratings. In the 1980s Deming was asked by Ford Motor Company to start a quality initiative after they realized that they were falling behind Japanese manufacturers. A number of highly successful quality initiatives have been invented by the Japanese (see for example on this pages: [[Genichi Taguchi]], [[Quality function deployment|QFD]], [[Toyota Production System]]). Many of the methods not only provide techniques but also have associated quality culture (i.e. people factors). These methods are now adopted by the same western countries that decades earlier derided Japanese methods.

Customers recognize that quality is an important attribute in products and services. Suppliers recognize that quality can be an important differentiator between their own offerings and those of competitors (quality differentiation is also called the quality gap). In the past two decades this quality gap has been greatly reduced between competitive products and services. This is partly due to the contracting (also called outsourcing) of manufacture to countries like China and India, as well internationalization of trade and competition. These countries, among many others, have raised their own standards of quality in order to meet international standards and customer demands.&lt;ref name="HagertyBad13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/13/bad-news-for-u-s-industry-china-is-closing-the-quality-gap/ |title=Bad News for U.S. Industry: China is Closing the Quality Gap |author=Hagerty, J.R. |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010113532/http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/12/13/bad-news-for-u-s-industry-china-is-closing-the-quality-gap/ |archivedate=10 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShirouzuChina17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos/china-carmakers-narrow-quality-gap-on-global-rivals-report-idUSKCN1C30HY |title=China carmakers narrow quality gap on global rivals: Report |author=Shirouzu, N. |work=Reuters |date=28 September 2017 |accessdate=16 February 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217082449/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos/china-carmakers-narrow-quality-gap-on-global-rivals-report-idUSKCN1C30HY |archivedate=17 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ISO 9000]] series of standards are probably the best known International standards for quality management.

[[Customer satisfaction]] is the backbone of Quality Management. Setting up a million dollar company without taking care of needs of customer will ultimately decrease its [[revenue]]. 

There is a huge number of books available on quality management. Some themes have become more significant including quality culture, the importance of [[knowledge management]], and the role of leadership in promoting and achieving high quality. Disciplines like systems thinking are bringing more holistic approaches to quality so that people, process and products are considered together rather than independent factors in quality management.

The influence of quality thinking has spread to non-traditional applications outside of walls of manufacturing, extending into service sectors and into areas such as [[sales]], [[marketing]] and [[customer service]].&lt;ref name=Selden1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul H. Selden|date=December 1998|title='''Sales Process Engineering: An Emerging Quality Application'''|journal=Quality Progress|pages=59–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The International Standard for Quality management (ISO 9001:2015) adopts a number of management principles, that can be used by top management to guide their organizations towards improved performance.

===Customer focus===
The primary focus of quality management is to meet [[customer requirement]]s and to strive to exceed customer expectations.

'''Rationale'''

Sustained success is achieved when an organization attracts and retains the confidence of customers and other interested parties on whom it depends. Every aspect of customer interaction provides an opportunity to create more value for the customer. Understanding current and future needs of customers and other interested parties contributes to sustained success of an organization &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Customer focus|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Quality management principles|publisher=ISO quality|accessdate=29 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626105500/http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
Leaders at all levels establish unity of purpose and direction and create conditions in which people are engaged in achieving the organization’s quality objectives.

'''Rationale'''

Creation of unity of purpose and direction and engagement of people enable an organization to align its strategies, policies, processes and resources to achieve its objectives  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Quality management principles|publisher=ISO quality|accessdate=29 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626105500/http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engagement of people===
Competent, empowered and engaged people at all levels throughout the organization are essential to enhance its capability to create and deliver value.

'''Rationale'''

To manage an organization effectively and efficiently, it is important to involve all people at all levels and to respect them as individuals. Recognition, empowerment and enhancement of competence facilitate the engagement of people in achieving the organization’s
quality objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engagement of people|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Quality management principles|publisher=ISO quality|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119011631/http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process approach===
Consistent and predictable results are achieved more effectively and efficiently when activities are understood and managed as interrelated
processes that function as a coherent system.

'''Rationale'''

The quality management system consists of interrelated processes. Understanding how results are produced by this system enables an organization to optimize the system and its performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process approach|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Quality management principles|publisher=ISO quality|accessdate=29 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626105500/http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvement===
Successful organizations have an ongoing focus on improvement.

'''Rationale'''

Improvement is essential for an organization to maintain current levels of performance, to react to changes in its internal and external conditions and to create new opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Improvement|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Quality management principles|publisher=ISO quality|accessdate=29 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626105500/http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence based decision making===
{{see|decision making}}
Decisions based on the analysis and evaluation of data and information are more likely to produce desired results.

'''Rationale'''

Decision making can be a complex process, and it always involves some [[uncertainty]]. It often involves multiple types and sources of inputs, as well as their interpretation, which can be subjective. It is important to understand [[cause-and-effect]] relationships and potential [[unintended consequences]]. [[Fact]]s, [[evidence]] and [[data analysis]] lead to greater [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and confidence in decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence based decision making|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Quality management principles|publisher=ISO quality|accessdate=29 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626105500/http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship management ===
{{see|Relationship management}}
For sustained success, an organization manages its relationships with interested parties, such as [[Distribution (business)|supplier]]s, retailers.

'''Rationale'''

Interested parties influence the performance of an organizations and industry. Sustained success is more likely to be achieved when the organization manages relationships with all of its interested parties to optimize their impact on its performance. Relationship management with its supplier and partner networks is of particular importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Relationship management|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Quality management principles|publisher=ISO quality|accessdate=29 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626105500/http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The social scientist Bettina Warzecha (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/992993108|title=Problem with Quality Management Process orientation, controllability and zero-defect processes as modern myths|last=Bettina|first=Warzecha,|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9783981863833|location=Walsrode|pages=|oclc=992993108}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the central concepts of Quality Management (QM), such as e.g. process orientation, controllability, and zero defects as modern myths. She demonstrates that zero-error processes and the associated illusion of controllability involve the epistemological problem of self-referentiality. The emphasis on the processes in QM also ignores the artificiality and thus arbitrariness of the difference between structure and process. Above all, the complexity of management cannot be reduced to standardized (mathematical) procedures. According to her, the risks and negative side effects of QM are usually greater than the benefits (see also ''brand eins'', 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brandeins.de/archiv/2010/qualitaet/ungesunde-ordnung/|title=Ungesunde Ordnung - brand eins online|website=www.brandeins.de|language=de|access-date=2018-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108062539/https://www.brandeins.de/archiv/2010/qualitaet/ungesunde-ordnung/|archivedate=2018-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality improvement and more==

There are many methods for quality improvement. These cover product improvement, process improvement and people based improvement. In the following list are methods of quality management and techniques that incorporate and drive quality improvement:
# [[ISO 9004]]:2008 — guidelines for performance improvement.
# [http://www.lrqa.co.uk/standards-and-schemes/iso-9001/ ISO 9001]:2015 - a certified quality management system (QMS) for organisations who want to prove their ability to consistently provide products and services that meet the needs of their customers and other relevant stakeholders.&lt;ref name="LRQA"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 9001 Certification|url=http://www.lrqa.co.uk/standards-and-schemes/iso-9001/|website=ISO 9001 certification|publisher=Lloyd's register LRQA|accessdate=29 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626061945/http://www.lrqa.co.uk/standards-and-schemes/iso-9001/|archivedate=26 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[ISO 15504]]-4: 2005 — information technology — process assessment — Part 4: Guidance on use for process improvement and process capability determination.
# [[Quality function deployment|QFD]] — quality function deployment, also known as the house of quality approach.
# [[Kaizen]] — 改善, Japanese for change for the better; the common English term is ''continuous improvement''.
# Zero Defect Program — created by NEC Corporation of Japan, based upon [[statistical process control]] and one of the inputs for the inventors of Six Sigma.
# [[Six Sigma]] — 6σ, Six Sigma combines established methods such as statistical process control, [[design of experiments]] and [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)]] in an overall framework.
# [[PDCA]] — plan, do, check, act cycle for quality control purposes. (Six Sigma's [[DMAIC]] method (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) may be viewed as a particular implementation of this.)
# [[Quality circle]] — a group (people oriented) approach to improvement.
# [[Taguchi methods]] — statistical oriented methods including quality robustness, quality loss function, and target specifications.
# [[Toyota Production System|The Toyota Production System]] — reworked in the west into [[lean manufacturing]].
# [[Kansei Engineering]] — an approach that focuses on capturing customer emotional feedback about products to drive improvement.
# [[Total quality management|TQM]] — [[total quality management]] is a management strategy aimed at embedding awareness of quality in all organizational processes. First promoted in Japan with the Deming prize which was adopted and adapted in USA as the [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]] and in Europe as the [[European Foundation for Quality Management]] award (each with their own variations).
# [[TRIZ]] — meaning "theory of inventive problem solving"
# [[Business process reengineering|BPR]] — [[business process reengineering]], a management approach aiming at optimizing the workflows and processes within an organisation.
# OQRM — Object-oriented Quality and Risk Management, a model for quality and risk management.&lt;ref name="OQM"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Object Oriented Quality Management, a model for quality management.|publisher=Statistics Netherlands, The Hague|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/QAF_comments/Object%20Oriented%20Quality%20Management.pdf|date=2009-04-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215064737/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/QAF_comments/Object%20Oriented%20Quality%20Management.pdf|archivedate=2010-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Top-down and bottom-up design|Top Down &amp; Bottom Up Approaches]]—Leadership approaches to change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Greg L.|last2=Manges|first2=Kirstin A.|last3=Ward|first3=Marcia M.|title=Empowering Sustained Patient Safety|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00001786-201507000-00009|journal=Journal of Nursing Care Quality|volume=30|issue=3|pages=240–246|doi=10.1097/ncq.0000000000000103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of each approach have sought to improve them as well as apply them for small, medium and large gains. Simple one is Process Approach, which forms the basis of [[ISO 9001:2008]] Quality Management System standard, duly driven from the 'Eight principles of Quality management', process approach being one of them. Thareja&lt;ref&gt;http://ssrn.com/abstract=1488690 "Thareja"&lt;/ref&gt; writes about the mechanism and benefits: "The process (proficiency) may be limited in words, but not in its applicability. While it fulfills the criteria of all-round gains: in terms of the competencies augmented by the participants; the organisation seeks newer directions to the business success, the individual brand image of both the people and the organisation, in turn, goes up. The competencies which were hitherto rated as being smaller, are better recognized and now acclaimed to be more potent and fruitful".&lt;ref&gt;Thareja P(2008), "Total Quality Organization Thru’ People, Each one is Capable", FOUNDRY, Vol. XX, No. 4, July/Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The more complex Quality improvement tools are tailored for enterprise types not originally targeted. For example, Six Sigma was designed for manufacturing but has spread to service enterprises. Each of these approaches and methods has met with success but also with failures.

Some of the common differentiators between success and failure include commitment, knowledge and expertise to guide improvement, scope of change/improvement desired (Big Bang type changes tend to fail more often compared to smaller changes) and adaption to enterprise cultures. For example, quality circles do not work well in every enterprise (and are even discouraged by some managers), and relatively few TQM-participating enterprises have won the national quality awards.

There have been well publicized failures of BPR, as well as Six Sigma. Enterprises therefore need to consider carefully which quality improvement methods to adopt, and certainly should not adopt all those listed here.

It is important not to underestimate the people factors, such as culture, in selecting a quality improvement approach. Any improvement (change) takes time to implement, gain acceptance and stabilize as accepted practice. Improvement must allow pauses between implementing new changes so that the change is stabilized and assessed as a real improvement, before the next improvement is made (hence continual improvement, not continuous improvement).

Improvements that change the culture take longer as they have to overcome greater resistance to change. It is easier and often more effective to work within the existing cultural boundaries and make small improvements (that is '''Kaizen''') than to make major transformational changes. Use of Kaizen in Japan was a major reason for the creation of Japanese industrial and economic strength.

On the other hand, transformational change works best when an enterprise faces a crisis and needs to make major changes in order to survive. In Japan, the land of Kaizen, [[Carlos Ghosn]] led a transformational change at Nissan Motor Company which was in a financial and operational crisis. Well organized quality improvement programs take all these factors into account when selecting the quality improvement methods.

==Quality standards==
=== ISO standards ===
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]) created the [[Quality Management System]] (QMS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 9001 Quality Management System QMS Certification|url=http://www.irqs.co.in/quality-management-system.html|publisher=[[Indian Register Quality Systems]]|accessdate=13 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313211513/http://www.irqs.co.in/quality-management-system.html|archivedate=13 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; standards in 1987. They were the ISO 9000:1987 series of standards comprising ISO 9001:1987, ISO 9002:1987 and ISO 9003:1987; which were applicable in different types of industries, based on the type of activity or process: designing, production or service delivery.

The standards are reviewed every few years by the International Organization for Standardization. The version in 1994 was called the ISO 9000:1994 series; consisting of the ISO 9001:1994, 9002:1994 and 9003:1994 versions.

The last major revision was in the year 2000 and the series was called [[ISO 9000:2000]] series. The ISO 9002 and 9003 standards were integrated into one single certifiable standard: ISO 9001:2000. After December 2003, organizations holding ISO 9002 or 9003 standards had to complete a transition to the new standard.

ISO released a minor revision, ISO 9001:2008 on 14 October 2008. It contains no new requirements. Many of the changes were to improve consistency in grammar, facilitating translation of the standard into other languages for use by over 950,000 certified organization in the 175 countries (as at Dec 2007) that use the standard.

The [[ISO 9000|ISO 9004:2009]] document gives guidelines for performance improvement over and above the basic standard (ISO 9001:2000). This standard provides a measurement framework for improved quality management, similar to and based upon the measurement framework for process assessment.

The Quality Management System standards created by ISO are meant to certify the processes and the system of an organization, not the product or service itself. ISO 9000 standards do not certify the quality of the product or service.

In 2005 the International Organization for Standardization released a standard, [[ISO 22000]], meant for the food industry. This standard covers the values and principles of ISO 9000 and the [[HACCP]] standards. It gives one single integrated standard for the food industry and is expected to become more popular in the coming years in such industry.

ISO has also released standards for other industries. For example, Technical Standard TS 16949 defines requirements in addition to those in ISO 9001:2008 specifically for the automotive industry.

ISO has a number of standards that support quality management. One group describes processes (including [[ISO/IEC 12207]] and [[ISO/IEC 15288]]) and another describes process assessment and improvement ISO 15504.

=== CMMI and IDEAL methods ===
The Software Engineering Institute has its own process assessment and improvement methods, called [[Capability Maturity Model|CMMI]] (Capability Maturity Model Integration) and IDEAL respectively.

Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process improvement training and appraisal program and service administered and marketed by Carnegie Mellon University and required by many DOD and U.S. Government contracts, especially in software development. Carnegie Mellon University claims CMMI can be used to guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire organization. Under the CMMI methodology, processes are rated according to their maturity levels, which are defined as: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, Optimizing. Currently supported is CMMI Version 1.3. CMMI is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by Carnegie Mellon University.

Three constellations of CMMI are:
* Product and service development (CMMI for Development)
* Service establishment, management, and delivery (CMMI for Services)
* Product and service acquisition (CMMI for Acquisition).

CMMI Version 1.3 was released on November 1, 2010. This release is noteworthy because it updates all three CMMI models (CMMI for Development, CMMI for Services, and CMMI for Acquisition) to make them consistent and to improve their high maturity practices. The CMMI Product Team has reviewed more than 1,150 change requests for the models and 850 for the appraisal method.

As part of its mission to transition mature technology to the software community, the SEI has transferred CMMI-related products and activities to the CMMI Institute, a 100%-controlled subsidiary of Carnegie Innovations, Carnegie Mellon University’s technology commercialization enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmmiinstitute.com|title=CMMI Institute|website=www.cmmiinstitute.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205230942/http://cmmiinstitute.com/|archivedate=2015-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality management software==
Quality Management Software is a category of technologies used by organizations to manage the delivery of high quality products. Solutions range in functionality, however, with the use of automation capabilities they typically have components for managing internal and external risk, compliance, and the quality of processes and products. Pre-configured and industry-specific solutions are available and generally require integration with existing IT architecture applications such as [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]], [[Supply chain management|SCM]], [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], and [[Product lifecycle management|PLM]].

'''Quality Management Software Functionalities'''
* [[Corrective and preventive action|Non-Conformances/Corrective and Preventive Action]]
* [[Audit management|Compliance/Audit Management]]
* Supplier Quality Management
* [[Risk Management]]
* [[Statistical Process Control]]
* [[Failure mode and effects analysis|Failure Mode and Effects Analysis]]
* Complaint Handling
* [[Advanced Product Quality Planning]]
* [[Environment, Health and Safety|Environment, Health, and Safety]]
* [[Hazard Analysis &amp; Critical Control Points]]
* [[Production Part Approval Process]]

'''Enterprise Quality Management Software'''

The intersection of technology and quality management software prompted the emergence of a new software category: Enterprise Quality Management Software (EQMS). EQMS is a platform for cross-functional communication and collaboration that centralizes, standardizes, and streamlines quality management data from across the value chain. The software breaks down functional silos created by traditionally implemented standalone and targeted solutions. Supporting the proliferation and accessibility of information across supply chain activities, design, production, distribution, and service, it provides a holistic viewpoint for managing the quality of products and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Littlefield|first=Matthew|author2=Roberts, Michael|title=Enterprise Quality Management Software Best Practices Guide|journal=LNS Research Quality Management Systems|date=June 2012|pages=10|url=http://www.lnsresearch.com/research-library/research-articles/Enterprise-Quality-Management-Software-Best-Practices-Guide|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926143014/http://www.lnsresearch.com/research-library/research-articles/Enterprise-Quality-Management-Software-Best-Practices-Guide|archivedate=2012-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality terms==
* Quality Improvement can be distinguished from Quality Control in that Quality Improvement is the purposeful change of a process to improve the reliability of achieving an outcome.
* Quality Control is the ongoing effort to maintain the integrity of a process to maintain the reliability of achieving an outcome.
* Quality Assurance is the planned or systematic actions necessary to provide enough confidence that a product or service will satisfy the given requirements.

These claims were verified by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI).&lt;ref name="fai.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baumgartner's Records Ratified By FAI|url=http://www.fai.org/news-of-records/37017-baumgartners-records-ratified-by-fai|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumgartner's jump was 65 years, to the day, after [[Chuck Yeager]] broke the sound barrier for the first time in a [[Bell X-1|piloted aircraft]].

== History ==
In January 2010, it was reported that Baumgartner was working with a team of scientists and sponsor [[Red Bull]] to attempt the highest sky-dive on record.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18427-space-diver-to-attempt-first-supersonic-freefall.html |title='Space diver' to attempt first supersonic freefall |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=22 January 2010 |work=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=29 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By wearing the Equivital LifeMonitor, researchers were able to monitor Felix Baumgartner’s physiological response within an extreme environment. Baumgartner was going to make the {{convert|36600|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} jump from a capsule suspended from a balloon filled with helium, intending to become the first parachutist to break the [[sound barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz|first=Jesus|url=https://gizmodo.com/5454895/man-to-break-sound-barrier-jumping-from-edge-of-space |title=Man to Break Sound Barrier Jumping from Edge of Space |publisher=Gizmodo.com |date=22 January 2010|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paterson"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/faster-than-the-speed-of-sound-the-man-who-falls-to-earth-1877875.html |title=Faster than the speed of sound: the man who falls to earth |first=Tony |last=Paterson |date=25 January 2010 |work=The Independent |accessdate=29 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Quain |first=John R. |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/04/09/felix-baumgartner-red-bull-supersonic-suit/ |title=Daredevil to Plunge From Outer Space in Supersonic Suit |publisher=Fox News |date= 11 April 2010|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This would be possible because while the normal [[terminal velocity]] of a skydiver [[freeflying]] is about 320&amp;nbsp;km/h (200&amp;nbsp;mph or 90&amp;nbsp;m/s), the high altitude with less dense atmosphere would decrease drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Bull Stratos: Mission Accomplished|url=https://www.redbullcontentpool.com/content/stratos/products/red_bull_stratos_mission_accomplished|work=Red Bull Stratos Mission Press Releases|publisher=Red Bull Stratos Mission|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2010, Red Bull announced it was placing the project on hold after Daniel Hogan filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Los Angeles, California, USA in April, claiming he originated the idea of the parachute dive from the edge of space in 2004 and that Red Bull stole the idea from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704164004575548514271289990 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Andy | last=Pasztor | title=Lawsuit Grounds Red Bull | date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://redbullstratos.digitalnewsagency.com/story/view/4992-statement-regarding-red-bull-stratos/all |title=Statement regarding Red Bull Stratos |accessdate=5 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213191127/http://redbullstratos.digitalnewsagency.com/story/view/4992-statement-regarding-red-bull-stratos/all |archivedate=13 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit was resolved out of court in June 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.redbullstratos.com/JumpOnHold.aspx | title=Official statement on closing of legal case | publisher=Red Bull Stratos | date=30 June 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227014738/http://www.redbullstratos.com/JumpOnHold.aspx | archivedate=27 December 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 5 February 2012, it was reported that the project would be resumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/9061387/Sky-diver-to-break-sound-barrier-with-jump-from-edge-of-space.html |work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Sky diver to break sound barrier with jump from edge of space | date=5 February 2012 | first=Richard | last=Gray | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2012, Baumgartner completed the first of two test jumps, from {{convert|21818|m|ft}}. During the jump, he spent approximately three minutes and 43 seconds in free fall, claiming to have reached speeds of more than {{convert|580|kph|mph}}, before opening his parachute. In total, the jump lasted approximately eight minutes and eight seconds and Baumgartner became only the third person to parachute safely from a height of over {{convert|21.7|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0315/Skydiver-jumps-13.6-miles-on-path-to-world-s-highest-jump |title=Skydiver jumps 13.6 miles on path to world's highest jump |first=Marcia |last=Dunn |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2012, Baumgartner completed the second of two planned test jumps, from {{convert|29460|m|ft}}. It took Baumgartner about 90 minutes to reach the target altitude and his free fall was estimated to have lasted three minutes and 48 seconds before his parachutes were deployed. Baumgartner landed safely near [[Roswell, New Mexico]], USA. His top speed was an estimated {{convert|863|kph|mph}} according to Brian Utley, an official observer on site. The jump represented a personal best for Baumgartner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Marcia | last = Dunn | url=http://phys.org/news/2012-07-parachutist-stratospheric.html |title=Skydiver Fearless Felix jumps from 18 miles up | publisher=[[Phys.Org]] | date= 25 July 2012 | accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Chuck | last = Squatriglia | title = 'Fearless Felix' Hits 536 MPH Skydiving From 18 Miles Up | date = 25 July 2012 |work = Wired | url = https://www.wired.com/playbook/2012/07/felix-baumgartner-redbull-stratos/ | accessdate =9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Marcia | last = Dunn | title = Skydiver Fearless Felix jumps from 18 miles up | date = 25 July 2012 | agency = The Associated Press | url = https://news.yahoo.com/skydiver-fearless-felix-jumps-18-miles-161900738.html | work = Yahoo!

== Mission ==

=== Aborted launch ===
The project's original scheduled launch on the morning of 9 October 2012 was delayed five hours because of weather problems. Technicians at the launch site also found that one of the capsule's communication radios was faulty.&lt;ref name="Stanglin 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanglin|first=Doug|title=Supersonic skydive attempt scrubbed by gusty winds|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/ondeadline/2012/10/09/skydiver-new-mexico-austrian-baumgartner-sound-barrier/1622139/|accessdate=13 October 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 11:42 [[Mountain Daylight Time|MDT]],&lt;ref name="Launch Progress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Progress|url=http://www.redbullstratos.com/the-mission/launch-progress/|publisher=Red Bull Stratos|accessdate=10 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608223402/http://www.redbullstratos.com/the-mission/launch-progress/|archivedate=8 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the launch was aborted due to a {{convert|40|kph|adj=on}} gust of wind at the launch site.&lt;ref name="Associated Press 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Skydiver Cancels Try at Supersonic Jump|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2012/10/09/us/ap-us-supersonic-skydiver.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The launch was rescheduled for the morning of 11 October,&lt;ref name="Tierney 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John|title=New Mexico: Skydiver Delays 22-Mile Jump|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/us/new-mexico-jump-is-delayed.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the project's meteorologist announced that the date would again be postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Bull Stratos Felix Baumgartner space jump postponed|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=8841978|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Launch ===
The capsule was launched from [[Roswell International Air Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-10/watch-felix-baumgartners-record-setting-jump-32000-feet-live |title=Watch Felix Baumgartner's Record-Setting Jump From 120,000 Feet Live |publisher=Popular Science |date=14 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 09:30 MDT (15:30 UTC) on 14 October 2012,&lt;ref name="Launch Progress" /&gt; which was also the 65th anniversary of [[Chuck Yeager]]'s [[Bell X-1]] flight.

Shortly after passing the [[Armstrong limit]], Baumgartner expressed concerns that his visor heater was not functioning properly.  Mission Control continued with the mission, and 40 minutes later announced that the jump would continue regardless of the reported problem.&lt;ref name="Kolawole 2012" /&gt;  An abort procedure—which would have seen helium vented from the balloon to allow the capsule to descend—was considered.&lt;ref name="Kolawole 2012" /&gt;

After approximately 2½ hours of ascent, Baumgartner and mission control began the egress procedures.  This involved depressurisation of the capsule, detachment of his umbilical air supplies, and adjusting the capsule interior ready for decamp.&lt;ref name="Kolawole 2012" /&gt;  As the final checks were being undertaken, Kittinger said to Baumgartner, "OK, we're getting serious now, Felix".&lt;ref name="Irvine 2012" /&gt;

=== Jump and descent ===
Fifteen minutes after the egress checks began, the pressure between the capsule and the outside stabilized and the door opened.&lt;ref name="Kolawole 2012" /&gt; One of the last items was for Baumgartner to enable his suit cameras.  With this, Kittinger radioed Baumgartner for the last time:&lt;ref name="RBS Live" /&gt;

{{quote|Start the cameras, and our guardian angel will take care of you.}}

Standing on the step of the capsule, Baumgartner made a short address:&lt;ref name="Irvine 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RBS Live" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rushe 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rushe|first=Dominic|title=Felix Baumgartner lands safely after record-breaking jump – as it happened|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/14/felix-baumgartner-sound-barrier-live|accessdate=14 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the deployment altitude Baumgartner could have continued to fall safely for another 20 seconds, but it was difficult for him to verify his exact altitude.

=== Analysis ===
On 22 February 2013, FAI announced that Baumgartner had broken three of the four planned records.&lt;ref name="fai.org"/&gt;

The jump records Baumgartner attained:&lt;ref name="fai.org"/&gt;
* '''Exit altitude''' of {{convert|38.9694|km}}
* '''Maximum vertical speed (without drogue)''' of {{convert|1357.6|kph}}
* '''Vertical distance of freefall (without drogue)''' of {{convert|36402.6|m}}

=== Timeline ===
[[File:Red Bull Stratos Ascent.png|thumb|600px]]
The timeline for the mission was split into eight stages.&lt;ref name="Red Bull Media House"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Red Bull Stratos lifts off in Roswell, New Mexico|url=https://www.redbullcontentpool.com/content/stratos/products/mission_red_bull_stratos_lifts_off_in_roswell_new_mexico|work=Red Bull Stratos Newsroom|publisher=Red Bull Media House|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stages 1 and 2 covered the balloon's ascent, stages 3–7 covered the descent and landing, and stage 8 covered the return of the balloon and capsule:

#After approximately 3:30 of freefall, [[air resistance]] slows Baumgartner as the atmosphere becomes denser
#*Parachute deployed at 4:16 and fully opened by 4:19, earlier than scheduled, preventing the duration milestone from being reached
#Baumgartner deploys his parachute at approximately {{convert|2500|m}} above sea level, and 1500 m above ground level.
#*Completed
#Approximately 5:00 of controlled parachute descent until landing
#*Completed at approximately 12:17 MDT (18:17 UTC)
#Mission control remotely detach the balloon from the capsule; both descend to Earth to be recovered
#*Completed

While the jump altitude was generally described as the "edge of space" in the media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van den Hur|first=Ann Marie|title=Social Media Crisis Communications: Preparing for, Preventing, and Surviving a Public Relations #FAIL|year=2013|publisher=Que Publishing|isbn=9780133353891}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics questioned that label, pointing that the more scientifically accepted definition for the "edge of space" is the [[Kármán line]] at {{convert|100|km}}, or nearly three times the height of the project's jump altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Platt|first=Phill|title=Space Leap of Faith|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/tag/felix-baumgartner/#.UYcFFqvwI98|newspaper=Discover Magazine|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude is also used as a defining line by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]], which administers aeronautics records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Tony|title=Jump from space?

'''SS ''John Burke''''' ([[United States Maritime Commission|MC]] hull number 609) was an American [[Liberty Ship]] built during [[World War II]], one of the 2,710 type 'EC2-S-C1' ships that carried all kinds and types of dry cargo during the war.&lt;ref name="shipyard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/koregon.htm |title=Oregon Shipbuilding |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714231330/http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/4emergencylarge/wwtwo/koregon.htm |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was named for [[John Burke (politician)|John Burke]] (February 25, 1859 – May 14, 1937), the 10th Governor of North Dakota. ''Burke'' was built at [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipbuilding Company's]] [[Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation|Oregon Shipbuilding]] yard in [[Portland, Oregon]]. ''Burke's'' keel was laid November 20, 1942&lt;ref name="shipyard" /&gt; and the hull was launched on December 13.&lt;ref name="shipyard" /&gt; After [[fitting-out]], ''Burke'' was delivered to the US Maritime Commission on December 23,&lt;ref name="shipyard" /&gt; just 33 days after construction began. The War Shipping Administration then placed ''Burke'' under management of the [[Eric Wickman#Historic list of companies involved as founder|Northland Transportation Company]].&lt;ref name="maritime" /&gt;

On December 28, 1944, while transporting ammunition to [[Mindoro]], Philippines, ''Burke'' was hit by a Japanese [[kamikaze]] aircraft, and disintegrated in a tremendous explosion with the loss of all hands.&lt;ref&gt;Cressman, pp 597-599&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uss-stevens-dd479.us/KamikazeIncidnt.htm|title=Eyewitness account}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''John Burke'' was one of three Liberty Ships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu/kamikaze/background/ships-sunk/index.htm|title=William S. Ladd, 10 Dec 1944; John Burke, 28 Dec 1944; Lewis L. Dyche, 5 Jan 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of forty-seven ships sunk by kamikaze attack during World War II.&lt;ref name="47sunk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu/kamikaze/background/ships-sunk/index.htm |title=47 Ships Sunk by Kamikaze Aircraft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and design==
[[File:Planlibertyship.jpg|thumb|border|left|450px|alt=A color-coded diagram of compartments on a ship|A color-coded diagram of compartments on a Liberty ship, from the starboard side, bow to the right]]
''John Burke'' was powered by two oil-fired boilers and a single {{convert|2500|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[marine steam engine#Vertical|vertical]] type, [[marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion]] [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating]] [[marine steam engine|steam engine]]. The machinery space (dark blue in the picture) was located at the middle of the ship. The single [[propeller]] was driven through a long propeller shaft that ran through a tunnel (lower green area in the picture) under the aft cargo holds. The propeller rotated at 76 rpm, giving a speed of about {{convert|11|kn|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-ship.com/html/vtour/engineroom.php|title=Liberty ship engineroom|publisher=www.liberty-ship.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619082629/http://www.liberty-ship.com/html/vtour/engineroom.php|archivedate=2012-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two decks running the full length of the ship, with seven watertight [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] dividing the machinery space and five cargo holds (light blue in the picture), three ahead of the machinery space and two [[aft]].  Crew accommodations were provided in a large three-deck structure located in the middle of the ship (medium blue in the picture) directly above the machinery space, and in a small structure (medium blue in the picture) located at the [[stern]]. The bridge, radio room and Captain's quarters were located on the top deck (yellow in the picture) of the three-deck structure. The fuel for the boiler was carried in several tanks (red in the picture) located throughout the ship. Ship's storage (light green in the picture) was located at the bow and above the machinery space. Gun crew quarters and the ship's hospital were located in the stern structure. When the ship was armed, the [[Barbette|gun 'tubs']] (white in the picture) were located at the bow, stern and above the bridge. These could be any mixture of [[5"/38 caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}]] caliber gun|{{convert|5|in|mm}}]], [[4"/50 caliber gun|{{convert|4|in|mm|2}}]], [[3"/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}}]] caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|mm}}]], [[Bofors 40 mm#Naval|{{convert|40|mm|in|2}}]], [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon#Description|{{convert|20|mm|in|2}}]] and/or [[M2 Browning|{{convert|.5|in|mm|2}} caliber]] guns.

The ship's steering was by a [[unity of opposites|contrabalanced]] rudder (black, at left in the picture), with its associated steering gear located in a compartment (green in the picture) above the rudder and below the aft structure. Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and [[degaussing]]. An [[Evaporator (marine)|evaporator]] produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew.
Large [[trapdoor|hatches]] above the cargo holds allowed steam winches and booms rigged to three centerline masts to quickly load or unload cargo.&lt;ref name="victory"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lanevictory.org/laneVtour_mast_boom.php| title=Hoist, masts and rigging| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319020028/http://www.lanevictory.org/laneVtour_mast_boom.php| archivedate=2016-03-19| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Liberty ships were an expedient solution to a pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/116liberty_victory_ships/116facts1.htm|publisher=National Park Service|title=Liberty ship facts (6th paragraph)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is remarkable that two ([[SS John W. Brown|SS ''John W. Brown'']] and [[SS Jeremiah O'Brien|SS ''Jeremiah O'Brien'']]) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but that they are in 'like-new' condition, and are open to the public as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them.&lt;ref name="ww2ships"/&gt; In 1939, they asked the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called [[Ocean ship]]s with each ship's name starting with Ocean.&lt;ref name="ww2ships" /&gt;

The United States needed more ships as war approached. The 'Ocean' design was revised and simplified to allow mass production. This new design was the basis for the Liberty ship.&lt;ref name="ww2ships" /&gt; On December 7, 1941 Japan [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the military bases at Hawaii]], Guam, and a few days later, the Philippines. Liberty ships carried weapons, ammunition, food, tools, hardware, vehicles, and other things for the war effort. They could also be equipped to carry a large number&lt;ref name="build"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/liberty_ships/BuildingLibertyShips/index.html#config|title=Liberty Ship design and construction}}&lt;/ref&gt; of troops by rigging bunks in the holds similar to those used by the armed guard.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-ship.com/html/vtour/cargoholds.php |title=Virtual tour of a Liberty ship's hold |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619082548/http://www.liberty-ship.com/html/vtour/cargoholds.php |archivedate=2012-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty ships began taking troops and materials wherever they were needed, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.&lt;ref name="ww2ships" /&gt; Like other Liberty Ships, ''John Burke'' transported war materials between the United States and the [[rear (military)|rear areas]] of the [[Pacific War]], often calling at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Australia]], [[Guadalcanal]], [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] and [[Manaus]].

On what would be her final trip, ''Burke'' departed [[Seattle, Washington]] for [[Guam]], where she spent several days loading munitions for the invasion force on the island of [[Battle of Mindoro|Mindoro]].&lt;ref name="browning"&gt;Browning, p 470&lt;/ref&gt; ''Burke'' then departed with the 100-ship "Uncle Plus 13" convoy, bound for [[Leyte]] in the [[Philippines]]. The convoy arrived at Leyte the night of December 27.&lt;ref name="wreck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/18433353/Wreck-of-SS-John-Burke|title=Wreck of SS John Burke|publisher=wikimapia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese forces were alerted to the convoy's arrival shortly before daybreak on December 28. A flight of six Japanese [[kamikaze]] fighter/bombers was sent up from [[Cebu|Cebu Island]] shortly after dawn.&lt;ref name="wreck" /&gt;  If the convoy was destroyed, the U.S. forces on Mindoro would be cut off from their supply line.

That morning ''Burke'' and the other ships in the Mindoro-bound TG 77.11 (under the command of Captain George F. Mentz&lt;ref name="mentz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=9825| title=Captain Mentz' Navy Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were at [[general quarters]] shortly after receiving the dawn weather report that reported that air cover would not launch until the poor weather cleared. The crews began their wait for the inevitable arrival of Japanese aircraft.

==The attack==
At about 0815 hrs, the first kamikaze appeared on the American ship's [[radar]], and orders were immediately given for the convoy to begin evasive maneuvering.&lt;ref name="bush1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ussbush.com/mindoro.htm|title=USS Bush (DD 529)'s deck log for Thursday 28 December, 1944 8-12 watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through holes in the clouds, the Japanese pilots sighted the large American force as it steamed through calm seas south of [[Cebu]] and [[Bohol]] Islands. Finding the convoy without air cover, a group of six Japanese planes began their attack. One of the pilots, flying an [[Aichi D3A]] "Val",&lt;ref name="rieley" /&gt; chose ''John Burke'' as his target. Diving through heavy [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]], the Japanese pilot had no intention of pulling out of his steep dive. At 1020, despite the damage to his aircraft, he crashed between ''Burke'''s #2 and #3 cargo holds.&lt;ref name="browning" /&gt;

A brief flash of fire was visible to most of the ships in the convoy, and for several seconds, only smoke could be seen billowing from her hold. A few seconds later, a huge pillar of fire shot out of ''Burke's'' cargo hold, followed by an immense cloud of white smoke.&lt;ref name="bush1" /&gt; Within seconds all eyes were drawn to ''Burke'' where an enormous fireball erupted as her entire cargo of munitions detonated, instantly destroying the ship and killing her crew of 40 [[merchant marine]] sailors and 28&lt;ref name=USMM01&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronological List of U.S. Ships Sunk or Damaged during 1944|url=http://www.usmm.org/sunk44.html#anchor412649|work=usmm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 29&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.armed-guard.com/sunk.html|title=Merchant sailors and armed guard losses}}&lt;/ref&gt; armed guards. For several seconds, ''Burke'' was not visible under an enormous mushroom cloud of smoke, fire and explosions. Several ships nearby were damaged by the force of the blast and flying fragments.&lt;ref name="bush1" /&gt; The shock wave rocked the entire convoy, and several ships reported that they had been torpedoed.  A US Army "FS" type ship just aft of ''Burke'' was severely damaged by the blast, sinking before it could be identified.&lt;ref name="rieley" /&gt; As the cloud of smoke cleared, nearby ships closed on ''Burke'''s former position to search for survivors.  It was soon clear that ''Burke'', and all men aboard her, were gone.

The Combat Air Patrol arrived at 1213 after the weather cleared, providing air cover for the next three hours.&lt;ref name="bush2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ussbush.com/mindoro.htm|title=USS Bush (DD 529)'s deck log for Thursdav 28 December, 1944 12-16 watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese attack that morning was just the beginning of a two-day series of attacks on the convoy, costing several more ships and hundreds of lives. In spite of the near-constant attacks, the force reached its destination at 0648 December 30 with much-needed materiel for the Mindoro invasion.&lt;ref name="bush3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ussbush.com/mindoro.htm|title=USS Bush (DD 529)'s deck log for Saturday 30 December, 1944 4-8 watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, SS ''John Burke's'' fragments lie {{convert|1500|ft|m|0}} below the surface, in the vicinity of  [https://maps.google.com/maps?t=m&amp;q=9%C2%B01%2711%22N,123%C2%B026%2750%22E 9°1'11"N 123°26'50"E],&lt;ref&gt;Location on Google Maps&lt;/ref&gt; the location the ship was last seen, in the strait between [[Negros (island)|Negros]], [[Siquijor]]  Islands and [[Dapitan]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Mindanao]], Philippines.&lt;ref name="wreck" /&gt;

'''La Sayona''' is a legend from [[Venezuela]], represented by the [[vengeful spirit]] of a woman that shows up only to men that have love affairs out of their marriages. The name "Sayona" refers to the cloth the ghost wears which is a long white dress similar to a medieval undergarment. 

The legend claims that when this woman appears she asks for a cigarette or for a ride, and after a while when the victim tries to see her face, he notices that she has instead a skull with horrible teeth.&lt;ref name="Domínguez"&gt;Domínguez, Luis Arturo. 1990. Encuentro con el folklore en Venezuela. Editorial Kapelusz Venezolana. Caracas. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The legend says that "La Sayona" was a young woman named Casilda. She lived in a small town in the plains of Venezuela and was the most beautiful girl there. She was married to a great man, caring and loving. Casilda and her husband had a baby boy. One day, Casilda was swimming naked in a nearby river, when a man from the village saw her. After that, the man would always follow her and watch her bathe in the river. One day Casilda saw him and told him to leave her alone; he ignored her, and instead told her that he was there to warn her: "Your husband is having an affair with none other than your mother," he said. Casilda ran home and found her husband asleep with the baby in his arms. Blind with anger, she burned the house with them inside. Villagers could hear their screams while Casilda ran to her mother's house. She found her on the patio and attacked her with a machete, striking her in the stomach. As the mother bled to death, she cursed Casilda by saying that from then on she would have to avenge all women by killing their unfaithful husbands. And from that day forward Casilda became "La Sayona".

In other versions of the tale, it appears to lone men working in the jungle when they are thinking of women they left behind in their hometown or simply when they talk to their work mates about wanting to be with a woman. Later on, a woman would appear to them in the likeness of an unknown, beautiful and desirable woman, or a loved one, and try to lure them into the forests so it could then reveal their animal-like features and devour them or just mangle them, leaving their wretched bodies for their companions to find.

In another version told in the peacock mountains, the woman would appear to men in the jungle who were lonely and willing to be unfaithful with their companion. Stories often claim that several men would take act in unveiling their selves to this ghost woman, and she would let all the men have sex with her. She would then devour their body parts, though it is most often noted that she would tear each mans genitals off with her hand or mangle them beyond use ever again, in order to punish them. Although many men in the jungle are said to have encountered La Sayona, most of them still have their genitals. It is said that she also has many strange diseases, and that she sometimes gives them to men, making their penises swollen with blisters and boils. Their wives find these boils and can assume that their husbands have had an encounter with La Sayona, effectively informing her that her husband has been unfaithful.

It is important to note that there are many versions of the La Sayona story, with greatly different characters, names, and plot points. La Sayona is often related to La Llorona.

'''''The New Meditation Handbook: Meditations to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful''''' ([[Tharpa Publications]] (2003) {{ISBN|978-0-9817277-1-4}}) is a guide to Buddhist philosophy and meditation techniques. It is a compilation of twenty-one concise meditations on [[Lamrim]], or the stages of the path to enlightenment, by Geshe [[Kelsang Gyatso]], a Buddhist teacher and author in the West.

''The New Meditation Handbook'' contains twenty-one meditations on [[Lamrim]] that are designed to be followed in a cycle, thus covering all of [[Buddha]]'s teachings every 21 days. The meditations are described as "actual methods to control our mind. Because everyone has different wishes and capacities, many different levels of meditation practice are given."&lt;ref&gt;''The New Meditation Handbook: Meditations to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful'', p. 4, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2003) {{ISBN|978-0-9817277-1-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, a Tibetan monk, entered the monastery at the age of eight and has spent the past 30 years establishing Buddhist centers throughout the world. He provides 21 contemplative meditations to systematically guide a seeker to enlightenment according to Buddhist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000027801 Booklist Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21 meditations are intended to give a concise overview of essential Buddhist teachings and philosophy with the purpose of increasing peace of mind, positivity, and spiritual wisdom. ''[[Foreword Reviews|Foreword Magazine]]'' says: "Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's words provide a stimulatingly peaceful perspective.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of The New Meditation Handbook |url=https://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/the-new-meditation-handbook/ |publisher=Foreword Reviews |accessdate=29 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkus Reviews called it "Clear, inspirational writing" &lt;ref&gt;Kirkus Reviews, UK&lt;/ref&gt; and Booklist says "''The New Meditation Handbook'' is a simple, sincere guide to Buddhist philosophy and meditation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Booklist, October 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Spirituality and Health Magazine'': "This manual provides a succinct and inspiring overview of the many ways in which Buddhism can be applied to the situations and activities of daily life." {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The book focuses on Buddha's teaching that all human beings have potential for spiritual growth by overcoming negative minds and increasing positive ones in daily life. Donna Seaman of Booklist suggests: "Geshe Kelsang has a unique gift for simultaneously addressing everyday difficulties--particularly in his useful and inspiring elucidation of how to control anger and practice patience--and bringing into focus the spiritual dimension in which they reverberate."&lt;ref&gt;''Booklist'', October 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The author is the founder of the [[New Kadampa Tradition]], which has 1100 Buddhist centers and groups worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1310">The '''upright jerker''' was an [[execution]] method and device intermittently used in the [[United States]] during the 19th and early 20th century. Intended to replace [[hanging]]s, the upright jerker did not see widespread use.

As in a hanging, a cord would be wrapped around the neck of the condemned. However, rather than dropping down through a trapdoor, the condemned would be violently jerked into the air by means of a system of weights and pulleys. The objective of this execution method was to provide a swift death by breaking the condemned's neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Banner|title=The Death Penalty: An American History|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2018}} The warden of the Connecticut State Prison at Wethersfield obtained {{cite patent |country=US |number=541409 |status=patent}}, issued on June 18, 1895, for one such "automatic gallows". 

Executions of this type took place in several U.S. states, notably [[Connecticut]], where among others the "Count of Gramercy Park", murderer and gang member [[Gerald Chapman]] was put to death by the method. The upright jerker was never very efficient at breaking the condemned's neck and was withdrawn from use by the 1930s.

{{homicide}}
{{Criminal law}}

'''Vehicular homicide''' is a crime that involves the death of a person other than the driver as a result of either [[Criminal negligence|criminally negligent]] or [[murder]]ous operation of a motor vehicle.

In cases of criminal negligence, the defendant is commonly charged with unintentional '''vehicular manslaughter'''.

Vehicular homicide is similar to the offense, in some countries, of "dangerous driving causing death."

The victim may be either a person not in the car with the offending motorist (such as a pedestrian, cyclist, or another motorist), or a passenger in the vehicle with the offender.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sacerdote|first=Bruce |first2=Edward |last2=Glaeser |title=Sentencing in Homicide Cases and the Role of Vengeance |journal=Journal of Legal Studies |date=2003 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=363–382 |doi=10.1086/374707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdictions==

===Canada===

The [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] does not have a specific offence for vehicular homicide, but has a series of provisions covering driving offences causing death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/publications/permis/criminal_code_offences.pdf Quebec:  Société de l'assurance automobile, ''Criminal Code Offences''].&lt;/ref&gt; among them:
* dangerous driving causing death
* criminal negligence causing death 
* failure to stop for police causing death
* street racing causing death
* impaired driving causing death
* hit and run driving causing death

The maximum penalty for dangerous driving causing death, absent any of the remaining 5 elements mentioned above, is 14 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-249.html#h-81|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|date=|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty is otherwise [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]]. Anyone sentenced to life imprisonment for a Criminal Code driving offence is eligible to apply for [[parole]] after serving [[Parole Board of Canada|7 years]], but there is no guarantee of parole.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], there is no offense of "vehicular homicide". Where a vehicle has been used as a weapon as part of a deliberate assault; and the intention was to kill or cause serious injury; and that assault resulted in the death of the victim then the driver may be charged with murder contrary to the [[Common Law]].

Where death is the result of driving that falls short of a deliberate assault, the Road Traffic Act 1988 (RTA 88) governs the disposal of the case.&lt;ref name="rta"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/contents | title=The Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) | publisher=HMSO | accessdate=17 March 2015 | author=UK Gvt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offenses created by this act relating to road deaths are as follows ...

* "[[Causing death by dangerous driving]]" - Section 1 RTA 88, the only points for the prosecution to prove are that death was caused and the driver of the vehicle that caused the death was driving dangerously.
* "Causing death by careless, or inconsiderate, driving" - Section 2B RTA 88, deals with cases similar in scope to Section 1 but while the standard of the driving remains reprehensible the lapse(s) alleged are considered to fall short of being actually dangerous.
* "Causing death by driving: unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured drivers" - Section 3ZB RTA 88, it is a requirement under UK law for the drivers of motor vehicles to be properly licensed and for them to hold third party insurance for their vehicle. This section was inserted to the RTA 88 to deal with road death cases where there was no provable lapse in driving standards but nevertheless the driver should not in law have been driving.
* and "Causing death by careless driving while unfit through alcohol/over prescribed limit", Section 3A RTA 88

The RTA 88 introduced the simple concept of dangerousness by removing the offence of "reckless driving" as the concept of recklessness in UK law requires a [[mens rea]]. This had been difficult to prove in court. C. M. V. Clarkson, an advocate of a vehicular homicide offense, opines that while people's perceptions are that death resulting from a motor vehicle is in a different "family" to other killings, "in terms of fault there can be little distinction between those who kill through the dangerous operation of their cars and those who kill with machines, trains, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1988|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880052_en_2.htm#mdiv1|work=Road Traffic Act 1988|title=c.52 §1|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking English Homicide Law|author=C.M.V. Clarkson|chapter=Context and culpability in involuntary manslaughter: Principle or instinct?|editor1=Andrew Ashworth |editor2=Barry Mitchell |pages=148&amp;ndash;150,164|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829915-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above there also exists the option of charging offenders with [[causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving]]. 

Originally framed in the era of horse-drawn vehicles this legislation is now applied where offences involving motorised vehicles take place outside the provisions of the Road Traffic Act (on private land, when driving off-road or in pedestrianised areas) and in the small number of serious cases involving non-motorised collisions such as the few that involve cyclists and result in severe injury or loss of life, typically of pedestrians.

===United States===
The definition and penalties of vehicular manslaughter in the United States vary by state.

All states except [[Alaska]], [[Montana]], and [[Arizona]] have vehicular homicide [[statute]]s. The laws have the effect of making a vehicle a potentially [[deadly weapon]], to allow for easier conviction and more severe penalties; in states without such statutes, [[defendant]]s can still be charged with manslaughter or murder in some situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/outreach/safesobr/13qp/facts/facthom.html |title=The Facts: Vehicular Homicide and the Impaired Driver |publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428213536/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/outreach/safesobr/13qp/facts/facthom.html |archivedate=2009-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Model Penal Code]], there is no distinction between vehicular homicide and vehicular homicides that involve negligence; instead, both are included in the overall category of [[negligent homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to the American Legal System|author1=John M. Scheb II  |author2=John Malcolm Scheb |lastauthoramp=yes |page=120|year=2001|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-2759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Criminal Justice Administration|author1=Michael Hooper |author2=M.

====California====
In the state of [[California]], depending on the degree of recklessness and whether alcohol was involved, a person could be charged with progressively more serious offenses: vehicular manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, or second-degree murder. In any of these cases, the prosecution must prove that the driver committed some wrongful act (which could be a felony, a misdemeanor, an infraction, or a lawful act that might cause death) and that the wrongful act caused the collision and the death of the victim. Murder charges are usually reserved for the most egregious cases, such as a convicted DUI offender who drives recklessly while intoxicated and thereby causes a fatal collision.

====Georgia====
In the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], vehicular homicide is more properly known as '''homicide by vehicle'''. It is defined, by statute, as the unlawful killing of another person using a vehicle. To be guilty of the offense, the perpetrator does not have to have an [[mens rea|intent to kill]], [[malice aforethought]], or [[premeditation]].&lt;ref name=Trapp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgun-lawyer.com/veh_homicide.htm|title=Vehicular Homicide Laws|author=Allen M. Trapp, Jr., P.C.|year=2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101193812/http://www.topgun-lawyer.com/veh_homicide.htm|archivedate=2007-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two degrees of vehicular homicide:
;First degree homicide by vehicle: This is a [[felony]] that, upon conviction, will result in a sentence of between 3 and 15 years of [[imprisonment]] (or between 5 and 20 years for habitual violators), with no parole for at least 1 year. A homicide is first degree homicide by vehicle if the driver "unlawfully met or overtook a school bus; unlawfully failed to stop after a collision; was driving [[Recklessness (law)|recklessly]]; was driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs; failed to stop for, or otherwise was attempting to flee from, a law enforcement officer; or had previously been declared a habitual violator".&lt;ref name=Trapp /&gt;
;Second degree homicide by vehicle: This is a [[misdemeanor]] that, upon conviction, will result in a sentence of up to 1 year (which may be suspended), a fine of up to US$1,000, or both.  Second degree homicide by vehicle encompasses all other homicides by vehicle, involving any other violation of the laws governing motor vehicles, that are not classed as first degree  homicides.&lt;ref name=Trapp /&gt;

====Louisiana====
In the state of [[Louisiana]], vehicular homicide is defined as the killing of a human being while operating a motor vehicle, or other means of conveyance, under the influence of alcohol and/or controlled substances. The minimum punishment is a fine of at least $2,000 (not more than $15,000) and 5–30 years in prison.

The law is [[Louisiana Statutes Annoted|LSA]] [http://law.justia.com/louisiana/codes/146/78410.html RS 14:32.1].

====Minnesota====
In the state of [[Minnesota]], vehicular homicide is one of the six levels of '''criminal vehicular operation''', and is defined as causing the death of a person, that does not constitute murder or manslaughter, as a  result of operating a motor vehicle in a grossly negligent manner, or in a negligent manner while in violation of the [[driving under the influence|driving while intoxicated]] law, or where the driver flees the scene in violation of the felony fleeing law.&lt;ref name="Minnesota"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dps.state.mn.us/ots/crashdata/2003%20Impaired%20Facts/IDF03FLawOverviewVer10.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Minnesota Department of Public Safety|title=A Brief Overview of Minnesota’s DWI Laws: Minnesota Statutes Chapter 169A and Related Laws|author1=James Cleary  |author2=Joseph Cox |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Minnesota Impaired Driving Facts Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicular homicide in Minnesota requires, at a minimum, a ''[[mens rea]]'' of gross negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?id=609.21  |title=609.21 Criminal Vehicular Homicide and Injury |publisher=Office of the Revisor of Statutes, State of Minnesota |year=2008  |accessdate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Texas====
In the state of Texas, an individual charged with vehicular manslaughter even if intoxicated with alcohol can receive the following penalties and punishments under Chapter 12 of the Texas Penal Code. Manslaughter in Texas is generally a felony of the second degree. This offense can result in a prison sentence from two to 20 years and/or fines up to $10,000.

====Washington====
'''Vehicular homicide in Washington state''', is governed by ''RCW 46.61.520 Vehicular homicide—Penalty.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.520|title=RCW 46.61.520: Vehicular homicide—Penalty.|author=|date=|website=apps.leg.wa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Text=====
::(1) When the death of any person ensues within three years as a proximate result of injury proximately caused by the driving of any vehicle by any person, the driver is guilty of vehicular homicide if the driver was operating a motor vehicle:

:::a While under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, as defined by RCW 46.61.502; or
:::b In a reckless manner; or
:::c With disregard for the safety of others.

::(2) Vehicular homicide is a class A felony punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW, except that, for a conviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section, an additional two years shall be added to the sentence for each prior offence as defined in RCW 46.61.5055.

====Sentencing====
A study by professors at [[Dartmouth College]] and [[Harvard University]] found that those convicted of vehicular homicide are given, on average, shorter sentences than those found guilty of other types of homicide. The study found that the gender of the offender does not statistically affect the length of the sentence, but the race does. The identity of the victim is a more important predictor of sentencing length, with longer sentences given to offenders in cases where the victim was female and/or had no violent criminal record.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote" /&gt;

Some states, such as [[Minnesota]], have statutes allowing for a charge of a vehicular homicide if an unborn child is killed or injured by a motorist.&lt;ref name="Minnesota"/&gt;

A '''viral shift''' is the sudden emergence of a seemingly novel strain of a virus. It is a prerequisite viral condition for [[pandemic]]s. An existing virus undergoes a change and becomes a [[pathogen]], such as the constantly mutating "A" strain of [[influenza]] in which the change is known as an [[antigenic shift]]. Existing [[vaccine]]s or natural [[antibodies]] cannot produce an [[immune response]] to the new strain.

Viral shift is caused by [[Reassortment|viral subunit reassortment]], as opposed to simple random [[mutation]].

[[File:Raphael - Cardinal and Theological Virtues.jpg|thumb|400px|''Cardinal and Theological Virtues'' by [[Raphael]], 1511]]

'''Virtue''' ({{lang-la|[[Virtus (virtue)|virtus]]}}, {{lang-grc|ἀρετή}} "[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]") is [[morality|moral]] [[excellence]]. A virtue is a trait or quality that is deemed to be morally [[Good and evil|good]] and thus is [[Value (ethics)|valued]] as a foundation of [[principle]] and good moral being. Personal virtues are characteristics [[Value (personal and cultural)|valued]] as promoting collective and individual greatness. In other words, it is a behavior that shows high moral standards. Doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong. The opposite of virtue is [[vice]]. 

The four classic cardinal  virtues are temperance, prudence, courage, and justice. Christianity derives the three theological virtues of faith, hope and love (charity) from 1 Corinthians. Together these make up the [[seven virtues]]. Buddhism's four [[brahmavihara]] ("Divine States") can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The Japanese [[Bushidō]] code is characterized by up to ten virtues,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} including rectitude, courage, and benevolence.

==Etymology==
The ancient Romans used the Latin word ''virtus'' (derived from ''vir'', their word for ''man'') to refer to all of the "excellent qualities of men, including physical strength, valorous conduct, and moral rectitude." The French words ''vertu'' and ''virtu'' came from this Latin root. In the 13th century, the word ''virtue'' was "borrowed into English".&lt;ref&gt;’’The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories’’. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==
[[File:Maat.svg|thumb|upright|[[Maat]], to [[ancient Egypt]]ians, personified the virtue of [[truth]] and [[justice]]. Her feather represents truth.&lt;ref&gt;Karenga, M. (2004), Maat, the moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During Egyptian civilization, [[Maat]] or Ma'at (thought to have been pronounced *[muʔ.ʕat]), also spelled māt or mayet, was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian concept of [[truth]], [[balance (metaphysics)|balance]], [[Natural order (philosophy)|order]], [[law]], [[morality]], and [[justice]]. Maat was also personified as a goddess regulating the stars, seasons, and the actions of both mortals and the deities. The deities set the order of the universe from chaos at the moment of creation. Her (ideological) counterpart was [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], who symbolized [[chaos (mythology)|chaos]], lies, and injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Norman Rufus Colin Cohn| title = Cosmos, Caos and the World to Come: The Ancient Roots of Apocalyptic Faith| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-300-05598-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Assmann]], Translated by Rodney Livingstone, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8047-4523-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical antiquity==
[[File:Arete - Areté- Éfeso.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Personification]] of virtue ([[Greek Language|Greek]] ''Ἀρετή'') in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesos]], [[Turkey]]]]

===Platonic virtue===
The four classic [[cardinal virtues]] are:&lt;ref&gt;Stanley B. Cunningham (2002), Review of Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy, Dialogue, Volume 21, Issue 01, March 1982, pp. 133–37&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]]: {{lang|grc|σωφροσύνη}} (''sōphrosynē'')
* [[prudence]]: {{lang|grc|φρόνησις}} (''phronēsis'')
* [[courage]]: {{lang|grc|ἀνδρεία}} (''andreia'')
* [[justice (virtue)|justice]]: {{lang|grc|δικαιοσύνη}} (''dikaiosynē'')

This enumeration is traced to Greek philosophy and was listed by [[Plato]] in addition to [[piety]]: {{lang|grc|ὁσιότης}} (hosiotēs), with the exception that wisdom replaced prudence as virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, D. J. (1991), [http://www.peterlang.de/download/datasheet/42753/datasheet_61504.pdf The virtue of prudence], P. Lang., in Studies in Moral Philosophy. Vol. 5 General Editor: John Kekes&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Carr, D. (1988), The cardinal virtues and Plato's moral psychologym The Philosophical Quarterly, 38(151), pp. 186–200&lt;/ref&gt; consider either of the above four virtue combinations as mutually reducible and therefore not cardinal.

It is unclear whether multiple virtues were of later construct, and whether Plato subscribed to a unified view of virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, The Unity of the Virtues in the "Protagoras", The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 25, No. 3 (Mar., 1972), pages 415-458&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' and ''[[Meno]]'', for example, he states that the separate virtues cannot exist independently and offers as evidence the contradictions of acting with wisdom, yet in an unjust way; or acting with bravery (fortitude), yet without wisdom.

=== Aristotelian virtue ===
In his work ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] defined a virtue as a point between a deficiency and an excess of a trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aristotle |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/summary.html |title=Sparknotes.com |publisher=Sparknotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point of greatest virtue lies not in the exact middle, but at a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] sometimes closer to one extreme than the other. However, the virtuous action is not simply the "mean" (mathematically speaking) between two opposite extremes.  As Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics: "at the right times, about the right things, towards the right people, for the right end, and in the right way, is the intermediate and best condition, and this is proper to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |title=Nicomachean Ethics |publisher=Home.wlu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232937/http://home.wlu.edu/~mahonj/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle2.htm |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not simply splitting the difference between two extremes.  For example, generosity is a virtue between the two extremes of miserliness and being profligate.  Further examples include: courage between cowardice and foolhardiness, and confidence between [[self-deprecation]] and vanity.  In Aristotle's sense, virtue is excellence at being human.

===Prudence and virtue===
[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], the Roman [[Stoicism|Stoic]], said that perfect [[prudence]] is indistinguishable from perfect virtue. Thus, in considering all consequences, a prudent person would act in the same way as a virtuous person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The same rationale was expressed by [[Plato]] in [[Meno]], when he wrote that people only act in ways that they perceive will bring them maximum good. It is the lack of wisdom that results in the making of a bad choice instead of a prudent one. In this way, wisdom is the central part of virtue. Plato realized that because virtue was synonymous with wisdom it could be taught, a possibility he had earlier discounted. He then added "correct belief" as an alternative to knowledge, proposing that knowledge is merely correct belief that has been thought through and "tethered".

===Roman virtues===
The term "virtue" itself is derived from the Latin [[Virtus (virtue)|"virtus"]] (the personification of which was the deity [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]), and had connotations of [[masculinity|"manliness"]], [[honor|"honour"]], worthiness of deferential respect, and civic duty as both [[Cincinnatus|citizen and soldier]]. This virtue was but one of many virtues which Romans of good character were expected to exemplify and pass on through the generations, as part of the [[mos maiorum|Mos Maiorum]]; ancestral traditions which defined [[Romanitas|"Roman-ness"]]. Romans distinguished between the spheres of private and public life, and thus, virtues were also divided between those considered to be in the realm of private family life (as lived and taught by the [[paterfamilias]]), and those expected of an upstanding Roman [[Citizenship#Roman ideas|citizen]].

Most Roman concepts of virtue were also personified as a [[numina|numinous deity]]. The primary Roman virtues, both public and private, were:
* [[Auctoritas]] – "spiritual authority" – the sense of one's social standing, built up through experience, Pietas, and Industria. This was considered to be essential for a magistrate's ability to enforce law and order.
* Comitas – "humour" – ease of manner, courtesy, openness, and friendliness.
* Constantia – "perseverance" – military stamina, as well as general mental and physical endurance in the face of hardship.
* [[Clementia]] – "mercy" – mildness and gentleness, and the ability to set aside previous transgressions.
* [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|Dignitas]] – "dignity" – a sense of self-worth, personal self-respect and self-esteem.
* [[Disciplina]] – "discipline" – considered essential to military excellence; also connotes adherence to the legal system, and upholding the duties of citizenship.
* Firmitas – "tenacity" – strength of mind, and the ability to stick to one's purpose at hand without wavering.
* [[frugality|Frugalitas]] – "frugality" – economy and simplicity in lifestyle, without being miserly.
* [[Gravitas]] – "gravity" – a sense of the importance of the matter at hand; responsibility, and being earnest.
* Honestas – "respectability" – the image that one presents as a respectable member of society.
* [[Humanitas]] – "humanity" – refinement, civilization, learning, and generally being cultured.
* Industria – "industriousness" – hard work.
* [[justice|Iustitia]] – "justice" – sense of moral worth to an action; personified by the goddess [[Iustitia]], the Roman counterpart to the Greek [[Themis]].
* [[Pietas]] – "dutifulness" – more than religious piety; a respect for the natural order: socially, politically, and religiously. Includes ideas of patriotism, fulfillment of [[Cult (religious practice)|pious obligation to the gods]], and honoring other human beings, especially in terms of the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron and client relationship]], considered essential to an orderly society.
* [[Prudentia]] – "prudence" – foresight, wisdom, and personal discretion.
* Salubritas – "wholesomeness" – general health and cleanliness, personified in the deity [[Salus]].
* Severitas – "sternness" – self-control, considered to be tied directly to the virtue of gravitas.
* [[honesty|Veritas]] – "truthfulness" – honesty in dealing with others, personified by the goddess [[Veritas]]. Veritas, being the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], was considered the root of all virtue; a person living an honest life was bound to be virtuous.
* [[Virtus (virtue)|Virtus]] – "manliness" – valor, excellence, courage, character, and worth. 'Vir' is Latin for "man".

===The Seven Heavenly Virtues===
In 410 CE, [[Prudentius| Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] listed seven "heavenly virtues" in his book [[Psychomachia]] (Battle of Souls) which is an allegorical story of conflict between vices and virtues. The virtues depicted were:
*chastity
*temperance 
*charity
*diligence 
*patience 
*kindness
*humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudentius Seven Heavenly Virtues |url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/prudentius_virtues.htm |website=Changing Minds |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Chivalric virtues==
In the 8th Century, upon the occasion of his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] published a list of knightly virtues:

Love God
Love your neighbour
Give alms to the poor
Entertain strangers
Visit the sick
Be merciful to prisoners
Do ill to no man, nor consent unto such
Forgive as ye hope to be forgiven
Redeem the captive
Help the oppressed
Defend the cause of the widow and orphan
Render righteous judgement
Do not consent to any wrong
Persevere not in wrath
Shun excess in eating and drinking
Be humble and kind
Serve your liege lord faithfully
Do not steal
Do not perjure yourself, nor let others do so
Envy, hatred and violence separate men from the Kingdom of God
Defend the Church and promote her cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The origins of Chivalry |url=http://www.baronage.co.uk/chivalry/chival1a.html |website=Baronage |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious traditions ==

===Judaism===
{{main article|Jewish ethics}}Loving God and obeying his laws, in particular the [[Ten Commandments]], are central to Jewish conceptions of virtue. Wisdom is personified in the first eight chapters of the [[Book of Proverbs]] and is not only the source of virtue but is depicted as the first and best creation of God (Proverbs 8:12-31). Wisdom is also celebrated in the [[Book of Wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/7#27007022|title=Wisdom, Chapter 7, Verse 22|last=|first=|date=|website=USCCB Bible|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|access-date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the most concise terms, Hillel replied (reputedly while standing on one leg): "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|Virtues fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]{{main article|Christian ethics}}{{See also|Seven virtues|Evangelical counsels}}
In [[Christianity]], the [[three theological virtues]] are [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Agape|love]], a list which comes from [[1 Corinthians 13]]:13 ({{lang|grc|νυνὶ δὲ μένει πίστις}} ''pistis'' (faith), {{lang|grc|ἐλπίς}} ''elpis'' (hope), {{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agape'' (love), {{lang|grc|τὰ τρία ταῦτα· μείζων δὲ τούτων ἡ ἀγάπη}}). The same chapter describes love as the greatest of the three, and further defines love as "patient, kind, not envious, boastful, arrogant, or rude." (The Christian virtue of love is sometimes called [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and at other times a Greek word [[agape]] is used to contrast the love of God and the love of humankind from other types of love such as friendship or physical affection.)

Christian scholars frequently add the four Greek [[cardinal virtues]] (prudence, justice, temperance, and courage) to the theological virtues to give the [[seven virtues]]; for example, these seven are the ones described in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', sections 1803–1829.

The Bible mentions additional virtues, such as in the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]," found in Galatians 5:22-23: "By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit it is [[Temperance (virtue)|benevolent]]-love: joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, benevolence, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is absolutely no law against such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Aland]], [[Kurt Aland]], Matthew Black, [[Carlo M. Martini]], [[Bruce M. Metzger]] and [[Allen Wikgren]], ''The Greek New Testament'', 4th ed. (Federal Republic of Germany: United Bible Societies, 1993, c1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval and renaissance periods saw a number of models of sin listing the seven deadly sins and the virtues opposed to each.

===Islam===
{{main article|Islamic views on virtue}}
In Islam, the [[Qur'an]] is believed to be the literal word of God, and the definitive description of virtue. [[Muhammad]] is considered an ideal example of virtue in human form. The [[hadiths]], his reported sayings, are central to the Islamic understanding of virtue.

Virtue is defined in [[hadith]]. It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an:
{{quote|"The Prophet Muhammad said, "Piety/virtue is good manner, and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported:
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of Allah and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about Piety/virtue?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Piety/virtue is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi}}

For Muslims fulfilling the human rights are valued as an important building block of Islam, According to Muslim beliefs Allah will forgive individual sins but the bad treatment of humans and injustice with others will only be pardoned by the humans and not by Allah.
===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], attainment of [[enlightenment]] is possible only if the seeker possesses certain virtues. All [[Jains]] are supposed to take up the five vows of [[ahimsa]] (non violence), [[satya]] (truthfulness), [[asteya]] (non stealing), [[aparigraha]] (non attachment and [[brahmacharya]] (celibacy) before becoming a monk. These vows are laid down by the [[Tirthankaras]]. Other virtues which are supposed to be followed by both monks as well as laypersons include forgiveness, humility, self-restraint and straightforwardness. These vows assists the seeker to escape from the karmic bondages thereby escaping the cycle of birth and death to attain liberation.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/bliss-of-wisdom/जैन-धर्म-के-पाँच-मूलभूत-सिद्धांत-bfc9b756d509&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main article|Hindu ethics}}Virtue is a much debated&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}; pages 268-72;
* Quote: "(In Hinduism), srutis did not pretend to deal with all situations or irregularities in the moral life, leaving these matters to human reasons (Mbh Xii.109); Accordingly, that again which is virtue may, according to time and place, be sin (...); Under certain conditions, acts that are apparently evil (such as violence) can be permitted if they produce consequences that are good (protection of children and women in self-defense when the society is attacked in war)
* Quote: "(The Hindu scripture) notes the interrelationship of several virtues, consequentially. Anger springs from covetousness; (the vice of) envy disappears in consequence of (the virtues) of compassion and knowledge of self (Mbh Xii.163);&lt;/ref&gt; and an evolving concept in ancient scriptures of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S. Cromwell (1982), The evolution of Hindu ethical ideals, Asian Studies Program, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Becker (2001), Encyclopedia of Ethics, {{ISBN|978-0415936729}}, 2nd Edition, Routledge, pages 845-848&lt;/ref&gt; The essence, need and value of virtue is explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};
* Also see: Apastamba, Dharma Sutra, 1.20.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtues lead to ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुण्य,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=puNya&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 puNya] Spoken Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; holy living) in Hindu literature; while vices lead to ''pap'' (Sanskrit: पाप,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html search for pApa] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[sin]]). Sometimes, the word ''punya'' is used interchangeably with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;What Is Hinduism?, Himalayan Academy (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-934145-00-5}}, page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtues that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' ([[forgiveness]]), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K. N. (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought: A Philosophical Study of Hindu, Jaina, and Buddhist Morals, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1608-4}}, pp 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; In later verses, this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] - considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong - argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S.

===Buddhism===
{{main article|Buddhist ethics}}
Buddhist practice as outlined in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] can be regarded as a progressive list of virtues.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Right View - Realizing the [[Four Noble Truths]] (samyag-vyāyāma, sammā-vāyāma).
# Right Mindfulness - Mental ability to see things for what they are with clear consciousness (samyak-smṛti, sammā-sati).
# Right Concentration - Wholesome one-pointedness of mind (samyak-samādhi, sammā-samādhi).

Buddhism's four ''[[brahmavihara]]'' ("Divine States") can be more properly regarded as virtues in the European sense. They are:
# [[Metta]]/Maitri: loving-kindness towards all; the hope that a person will be well; loving kindness is the wish that all sentient beings, without any exception, be happy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bs-s15.htm |title=Buddhist Studies for Secondary Students, Unit 6: The Four Immeasurables |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Karuṇā]]: compassion; the hope that a person's sufferings will diminish; compassion is the wish for all sentient beings to be free from suffering.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# [[Mudita]]: altruistic joy in the accomplishments of a person, oneself or other; sympathetic joy is the wholesome attitude of rejoicing in the happiness and virtues of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;
# Upekkha/[[Upeksa|Upeksha]]: equanimity, or learning to accept both loss and gain, [[praise]] and [[blame]], success and failure with detachment, equally, for oneself and for others. Equanimity means not to distinguish between friend, enemy or stranger, but to regard every sentient being as equal. It is a clear-minded tranquil state of mind - not being overpowered by delusions, mental dullness or agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |title=A View on Buddhism, The four immeasurables: Love, Compassion, Joy and Equanimity |access-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819075238/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/immeasurables_love_compassion_equanimity_rejoicing.html |archive-date=2006-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also the [[Paramitas]] ("perfections"), which are the culmination of having acquired certain virtues. In [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]'s [[Pali Canon|canonical]] [[Buddhavamsa]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddhavamsa, chapter 2. For an on-line reference to the Buddhavamsa's seminality in the Theravada notion of ''parami'', see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]&lt;br&gt;In terms of other examples in the [[Pali literature]], Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 454, [https://archive.is/20120629172506/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:2679.pali entry for "Pāramī,"] (retrieved 2007-06-24) cites [[Jataka]] i.73 and [[Dhammapada]] [[Atthakatha]] i.84. Bodhi (2005) also mentions Acariya [[Dhammapala]]'s treatise in the [[Cariyapitaka]]-[[Atthakatha]] and the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]] [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentary (''tika'')]].&lt;/ref&gt; there are Ten Perfections (''dasa pāramiyo''). In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, the [[Lotus Sutra]] (''Saddharmapundarika''), there are Six Perfections; while in the [[Dasabhumika Sutra|Ten Stages]] (''Dasabhumika'') Sutra, four more ''Paramitas'' are listed.

===Bahá'í faith===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], virtues are direct spiritual qualities that the human soul possesses, inherited from the world of God. The development and manifestation of these virtues is the theme of the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and are discussed in great detail as the underpinnings of a divinely-inspired society by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] in such texts as ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Daoism===
"Virtue", translated from Chinese ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ([[Wikt:德|德]]), is also an important concept in [[Chinese philosophy]], particularly [[Daoism]]. ''De'' ({{zh|c=德|p=''dé''| w=''te''}}) originally meant normative "virtue" in the sense of "personal character; inner strength; integrity", but semantically changed to moral "virtue; kindness; morality". Note the semantic parallel for English ''[[Wikt:virtue|virtue]]'', with an archaic meaning of "inner potency; divine power" (as in "by virtue of") and a modern one of "moral excellence; goodness".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In early periods of [[Confucianism]], moral manifestations of "virtue" include ''ren'' ("[[Human nature|humanity]]"), ''xiao'' ("[[filial piety]]"), and ''li'' ("[[Li (Confucian)|proper behavior, performance of rituals]]"). The notion of [[Confucianism#Humaneness|ren]] - according to Simon Leys - means "humanity" and "goodness". [[Confucianism#Humaneness|Ren]] originally had the archaic meaning in the Confucian Book of Poems of "virility", but progressively took on shades of ethical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Yu-sheng: "The evolution of the pre-Confucian meaning of jen and the Confucian concept of moral autonomy," Monumenta Serica, vol.31, 1974-75&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider the virtues identified in early Confucianism as non-theistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"&gt;Yang, C. K. (1971), Religion in Chinese society: a study of contemporary social functions of religion and some of their historical factors, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-88133-621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daoist concept of ''De'', compared to Confucianism, is more subtle, pertaining to the "virtue" or ability that an individual realizes by following the [[Tao|Dao]] ("the Way"). One important normative value in much of Chinese thinking is that one's social status should result from the amount of virtue that one demonstrates, rather than from one's birth. In the ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] explains ''de'' as follows: "He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu Lunyu 2/1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005031/http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?no=17&amp;l=Lunyu |date=2007-09-27 }}, tr. [[James Legge]]&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods, particularly from the Tang dynasty period, Confucianism as practiced, absorbed and melded its own concepts of virtues with those from Daoism and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt;

==Samurai virtue==
In [[Hagakure]], Yamamoto Tsunetomo encapsulates his views on 'virtue' in the four vows he makes daily:&lt;ref&gt;''Hagakure: The Secret Wisdom of the Samurai'', by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, Translated by Alexander Bennett, Tuttle Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|978-4-8053-1198-1}} (Full Translation)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Never to be outdone in the way of the samurai or [[bushido]].
# To be of good use to the master.
# To be filial to my parents.
# To manifest great compassion and act for the sake of Man.

Yamamoto goes on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If one dedicates these four vows to the gods and Buddhas every morning, he will have the strength of two men and never slip backward. One must edge forward like the inchworm, bit by bit. The gods and Buddhas, too, first started with a vow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Bushidō code is typified by seven virtues:&lt;ref&gt;see Random House's Japanese-English, English-Japanese Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rectitude (義,gi)
* Courage (勇,yuu)
* Benevolence (仁,jin)
* Respect (礼,rei)
* Honesty (誠,sei)
* Honor (誉,yo)
* Loyalty (忠,chuu)

Others that are sometimes added to these:
* Filial piety (孝,kō)
* Wisdom (智,chi)
* Care for the aged (悌,tei)

==Philosophers' views==
===Valluvar===
While religious scriptures generally consider ''[[dharma]]'' or ''aṟam'' (the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] term for virtue) as a divine virtue, [[Valluvar]] describes it as a way of life rather than any spiritual observance, a way of harmonious living that leads to universal happiness.&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”&gt;{{cite book |author= N. Sanjeevi |title= First All India Tirukkural Seminar Papers |url= |year= 1973 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of Madras | location=Chennai |isbn = |page= xxiii–xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Valluvar keeps ''aṟam'' as the cornerstone throughout the writing of the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]].&lt;ref name="UMI_WhyNationalBook?"&gt;{{cite book

While [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]] such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and their descendants opined that justice cannot be defined and that it was a divine mystery, Valluvar positively suggested that a divine origin is not required to define the concept of justice. In the words of [[V. R. Nedunchezhiyan]], justice according to Valluvar "dwells in the minds of those who have knowledge of the standard of right and wrong; so too deceit dwells in the minds which breed fraud."&lt;ref name=”Sanjeevi_SeminarPapers”/&gt;

===René Descartes===
For the [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]], virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Men should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that these goods contribute to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;Blom, John J., ''Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology''. New York University Press. 1978. {{ISBN|0-8147-0999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'', expresses true virtue as different from what commonly is known about this moral trait. In Kant's view, to be goodhearted, benevolent and sympathetic is not regarded as true virtue. The only aspect that makes a human truly virtuous is to behave in accordance with moral principles. Kant presents an example for more clarification; suppose that you come across a needy person in the street; if your [[sympathy]] leads you to help that person, your response does not illustrate your virtue. In this example, since you do not afford helping all needy ones, you have behaved unjustly, and it is out of the domain of principles and true virtue. Kant applies the approach of [[four temperaments]] to distinguish truly virtuous people. According to Kant, among all people with diverse temperaments, a person with [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] frame of mind is the most virtuous whose thoughts, words and deeds are one of principles.

=== Friedrich Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s view of virtue is based on the idea of an order of rank among people. For Nietzsche, the virtues of the strong are seen as vices by the weak and slavish, thus Nietzsche's virtue ethics is based on his distinction between [[master and slave morality|master morality and slave morality]]. Nietzsche promotes the virtues of those he calls "higher men", people like Goethe and Beethoven. The virtues he praises in them are their creative powers (“the men of great creativity” - “the really great men according to my understanding” (WP 957)).
According to Nietzsche these higher types are solitary, pursue a "unifying project", revere themselves and are healthy and life-affirming.&lt;ref name="Leiter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/#2 |last= Leiter |first=Brian |title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mixing with the herd makes one base, the higher type “strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority…” (BGE 26). The 'Higher type' also "instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities" (WP 944) in the form of an "organizing idea" for their life, which drives them to artistic and creative work and gives them psychological health and strength.&lt;ref name="Leiter"/&gt; The fact that the higher types are "healthy" for Nietzsche does not refer to physical health as much as a psychological resilience and fortitude. Finally, a Higher type affirms life because he is willing to accept the [[eternal return]] of his life and affirm this forever and unconditionally.

In the last section of ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche outlines his thoughts on the noble virtues and places [[solitude]] as one of the highest virtues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude. Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclination and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people (“society”) inevitably makes things unclean. Somewhere, sometime, every
community makes people – “base.” (BGE §284)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche also sees truthfulness as a virtue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genuine honesty, assuming that this is our virtue and we cannot get rid of it, we free spirits – well then, we will want to work on it with all the love and malice at our disposal and not get tired of ‘perfecting’ ourselves in our virtue, the only one we have left: may its glory come to rest like a gilded, blue evening glow of mockery over this aging culture and its dull and dismal seriousness! ([[Beyond Good and Evil]], §227)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Benjamin Franklin ===
[[File:Seal of Virginia.svg|thumb|upright|Virtue, spear in hand, with her foot on the prostrate form of [[Tyranny]] on the [[Sic Semper Tyrannis|Great Seal of Virginia]]]]
These are the virtues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftrain.com/franklin_improving_self.html Franklin's 13 Virtues] Extract of Franklin's autobiography, compiled by Paul Ford.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Benjamin Franklin]] used to develop what he called 'moral perfection'. He had a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to his virtues.

They became known through [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin's autobiography]].

# Temperance: Eat not to Dullness. Drink not to Elevation.
# Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself. Avoid trifling Conversation.
# [[Order (virtue)|Order]]: Let all your Things have their Places. Let each Part of your Business have its Time.
# Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality: Make no Expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Waste nothing.
# Industry: Lose no Time. Be always employed in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary Actions.
# Sincerity: Use no hurtful Deceit. Think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice: Wrong none, by doing Injuries or omitting the Benefits that are your Duty.
# Moderation: Avoid Extremes. Forbear resenting Injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness: Tolerate no Uncleanness in Body, Clothes or Habitation.
# Tranquility: Be not disturbed at Trifles, or at Accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity: Rarely use [[wikt:venery#Etymology 2|Venery]] but for Health or Offspring; Never to Dullness, Weakness, or the Injury of your own or another's Peace or Reputation.
# Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

==Contemporary views==

===Virtues as emotions===
Marc Jackson in his book ''Emotion and Psyche'' puts forward a new development of the virtues. He identifies the virtues as what he calls the good emotions "The first group consisting of [[love]], [[kindness]], [[joy]], [[faith]], [[awe]] and [[pity]] is good"&lt;ref&gt;Marc Jackson (2010) ''Emotion and Psyche.'' O-books. p. 12 ({{ISBN|978-1-84694-378-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; These virtues differ from older accounts of the virtues because they are not character traits expressed by action, but emotions that are to be felt and developed by feeling not acting.

===In Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]] held that her morality, the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)#Ethics: rational self-interest|morality of reason]], contained a single axiom: existence exists, and a single choice: to live. All values and virtues proceed from these. To live, man must hold three fundamental values that one develops and achieves in life: Reason, Purpose, and Self-Esteem. A value is "that which one acts to gain and/or keep ... and the virtue[s] [are] the act[ions] by which one gains and/or keeps it." The primary virtue in [[Objectivist ethics]] is rationality, which as Rand meant it is "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness|The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism]]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; These values are achieved by passionate and consistent action and the virtues are the policies for achieving those fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Gotthelf|Gotthelf, Allan]] ''On Ayn Rand''; p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Ayn Rand describes seven virtues: rationality, productiveness, pride, independence, integrity, honesty and justice. The first three represent the three primary virtues that correspond to the three fundamental values, whereas the final four are derived from the virtue of rationality. She claims that virtue is not an end in itself, that virtue is not its own reward nor sacrificial fodder for the reward of evil, that life is the reward of virtue and happiness is the goal and the reward of life. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality, not the degree of your intelligence but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of your knowledge but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn (1961) ''For the New Intellectual Galt’s Speech,'' "[[For the New Intellectual|For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]", pp. 131, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern psychology===
[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]], two leading researchers in [[positive psychology]], recognizing the deficiency inherent in [[psychology]]'s tendency to focus on dysfunction rather than on what makes a healthy and stable [[personality]], set out to develop a list of "[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of study, 24 traits (classified into six broad areas of virtue) were identified, having "a surprising amount of similarity across cultures and strongly indicat[ing] a historical and cross-cultural convergence."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. p. 36. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; These six categories of virtue are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., &amp; Seligman, M.E.P. (2004). ''Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification''. Oxford University Press. pp. 36-39. ({{ISBN|0-19-516701-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists suggest that these virtues are adequately grouped into fewer categories; for example, the same 24 traits have been grouped into simply: Cognitive Strengths, Temperance Strengths, and Social Strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie. 2010. The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of
the virtues in action inventory of strengths. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice as opposite==
{{Main article|Vice}}
{{See also|List of virtues}}
The opposite of a virtue is a [[vice]]. Vice is a habitual, repeated practice of wrongdoing. One way of organizing the vices is as the corruption of the virtues.

As [[Aristotle]] noted, however, the virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be considered the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates ''in medio stat virtus'' - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are opposites of courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the opposites of pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more "modern" virtue, [[Toleration|tolerance]], can be considered the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness on the one hand and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the opposites of virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5599">'''Water torture''' encompasses a variety of techniques using [[water]] to inflict physical or psychological harm on a victim as a form of [[torture]] or execution.

==Forced ingestion==
{{Main|Water cure (torture)}}
In this form of water torture, water is forced down the throat and into the stomach. It was used as a legal torture and execution method by the courts in [[France]] in the 17th and 18th century. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century it was used against [[Philippines|Filipinos]] by American Forces during the [[Philippine–American War]] and was employed against [[British Commonwealth]], [[United States|American]] and [[China|Chinese]] prisoners during [[World War II]] by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Knights of Bushido: A Short History of Japanese War Crimes'' by Edward Frederick Langley Russell, Baron Russell of Liverpool (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Rights Watch]] organization reports that in the 2000s, security forces in [[Uganda]] sometimes forced a detainee to lie face up under an open water [[spigot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/04/27/china10549.htm#UGANDA Human Rights News: Torture Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water intoxication]] can result from drinking too much water. This has caused some fatalities over the years in [[Fraternities_and_sororities_in_North_America|fraternities]] in [[North America]] during initiation week.  For example, a person was [[hazing|hazed]] to death by [[Chi Tau]] of [[Chico State]] (California) in 2005 via the forcing of pushups and the drinking of water from a bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5012154|title=A Fraternity Hazing Gone Wrong|last=Korry|first=Elaine|date=November 14, 2005|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fear of drowning==
{{Main|Waterboarding}}
Waterboarding refers to a technique involving water poured over the face or head of the subject, in order to evoke the instinctive fear of [[drowning]]. Often a wet cloth is placed in the subject's mouth, giving them the impression that they are drowning.&lt;!-- there have been many claims that this torture is used. Although it is common belief that waterboarding merely simulates the fear of drowning, however the technique is actually a slow and controlled system of drowning.--&gt;

==Dripping water==
{{Main|Chinese water torture}}
What is called the "[[Chinese water torture]]" was a torture described by [[Hippolytus de Marsiliis]] in the 16th century that was supposed to drive its victim insane with the stress of water dripping on a part of the forehead for a very long time.  It may also be characterised by the inconsistent pattern of water drips.  There are no expert opinions on the true cause of torture in this method.

==Dunking==
{{Main|Dunking}}
This form of torture was used in the early modern period as a [[trial by ordeal]].

==Other forms==
*Supposedly, the [[Rasphuis]] in [[Amsterdam]], a 17th-century institution that attempted to rehabilitate young male criminals through labor, contained a "water dungeon," the so-called ''Waterhuis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pol|first=Lotte van der|title=Het Amsterdams hoerdom: prostitutie in de zeventiende en achttiende eeuw|year=1996|publisher=Wereldbibliotheek|page=192|quote=Het rasphuis had opvallend genoeg ook een hardnekkige mythe. In dit tuchthuis voor mannen zou een 'waterhuis' of verdrinkingscel zijn waarin gevangenen werden gezet die niet wilden werken.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If prisoners refused to work they were placed in a cellar that quickly filled with water after a [[sluice]] was opened, and were handed a [[pump]] that enabled them to keep from drowning. [[Geert Mak]] and other authors, however, point out that there is no evidence whatsoever for the existence of this room and this punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mak|first=Geert|title=Een kleine geschiedenis van Amsterdam|year=1994|publisher=Atlas|isbn=978-90-254-0416-1|page=180|quote=[[Jacob Bicker Raye]] en enkele anderen melden zelfs het - overigens onbevestigde - bestaan van een 'waterhuis'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[House of Terror]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary, shows examples of water torture used by the Nazi and Arrow Cross Parties against the Jews. One involves a sunken cell filled with ice cold water; the prisoner must stand on a tiny metal plinth in the centre of the room. When the prisoner becomes tired or falls asleep, they will fall from the plinth into the icy water.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* The water torture as inflicted in medieval Europe was sometimes intensified by mixing hot peppers, vinegar, and even urine with the water.  Central Asian tribes commonly inflicted the water torture with urine.  The Vietnamese have dunked prisoners in a tank filled with urine and feces as a form of torture. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* In the 19th century, various U.S. newspapers published details of "water torture" (or the "torture of thirst") in Japan which involved subjecting the victim to a high salt diet for several days, without rice or water, and then offering them water in exchange for a confession: "it is "difficult to imagine a more cruel device."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/65554468/?terms=%22water+torture%22|title=31 May 1879, Page 4 - The Newton Enterprise at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Whose Life Is It Anyway?''''' is a play by [[Brian Clark (writer)|Brian Clark]] adapted from his 1972 [[television movie|television play]] of the same title, which starred [[Ian McShane]]. The stage version premiered in 1978 at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in London, and subsequently opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1979. The play involves a sculptor who is paralysed.

==Plot==
Set in a hospital room, the action revolves around Ken Harrison (Claire Harrison in some later productions), a [[sculptor]] by profession, who was [[paralysed]] from the neck down ([[quadriplegia]]) in a car accident and is determined to be allowed to die. Clark presents arguments both in favour of and opposing [[euthanasia]] and to what extent government should be allowed to interfere in the life of a private citizen. In portraying Ken as an intelligent man with a useless body, he leaves the audience with conflicting feelings about his desire to end his life.

==Productions==
The play was televised on 12 March 1972 by [[Granada TV]]. It was directed by Richard Everitt, with the cast that featured Ian McShane (Ken), [[Suzanne Neve]] (Dr. Scott), and [[Philip Latham]] (Dr. Emerson).&lt;ref name=script&gt;Clark, Brian.

''Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' opened at the [[Mermaid Theatre]], London, on 6 March 1978, before playing at the [[Savoy Theatre]] from June 1978 to October 1979. This production originally starred [[Tom Conti]] and [[Jane Asher]].&lt;ref name=script/&gt; Conti transferred to New York to star in the Broadway production, which was produced by [[Emanuel Azenberg]] and directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]]. It opened at the [[Nederlander Theatre|Trafalgar Theatre]] on 17 April 1979 and ran for 223 performances and 9 previews. Conti, who was making his Broadway debut, was joined by [[Jean Marsh]] and [[Philip Bosco]]. Conti was nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] and won the 1979 [[Tony Award]] for Best Actor in a Play. Both the play itself and Lindsay-Hogg were nominated as well.

The play, again directed by Lindsay-Hogg, was revived on Broadway at the [[Royale Theatre]], where it opened on 24 February 1980 after nine previews. A gender reversal found [[Mary Tyler Moore]] in the lead role, renamed Claire, and [[James Naughton]] as her now-male doctor. [[Josef Sommer]] completed the principal cast. The play ran for 96 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/10212/Whose-Life-Is-It-Anyway "'Whose Life Is It Anyway?' Broadway 1980"] playbillvault.com, accessed December 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Moore was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Actress in a Play and won a special 1980 Tony Award for her performance.

The play was revived in London at the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]] from January to April 2005, directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]] and starring [[Kim Cattrall]] as Claire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisistheatre.com/londonshows/whoselifeisitanyway.html "'Whose Life Is It Anyway?' London 2005"] thisistheatre.com, accessed December 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Husband and wife [[Laurence Luckinbill]] and [[Lucie Arnaz]] starred in the national tour of the play. The two rotated playing the patient (Ken/Claire) and doctor.

==Adaptations==
{{main article|Whose Life Is It Anyway? (1981 film)}}
''Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' was adapted from Clark's own television film of the same title directed by [[Richard Everitt (producer)|Richard Everitt]] starring [[Ian McShane]].

A film adapted by [[Reginald Rose]] and directed by [[John Badham]] was released in 1981, starring [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[John Cassavetes]], and [[Christine Lahti]].

'''William Wynn Westcott''' (17 December 1848 &amp;ndash; 30 July 1925) was a [[coroner]], [[ceremonial magic]]ian, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] born in [[Leamington, Warwickshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;The Isiac Tablet, about the author section&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Supreme Magus (chief) of the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia|S.R.I.A]] and went on to co-found the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]].

== Biography ==

He was a doctor of medicine.{{fact|date=November 2015}}

In 1871 he became active in [[Freemasonry]] where he became Master of his home Lodge three years later and also the [[Quatuor Coronati Lodge|''Quatuor Coronati'']] research lodge (Master 1893–94&lt;ref&gt;Ars Quatuor Coronatorum Vol. 7 1895&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 1879 he moved to Hendon. In 1880 he began studying the [[Kabbalah]] and joined [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]]. In 1882 he met [[Samuel Liddell Mathers]].

=== Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia ===

{{main|Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia}}

Westcott became chief of the SRIA with the death of [[William Robert Woodman]].&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Golden Dawn ===

{{main|Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn}}

Wescott co-founded the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] with [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]] and [[William Robert Woodman]] in 1887, using the motto V.H. Frater [[wikt:sapere aude|Sapere Aude]].

Around this time, he was also active in the [[Theosophical Society]], where he founded in 1891 [[The Adelphi Lodge]] in London WC.
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
In 1896, he abandoned public involvement with the Golden Dawn due to pressure regarding his job as a Crown Coroner, with which it was seen as an unseemly association. He continued to head the S.R.I.A. and later was involved with the Golden Dawn breakaway [[Stella Matutina]].

=== Later years ===

He retired as a coroner after 1910, emigrated to [[South Africa]] in 1918, and died in [[Durban]] in 1925.

'''Yaakov Teitel''' ({{lang-he-n|יעקב טייטל}}, born November 1972) is an American-born [[Israelis|Israeli]] religious nationalist, convicted for killing two people in 2009. Teitel, who had immigrated to Israel in 2000, settling in a [[West Bank]] [[Israeli settlement|settlement]],&lt;ref name="ynet"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3798629,00.html |title=Settler suspected of multiple hate crimes |work=[[Ynetnews]] |date= 1 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1125063.html |title=Settler admits to murder, series of bomb attacks |work=[[Haaretz]] |first=Amos |last=Harel |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1934103,00.html |title=Accused Jewish Terrorist Jack Teitel |date= 3 November 2009 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Randy |last=James |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; confessed to planning and committing various acts of terrorism and hate crimes against [[Palestinians]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[Left-wing politics|left-wingers]], missionary [[Christians]], and police officers across Israel. Teitel was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], which he is currently serving.

== Early life ==
Yaakov Teitel was born in 1972 in [[Florida]], United States, and moved to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], when he was a teenager. His father, Mark, was a retired [[dentist]] who had served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and his mother, Dianne, was a medical secretary - both of whom became [[Haredi Jews]] later in life. Commonly known as Jack, Teitel attended [[university]] and received a bachelor's degree in [[psychology]], and in the mid-1990s, he began making regular visits to Israel. He was arrested in August 1997 on suspicion of murdering a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[shepherd]], but was released, and the case was eventually closed due to lack of evidence. Teitel subsequently returned to the United States, where he took a computer course with [[Microsoft]], and began working as a computer technician.

== Emigration to Israel ==
In 1999, Teitel immigrated to Israel and moved to the settlement of [[Shvut Rachel]], becoming an Israeli citizen under the [[Law of Return]] in December 2000. The following year, his parents and sister also emigrated to Israel, and settled in [[Beitar Illit]], an [[Ultra-Orthodox Jews|Ultra-Orthodox]] city in the [[Gush Etzion]] settlement bloc. In 2002, Teitel met Rivka Pepperman, a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born dance teacher originally from [[Broughton Park]], [[Manchester]], whose family had moved to Israel in 1981. They married the following year, and had four children. Teitel was summoned by [[Israel Defense Forces]] for preliminary checks, but was exempted from [[conscription]] due to his advanced age, medical history, and familial state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Gili Cohen6 hours ago |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/who-is-suspected-jewish-terrorist-yaakov-teitel-1.4998 |title=Who Is Suspected Jewish Terrorist Yaakov Teitel? |publisher=Israel News Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/israel-news/21868/jewish-terrorist-god-proud-me |title=Jewish 'terrorist': God is proud of me |publisher=The Jewish Chronicle Thejc.com |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitel was considered an outcast in the settlement due to his limited proficiency in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and reclusive behavior. He hardly left his home, and did not regularly participate in services at the local synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.5227288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/the-two-faces-of-accused-terrorist-jack-teitel/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terrorist acts and arrest ==
Teitel was arrested in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Har Nof]] neighborhood on October 7, 2009, while posting [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s praising the [[2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting]]. He attempted to throw away a bag he was carrying, but it was retrieved, and was found to contain two [[handguns]]. Teitel was then turned over to [[Shin Bet]] for interrogation, while special police units raided his home and the homes of his brother-in-law, parents, and mother-in-law. The search of his property revealed a cache of guns, parts used in [[explosive]] devices, pellets used to maximize the impact of explosives, [[binoculars]], and flyers containing [[anti-gay]] incitement. The explosives were all detonated safely by the police, and a search of his home two days later found a [[bomb]] buried in the backyard.&lt;ref name="ynet" /&gt;

Israeli police revealed that Teitel, acting alone, confessed to a string of terrorist attacks and attempted attacks. Teitel confessed to having carried out a [[Ze'ev Sternhell#Attack|pipe-bomb attack against Ze'ev Sternhell]], as well as the murders of a Palestinian taxi driver and a [[West Bank]] shepherd in 1997, a 2006 attempted bombing near the settlement of [[Eli, Mateh Binyamin|Eli]], three bombings against police targets and a [[Christian]] monastery in 2007, and sending a [[booby-trapped]] package that injured a teenage boy to the home of a [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jewish]] family in [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]].&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=2 November 2009 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1102/1224257903312.html |title=Israeli police arrest West Bank settler over Palestinian killings |first=Mark |last=Weiss |accessdate=2009-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[CBN News]] |date=6 November 2009 |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2009/November/Suspect-Arrest-Announced-in-Ami-Ortiz-Case/ |title=Suspect Arrest Announced in Ami Ortiz Case |first=Chris |last=Mitchell |accessdate=2009-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Haaretz |date=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/1125062.html |title=Who is suspected Jewish terrorist Yaakov Teitel? |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Teitel's confession, his [[DNA]] was found to match DNA retrieved from Sternhell's home after the bombing attack.&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt; Teitel also confessed that he had planned to fly a remote-controlled toy plane containing explosives into the [[Tel Aviv]] gay pride parade, and that he planned a bombing against a [[Jerusalem]] gay bar. He also admitted that he planned to fire an improvised [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] against the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], but abandoned the plan over fear of injuring Jewish worshippers on the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=164915 |title=Leaks are prejudicing course of justice, complains Ya'acov Teitel's new attorney |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teitel was also suspected of murdering two police officers in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], and confessed to the [[2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting|gay centre shooting]] in Tel Aviv in 2009, though police stated that they were certain he was not involved in either.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257417385328&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Police clear Yosef Espinoza, suspected Teitel accomplice |first=Ben |last=Hartman |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date= 5 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discoveries, Teitel was held by Shin Bet in special custody for 48 hours, without being allowed to see an [[Lawyer|attorney]] or brought before a judge. The [[Petah Tikva]] District Court denied appeals from his attorney to meet with him, and subsequently extended both his remand and the special ordnance banning him from meeting his lawyer. All of Teitel's [[arraignment]]s were held behind closed doors, and a [[gag order]] was imposed on the case.&lt;ref name="ynet"/&gt;

On 10 November 2009, the Jerusalem District Prosecutor's Office declared that Teitel would be charged for the murder of the two Palestinians, incitement to racism, deploying explosive devices, and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1127200.html |title=Alleged Jewish terrorist to be charged with murdering two Palestinians |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |work=Haaretz |date= 10 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teitel's legal defense was provided by ''Honenu'', an organization which provides legal defense for Israelis accused of crimes against Arabs or the Israeli security forces. Honenu founder Shmuel Meidad suggested that Teitel may be [[Insanity|mentally unstable]], stating that, "It's my impression that this man is sick, but he's not nearly as sick as the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1257455202910&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Teitel's defense provided by 'Honenu' |first=Ben |last=Hartman |work=The Jerusalem Post |date= 7 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 2010, Jerusalem's district [[psychiatrist]] ruled Teitel unfit to stand trial. The evaluation was criticized by [[Israeli-Arab]] [[Knesset]] members, with [[Ahmad Tibi]] stating, "An Arab who shoots a Jew in Israel is a terrorist, but a Jew who shoots Arabs is insane."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/jewish-terror-suspect-unfit-to-stand-trial-1.288172 |first=Chaim |last=Levinson |title=Jewish terror suspect 'unfit to stand trial' |work=Haaretz |date=4 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a new psychiatric evaluation, the district court overturned the previous ruling, and declared Teitel fit for trial, on 30 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3946310,00.html |first=Aviad |last=Glickman |title=Teitel deemed fit to stand trial |work=Ynetnews |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conviction ==

In February 2012, the Jerusalem District Prosecutor's Office and Teitel's attorneys reached an agreement under which he would confess to two counts of murder. Teitel's attorneys confessed on his behalf, as Teitel himself announced that did not recognize the court's jurisdiction.
