He pleaded guilty to financial and conspiracy charges in 2004, which resulted in a 23-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="AL-Ahram"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/714/in3.htm 28 Fall from grace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022163245/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/714/in3.htm |date=2008-10-22 }}, [[Al-Ahram Weekly]], October 28 – November 3, 2004 Issue No. 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Al-Amoudi was born in [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref name="DOJPressRelease"&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2004/October/04_crm_698.htm|title=Abdurahman Alamoudi Sentenced to Jail in Terrorism Financing Case|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|date=October 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Markon"&gt;Jerry Markon, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36718-2004Oct15.html Muslim Activist Sentenced to 23 Years for Libya Contacts], ''Washington Post'' (October 16, 2004), A17.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved from [[Yemen]] to the United States in 1979,&lt;ref name="ChargesNYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/30/national/30TERR.html U.S. Charges Islamic Leader Who Met Bush], ''New York Times'' (September 30, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  and became a U.S. citizen in 1996.&lt;ref name="DOJPressRelease"/&gt; Al-Amoudi was automatically stripped of this citizenship by the U.S. after his conviction on terrorism-related charges.&lt;ref name="Markon"/&gt;

Al-Amoudi lived in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Markon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChargesNYT"/&gt;

== Organizations ==
According to the ''Washington Post'', before his arrest and guilty plea, was Alamoudi was "one of America's best-known Muslim activists" and "met with senior Clinton and Bush administration officials in his efforts to bolster Muslim political prominence."&lt;ref name="Markon"/&gt; Al-Amoudi founded and was the executive director of the American Muslim Foundation and "was an influential member of other Islamic political and charitable organizations."&lt;ref name="DOJPressRelease"/&gt; Al-Amoudi also played a role in establishing a [[U.S. Department of Defense]] Muslim chaplain program.&lt;ref name="Markon"/&gt; Alamoudi met with President [[George W. Bush]] and contributed $1,000 to his campaign; Al-Amoudi donated the same amount to the [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|U.S. Senate campaign]] of [[Hillary Clinton]]. Both Bush and Clinton later returned the money.&lt;ref name="ChargesNYT"/&gt; Al-Amoudi was invited by the Bush White House to speak at a [[Washington National Cathedral]] prayer service in memory of victims of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Gjelten]], ''A Nation of Nations: A Great American Immigration Story'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Amoudi was a founder of the [[Islamic Society of Boston]] (ISB).&lt;ref name="Shane"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/us/boston-muslims-struggle-to-wrest-image-of-islam-from-terrorists.html|title=Boston Muslims Struggle to Wrest Image of Islam From Terrorists|last=Shane|first=Scott|date=2015-06-15|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the Society's articles of incorporation and served as the first president of the Society's [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] mosque, which was also attended by the [[Boston Marathon bombing|Boston Marathon bombers]] (Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev), as well as by convicted terrorists [[Aafia Siddiqui]] and [[Tarek Mehanna]].&lt;ref&gt;Oren Dorell, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/23/boston-mosque-radicals/2101411/ Mosque that Boston suspects attended has radical ties], ''USA Today'' (April 25, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversial statements ==
During an interview with a Middle East television channel in March 1997, Al-Amoudi declared: "I really consider him (Hamas deputy political leader [[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook|Musa Abu Marzook]]) to be from among the best people in the Islamic movement," and added that he worked with Marzook and Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner, Harvey W. (1998). ''The Future of Terrorism: Violence in the New Millennium'' (Sage Publications), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In a phone call intercepted by a [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agent and recounted in a court [[affidavit]], Alamoudi lamented that the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in Africa did not kill any Americans and suggested that more attacks should be carried out similar to the [[AMIA bombing|1994 Jewish cultural center bombing]] in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/oct/5/20031005-111130-4622r/|title=The al-Amoudi terror charges|last=|first=|website=The Washington Times|access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their [[PBS]] documentary miniseries ''[[America at a Crossroads]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'' journalists [[Mark Hosenball]] and [[Michael Isikoff]] report that Al-Amoudi was "an influential [Muslim] [[Muslim Brotherhood|Brotherhood]] supporter described as an 'expert in the art of deception' by an FBI insider" for expressing moderate, pro-American sympathies in his lobbying and public relations work with Americans, but then expressing support for [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]] at an Islamist rally.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/crossroads/about/show_the_brotherhood.html|title=America at a Crossroads: Inside the Muslim Brotherhood |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crown Prince Abdullah assassination plot and conviction on U.S. federal criminal charges==
Alamoudi was indicted in 2003 in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/terrorism/usalamoudi102303ind.pdf United States v. Abdurahman Muhammad Alamoudi, a/k/a Abdulrahman]'' - indictment in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]]&lt;/ref&gt; for illegal dealings with Libya that included his involvement in a complex and "bizarre" plot,&lt;ref name="Shane"/&gt; financed by the Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi|Muammar Qaddafi]], to have then-Saudi Crown Prince [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] killed by two Britain-based [[al-Qaeda]] operatives.&lt;ref name="Markon"/&gt; Alamoudi was arrested in September 2003 at [[Dulles International Airport]] after arriving on a flight from London.&lt;ref name="ChargesNYT"/&gt; He was charged with accepting $10,700 from the Libyan Mission to the United Nations while Libya was listed as one of the seven state sponsors of terrorism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Alamoudi admitted "that he pocketed nearly $1 million and used it to pay conspirators in the plot, which sources said came close to succeeding before it was broken up by Saudi intelligence officials."&lt;ref name="Markon"/&gt;

On July 30, 2004, Alamoudi pleaded guilty to three federal criminal charges: "one count of violating the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] (IEEPA), which imposes terrorism-related sanctions prohibiting unlicensed travel to and commerce with Libya; one count of false statements made in his application for naturalization; and a tax offense involving a long-term scheme to conceal from the IRS his financial transactions with Libya and his foreign bank accounts and to omit material information from the tax returns filed by his charities."&lt;ref name="DOJPressRelease"/&gt;

He agreed to cooperate in ongoing investigations in return for prosecutors dropping 31 other counts and possible reduction in a pending 23-year sentence and $750,000 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-557063/U-S-Muslim-admits-guilt.html U.S. Muslim admits guilt in plot; Conspired to kill Saudi prince], [[Washington Times]], July 31, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasha Saad, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/702/re4.htm Libyan quandary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723031219/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/702/re4.htm |date=2009-07-23 }}, [[Al-Ahram Weekly]],  5 – August 11, 2004
Issue No. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. District Judge [[Claude M. Hilton]] sentenced Alamoudi to 276 months (23 years) in prison in October 2004,&lt;ref name="DOJPressRelease"/&gt; the maximum sentence.&lt;ref name="Crampton"&gt;Thomas Crampton, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/16/politics/muslim-advocate-sentenced-to-23-years-for-libyan-dealings.html Muslim Advocate Sentenced to 23 Years for Libyan Dealings], ''New York Times'' (October 16, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; For his [[immigration fraud]], Alamoudi was also stripped of his citizenship.&lt;ref name="Markon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crampton"/&gt;

The September 2003 affidavit against Alamoudi also alleged that his money not only went to al Qaeda, but also to Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).  In addition, the affidavit states that he was granted power of attorney for 22 family members of people detained in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for suspicion of ties to Al Qaeda.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The U.S. Department of the Treasury cited Alamoudi on the occasion of the July 2005 terrorist designation of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia as providing support to al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Treasury Designates MIRA for Support to Al Qaida|url = http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js2632.aspx|website = www.treasury.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashtadiggajas''' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]: అష్టదిగ్గజాలు) is the collective title given to the eight Telugu [[poets]] in the [[Noble court|court]] of the [[monarch|emperor]] [[Sri]] [[Krishna Deva Raya]] who ruled the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] from 1509 until his death in 1529. During his reign, [[Telugu people|Telugu]] literature and culture reached its zenith. In his court, eight poets were regarded as the eight pillars of his literary assembly. The age of Ashtadiggajas is called ''[[Telugu poetry#Prabandha era|Prabandha Age]]'' (1540 AD to 1600).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Tenali Ramakrishna]] hailed from the [[Guntur district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. [[Ramarajabhushanudu]] was another Ashtadiggaja.

==Etymology==
The title ''Ashtadiggajas'' (Ashta + dik + gaja) means ''elephants in eight directions''. It refers to the old [[Hindu]] belief that eight [[elephants]] hold the [[earth]] in eight directions which are namely Airaavata, Pundareeka, Vaamana, Kumuda, Anjana, Pushpadanta, Sarwabhouma, Suprateeka, whose wives are Abhra, Kapila, Pingala, Anupama, Taamraparni, Subhradanti, Angana, Anjanaavati. The court of poets were also called ''Bhuvana Vijayam'' (Conquest of the World).&lt;ref&gt;[http://surrealist.org/gurukula/storymatters/nrsimha.html Legend in Vaishnavites about Eight elephants. One such mentioning of elephants is that Hiranayakasipu sent eight elephants carrying earth to kill Prahlada.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 71|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
These poets were 
*[[Allasani Peddana|Allasani Peddanna]]
*[[Nandi Thimmana]]
*[[Madayyagari Mallana]]
*[[Dhurjati|Dhurjaty]]
*[[Ayyalaraju Ramambhadrudu]]
*[[Pingali Surana]]
*[[Ramarajabhushanudu]]
*[[Tenali Ramakrishna]]

The most famous being Allasani Peddana honoured with the title ''Andhrakavitapitamaha'' (Progenitor of Telugu poetry) and [[Tenali Ramakrishna]], Krishnadevaraya's court jester who authored several acclaimed works.&lt;ref&gt;Like the Nine gems of King Vikramaditya's court, the Ashtadiggajas of Krishnadevara's court are famous in legend, K.A. Nilakanta Sastry, [[History of South India]], From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar, 1955, OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p372&lt;/ref&gt;

==More Details==
Though the above listed eight poets are widely regarded as the Ashtadiggajas, there are some differences of opinion as to who exactly constituted the Ashtadiggajas and if the composition of this body changed over time. Some literary works mention the name of ''Bhattu-Murti'' in place of [[Ramarajabhushanudu]] and some accounts mention [[Pingali Surana]] and [[Tenali Ramakrishna]] also as members of the later emperors.  From the stone inscriptions of that time, it has been inferred that the [[village]] of Thippalur in the present-day [[Cuddapah]] district was given to the Ashtadiggajas by the emperor.

==Works==
[[Allasani Peddana]] wrote ''Manucharitramu'' and dedicated to the Emperor [[Krishna Deva Raya]]. [[Nandi Thimmana]] wrote ''Parijataapaharanam'' and dedicated it to the emperor as well. [[Madayyagari Mallana]] wrote ''Rajasekhara Charitramu''. [[Dhurjati]] wrote ''Kalahasti Mahatyamu''. [[Ayyalaraju Ramabhadrudu]] wrote ''Ramaabhyudayamu''. Pingali Surana wrote ''Raghavapandaveeyamu'', a dual work that describes both [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. Ramarajabhushanudu wrote ''Kavyalankarasangrahamu'', ''Vasucharitramu'' and ''Harischandranalopakhyanamu''. [[Tenali Ramakrishna]] wrote ''Udbhataradhya Charitramu'', ''Panduranga Mahatmyamu'' and "Ghatikachala Mahatmyamu."

==Literary style==
Telugu literature reached its peak during their period. A new style called ''[[Telugu poetry#Prabandha era|prabandha]]'' with added fiction and few omissions from the original stories was followed during this period. Poets in earlier century like [[Tikkana]] and [[Potana]] translated the [[Sanskrit]] books and epics without changing the stories from original. Ashtadiggajas usually took small, some times obscure, stories from [[Purana]]s and used them as plots for writing major [[Kāvya]]s. A ''Prabandham'' can be of three types, viz., Prakhyatam, Utpadyam, Misramam (famous story, purely fictional story, mixed story).&lt;ref name="Adluri 1998" /&gt; Ashtadiggajas have written in all the three genres during the ''Prabandha Yugam''. 

There are also at least two dual meaning works during this time. ''Raghavapandaveeyam'' by Pingali Surana simultaneously runs the stories of [[Rama]] and [[Pandavas]]. ''Harischandranalopakhyanamu'' by Bhattumurthy also simultaneously tells the stories of the emperors [[Harischandra]] and [[Nala]].

'''Attan''' ({{lang-ps|''' اتڼ'''}}) is a form of dance that originated in [[Afghanistan]]. The Attan began as a [[folk dance]] conducted by [[Pashtuns]] in times of war or during weddings or other celebrations (engagements, new year, and informal gatherings). It is now considered the national dance of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia/Pacific|author1=Rubin, D.|author2=Pong, M.|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415260879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=maGU4ziPQJQC|page=38|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of the attan dance has been a long customary in the [[Pashtun culture]] and is carried by Pashtuns mostly, and other ethnic groups as well.&lt;ref&gt;"attan." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 13 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/42102/attan&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222134846/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/42102/attan |date=February 22, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attan is a special type of dance performed by a troupe of 50 to 100 dancers who wave red scarves in the air while musicians beat drums. This dance is common among the Pashtuns and promoted it as the national dance of Afghanistan. As time has passed, the special dance has changed from a dance done by troupe dancers only to anyone who wishes to perform this dance at any celebration.

==Origin==
Attan is a traditional Pashtun dance. It is said to be one of the oldest forms of Pashtun pagan dance. Some identify attan as a religious ceremony of early [[Zoroastrians]] placing its origins as early as 2000&amp;nbsp;BCE, while others have placed even older going back to King Yama's celebration of Nowroz and warriors dancing and circling around the fire. It is usually performed with a [[Dhol]], which is a double-headed barrel drum. The dance can be anywhere from 5 minute to 30 minutes long. There are many different regional variations of attan, the most famous being Mahsudi, Kabuli, Paktiyaya, Shenwari, Kandahari, Sistani, Herati, Pashayi, and Nuristani. During King Yama's time, attan was performed before going to a war because it used to give the army the confidence that they could win the battle. Attan is the national dance of [[Afghanistan]] and also a very popular dance in Pakistan's North-Western regions (Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province and parts of upper Balochistan) and has spread and become a part of festivals, weddings, and other forms of celebrations, and has its origins from [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] areas.

==Movement==
To the accompaniment of drums and pipes the dancers form a circle, taking each other by the hand or preparing to revolve in circles of their own. The dance starts with slow steps that gradually get faster and faster until it seems the performers must drop from exhaustion. However, the dance continues, sometimes for two or three hours at a stretch, with no breaks except a lowering of tempo or changes in the tunes and songs.&lt;ref name="Wilber, Donald N. 1962"&gt;Wilber, Donald N., (1962) ''Afghanistan, Its People, Its Society Its Culture.'' New Haven: Hraf Press. {{oclc|410960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What the Attan Dance consists of:'''
The dancers gather in a circle, and then is followed by music which starts slow at first, and then gradually speeds up. There is a consistent beat and rhythm, and during that specific beat is when they clap inside the circle, so the movement of the hands is outside prior to the beat. It is then followed by the dancers bringing their hands out and then clapping inside the circle, and it is the same routine and pattern of movement, which then get faster. As the movements and routine get faster, the one clap turns into two claps, and the dancers who are more advanced, at times will add turns into the movements. All in all, they must keep the circular path with the clap on the beat, every other move added is up to the individuals who originate and add their own personal style to the dance. Common dance moves involve the extending of arms into air and the stretch and extension of legs. When extending arms into air, there are times when the hands are free or there is the waving of the regalia and extension of the attire to show the detail and color.

==Instruments==

Most essential instrument of course is the [[Dhol]] (Drum). But dhols vary by sizes, for some types the size is relatively small. The reason for that could be geographic but the distinction between dhols is apparent among the various types of Attans. The [[tablah]] (also known as darbukkah or dumbak) is a single-headed hand-drum found in most Arab music ensembles. The goblet-shaped body (cylindrical with a slightly narrowed waist) was traditionally made out of fired clay, and the sounding head out of goat, calf, or fish skin, stretched and glued permanently on the body. The second most important instrument is the [[zurna]] surnay, although very common, the surna is not essential with every type. Another instrument that is specific to some styles, is the [[Pump organ|Harmonium]] (Baja), given the size and shape of the harmonium it is usually played while sitting on the ground, but for Attans, the harmonium is bound in a shawl that is wrapped around the players back. A very rare one is the [[Sarangi]] just like Baja this one too is supposed to be played while sitting down but for Attan, the musicians strap it in front to walk along the group of dancers.

==Attire==
[[File:Attan Regalia for Women.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Attan regalia for a woman, with mirrors on the front, sleeves, and the bottom of the dress.]]
Performers often wear traditional [[regalia]] when participating in the lively dance. For men, the [[pakol]] (a thick wool hat) is usually worn, as well as a waskata (thick wool vest)&lt;ref name="villagehatshop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagehatshop.com/media/images/viewer/155300AfghanPakolHat/medium_155300AfghanPakolHat1.jpg |title=Hats and Caps - Village Hat Shop - Best Selection Online |publisher=villagehatshop.com |accessdate=2015-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706230146/http://www.villagehatshop.com/media/images/viewer/155300AfghanPakolHat/medium_155300AfghanPakolHat1.jpg |archivedate=2012-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually during the celebratory occasions, men can also be seen wearing suits and ties for a more formal look.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.k5.dion.ne.jp/~museum/costume/costume_picture/waskat01.JPG{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women can be found wearing bright, colorful dresses. These dresses can be accompanied with tiny mirrors on them which are said to symbolize light. The tiny mirrors add great detail and shine under the lights as the women move and dance.

==Styles and types==
[[File:Khattak Dance.jpg|thumb|300px|A Pashtun man performing Attan a.k.a. [[Khattak dance]] in [[Pakistan]]]]
The Attan is performed differently in many of the different [[Pashtun tribes]]. Some styles of Attan portray themes of war while others portray celebration, especially for events such as marriage, engagements, family gatherings and also as a prelude to the arrival of spring.

All different kinds of Attan are danced with the beats of the drums. However they all differ in style. The beater of the drum known as "Dum", who instantaneously change the rhythm, is circled by the performers.
Below is a list of common attan styles.

* Kochai/ Kochyano - Pashtun nomadic style done in both Afghanistan and Pakistan Kochyano Attan or literally Attan of the Kuchi. Women usually perform this attan during their own occasions, such as childbirth or new years (nou rooz) and coming of spring. The men usually perform with long hair, almost to shoulder length and cut straight across the back, and some may sport a very wild mustache or beard. It is usually performed with Handkerchiefs, and involves lots of spotting movements, with multiple twists and squatting. This dance can be up to 10 steps, and also involve men walking with their knees or standing erect and snapping their head in random directions to the beat of the Dhol. The depth and complexity of their Attan may be because of the wide range of valleys they trek, and many other forms may have influenced it. This dance is performed with the musician tuning the beat to the technique of the performers.
* Logarai - From the Afghan province of [[Logar Province|Logar]] Logari dancers have always been known for their shyness and also for their rhythmic interruptions and spins during their local dance. Their Attan also has the trademark spins of the Logari style, using the clapping and the full twists in place, as arms are usually in the air and come together medially during the circular dance with one or two claps in the center. It is not uncommon to see one ore two circles in one. This dance typically performed by men and/or women or even young boys and/or girls. The men occasionally wear Turbans and they are taken off usually during the end of the dance when the beats get faster. The sweat on their heads from wearing the Turban, puts added weight to their hair. This dance is performed either with the beat of the musician or the musician tuning the beat to the technique of the performers.
* Paktiawal / Khostai - Notable Attan style originating from the provinces of [[Paktia]] and [[Khost]], Afghanistan Paktia/Khosti is typically a 5-7 step and can be longer. Because of the head movements the head is snapped left and right as their long jet black hair fling through the air, and eventually ends with the dancers turned medially and squatting with arms to their sides towards the center. This dance is performed with the musician tuning the beat to the technique of the performers.
* Shenwari - From the Afghan province of Nangarhar and amongst the shinwari tribe of Khyber Agency of Pakistan.
* [[Wardak province|Wardag]]/Wardaki - Da Wardag Attan, another famous style of Attan. Wardaki consists of body movements no clapping and lots of turns and twists, and Spotting, as well as handkerchiefs in their hands to accentuate their spins. The men usually boast wild mustaches, including hair that is greased as to accentuate the spotting and give more weight to the hair during turns. This dance is performed either with the beat of the musician or the musician tuning the beat the technique of the performers. In some regions of Wardak within the wardaki (wardagi) attan the leading men followed by the rest will sing a song at the start of the attan, while they are still moving at a slow pace. Later on as the pace is picked up and the attan gets faster, then they stop singing and they focus all of their energy on the (movement) attan.
* Warziro - Attan from the [[Waziristan]] region of Pakistan, famous for its use of guns
* Khattak - Attan performed by the [[Khattak]] tribe in Pakistan, this style of attan Some what resembles the Mehsud style of attan with a little variation it is called “Dre Makheez attan” 
* Quetta Style - The Attan performed in the [[Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]]. It is popular in Quetta, [[Pishin, Pakistan|Pishin]] and surrounding areas and is danced mostly by the Kakar, [[Tareen]], [[Achakzai]] and other tribes.
* Kabuli / Peshawari Attan is a modified Attan with modern music. In this dance, the dancers perform to the beat of the musician. This dance typically performed by men &amp; women. It involves 2–5 steps, ending with a clap given while facing the center, after which the process is repeated again. The hip and arms are put in a sequential movement including left and right tilts, with the wrists twisting in sequence, with ultimately a hand is projected outward and brought in a 'scoop-like' fashion towards the center where the other hand meets it for a clap. This dance is typically performed with the musician dictating the duration and speed.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iopyne.wordpress.com/2012/08/14/for-the-love-of-attan/|title=For the Love of ATTAN &amp;#124; I Opyne|publisher=iopyne.wordpress.com|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kumbhar - Slightly resembling the Quetta style Attan is the "Kumbhar". It is performed by tribes in various districts of [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]], [[Potohar]] and North [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]]. The word "kumbhar" is the [[Hindko]] and Punjabi word for dance.

==Gender roles==
Most conspicuous are the younger men, with a coloured scarf in one hand, sometimes a sword in the other (such as the Khattak style Attan). The women, colourfully clad in traditional Pashtun ([[Firaq partug]]) dress, join in the dance.&lt;ref name="Wilber, Donald N. 1962"/&gt; The men and women are separated in more conservative areas such as eastern [[Afghanistan]] and north western [[Pakistan]] and neither can see the other sex dancing. However, in modern areas like the west, both genders dance side by side. Often, women change into an Attan dress while the men remain in their original clothes at a wedding or gathering. In the past, musicians and singers were men because social norms at the time prohibited women from playing musical instruments, singing songs, or dancing in front of male counterparts. Dancing by men and women together increasingly gained momentum among the educated and upper- and middle-class urban families in the 1970s and afterward. The Daoud Khan, Zahir Shah and the Communist regimes encouraged young men and women to defy traditional values and participate in these public activities.&lt;ref&gt;Emadi, Hafizullah.(2005) ''Cultures and Customs of Afghanistan.''

=== Think before you drive ===

AMSM in collaboration with the [[FIA Foundation for the Automobile and Society|FIA Foundation]] supported the international global campaign for road safety Think Before You Drive in 2006. Think Before You Drive is a global road safety initiative of the FIA Foundation, [[Bridgestone Corporation]] and motoring clubs worldwide.
The Think Before You Drive campaign aims to promote safe driving behaviour and to raise awareness about road safety, locally and globally.
The campaign promotes simple road safety messages:
* Highlighting actions that take a few seconds but could save your life
* Identifying the main causes of serious or fatal crashes

=== Make cars green ===

[[Make Cars Green]] is an international environmental campaign, aimed at reducing the impact of motoring on our planet, conducted by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] - FIA. AMSM in cooperation with the National Security Council on Road Traffic and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Macedonia launched the global campaign Make cars green on 23 May 2008. The FIA’s Make Cars Green campaign aims to help reduce the impact of cars on the environment. The campaign’s 10 points for greener motoring encourage motorists to think green before they drive: 

* Buy Green
* Plan your journey
* Check tyre pressures frequently
* Reduce loads and avoid the need for roof racks
* Don’t warm up your engine before starting off 
* Use air conditioning only when necessary
* Accelerate gently and keep your speed constant
* Use engine braking
* Don’t idle your engine
* Offset your CO 2 emission

=== UN Decade of action for road safety 2011 - 2020 ===

AMSM in cooperation with the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] - FIA joined the initiative to support the Decade of Action of the United Nations for Road Safety 2011-2020 officially launched on 11 May 2011. Under the motto "believe, speak, change" AMSM in cooperation with the Ministry of Interior of Macedonia and Republic Council for Road Traffic Safety every year marks the national campaign for road safety in Macedonia.
Officially launched on 11 May 2011, the Decade of Action has the official goal of 'stabilising and then reducing' global road traffic fatalities by 2020.

Ten reasons to act on road deaths:

* Nearly 1.3 million people are killed on the world's roads each year
* Up to 50 million people are injured, and many remain disabled for life
* 90% of casualties from road deaths occur in developing countries
* Annual road traffic deaths are forecast to rise to 1.9 million people by 2020
* Road traffic injuries are the number one cause of death for young people worldwide
* By 2015 road traffic injuries will be the leading health burden for children over the age of five years in developing countries
* The economic cost to developing countries is at least $100 billion a year
* Road traffic injuries place an immense burden on hospitals and health systems generally
* Road crashes are preventable
* A global Action Plan includes practical measures which, if implemented, could save millions of lives

The relationship between '''[[BDSM]] and the law''' changes significantly from nation to nation. It is entirely dependent on the legal situation in individual countries whether the practice of BDSM has any criminal relevance or legal consequences. Criminalization of consensually implemented BDSM practices is usually not with explicit reference to BDSM, but results from the fact that such behavior as spanking or cuffing someone could be considered a breach of personal rights, which in principle constitutes a criminal offense. In Germany, Netherlands, [[Japan]] and [[Scandinavia]], such behavior is legal in principle. In Austria the legal status is not clear, while in Switzerland some BDSM practices can be considered criminal. Spectacular incidents like the US scandal of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'' and the British [[Operation Spanner]] demonstrate the degree to which difficult grey areas can pose a problem for the individuals and authorities involved. It is very important to learn the legal status of the right of consent in the judicial statue of the country of resident for the practitioners of BDSM.

==Current status==

===Austria===
§90 of the criminal code declares bodily injury (§§ 83, 84) or the endangerment of physical security (§89) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the "victim" has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities.  Case law from the Austrian Supreme Court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities (and thus punishable) when a "serious injury" (meaning a damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than 24 days) or the "death" of the "victim" results.  A ''light injury'' is considered generally ''permissible'' when the "victim" has consented to it.  In cases of threats to bodily well-being, the standard depends on the probability that an injury will actually occur.  If serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out, then even the threat itself is considered punishable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Zum konkreten Fall der Körperverletzung durch Handlungen im BDSM-Bereich gibt es allerdings keine gefestigte Rechtsprechung. Es kann durchaus sein, dass der Oberste Gerichtshof im BDSM-Bereich auch leichte Körperverletzung als sittenwidrig und somit als strafbar ansieht. Ob eine Handlung gegen die guten Sitten verstößt, hängt in Österreich nämlich davon ab, ob einem vorbildlichen Menschen die Sorge um die Gesundheit des „Opfers“ wichtiger wäre als die Rücksicht auf dessen Wünsche. Es besteht also keine Rechtssicherheit.--&gt;

===Canada===
In 2004, a judge in Canada ruled that videos seized by the police featuring BDSM activities were not obscene, and did not constitute violence, but a "normal and acceptable" sexual activity between two consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' that a person must have an active mind during the specific sexual activity in order to legally consent.  The Court ruled that it is a criminal offence to perform a sexual act on an unconscious person – whether or not that person consented in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can’t consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author= Mike Blanchfield|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/998055--woman-can-t-consent-to-sex-while-unconscious-supreme-court-rules?bn=1|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The practice of BDSM is not generally penalized in Germany if it is conducted with the mutual consent of the partners involved.

The following sections of the criminal code may be relevant in certain instances for BDSM practices:
{{col-begin}}
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top" style="border:0"|
* [[Sexual assault]] (§177)
* [[Sexual abuse]] of persons unable to resist (§179)
* [[Insult]] and insult by deed (§185)
* [[Battery (crime)|Battery]] (§223)
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top"|
* Aggravated battery (§224)
* [[False imprisonment]] (§239)
* [[Coercion]] (§240)
{{col-end}}
To fulfill the charge of coercion, the use of violence or the threat of a "severe mistreatment" must involve an endangerment to life and limb.  In cases where the continued application of the treatment could be ended through the use of a [[safeword]], neither coercion nor sexual coercion may be charged.  In the case of charges of sexual abuse of people incapable of resistance, similar principles apply.  In this case, taking advantage of a person's inability to resist in order to perform sexual acts on that person is considered punishable.  The potential use of the safeword is considered to be sufficient possibility for resistance, since this would lead to the cessation of the act, and so a true inability to resist is not considered to be in effect. The charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges, according to §194. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement.

According to §228 of the German criminal code, a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases in which the deed can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given.  On 26 May 2004, the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to §228.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the Bundesgerichtshof, 26 May 2004, 2 StR 505/03, which may be found at: BGHSt 49, 166 ([http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;Datum=2004-5&amp;Seite=0&amp;client=12&amp;nr=29672&amp;pos=19&amp;anz=244&amp;Blank=1.pdf bundesgerichtshof.de])&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, this ruling makes the question of indecency dependent on the degree to which the bodily injury might be likely to impair the health of the receiving party. According to the BGH, the line of [[indecency]] is definitively crossed when "under an objectively prescient consideration of all relevant circumstances the party granting consent could be brought into concrete danger of death by the act of bodily injury." In its ruling, the court overturned a verdict by the Provincial Court of Kassel, according to which a man who had choked his partner and thereby involuntarily strangled her, had been sentenced to probation for negligent manslaughter.  The court had rejected a conviction on charges of bodily injury leading to death on the grounds that the victim had, in its opinion, consented to the act. Following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases, the Appeals Court of [[Hamm]] ruled in February 2006 that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful childraising.&lt;ref&gt;Appeals Court of Hamm in its judgement of 1 February 2006, case number 10 UF 147/04, available online at the [http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php# Portal of the North Rhine-Westfalian Ministry of Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217060746/http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php |date=17 December 2004 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
For Italian law, BDSM is right on the border between crime and legality, and everything lies in the interpretation of the Code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing "injury" to another person is to be punished. In this context, though, "injury" is legally defined as "anything causing a condition of illness", and "illness" is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is "any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism" (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is "a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy". This makes it somewhat risky to play with someone, as later the "victim" might call for foul play using any sort of little mark as evidence against the partner. Also, any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it. BDSM play between nonconsenting adults or minors or in public is of course punished according to normal laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayzad.com/ Ayzad], ''BDSM – Guida per esploratori dell'erotismo estremo'', Castelvecchi, 2004 {{ISBN|88-7615-025-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
In September 2010, a Swedish court ruled that a 32-year-old man was acquitted of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16-year-old woman (the [[age of consent]] in Sweden is 15).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/29302/20100928 Man freed in landmark S&amp;M case]&lt;/ref&gt;  Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revisef65.org/loven.html SM og loven] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution.  This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries, which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.

===Switzerland===
The age of consent in Switzerland is 16 years, which also applies for BDSM play. Children (i.e. those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years.  Certain practices, however, require granting consent to light injuries and thus are only allowed for those over 18. Since Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened, on 1 April 2002, ownership of "objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content" is punishable. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochists, since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfill these criteria.  Critics also object to the wording of the law, which puts sado-masochists in the same category as [[pedophilia|pedophiles]] and [[pederasty|pederasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ig-bdsm.ch/index.php?pid=24 Interessengemeinschaft BDSM Schweiz] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
British law does not recognize the possibility of consenting to [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]]. Such acts are illegal, even between consenting adults, and these laws are enforced ([[R v Brown]] being the leading case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp|title=Spanner Trust submission to the Home Office Review Board on Sexual Offences|publisher=The Spanner Trust|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071214235525/http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp| archivedate= 14 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; R v Brown dismissed the defence of consent, meaning that the men charged of sexual offences could not defend their actions. It has been pointed out that people can consent to activities such as boxing and body piercing, which also result in pain, but apparently cannot consent to BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009]|title=Roffee, James (2015).

[[Operation Spanner]] was the name of an operation carried out by police in the United Kingdom city of Manchester in 1987, as a result of which a group of homosexual men were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for their involvement in consensual sadomasochism over a ten-year period. The resulting [[House of Lords]] case (''[[R v Brown]]'', colloquially known as "the Spanner case") ruled that [[informed consent|consent]] was not a valid legal defence for [[wounding]] and [[actual bodily harm]] in the UK, except as a foreseeable incident of a lawful activity in which the person injured was participating, e.g. surgery. Following Operation Spanner the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in January 1999 in [[Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom]] that no violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] the individuals live in, as it is the State's responsibility to balance the concerns of [[public health]] and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. In the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill 2007, the British Government cited the Spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts, as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of ''"[[extreme pornography]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons: ''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/en/07130x-n.htm#index_link_206 Criminal Justice And Immigration Bill]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014]] the video distribution of some BDSM practices has become illegal.

=== United States ===
The United States Federal law does not list a specific criminal determination for consensual BDSM acts. Many BDSM practitioners cite the legal decision of ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'', 95 N.Y.2d 846 (2000), or the "Cybersex Torture Case", {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} which was the first U.S. appellate decision to hold (in effect) that one does not commit assault if the victim consents. However, many individual states do criminalize specific BDSM actions within their state borders.  Some states specifically address the idea of "consent to BDSM acts" within their assault laws, such as the state of New Jersey, which defines "simple assault" to be "a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle ''entered into by mutual consent'', in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm |title=New Jersey NJ Criminal Offenses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=14 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104155828/http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm |archive-date=4 November 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oregon Ballot Measure 9]] was a [[initiative|ballot measure]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] in [[1992 in the United States|1992]], concerning sadism, masochism, [[gay rights]], pedophilia, and [[public education]], that drew widespread national attention. It would have added the following text to the [[Oregon Constitution]]:
{{cquote|All governments in Oregon may not use their monies or properties to promote, encourage or facilitate [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] or masochism. All levels of government, including [[public education]] systems, must assist in setting a standard for Oregon's youth which recognizes that these behaviors are abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse and they are to be discouraged and avoided.}}
It was defeated in the November 3, 1992 [[general election]] with 638,527 votes in favor, 828,290 votes against.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Documents/elections/initiative.pdf Oregon Blue Book: Initiative, Referendum and Recall: 1902-2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bachelor''' is a [[man]] who is socially regarded as able to [[marry]], but has not yet.&lt;ref name="note"&gt;Bachelors are, in [[Richard Pitt|Pitt]] &amp; al.'s phrasing, "men who live independently, outside of their parents' home and other institutional settings, who are neither married nor cohabitating". ({{citation |last=Pitt |first=Richard |author2-last=Borland |author2-first=Elizabeth |ref={{harvid|Pitt &amp; al.|2008}} |date=2008 |contribution-url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-180029368/bachelorhood-and-men-attitudes.html |contribution=Bachelorhood and Men's Attitudes about Gender Roles |title=The Journal of Men's Studies |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;16 |pp=140–158}}).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the title of anyone of any gender or marital status who holds a [[bachelor's degree]].

==Etymology==
The word is first attested as the 12th-century ''bacheler'', a [[knight bachelor]], a [[knight]] too young or poor to gather vassals under [[knights banneret|his own banner]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|bacheler}}'' presumably derives from [[Occitan language|Provençal]] ''{{lang|pro|bacalar}}'' and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|baccalare}}'',&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; but the ultimate source of the word is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197"&gt;{{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bachelor |volume=3 |pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. "[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14313 bachelor, ''n.'']" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[linguistic reconstruction|proposed]] [[Medieval Latin]] *''{{lang|la|baccalaris}}'' ("vassal", "field hand") is only attested late enough that it may have derived from the vernacular languages,&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; rather than from the southern French and northern Spanish Latin&lt;ref name="Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197"/&gt; ''{{lang|la|baccalaria}}''.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;{{citation |last=Du Cange |first=Charles du Fresne, sieur |author-link=Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange |date=1733 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=no9IWJhHTxIC&amp;pg=PA153-IA67 |title=? |pp=906–912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|baculum}}'' ("a stick"), in reference to the wooden sticks used by knights in training.&lt;ref&gt;For further [[etymology|etymological]] discussion, with sources, see [[Uwe Friedrich Schmidt|Schmidt]],({{citation |last=Schmidt |first=Uwe Friedrich |title=Praeromanica der Italoromania auf der Grundlage des LEI (A und B) |series=Europäische Hochschulschriften; Vol.&amp;nbsp;49, No.&amp;nbsp;9 |language=de}}) reprinted by [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Lang]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Schmidt |first=Uwe Friedrich |contribution=Praeromanica der Italoromania auf der Grundlage des LEI (A und B) |title=Italienische Sprache und Literatur |publisher=Peter Lang |date=2009 |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OPrKYUOFvgC&amp;pg=PA117 |pp=117–120 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 14th century, the term was also used for a junior member of a [[guild]] (otherwise known as "yeomen") or [[university]] and then for low-level ecclesiastics, as young [[monk]]s and recently appointed [[Canon (priest)|canon]]s.{{Refn|Severtius,&lt;ref&gt;Severtius, ''De Episcopis Lugdunensibus'', p.&amp;nbsp;377&lt;/ref&gt; cited in [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]].&lt;ref name=dc/&gt;}} As an inferior grade of scholarship, it came to refer to one holding a "[[bachelor's degree]]". This sense of ''{{lang|la|baccalarius}}'' or ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus}}'' is first attested at the [[University of Paris]] in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of [[Pope Gregory IX]] as applied to scholars still ''{{lang|la|in statu pupillari}}''. There were two classes of ''{{lang|la|baccalarii}}'': the ''{{lang|la|baccalarii cursores}}'', theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course, and the ''{{lang|la|baccalarii dispositi}}'', who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Bachelor |volume=3 |page=132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Victorian era]], the term [[eligible bachelor]] was used in the context of [[upper class]] [[arranged marriage|matchmaking]], denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered "eligible" in financial and social terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term "[[confirmed bachelor]]" denoted a man who was resolute to remain unmarried.

By the later 19th century, the term "bachelor" had acquired the general sense of "unmarried man". The expression [[bachelor party]] is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent "bachelor-girl" was coined, replaced in US English by "[[bachelorette]]" by the mid-1930s. After [[World War II]], this terminology came to be seen as antiquated and has been mostly replaced by the gender-neutral term "[[single person|single]]" (first recorded 1964). In England and Wales, the term "bachelor" remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favor of "single."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=R.I.P Bachelors and Spinsters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4141996.stm|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Arab]] countries, "bachelor" can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/hundreds-of-bachelors-crammed-in-squalid-and-dilapidated-buildings-1.194725 |title=Hundreds of 'bachelors' crammed in squalid and dilapidated buildings |publisher=GulfNews.com |date=2009-05-03 |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a colloquial term "executive bachelor" is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] bachelors in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130125101719/http://www.google.com/search?q=executive-bachelor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bachelors have been subject to [[penal law]]s in many countries, most notably in [[Ancient history|Ancient]] [[Sparta]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name="Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197"/&gt; At Sparta, men unmarried after a certain age were subject to various penalties ({{lang-grc-gre|ἀτιμία}}, ''atimía''): they were forbidden to watch women's gymnastics; during the winter, they were made to march naked through the [[agora]] singing a song about their dishonor;&lt;ref name="Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197"/&gt; and they were not provided with the traditional respect due to the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Lyc''., 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] laws were similar.&lt;ref&gt;Schomann, ''Gr. Alterth.'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;I, 548.&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelors in Rome fell under the [[Lex Julia]] of 18&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and the [[Lex Papia Poppaea]] of {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;9: these lay heavy fines on unmarried or childless people while providing certain privileges to those with several children.&lt;ref name="Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197"/&gt; In [[UK|Britain]], taxes occasionally fell heavier on bachelors than other persons: examples include 6 &amp; 7 Will. III, the 1785 Tax on Servants, and the 1798 Income Tax.&lt;ref name="Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197"/&gt; Over time, some punishments developed into no more than a teasing game. In some parts of [[Germany]], for instance, men who were still unmarried by their 30th birthday were made to sweep the stairs of the [[town hall]] until kissed by a "virgin".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The '''Butuanon''' are part of the wider [[Visayans|Visayan]] ethnolinguistic group, which constitute the largest [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|Filipino ethnolinguistic group]]. The Butuanon are one of the smallest Visayan ethnic groups.  As with the [[Surigaonon people|Surigaonons]], the Butuanons are also previously considered as Cebuanos.

==Area==
Butuanons live in the provinces of [[Agusan del Norte]] and [[Agusan del Sur]]. Some live in [[Misamis Oriental]] or in [[Surigao del Norte]], all of which are in the northeastern corner of [[Mindanao]].

==Demographics==
Butuanons number about 1,420,000. They are the descendants of Austronesian-speaking immigrants who came from South China during the Iron Age. The native language of Butuanons is the [[Butuanon language]], but most Butuanon nowadays primarily speak the [[Cebuano language]], because of the mass influx of [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] settlers to Mindanao, and [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[English language|English]] as second languages. Most are [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholics]], while some are [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestants]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4616">'''Cannabis in the Northern Mariana Islands''' is legal, both for medical and recreational purposes. Per the 2012 UNODC ''World Drug Report'', the [[United States Territory]] of CNMI has the second highest marijuana consumption per capita of any nation or territory in the world, at 22.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/top-cannabis-smoking-countries-worldwide-2012-6 |title=Top Cannabis-Smoking Countries Worldwide |publisher=Business Insider |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Drug Threat Assessment''==
Per the [[National Drug Intelligence Center]]'s ''Northern Mariana Islands Drug Threat Assessment'' of October 2003:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marijuana is readily available and widely abused in the CNMI; however, it is difficult to quantify the extent of marijuana abuse due to the lack of drug abuse statistics and marijuana-related survey data for the CNMI.

From 2000 to 2001 law enforcement eradication efforts caused a decrease in local cannabis cultivation, and distributors had to obtain most of their marijuana from sources outside the commonwealth. As a result, prices increased dramatically. A joint (0.5 gram), also known as a stick, of marijuana sold for an average price of $2.50 from 1997 to 1999 when supplies of locally produced marijuana were plentiful. The price of a joint subsequently increased to $20 to $50. In addition, sandwich bags (nickel and dime bags) of marijuana have been replaced by 1-inch-square, resealable bags containing small quantities of marijuana that sell for $20 to $35 each. Tourists typically are charged higher prices for retail quantities of marijuana than are local residents. At the wholesale level in Saipan, marijuana sells for approximately $1,500 per pound.

As a result of strong eradication efforts by law enforcement, cannabis cultivation in the CNMI is primarily limited to small quantities intended for personal use. CNMI authorities now focus on undercover operations, controlled purchases, and border interdiction.

According to the Department of Public Safety Criminal Investigation Bureau, marijuana is transported to the CNMI by criminal groups that cultivate [[cannabis in the Philippines]] and the neighboring island of the Republic of Palau. Filipino criminal groups typically transport marijuana in cargo containers aboard commercial maritime vessels. Criminal groups from Palau generally pay couriers to transport marijuana concealed on their bodies or packed in coolers. Local cultivators in the CNMI also transport small quantities of marijuana from island to island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs5/5047/marijuan.htm |title=Marijuana - Northern Mariana Islands Drug Threat Assessment |publisher=Justice.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2010 legalization attempt==
In 2010, the CNMI House of Representatives approved a legalization bill to regulate and tax marijuana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/weed-bill-would-legalize-use-in-us-commonwealth/ |title=Weed Bill Would Legalize Use in US Commonwealth |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the measure ultimately failed.{{why|date=July 2015}}

==2017–2018 legislation==
The [[CNMI Cannabis Act of 2018]] was introduced to the Commonwealth Legislature in 2017, and was passed by the Senate in May, 2018.

==Legalization (2018)==
On August 8, 2018, lawmakers voted to approve the legalization of cannabis by a margin of 18 to 1, making it the first jurisdiction in the United States to go from direct prohibition to legalization.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/08/08/lawmakers-in-u-s-territory-vote-to-legalize-marijuana/#4f659df657d9&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed by the Governor on September 21, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/09/21/governor-signs-marijuana-legalization-bill-making-history-in-us-territory/#1cf996f327ea|title=Governor Signs Marijuana Legalization Bill, Making History In US Territory|last=Angell|first=Tom|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cuisine of the [[Americas]]''' is made up of a variety of [[food]] preparation styles.

==North America==
{{main|North American cuisine}}
[[Image:Sirloin steak.JPG|thumb|American [[Sirloin|sirloin steak]] dinner]]
North American cuisine consists of foods native to or popular in countries of [[North America]], such as [[Canadian cuisine]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]], [[Mexican cuisine]], and [[Latin American cuisine#North America|Central American cuisine]]. North American cuisines display influence from many international cuisines, including [[Native American cuisine]], [[Jewish cuisine]], [[Asian cuisine]], and especially [[European cuisine]].
As a broad, geo-culinary term, North American cuisine also includes [[Latin American cuisine#North America|Central American]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. These regions are part of North America, so these regional cuisines also fall within the penumbra of North American cookery.

The term "regional" is somewhat ambiguous, however, since, for example, the cuisine of Puerto Rico can differ markedly from Cuban cuisine; Mexican cuisine spills across the border into the [[Tex-Mex]] and Mexi-Cali "sub-cuisines"; and the cuisines of Michigan and Ontario have more in common with each other than either has with the cuisines of Manitoba or Iowa.{{proveit|date=March 2012}}

Some of the richest products of [[South America]]n cuisine come from the middle of the continent, the [[Amazon basin]]. In countries like [[Peru]], there is a strong influence of the [[Tahuantinsuyu|Inca]] and their [[Inca cuisine|cuisine]]. [[Potato]]es are frequently grown as a result of this, and also plants such as [[quinoa]]. On the Southern tip of South America lies the [[Pacific Ocean]], which provides a large array of [[seafood]]. Many plains are also on this continent, which are rich for growing food in abundance. In the [[Patagonia]] region south of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], many people produce [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[venison]]. [[King crab]] is typically caught at the southern end of the continent. [[Antarctic krill]] has just recently been discovered and is now considered a fine dish. [[Tuna]] and tropical fish are caught all around the continent, but [[Easter Island]] is one place where they are found in abundance. [[Lobster]] is also caught in great quantities from [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]]. In [[Brazil]], their most traditional dish is the [[feijoada]].

The '''demographics of [[Nauru]]''', an [[island country]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], are known through national [[census]]es, which have been analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1920s. The [[Nauru Bureau of Statistics]] have conducted this task since 1977—the first census since Nauru gained independence in 1968. The most recent census of Nauru was in 2011, when population had reached ten thousand. The population density is 478 inhabitants per square kilometre (185 per square mile), and the overall [[life expectancy]] is 59.7 years. The population rose steadily from the 1960s until 2006 when the Government of Nauru repatriated thousands of Tuvaluan and [[I-Kiribati]] workers from the country. Since 1992, Nauru's [[birth rate]] has exceeded its [[death rate]]; the natural growth rate is positive. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15–64-year-old segment (65.6%). The median age of the population is 21.5, and the estimated gender ratio of the population is 0.91 males per one female.

Nauru is inhabited mostly by [[Nauruan people|Nauruans]] (93.6%), while minorities include I-Kiribati (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%) and other (3.1%). The demographic history of Nauru is marked by several migrations: the area was first inhabited by Micronesian people about 3,000 years ago. The first European to find the island was [[John Fearn (whaler)|John Fearn]] in 1798. Then, the country was annexed by Germany in the 1888. The next was when Japanese occupied the island during [[World War II]] in the 1942. During this time, the Japanese deported several thousands of Nauruans to other islands. In the 1960s, the country gained independence, where the percentage of Nauruans started to increase. The most recent demographic switch was in the 2000s, when the government repatriated several non-Nauruan population from the country.

The [[Nauruan language]] is the official language of Nauru, but English is often used in the country. Nauruan is declared as the primary language of 95.3% of the population. The 2011 census revealed that 66.0% of the population spoke English and 11.9% another language. The main religions of Nauru are [[Nauru Congregational Church]] (35.71%) and [[Roman Catholic]] (32.96%). The [[literacy rate]] in Nauru is 96.5%. The proportion of the country's population aged 15 and over attaining [[academic degrees]] is one of the lowest in the world, reaching 7.9% in 2011. An estimated 10.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) is spent on education. Nauru has a [[universal health care]] system, and in 2012, an estimated 7.5% of its GDP was spent on healthcare. Nauru has the highest [[obesity]] ranking in the world; 97 per cent of men and 93 per cent of women are obese. In 2006, the average net monthly income was [[Australian dollar|A$]]2,597 (A${{Inflation|AU|2597|2006|r=0}} in 2014). The most significant sources of employment are [[Phosphate mining in Nauru|phosphate mining]], banking industries, and various [[coconut]] products. In 2011, the [[unemployment rate]] was 23%. The 2011 census enumerated 1,647 total households, averaging 6.0 persons per house. Average [[Urbanization|urbanisation rate]] in Nauru is 100%.

Nauruan Independent was the predominant religion in Nauru before the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when foreign missionaries introduced Christianity to the island. It is still practised by 9.5% of the population, according to 2011 census. There are a few active Christian missionary organisations, including representatives of Anglicanism, Methodism, and Catholicism. The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]];&lt;ref name="const"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naurugov.nr/parliament-of-nauru/constitution-of-nauru.aspx | title=Constitution of Nauru | publisher=Nauru Government | accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Government restricted this right in some circumstances. The government has restricted the religious practices of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], most of whom are foreign workers employed by RONPhos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90147.htm | title=International Religious Freedom Report 2007 | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] | accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The education system had a near-collapse in 2000–2005. During this time, exams were not held, teachers were not paid, and schools did not have enough funding to continue.&lt;ref name="icde" /&gt; As a result, over half of the schools closed.&lt;ref name="edu" /&gt; In 2009, the [[Australian Government]] partnered with the Nauruan Department of Education to help. This agreement resulted in a 5.7% increase in students, teachers with a degree increased from 30% to 93%, and over A$11 million was used to construct a new secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aid.dfat.gov.au/countries/pacific/nauru/Pages/initiative-education-support.aspx |title=Nauru: Education Support |publisher=[[Australian Government]] |accessdate=18 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223040056/http://aid.dfat.gov.au/countries/pacific/nauru/Pages/initiative-education-support.aspx |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
With its success in the tourism and financial service industries, the Cayman Islands have attracted many international businesses and citizens to relocate. The largest numbers of expatriates living in the Cayman Islands (as of the government's 1999 Census Report) hail from Jamaica (8,320), the [[United Kingdom]] (2,392), the United States (2,040), [[Canada]] (1,562), and [[Honduras]] (873). Approximately 3,300 more residents are citizens of various other countries. While the government doesn't restrict foreign land ownership, it does strongly enforce its immigration laws. Businesses are required to grant access to job openings to Caymanian citizens first; if none of them are suitable, the business may then seek employees from other countries. In order to work in the Cayman Islands, foreigners must have a job offer before immigrating.

The estimated population of {{UN_Population|Year}} is {{UN_Population|Cayman Islands}} ({{UN_Population|source}}).

Although many [[Caribbean]] islands were initially populated by [[Amerindian]] groups such as the [[Taíno]] and [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], no evidence of this has been found in the Cayman Islands. Therefore, native Caymanians do not have any Amerindian heritage from their own islands; however, a significant number of Jamaicans have settled in the Cayman Islands over the years, so they and their descendants may have some Amerindian blood via Jamaica. [[Slavery]] was less common on the Cayman Islands than in many other parts of the Caribbean, resulting in a more even division of [[Africa]]n and [[Europe]]an ancestry. Those of mixed race make up 40% of the population, with blacks and whites following at 20% each. The remaining 20% belong to various immigrant ethnic groups.

According to CIA factbook of 2013, Caymanian people of mixed-race of mixed black African and white European ancestry are the plurality ethnic group in the [[Cayman Islands]], accounting for 40% of the country's population, with white 20%, black 20%, and expatriates of various ethnic groups 20%.&lt;ref name="CIAPAPUANEWGUINEA"/&gt;

The official language of the Cayman Islands is English. Islanders' accents retain elements passed down from English, Scottish, and Welsh settlers (among others) in a language variety known as [[Cayman Creole]]. Caymanians of Jamaican origin speak in their own vernacular (see [[Jamaican Creole]] and [[Jamaican English]]). It is also quite commonplace to hear some residents converse in Spanish as many citizens have relocated from Latin America to work and live on Grand Cayman. The Latin American nations with greatest representation are Honduras, Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. Spanish speakers comprise approximately between 10-12% of the population and is predominantly of the [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean dialect]]. Tagalog is spoken by about 5% of inhabitants most of whom are Filipino residents on work permits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">The '''Dilzak''' ([[Urdu]] : '''دلزاک''') is a [[Pashtun tribe]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==
The Dilzak originally dwelled in the [[Sulaiman Mountains|Sulaiman Range]] near Eastern [[Afghanistan]] and western [[Pakistan]] border regions. They were the first of the Pashtun tribes from the region to migrate north-eastwards. They descended to the valley of [[Peshawar]] through [[Khyber Pass]] during the time of [[Samanid Dynasty]], between 750 and 850 CE.&lt;ref&gt;"Taarikh-e-Hazara (History of Hazara)" (Urdu-1969) by Dr. Sher Bahadur Khan Panni Page 295-313&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mehmood Ghaznavi]] (around 1000 CE), the Dilzak had reached the [[Indus River]] (Then called ''[[Abasin|Abaseen]]'' or ''Neelaab'').&lt;ref&gt;"Taareekh-e-Hazara" (Urdu) by Dr. Sher Bahadur Khan Panni_first edition_1969 p 295-313,"Taareekh-e-Wadi-e-Chhachh and Aqwaam-e-Chhachh" (Urdu) by Manzoor Awan p 175-182, , “Da Pasto Qabeelo Shajre o Mene" (Pashto) by Muhammad Umar Rond Miakhel_2001 p 346-347&lt;/ref&gt; They participated in the campaigns of [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mehmood Ghaznavi]] in large numbers under their leader Malik Yahya Khan.&lt;ref&gt;"Taareekh-e-Pashtoon" by Sher Muhammad Khan translated by Saraj Ahmed Alvi (1979) Page 200&lt;/ref&gt; In the 500 years that followed, they extended up to [[Hassan Abdal]] and towards the North up to [[Abbotabad|Abbottabad]]. According to [[Ain-i-Akbari|Aain-i-Akbari]] (written around 1590 CE), the Dilzak were the only Pashtun tribe that possessed lands in [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] Qaarlugh at that time.&lt;ref&gt;''Hazara Qaarlugh'' was a term used during the Mughal period for an administrative unit collocated with the modern [[Hazara Division]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Attock District]] and [[Hasan Abdal|Hassan Abdal]] (Tehsil) of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1520, another Pashtun tribe, the [[Yousafzai]], was expelled from [[Kabul]] by [[Mirza Ulugbeg|Mirza Ulugh Beg]] (March 22, 1394 in [[Sultaniyeh]] ([[Persia]]) – October 27, 1449 ([[Samarkand]])), a [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] ruler and paternal uncle of the Mughal Emperor [[Babur|Zahir-ud-din Muhammad Babur]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[Pathans the Book|The Pathans]]" by [[Olaf Caroe|Sir Olaf Caroe]] Page 153,173/174&lt;/ref&gt; The Yousafzai migrated to [[Peshawar]] valley where they sought and received help from the Dilzak.&lt;ref&gt;"Mukhtasur Taareekh-e-Pashtoon (Short History of Pashtoons) by Professor Hameedullah (2004) Page 49&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the relationships between the two tribes deteriorated and a long war ensued.&lt;ref&gt;"Tawareekh-e-Hafiz Rahmat Khani" (Urdu) by Pir Moazzam Shah rearranged with notes by 'Roshan Khan', Published by Pashto Academy, Peshawar University (1976) Pages 83-570&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Return under Shahjahan===
Most of the Dilzaks returned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] (January 5, 1592 – January 22, 1600), and settled in parts of [[Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa Province]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]] of [[Pakistan]] in their old lands.{{cn|date=October 2018}} One of them, Saleh Khan, settled with his family in [[Sarai Saleh|Sara-e-Saleh]] and Tir, both in [[Haripur District]] of [[Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa Province]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Taareekh-e-Hazara" (Urdu) by Dr. Sher Bahadur Khan Panni First Edition (1969) Page 295-313&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pomeroy - Goddesses.jpg|thumb|Front cover of Sarah B. Pomeroy's Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves. Women in Classical Antiquity (1975)]]
'''''Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity''''' is a 1975 [[feminist history]] book by [[Sarah Pomeroy]].  The work covers the lives of women in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] from the [[Greek Dark Ages]] to the death of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah B.|title=Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity|year=1994|edition=2|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was one of the first English works on women's history in any period.&lt;ref name=Foxhall-7&gt;{{cite book|last=Foxhall|first=Lin|title=Studying Gender in Classical Antiquity|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2013|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been used as a textbook in many university-level courses on women in classical antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McClure|first=Laura|title=Teaching a Course on Gender in the Classical World|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=92|issue=3|year=1997|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When the book was first published, reviewers commented that Pomeroy's work was an improvement on previous treatments of women in classical antiquity, such as [[John Percy Vyvian Dacre Balsdon|J. P. V. D. Balsdon's]] ''Roman Women'',&lt;ref name=Nash-809&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Daphne|title=Review, Sarah Pomeroy, ''Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves''|year=1977|journal=Social History|volume=2|issue=6|page=809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was praised for its lack of "polemical bias".&lt;ref name=Arthur-391&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arthur|first=Marylin B.|title=Classics|year=1976|journal=Signs|volume=2|issue=2|page=391|doi=10.1086/493365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marylin Arthur thought that ''Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves'' was "important",&lt;ref name=Arthur-391/&gt; and particularly praised the chapter on women in the [[Hellenistic period]] as "the high point of her book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arthur|first=Marylin B.|title=Classics|year=1976|journal=Signs|volume=2|issue=2|page=397|doi=10.1086/493365}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Daphne Nash criticised Pomeroy's work for its "poor level of historical argumentation" and for Pomeroy refusing to give her own opinion on disputed points.&lt;ref name=Nash-809/&gt;  She concluded that ''Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves'' ultimately "failed to transcend the limitations of its predecessors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Daphne|title=Review, Sarah Pomeroy, ''Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves''|year=1977|journal=Social History|volume=2|issue=6|page=810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves'' is now considered to be a turning point in the study of women in ancient history.  In 1994, [[Edith Hall]] said that it "marked the inauguration of women's studies within classics";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Edith|title=Review, Sarah Pomeroy, ''Women's History and Ancient History''|year=1994|journal=The Classical Review|volume=44|issue=2|page=367|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00289415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the same year, [[Shelley Haley]] wrote that it "legitimized the study of Greek and Roman women in ancient times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haley|first=Shelley P.|title=Classical Clichés|year=1994|journal=The Women's Review of Books|volume=12|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lin Foxhall, writing about the historiography of gender in classical antiquity, has described Pomeroy's book as "revolutionary", and "a major step forward" compared to existing scholarship on women in the ancient world.&lt;ref name=Foxhall-7/&gt;

The '''Governor-General''' ({{lang-ga|Seanascal}}) was the official representative of the [[monarchy of the Irish Free State|sovereign]] of the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922 to 1936. By [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], the [[Governor-General|Office of Governor-General]] was largely ceremonial. Nonetheless, it was controversial, as many [[Irish nationalism|Irish Nationalists]] regarded the existence of the office as offensive to [[Irish republicanism|republican]] principles and a symbol of continued Irish involvement in the [[United Kingdom]], despite the Governor-General having no connection to the [[British Government]] after 1931. For this reason, the office's role was diminished over time by the Irish Government.

The 1931 enactment in London of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] gave the Irish Free State full legislative independence. However, the Irish considered that full legislative independence had been achieved in 1922. The role of Governor-General in the Irish Free State was officially abolished on 11 December 1936,&lt;ref&gt;[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/1948/12/09/printall.asp "Dáil Debates wherein it is noted that Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act was signed by the Governor-General on the 11th December, 1936."]&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of [[Edward VIII]]'s abdication as king of the United Kingdom and all the Dominions.

==Selection==

The governor-general was appointed by the King on the advice of his Irish ministers.  Initially, the British government had some involvement in the appointment process. However, this ended following the [[1926 Imperial Conference]]; thenceforth, only the government of the Irish Free State was formally involved. A further effect of the 1926 conference (in particular, of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]]) was that the monarch also ceased to receive formal advice from the British government in relation to his role in the Irish Free State; such advice thenceforth came officially only from the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State]] (the Cabinet).

The [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Free State constitution]] did not limit the governor-general to a fixed term of office. But, in 1927, the Irish government decided that no governor-general would serve a term longer than five years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Role==

Under the constitution of the Irish Free State, the governor-general was bound to act in accordance with the "law, practice and constitutional usage" relevant to the [[Governor General of Canada]]. His formal duties included the following:

* Executive authority: The [[executive (government)|executive authority]] of the state was formally 'vested' in the king, but exercised by the governor-general on the advice of the Executive Council.
* Appointment of the Cabinet: The [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] (prime minister) was appointed by the governor-general after being selected by {{lang|ga|[[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Dáil Éireann]]}} (the lower house of parliament). The remaining ministers were appointed on the nomination of the president, subject to a vote of consent in the {{lang|ga|Dáil}}.
* Convention and dissolution of the legislature: The governor-general, on behalf of the king, convened and dissolved the ''{{lang|ga|[[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]]}}'' on the advice of the Executive Council.
* Signing bills into law: The king was formally, along with the {{lang|ga|Dáil}} and the [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senate]], one of three components of the {{lang|ga|Oireachtas}}. No bill could become law until it received [[Royal Assent]], given by the governor-general on behalf of the king. The governor-general theoretically had the right to veto a bill or reserve it "for the signification of the King's pleasure", in effect postponing a decision on whether or not to enact the bill, for a maximum of one year. When it was suggested in the [[House of Lords]] that the Land Bill 1926 be vetoed in this way, the [[Lord Chancellor]] said, "It would not be effective, for if this Bill were vetoed a similar Bill could be passed to-morrow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1926/mar/03/appeal-from-the-irish-free-state-courts#column_406|title=Appeal From The Irish Free State Courts |date=3 March 1926|work=Hansard|pages=HL Deb vol 63 c406 |nopp=Y|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appointment of judges: All judges were appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the Executive Council.

Until 1928, the governor-general served an additional role as the British government's agent in the Free State. This meant that all official correspondence between the British and Irish governments went through the governor-general and that he had access to British government papers. It also meant that he could receive secret instructions from the British government and so, for example, on assuming office Tim Healy was formally advised by the British government to veto any law that attempted to abolish the controversial [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] to the Crown, sworn by Irish parliamentarians.

However, at the same [[imperial conference]] from which the change in the mode of the governor-general's appointment arose, it was agreed that thenceforth the [[governor-general|governors-general]] of [[Dominion]]s such as the Free State would lose the second half of their dual role and no longer be representatives of the British government, with this role being carried out instead by [[high commissioner]]s. Furthermore, because, under the changes agreed, the British government lost the right to advise the king in relation to the Irish Free State, it could no longer issue binding instructions to the Irish governor-general.

The first two governors-general lived at the Viceregal Lodge (now known as ''{{lang|ga|[[Áras an Uachtaráin]]}}'', the official residence of the [[President of Ireland]]). The last governor-general resided in a specially leased private residence in [[Booterstown]], [[County Dublin]]. The governor-general was officially referred to as [[Excellency|His Excellency]]. However, unlike all the other governors-general within the [[British Empire]] in the 1920s and 1930s, none of the Governors-General of the Irish Free State were ever sworn in as members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Imperial Privy Council]]. Among all the governors-general in the British Empire at that time, none of the governors-general of the Irish Free State ever wore, in public at least, the official ceremonial uniform for someone of their rank.

==History==

===Origins===

The [[Irish Free State]] was officially established on 6 December 1922, under the terms of the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. While Irish political leaders favoured the creation of a republic, 'the Treaty' required, instead, that the new state would be a [[Dominion]] within the [[British Empire]] under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]]. Central to the agreed system of government was to be a "representative of [[the Crown]]". The new office was not named in the treaty, but the committee charged with drawing up the Free State constitution, under General [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], decided, after considering a number of names, including ''President of Ireland'', that the representative would bear the title of ''Governor-General'', the same as that used by the Crown's representative in other Dominions, i.e. Canada, Australia, [[New Zealand]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]. The Crown's representative was expressly bound by the same constitutional conventions as the [[Governor General of Canada]], which would limit him to a largely ceremonial role. It was hoped that, if he was given the same title as that used in other Dominions, then, if the [[British government]] attempted to violate convention by using the Office of Governor-General to interfere in the Free State's affairs, these other nations would see their own autonomy threatened and might object.

===Cosgrave ministry===

The first two Governors-General of the Irish Free State assumed office under the pro-Treaty, {{lang|ga|[[Cumann na nGaedheal]]}} government of [[W. T. Cosgrave]]. When it came to choosing the first governor-general, there was speculation about a number of possible candidates, including the famed Irish painter [[John Lavery|Sir John Lavery]] and [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. However, the Irish cabinet let it be known that it wished Tim Healy, a former [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]]ite MP, to be appointed, and the British government ultimately agreed.

When it came to selecting Healy's successor, the Irish cabinet chose [[James McNeill]], an [[Ulster]]man who was a former member of Collins's constitution committee and a former Chairman of [[Dublin County Council]]. Because, unlike his predecessor, he was not the United Kingdom's official representative in the Free State, but merely the personal representative of the King, McNeill found himself with less influence than Healy had possessed.

===De Valera ministry===

In 1932 Cosgrave's government lost power to the anti-treaty {{lang|ga|[[Fianna Fáil]]}} party of [[Éamon de Valera]], who now became [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]. {{lang|ga|Fianna Fáil}}'s immediate goal was to republicanise the Irish Free State and, as such, it opposed the very existence of the governorship-general. With this in mind, de Valera's cabinet decided to boycott and humiliate McNeill at every turn. This policy was followed, for example, during the [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)|Eucharistic Congress in 1932]], when McNeill was sidelined and, on one occasion, the [[Irish Army|army's]] band was withdrawn from a function that he attended. On another occasion, two ministers publicly stormed out of a diplomatic function in [[Dublin]] when McNeill arrived as the guest of the French government. In late 1932, de Valera and McNeill clashed when the Governor-General published his private correspondence with de Valera and de Valera sought McNeill's dismissal. King [[George V]], however, acting as peacemaker, persuaded de Valera to withdraw the request on the basis that McNeill was due to finish his term of office within a few weeks. He then persuaded McNeill to bring forward his retirement to 1 November 1932.

On McNeill's retirement, de Valera advised the King to appoint the aged [[Domhnall Ua Buachalla]], a former {{lang|ga|Fianna Fáil}} [[Teachta Dála|TD]], to the post. The new Governor-General (who almost always styled himself as ''{{lang|ga|Seanascal}}'', an [[Irish language|Irish]] title) was formally advised by the cabinet to withdraw from public life and confine himself to formal functions such as giving [[Royal Assent]], issuing proclamations, dissolving {{lang|ga|[[Dáil Éireann]]}}, and appointing, on de Valera's advice, ministers to the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]].

===Abolition===

{{main|Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936}}

In December 1936, when King [[Edward VIII]] [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] from all his thrones, including that of the Irish Free State (as created in the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act]] and [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]), the Irish cabinet decided to finally abolish the governorship-general. {{lang|ga|Taoiseach}} [[John A. Costello]], speaking in 1948, described the [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936]], which effected the change as follows:

{{quote|This Act purported to vest all those powers in the Government, or rather, to put it more technically, to make all those powers exercisable by the Government. That Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act was signed by the Governor-General on the 11th December, 1936. It may be of interest to recall that that was his death warrant: he ceased, the minute he signed that, to be Governor-General. Also it might be of interest—it is of no interest now, except to constitutional lawyers—to consider how it was that the representative of the King who had abdicated the previous day was able to give the assent of that King to a constitutional amendment.}}

However, de Valera was later advised by the [[Attorney-General of the Irish Free State|Attorney-General]] and senior advisors that the amendment was not sufficient to abolish the office entirely, which still continued by virtue of [[Letters Patent]], [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]], and [[law of the Republic of Ireland#Statute law|statute law]]. Though officially insisting that the office had been abolished (de Valera instructed Ua Buachalla to act as though he had left office and to leave his official residence), de Valera introduced a second law, the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937, to retrospectively eliminate the post from [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]]. Under its own terms, the act applied retroactively, so that the office would be deemed to have been fully abolished on 11 December 1936.

Ua Buachalla and de Valera, although once close friends, fell out over Ua Buachalla's treatment in the abolition of the viceregal post, with Ua Buachalla initiating legal proceedings to sue de Valera. However, their relationship was eventually healed and, when de Valera later became President of Ireland, he appointed Ua Buachalla to the [[Irish Council of State|Council of State]] in 1959. Ua Buachalla was the last surviving governor-general, dying aged 97 on 30 October 1963.

'''Henry Tufts''' (1748–1831) was an infamous 18th-century thief who committed various crimes in northern [[New England]]. Most of what we know about his life and crimes comes from his 1807 autobiography ''A Narrative of the Life, Adventures, Travels and Sufferings of Henry Tufts, Now Residing at [[Limington, Maine|Lemington]], in the District of [[Maine]]. In Substance as Compiled from his own Mouth.''&lt;ref | name="DETMoM"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beem |first=Engar Allen |authorlink= |author2= |date=August 2008 |title=Rogues, Rascals, &amp; Villains |journal=Down East: the Magazine of Maine |volume= |issue= |pages=86–88 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This autobiography was reprinted in 1930 as ''Autobiography of a Criminal''.&lt;ref | name="DETMoM" /&gt; Neal Keating's 1993 reprint of Tufts' autobiography summarizes Tufts as a "horse thief, [[bigamist]], burglar, adulterer, [[confidence trick|con man]], scoundrel, counterfeiter, (military) deserter and common criminal."

=="An uncommonly misspent life"==
[[Image:Henry Tufts' Autobiography.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of Henry Tufts' book]]
Tufts was born in [[Newmarket, New Hampshire]], in June 1748 to a tailor and his wife.  Tufts would grow up in the nearby town of [[Lee, New Hampshire|Lee]], where he would first exhibit his "natural propensity to theft."

Tufts began his criminal activities at the age of 14 with thefts of "apples, pears, cucumbers, and other fruits of the earth," and then graduating to "a paper money bill" of a neighbor. He soon went on to stealing horses (which he disguised by coloring them) including the theft and subsequent selling of his own father's horse. The autobiography goes on to list numerous thefts of everything from silver spoons to livestock and clothes. He stole from houses, [[barn]]s, and [[Retailing|stores]]. He usually sold the stolen objects in neighboring towns.

He [[marry|married]] one Lydia Bickford around the age of 22, but would later marry other women without divorcing Lydia.

Tufts was first imprisoned in 1770, where he attempted his first of many escapes by using the cell's heating fire to burn through a wooden wall of the jail.

Many of his jail escapes were accomplished with due small tools concealed on his person or passed to him visits from friends. Not even his fellow prisoners were safe from his [[Psychopathy|sociopathic]] ways: once he and a fellow prisoner "stripped off all our clothes, turn(ed) them inside out, and (flung) them out" of the small hole Tufts had made in the jail wall.  Tufts exited first and, before waiting for his accomplice to follow, "gathered up (his) apparel, which I expected in all likelihood to need…and sped away."

When imprisoned, Tufts often saw himself as the unfair victim, once commenting on his time in a jail as "in the shocking circumstances…described, I continued for upwards of three months, without aid or assistance from either friend or foe, or so much as the expectation of relief – no eye had [[pity]] on me!"

Tufts spent several years among the [[Abenaki]] Indians in or near [[Bethel, Maine]] and learned their natural medicines from [[Molly Ockett]] shortly before his final arrest in 1794 at [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]]. Sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], his sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]] by Governor [[Samuel Adams]]. After five years imprisoned on [[Castle Island (Massachusetts)|Castle Island]] in [[Boston Harbor]], he was transferred to the jail in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], from whence he escaped to Maine. If his autobiography is to be believed, he thereafter lived as a [[Healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] and farmer without further criminal misdeeds.&lt;ref | name="DETMoM" /&gt;

Ultimately, while an entertaining book, it is difficult to tell how much of Tufts' autobiography is completely true. In his foreword to a 1993 reprint of the book, Keating points out that "Henry Tufts' favorite scheme was [[lie|lying]]…(and) in his autobiography he lies.…"

Since the [[North Korean famine]], they have formed a large [[informal economy]]. Since the 1990s, the government has become more lenient towards them; however, merchants still face heavy regulations. Currently a majority of North Koreans are dependent on markets for their survival.

The North Korean government has tried to regulate growth of the [[market economy]] in North Korea with a variety of methods. Some of them such as regulating the age of traders has caused some societal changes such as making women more responsible for earning money for their families. This has resulted in changing gender roles in North Korean society.

There have been speculations on the possible role of black markets in causing reforms of the North Korean government and its economy, as happened in China· &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/opinion/global/The-Market-Shall-Set-North-Korea-Free.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Market Shall Set North Korea Free|last=Jin-Sung|first=Jang|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They originally sold essential items, rice and vegetables.&lt;ref name="NewFocus2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newfocusintl.com/jangmadang-walls-are-growing-higher/ |title=North Korea's Jangmadang walls are growing higher |author= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private markets evolved from local communities involving various organizations, workplaces, relatives and neighbors, that helped people to survive during the [[North Korean famine|famine]]. Many of these mutual-help arrangements broke up later on, as markets developed.{{sfn|Kwon|Chung|2012|pp=166–167}}

Unlike in cities, the people use [[bartering]] instead of money to engage in trade.&lt;ref name="NewFocus2013"/&gt;

China dominates both the official and unofficial economies in North Korea. Some people received their start-up capital from relatives in China. Many of these relatives also became partners and advisers in business.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/10/304_96327.html |title=NK is no Stalinist country |author=Andrei Lankov |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===As a source of livelihood===
[[File:North Korea (5015885842).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=A North Korean vendor on a makeshift market stand selling goods.|Most North Koreans are dependent on markets to survive.]]

{{As of|2008}}, an estimate of 70 percent of households living in cities engage in handicrafts, trade or transportation services related to trade. Without a working food distribution system, people need local markets to earn money and survive.&lt;ref name="DailyNK2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=4409 |title=2008 Top Items in the Jangmadang |author=Park In Ho |date= |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While actual monthly salary was two U.S. dollars, an average North Korean earned a total of around 15 dollars a month in 2011. Successful black-market operators and actual capitalistic success stories are rare, however, even if a few former laborers and farmers have become very rich with income of hundreds and even thousands of dollars a month.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes2011"/&gt; Between a half and three-quarters of North Korean people's income come from various market activities. However, crackdowns by government lead to irregularities in business and bribing.&lt;ref name="Silberstein_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2015/08/28/a-new-defector-survey-about-market-trade-in-north-korea-and-what-it-says-maybe-about-kim-jong-un/ |title=A new defector survey about market trade in North Korea, and what it says (maybe) about Kim Jong-un |author=Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein |date=28 August 2015 |website=www.nkeconwatch.com |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual studies conducted among defectors by the Seoul National University Institute for Peace and Unification Studies revealed, even if the studies may be misrepresentative of the whole population, that little more than half of them received money from the North Korean state. A significant growth of number of the people engaged in private business activities and related bribing was also noted.&lt;ref name="Silberstein_2015"/&gt;

[[Kookmin University]] professor [[Andrei Lankov]] reports that some Jangmadang merchants, in addition to the elite and foreign currency earners, have paid for private education of their children. Music, computers and foreign languages have been the most popular courses among the private courses. In North Korea, the [[songbun]] system heavily regulates access to public education, and people with a modest background have a difficult time to get into universities such as [[Kim Il-sung University]]. Andrei Lankov, however, welcomed a crackdown of the private education by North Korean officials, despite having doubts about corruption and competitiveness of the public education in North Korea.&lt;ref name="RFA2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/lankov-02122014111559.html |title=North Korean Crackdown on Private Education Overlooks Real Issue |author=Andrei Lankov |date= |website=[[Radio Free Asia]] |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[Korea Institute for National Unification]] estimated there were 440 government-approved markets employing about 1.1 million people.&lt;ref name=nyt-20170430&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/world/asia/north-korea-economy-marketplace.html |title=As Economy Grows, North Korea's Grip on Society Is Tested |last=Sang-Hun |first=Choe |newspaper=New York Times |date=30 April 2017 |accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===
{{Further information|Agriculture in North Korea}}

The traders smuggle food across the border from China to North Korea for sale.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Usually crops are the cheapest right after harvest season. In addition to the typical seasonal changes in the prices of crops, droughts in North Korea may cause severe increase in prices of foodstuffs, and harm people's ability to keep a balanced and nutritious diet. In 2015, the drought tripled the price of potatoes compared to same time in 2014. Rumors of a bad potato harvest coming also caused increase in prices.&lt;ref name="DailyNK_potato"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=13288 |title=Hot potato! Produce prices surge in drought |author=Unification Media Group |date= |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Koreans who engage in various kinds of household business also farm private land. Those poorest North Koreans without an ability start even a food stall usually live through subsistence farming. Significant portion of North Korean food supply is produced illegally and privately, on small farm plots known in North Korea as ''sotoji'' (small land in Korean).&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes2011"/&gt;

===Goods and services offered===
[[File:Hamhung cyclist.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=North Korean man riding a bike in Hamhung while using a cellphone.|Bicycles and mobile phones are becoming more prevalent in North Korea.]]

Even if living conditions have not improved much in North Korea, the market activity and range of goods have had an increase. The quality of the goods has also increased.&lt;ref name="NewFocus2013"/&gt;

In 2008 among the most popular or wanted goods sold at markets were street food, car batteries, rice cookers, electric shavers, dress shoes, cosmetics, DVD-players, motorcycles and vinyl floor coverings. Many of the brand labels on goods for sale are fake, and pretend to be South Korean made goods.&lt;ref name="DailyNK2009"/&gt;

Cannabis may or may not be [[Legality of cannabis by country#North Korea|legal in North Korea]]. There is a report of it being sold in [[Rason]] market.&lt;ref name="Bohemian2013Sep"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebohemianblog.com/2013/09/on-smoking-weed-in-north-korea.html |title=On Smoking Weed in North Korea |author=Darmon Richter |date=September 2013 |website=www.thebohemianblog.com |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohemian2013Nov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebohemianblog.com/2013/11/smoking-weed-in-north-korea-critical.html |title=Smoking Weed in North Korea: A Critical Review |author=Darmon Richter |date=November 2013 |website=www.thebohemianblog.com |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914150016/http://www.thebohemianblog.com/2013/11/smoking-weed-in-north-korea-critical.html |archivedate=14 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drugs like [[methamphetamine]] are undoubtedly illegal. North Korea has one of the worst drug problems in the world with much of the population addicted to the drugs, due to a widespread use of methamphetamine as a drug and medicine.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Livestock stalls are a recent addition with markets in large cities being transformed into agricultural markets.&lt;ref name="DailyNK2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=13339&amp;cataId=nk00100 |title=Livestock stalls introduced to 'jangmadang'  |author=Unification Media Group |date=2015 |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Money lending and foreign currency exchange have appeared with growth of the markets.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} As banks do not really function in North Korea, but in name, the market stalls are used as the main platform for banking transactions.&lt;ref name="NewFocus2013_2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newfocusintl.com/north-korea-implements-identity-based-vendor-system/ |title=North Korea Implements Identity-Based Vendor System |author= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people use foreign currency for their savings and those selling more valuable goods often use [[Renminbi|Chinese yuan]]. Taking a loan, to buy expensive goods such as bicycles, has become more common.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Even private medical services have appeared in the markets with retired doctors offering their services, and with self-trained [[traditional Korean medicine]] practicers present too. The doctors charge around 10 dollars for a diagnosis, and some doctors fill in prescriptions for people. Many of these doctors had been unable to live on their measly wages. Black market medical services have been around since the free health care system collapsed in the 1990s. Some officials have themselves been forced to receive help from the same doctors they are supposed to crackdown.&lt;ref name="DailyNK_diagnosis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=13458 |title=Black market diagnoses saving more lives |author=Seol Song Ah |date=11 September 2015 |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in possible reforms==
{{See also|Transition economy}}

One defector reportedly displayed surprise on the similarity between markets in North Korea and South Korea, instead of the contrasts.&lt;ref name="NewFocus2013"/&gt;

Some have talked about ''Jangmadang Generation'' while referring to the people born in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="DailyNK_generation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=13323&amp;cataId=nk02501 |title='Jangmadang Generation' at the core of change in NK  |author1=Jihae Lee |author2=George Swartz |date= |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Jong-un has been speculated to want more liberal marketplaces than [[Kim Jong-il]].&lt;ref name="DailyNK2015"/&gt; However, as market trade has increased, support for Kim Jong-un among the people has not notably weakened, which casts into doubt the claim that market reforms would dwindle support for the regime.&lt;ref name="Silberstein_2015"/&gt;

===Access to outside information===
{{See also|Cyberactivism in North Korea}}
Foreign media smuggled in North Korea may encourage people to defy their government, and encourage a regime change.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Influence from relative Chinese prosperity may also make people want reforms.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Crackdowns and regulation by North Korean government==
[[File:North Korea - Women workers (5609059647).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=A group of aged women with full backpacks sitting on the street.|These women are possibly so called "tick merchants", who are frequently persecuted by officials.]]

Some people sell their wares in alleyways near the actual marketplace to avoid harassment and extortion by officials of the [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Ministry of People's Security]]. These merchants are called, for their rapid proliferation, "tick merchants" in North Korea. They are also sometimes referred to as "grasshopper merchants".&lt;ref name="DailyNK_Seol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=12888&amp;cataId=nk01500 |title=Crackdowns Ease Up on Alley Merchants |author=Seol Song Ah |date= |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2007, the officials tried to take control of sales of the Chinese-made plastic floor coverings, which had become popular and profitable with increasing living standards, by decreeing that they may be sold only through state-owned stores. The officials also tried to regulate private buses and trucks exceeding the weight limit of eight tons, and tried to register the violators as state employees and declare the vehicles as state property. This wholesale business with trucks is known as ''{{transl|ko|Chapan-Jangsa}}'' in North Korea. These two economic activities were among the three most profitable businesses in addition to [[methamphetamine]] sales.&lt;ref name="DailyNK_Yang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=2312 |title=Purchase Popular Jangmadang Goods at State-Operated Stores. |author=Yang Jung A |date=3 July 2007 |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 an identity-based vendor system was started to stop people from avoiding stall rental fees. They now have to hold a vendor card around the neck during business hours. These vendor cards can be used to check if a merchant has paid the stall fees and to verify their identity. Vendors have also been made to rotate their stall locations.&lt;ref name="NewFocus2013_2"/&gt;

Some well-to-do merchants are allowed to skip the mobilizations by flexible local units. People with good ''[[songbun]]'' (family background) are also allowed more excuses for being absent.&lt;ref name="DailyNK_potato"/&gt;

===Age regulation===
In 2008 women younger than 40 years old were banned from doing business in markets.&lt;ref name="DailyNK2009"/&gt;

However, under the rule of [[Kim Jong-un]], the age limits have been removed from women, even though they have been raised for men. Currently only men over 60 are allowed to work on markets. This is an attempt to enforce loyalty of the workers to their workplaces, according to a [[Daily NK]] source from [[Ryanggang Province]].&lt;ref name="DailyNK_Kang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=13311 |title=Men under 60 banned from market activities  |author=Kang Mi Jin |date= |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currency reforms===
{{Further information|North Korean won#2009 revaluation}}

One theory of North Korean government's goals in the 2009 revaluation of the won, is that it targeted those traders who had grown very rich. The currency reform also caused an initial flurry of buying in ''jangmadangs'' by worried people to make sure their savings did not lose all of their value. For some time, only the [[Renminbi|Chinese Yuan]], in addition to other foreign currencies, was practically accepted in trade, with the exception of food merchants selling rice. Eventually the new won stabilized near the pre-currency reform value, after suffering a period of [[hyperinflation]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Changing gender roles in North Korean society==
{{Further information|Women in North Korea}}
[[File:North Korea (5015282819).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Two elderly North Korean women sitting on street. One of them is preparing food.|Role of the North Korean women has been changing with growth of the markets.]]

During the North Korean famine, people received and shared help first in their local community through organizations, workplaces, relatives and neighbors. These networks for assistance and barter were based on existing solidarity and trust. It has been reported that even women's organizations, such as elderly women's association, were able to give help. The initial barter networks developed into early makeshift marketplaces. However, many of the originally existing mutual-help relations strained and broke up later on.{{sfn|Kwon|Chung|2012|pp=166–167}}

Married women and elderly women with married children and grandchildren, played the most active role in the early mutual-help arrangements and the birth of marketplaces. North Korea human rights reporter [[Barbara Demick]] called these women "mothers of invention". These women were the ones to take risk of traveling great distances, and going to find food from countryside, or even from other [[Provinces of North Korea|provinces]] despite regulations against human mobility. The local administration in provinces which had suffered food shortages in the 1980s, was tolerant on the actions people took to survive. These women also defied regulations against unauthorized goods transactions, and some crossed the dangerous border to China as temporary migrants, to take the role of family's breadwinner.{{sfn|Kwon|Chung|2012|p=168}}

Historically in North Korea the man has been seen as a head of the family, and provider for family's livelihood,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} but with collapse of the North Korean economy, the men have been forced to stay in their workplaces even if they can not work in a non-functioning factory. As it has become impossible to live with monthly salary anymore, the role of the provider has increasingly fallen for women to do.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes2011"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} A married woman can be registered as a full-time housewife giving freedom to trade. Men have to pay to the factory management for the same unofficial privilege.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes2011"/&gt; However, women's relative freedom has allowed some men to stay in market life to earn money. As men take care of the wholesale and transportation, the women take care of the actual selling of the goods on marketplaces.&lt;ref name="DailyNK_Kang"/&gt; According to Andrei Lankov, remarkably the women dominate North Korean economy on the lower levels. The women engage not only in trade, but on small scale household production making shoes, sewing garments and preparing food for sale.&lt;ref name="KoreaTimes2011"/&gt;

'''Jukun''' are an ethno-linguistic group or ethnic nation in [[West Africa]]. The Jukun are traditionally located in [[Taraba State|Taraba]], [[Benue State|Benue]], [[Nasarawa]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]], and [[Gombe State|Gombe]] States in Nigeria and parts of northwestern [[Cameroon]]. They are descendants of the people of [[Kwararafa]]. Most of the tribes in the north central of Nigeria trace their origin to the Jukun people and are related in one way or the other to the Jukuns. Until the coming of both Christianity and Islam, the Jukun people were followers of their own Traditional Religions, Most of the tribes, [[Alago]], [[Agatu]], [[Rendere]], [[Gumai]] in [[Shendam]], and others left Kwararafa when it disintegrated as a result of a power tussle. The Jukuns are divided into two major groups; the Jukun Wanu and Jukun Wapa. The Jukun Wanu are fishermen residing along the banks of the river Benue and Niger where they run through Taraba state, Benue state and Nasarawa state.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The [[Wukari Federation]], headed by the Aku Uka of Wukari, is now the main center of the Jukun people.&lt;ref name=adesoji&gt;{{cite web

==Population and demographics==
Writing in the late 1920s, the British anthropologist [[C. K. Meek]] estimated that there were approximately 25,000 Jukun-speakers then alive.&lt;ref name="Meek 1"/&gt; Meek noted that the majority of the Jukun lived in scattered groups around the [[Benue basin]], in an area that roughly corresponded to the extent of the kingdom of Kwararafa as it existed in the 18th century. That area of Jukun habitation, Meek noted, was bounded by [[Abinsi]] to the west, [[Kona Department|Kona]] to the east, [[Pindiga]] to the north and [[Donga Department|Donga]] to the south.&lt;ref name="Meek 1"/&gt;

The language can be divided into six separate dialects: Wukari, Donga, Kona, Gwana and Pindiga, Jibu, and finally Wase Tofa, although Meek noted that the dialects of "Kona, Gwana and Pindiga differ so little that they may be regarded as one."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mee31|Meek 1931]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Kwararafa===
[[File:Kwararafa.jpeg|thumb|right|An estimated approximation of the boundaries of the historical Kwararafa, the kingdom from which the modern Jukun claim descendence.]]
The Jukun-speaking peoples trace their ancestry to the rulers of the kingdom of [[Kwararafa]], a state which existed in Western Africa from the 14th through to the 18th centuries. Traditionally, Jukun society was governed by a [[monarchy]].

===Modern history===
As a result of the [[Fulani]] conquests at the beginning of the 19th century, the Jukun-speaking peoples became politically divided into various regional factions.&lt;ref name="Meek 1"/&gt; By the 1920s, the main body of the Jukun population, known as the Wapâ, resided in and around [[Wukari]], where they were governed by the local king and his administration.&lt;ref name="Meek 1"/&gt; Other Jukun-speaking peoples living in the Benue basin, such as Jukun wanu of Abinsi, Awei District, Donga and Takum, remained politically separate from the Wukari government, and the Jukun-speakers in Adamawa Province recognised the governorship of the Fulani Emir of [[Muri]].&lt;ref name="Meek 1"/&gt;

In the post-colonial period, Nigeria has suffered violence, the result of multiple ethnic tensions among the different communities living in the country. Tensions exist between the Jukun and the neighbouring [[Tiv people who migrated from Congo |Tiv]] community.

==Studies==
In 1931, the academic publishing company [[Routledge|Kegan Paul, Trubner &amp; Co.]] published ''A Sudanese Kingdom: An Ethnographic Study of the Jukun-speaking Peoples of Nigeria'', a book which had been written by the Briton [[C. K. Meek]], the Anthropological Officer stationed with the Administrative Service in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mee31|Meek 1931]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kaqchikel''' language (in modern orthography; formerly also spelled '''Cakchiquel''' or '''Cachiquel''') is an [[Mesoamerican languages|indigenous Mesoamerican language]] and a member of the Quichean–Mamean branch of the [[Mayan languages]] [[language family|family]]. It is spoken by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Kaqchikel people]] in central [[Guatemala]].  It is closely related to the [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] (Quiché) and [[Tz'utujil language]]s.

Kaqchikel is taught in public schools through [[Intercultural bilingual education in Guatemala|Guatemala's intercultural bilingual education programs]].

== History ==

=== Before conquest ===
Kaqchikel is spoken by the indigenous Maya in Central Guatemala. The Mayan civilization dates back to the Pre-classic period (2000 BC to 300 AD). Geographically, the Maya expanded from [[Mexico]], [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. This changed between 900&amp;nbsp;AD and when the Spanish arrived. Their settlement moved west and into the highlands of Guatemala. Archaeological evidence shows suggestions of Kaqchikel living in [[Iximche]]’, which today is located near [[Tecpán Guatemala|Tecpan]], Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://latamst.ku.edu/kaqchikel|title=Kaqchikel &amp;#124; Center for Latin American &amp; Caribbean Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=www.studyabroad.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After conquest ===
In 1523, the Spaniards left Mexico and headed towards Guatemala. This crusade was led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. His first victory was over the [[K'iche' kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K’iche]], which led him towards the Kaqchikel capital. The Kaqchikel joined forces with de Alvarado, to take over the [[Tz'utujil people|Tz’utujiles]]. Instead, their hopes to become stronger were defeated when de Alvarado turned against them and destroyed their capital, which was a part of the Spanish’s mass extermination plans of the indigenous. This plan decreased the number of Kaqchikel speakers, as they were required to then speak Spanish.

=== Present ===
Today, the Mayan language of Kaqchikel is being revitalized and several Mayans are using education as a way to restore their language and culture. In 1986 the Academy of the Mayan Languages of Guatemala (ALMG) discovered an alphabet for the Mayan languages, which started a new movement for linguistic conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of Our Language: Kaqchikel Maya Maintenance, Shift, and Revitalization|last=Brown|first=R. McKenna|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-292-76335-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literacy ==
Literacy rates in Kaqchikel are low. Literacy campaigns are usually conducted in Spanish, and promote Spanish. In fact, most Mayan people are more literate in Spanish than they are in their native tongue. However, this is changing due to the movement to promote Mayan language literacy. Kaqchikel is being taught in public schools such as Guatemala’s intercultural bilingual education programs. United States universities also offer programs that give the opportunity to learn Kaqchikel, such as [[Tulane University]] and the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://latamst.ku.edu/kaqchikel|title=Kaqchikel {{!}} Center for Latin American &amp; Caribbean Studies|website=latamst.ku.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External classification==
Kaqchikel is a member of the [[Mayan languages|Mayan language family]]. Mayan languages fall under the Proto- Mayan language family. This family is broken into four branches: Western, Eastern, Yucatecan, and Huastecan. Kaqchikel falls under the Qichean and Quichean Proper. Quichean Proper breaks down into four new languages: Kaqchikel, Tz’utujil, K’iche’, and Achi. Tz’utujil is the closest dialect to Kaqchikel. Mayan languages are spoken throughout Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. 
[[File:Tree of maya languages.svg|thumb]] 

In [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s [[Amerind languages|Amerind]] hypothesis, Kaqchikel is classified as a member of the Penutian stock, in the Mayan branch of the Mexican family within that stock. However, this hypothesis has been largely discounted by modern linguists.

Greenberg's hypothesis has received significant amounts of negative criticism from many important linguists ever since it was first published in 1987. In Greenberg's etymological dictionary of Amerind, Kaqchikel words are found in 5 entries. Four of the entries are unremarkable; but the fifth uses two words, ''a-ĉin'' and ''iŝ-tan'', as examples of a protophoneme ''*t'ina / t'ana / t'una'', meaning "son/child/daughter" despite the fact that ''a-ĉin'' was already used in the dictionary to mean "elder". This is an example of a commonly cited flaw in the work, which is that Greenberg reaches too far in search of evidence. In general, the documentation of Kaqchikel in the Amerind etymological dictionary serves to highlight the problems with the hypothesis more than it helps Greenberg's cause.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Phonology==
In the charts below, each of the Kaqchikel phonemes is represented by the character or set of characters that denote it in the standard orthography developed by the [[Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages]] (ALMG) and sanctioned by the Guatemalan government. Where different, the corresponding symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] appears in brackets. The dialect used in this example is that of Xenacoj.

===Vowels ===
Kaqchikel dialects differ somewhat in their [[vowel]]s. Each dialect has a set of five [[tenseness|tense]] vowels and either one, two, four, or five lax vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Patal Majzul et al., 2000, pp. 34ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The chart below shows all the possible vowels that can occur in dialects of Kaqchikel. Although the dialect of [[Sololá]] uses the maximal ten-vowel system with all the vowels except [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}}, the dialects of [[San Juan Sacatepéquez]] and [[San Andrés Semetabaj]] only use the five tense vowels and schwa.

There is a variance in the pronunciation of the lax vowels across the dialects. Some dialects lower the given vowel, others center the vowel but do not lower it. The Xenacoj dialect used here both centers and lowers the vowels with a tendency to more strongly lower close vowels and more strongly center back vowels.

The pronunciation of the letters ''o'' and ''u'' varies between [ɤ] and [o] for ''o'', and [ɯ] and [u] for ''u''. This roundness ambiguity for the letters ''o'' and ''u'' is a trait found in many Mayan languages such as Tzotzil and Mam. The letters may be pronounced as either rounded or unrounded depending on the speakers preference and both are considered correct.

*The letter "ü" has a pronunciation between the "ʉ" and "ʊ" sounds. It is farther back and lower than the standard "ʉ" but it is not as low or back as standard "ʊ".
*The letter "ö" has similar traits. It is typically pronounced as either a lower "ɵ", though not as low as "ɘ" but may also be pronounced as "ɔ". It may fall anywhere between those sounds, but only lowered "ɵ" and centered "ɔ" are considered to be correct.

===Consonants===
Like other Mayan languages, Kaqchikel does not distinguish [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate consonant|affricates]] but instead distinguishes plain and [[glottalic consonant|glottalized]] stops and affricates. The plain stops and affricates (technically "[[pulmonic egressive]]") are usually voiceless and are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] at the ends of words and unaspirated elsewhere. The glottalized stops and affricates are usually [[ejective consonant|ejective]] in the case of ''t' '', ''k' '', ''ch' '', and ''tz' '' and [[implosive consonant|implosive]] in the case of ''b' '' and ''q' ''.&lt;ref&gt;Patal Majzul et al., 2000, pp. 24ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allophones and phonological processes===
Several of the consonants in Kaqchikel have variant forms that occur in certain positions within a word.
*The plain [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p t k/}} are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] internally before the prefix '''-b'äl''' and in word-final position.
**Examples:
***{{IPA|/tsʼetɓɨl/}} ''viewpoint'' is realized as {{IPA|[tsʼetʰɓɨl]}}
***{{IPA|/pop/}} ''knapsack'' is realized as {{IPA|[popʰ]}}
***{{IPA|/tat/}} ''dad'' is realized as {{IPA|[tatʰ]}}
***{{IPA|/kuk/}} ''squirrel'' is realized as {{IPA|[kukʰ]}}
*Before {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] to become {{IPA|[kʲ]}}. In the same position, the ejective {{IPA|/kʼ/}} palatalizes to become {{IPA|[kʼʲ]}}.
**Examples:
***{{IPA|/keχ/}} ''horse'' is realized as {{IPA|[kʲeχ]}}
***{{IPA|/kiʔ/}} ''sweet'' is realized as {{IPA|[kʲiʔ]}}
***{{IPA|/kʼekʼ/}} ''stingy'' is realized as {{IPA|[kʼʲekʼ]}}
***{{IPA|/kʼim/}} ''straw'' is realized as {{IPA|[kʼʲim]}}
*The [[voiceless uvular stop]] has an affricated release in final position. It is realized as the affricate {{IPA|[qx]}} in this position only, and is not contrastive.
**Examples:
***{{IPA|/ɓaq/}} ''bone'' realized as {{IPA|[ɓaqx]}}
***{{IPA|/winɨq/}} ''person'' realized as {{IPA|[vinɨqx]}}
*The [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} plays an important role in Kaqchikel; since words may not begin with a vowel and [[diphthong]]s do not exist in the language, this consonant often serves to separate vowels, and is found at the beginning of words that would otherwise begin with a vowel. It can also occur syllable- and word-finally.
**Examples:
***{{IPA|/aʠaʔ/}} ''your hand'' is realized as {{IPA|[ʔaʠaʔ]}}
***{{IPA|/iwir/}} ''yesterday'' is realized as {{IPA|[ʔiwir]}}
*The [[implosive consonant]]s in Kaqchikel are usually voiceless, which is unusual for implosives.
**The voiceless bilabial {{IPA|[p]}} has a tendency to be fricatized to {{IPA|[ɸ]}} word finally, before {{IPA|[u]}} and when in consonant clusters. In many dialects /ɸ/ has become the standard pronunciation in all situations while in others it has become /f/.
**The [[bilabial ejective|voiceless bilabial ejective]] {{IPA|[pʼ]}} is an allophone of the [[voiced bilabial implosive|bilabial implosive]] {{IPA|[ɓ]}}; there is free variation between the two in word-final position. Elsewhere, only {{IPA|[p']}} is found. For example, the word {{IPA|sɪɓ/}} "smoke" can be realized as {{IPA|[sɪɓ]}} or {{IPA|[sɪpʼ]}} with no change in meaning; but {{IPA|/ɓaqx/}} ''bone'' can never be realized as {{IPA|[pʼaqx]}} because the implosive occurs word-initially rather than word-finally.
**The [[voiceless uvular implosive|uvular implosive]] {{IPA|[ʠ]}} and its allophone, the [[uvular ejective|voiceless uvular ejective]] {{IPA|[qʼ]}}, experience free variation in the same position. For example, {{IPA|/aʠ/}}''tongue'' can be realized as {{IPA|[ʔaʠ]}} or {{IPA|[ʔaqʼ]}}; but {{IPA|/ʠiχ/}} can only ever be realized as {{IPA|[ʠiχ]}} because the implosive occurs word-initially.
*The [[sonorant consonant|sonorants]] {{IPA|/l ɾ j/}} are devoiced in word-final position and before another consonant.
*The distribution of the phoneme represented by the letter ''w'' is quite varied across Kaqchikel dialects. It has a total of seven [[allophone]]s: {{IPA|/β x pʰ f v ʍ w/}}. The [[labiovelar approximant]] {{IPA|/w/}} is the historical standard pronunciation, and this spelling has been maintained in order to have a single standard for all the various dialects of Kaqchikel. There is too much variation to list here, but these are some generalizations:
**At the beginning of a word, {{IPA|/w/}} can be realized in speech as {{IPA|[β]}} (only before back vowels {{IPA|/o u/}}), as {{IPA|[v]}} (only before front vowels {{IPA|/e i/}}), or another vowel which is itself followed by a uvular), or as just {{IPA|[w]}} (before any vowel), depending on the dialect. {{IPA|[v ~ w]}} can also occur internally in the same vowel environments.
***Examples:
****{{IPA|/wonon/}} ''bumblebee'' can be realized as {{IPA|[βonon]}} or {{IPA|[wonon]}}
****''wïy'' {{IPA|/wɨj/}} ''tortilla'' can be realized as {{IPA|[vɨj]}} or {{IPA|[wɨj]}}
****{{IPA|/wuquʔ/}} ''seven'' can be realized as {{IPA|[βuquʔ]}} or {{IPA|[vuquʔ]}} or {{IPA|[wuquʔ]}}
****{{IPA|/iwir/}} ''yesterday'' can be realized as {{IPA|[ʔivir]}} or {{IPA|[ʔiwir]}}
**At the end of a word, the {{IPA|/w/}} phoneme can be realized in one of four ways: {{IPA|[pʰ f ʍ]}} can be found in all environments, and {{IPA|[x]}} can occur after {{IPA|/o u/}}, depending on the dialect.
***Examples:
****{{IPA|/tew/}} ''cold'' can be realized as {{IPA|[tepʰ]}}, {{IPA|[tef]}} or {{IPA|[teʍ]}}.
****{{IPA|/kow/}} ''hard'' can be realized as {{IPA|[kopʰ]}}, {{IPA|[kof]}}, {{IPA|[koʍ]}} or {{IPA|[kox]}}.

===Syllable structure===
Kaqchikel has several constraints on syllable structure. The most common syllable types are CV (consonant-vowel) and CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant). V (vowel only) or VC (vowel-consonant) syllables are not allowed phonetically; a syllable that is conceived of as beginning with a vowel will begin in pronunciation with a glottal stop, although this is not always reflected in standard orthography or in the phonological realization of a word. While two CVC syllables often occur next to each other in the same word, true consonant clusters are relatively uncommon. When these do occur they are normally at word boundaries and consist of either two [[continuant]]s, a sonorant and a stop, or a [[fricative consonant|fricative]] and a [[stop consonant|stop]], with the stop always to the inside of its partner.

==Morphology and syntax==
Kaqchikel is a moderately [[synthetic language]] with [[fusional language|fusional]] affixes. It has a strong system of [[affix]]ation, including both suffixes and prefixes. These attach to both nouns and verbs; prefixes are exclusively [[inflection|inflective]], whereas suffixes can be inflective or [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]]. Inflective prefixes are quite short, often composed of a single sound and never consisting of more than three; suffixes can be longer than this. Because of the synthetic-fusional nature of Kaqchikel, it is difficult to discuss the language's [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]] as two separate entities; they are very robustly intertwined.

===Word classes===
Kaqchikel has 6 major word classes and several minor classes, referred to collectively as "particles." The major word classes are groups of bases or roots that can take affixes. These classes are nouns, adjectives, adverbs, intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and positionals. Positionals in this language are a group of roots which cannot function as words on their own; in combination with affixes they are used to describe relationships of position and location. In English, these words would fall into other categories, namely adjectives, adverbs, and verbs, both transitive and intransitive.

The minor classes or particles are words that do not take affixes; they mostly function in adverbial roles, and include such things as interrogative particles, affirmative/negative words, markers of time and location, conjunctions, prepositions and demonstratives. In addition to these officially recognized classes, there are a few other groups of words which do not fall neatly into any of the above categories. These groups are articles, pronouns, numbers, affectives, and words used for measurement. All of these types of words function differently in Kaqchikel, and so they are considered to belong to different word classes.

===Agreement===
Kaqchikel shows agreement with the subject and object of a verb.  Nouns also show agreement with their possessors.  The agreement pattern of Kaqchikel follows an [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative-absolutive pattern]]. This affects both nouns and verbs. The functions of the [[ergative case|ergative agreement]] include marking not only subjects of [[transitive verb]]s, but also possessors of nouns. There are two main sets of allomorphs for the ergative agreement markers, which are prefixed to the noun or verb they modify. One set is used before roots beginning in a consonant, and the other before those beginning with a vowel. These forms below are found when the ergative marks the possessor of nouns.

Before a consonant, these forms occur:
{| class="wikitable"
! &amp;nbsp;
! '''Singular'''
! '''Plural'''
|-
! '''1st person'''
| align="center"| nu-
| align="center"| qa-
|-
! '''2nd person'''
| align="center"| a-
| align="center"| i-
|-
! '''3rd person'''
| align="center"| ru-
| align="center"| ki-
|}

And before a vowel, these are found:
{| class="wikitable"
! &amp;nbsp;
! '''Singular'''
! '''Plural'''
|-
! '''1st person'''
| align="center"| w-
| align="center"| q-
|-
! '''2nd person'''
| align="center"| aw-
| align="center"| iw-
|-
! '''3rd person'''
| align="center"| r-
| align="center"| k-
|}

When the ergative forms are being used to denote the subject of a transitive verb, some of the forms differ. Before consonants, first person singular ''nu-'' becomes ''in-'' and third person singular ''ru-'' becomes ''u-''. Before vowels, first person singular ''w-'' becomes ''inw-'', third person singular ''u-'' becomes ''ur-'', first person plural ''qa-'' becomes ''w-'', and third person plural ''ki-'' becomes ''kiw-''.

The third person singular of the ergative is variable in its phonology, and the initial /r/ is often omitted, with variability among the different dialects of Kaqchikel. Absolutive agreement has three functions: its marks the subject of an [[intransitive verb]], the subject of a non-verbal predicate, and the object of a transitive verb. Unlike ergative agreement, it has only one set of forms, which are used before both consonants and vowels.

{| class="wikitable"
! &amp;nbsp;
! '''Singular'''
! '''Plural'''
|-
! '''1st person'''
| align="center"| in-
| align="center"| oj-
|-
! '''2nd person'''
| align="center"| at-
| align="center"| ix-
|-
! '''3rd person'''
| align="center"| -
| align="center"| e-
|}

Note that the third person singular is unmarked. In some dialects, an [[epenthesis|epenthetic vowel]] is inserted between a marker of the incompletive or potential states and the base, in the space which would be occupied by the absolutive prefix. However, this is not an allophone of the absolutive third person singular marker, but rather a phonetic addition which is not related to the case marking system.

Also, it is important to note that marking of subjects and objects occurs only on the verb, not on any nouns which may fill those roles as constituents. Agreement can take the place of pronouns, thus the language has [[pro-drop]].

===Word order===

Kaqchikel has a word order in which the head of a phrase usually comes before any other element of the phrase.  The following sentences show examples of the order of sentences, determiner phrases (DP), noun phrases (NP), prepositional phrases (PP), and quantifier phrases (QP):
*1)	{{lang|cak|X-u-pax-ij  	ri achin	ri  b'ojoy}}
	com-3sE-break-tr 	 the man	the pot&lt;br&gt;
	'The man broke the pot'

*2)	[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Ru-tz'e' [&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; a Xwan] x-u-k'ux 		ri 	ak'wal.
		      3sErg-dog cl Juan com-3sErg-bite 	the 	child&lt;br&gt;
		'Juan's dog bit the child.'

*3)	K'o 	jun 	ch'oy 	[&lt;sub&gt;PP&lt;/sub&gt; chrij 		ri 	chak'at].
		exist 	a   	mouse       behind:3sErg	the	chair&lt;br&gt;
		' There is a mouse behind the chair.'

*4)	A Xwan 	x-u-tij			[&lt;sub&gt;QP&lt;/sub&gt; r-onojel 	ri 	kinäq].
		cl Juan	com-3sErg-eat	    3sErg-all	the	bean&lt;br&gt;
		'Juan ate all the beans.'

Sentences show considerable variability in their word order.  The syntactic function of words is determined not only by their position at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence, but also by their [[definiteness]], level of animation and potency, and a logical analysis of what role each word can play in the sentence. (For example, the verb ''to throw'' with the nouns ''child'' and ''stone'' can only have one logical ordering, regardless of the position of the nouns with respect to the verb. For this reason, an inanimate [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] cannot be the subject if the other constituent is animate.). Due to these conditions, Kaqchikel word order is relatively free and various orderings can be seen without there being any confusion or lack of understanding.

Possible [[word order]]s that can occur in Kaqchikel are verb-first orders (VSO, VOS) and subject-first orders (SVO, SOV). (V: verb, S: subject, O: object)
*Verb-first orders (VSO, VOS).  When the verb occurs first and only one constituent is definite, then that constituent functions as the subject.  If both constituents are definite, then the one closest to the verb (the first constituent) is the subject; if both constituents are indefinite, then the subject is the latter of the two.
*Subject-first orders (SVO, SOV). The subject can come first only if it is animate and the object is not. In this case, the definiteness of the two constituents does not matter; that is to say, the subject can be either definite or indefinite, so long as it is animate and occurs first. The order of the verb and object is unimportant.

Other constituents of a sentence, such as dative, comitative, agentive, and adverbial phrases, tend to come first in the sentence. However, they can also come after the nucleus of the sentence, the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]].

===Reduplication===
Kaqchikel uses reduplication as an [[intensifier]]. For example, the Kaqchikel word for ''large'' is {{IPA|/nim/}}; to say that something is ''very large'', the adjectival form is reduplicated as {{IPA|/nim nim/}}. This form is not a single word but two separate words which, when combined, intensify the meaning of the base word, the same way "very" does in English.

A '''mail-order bride''' is a woman who lists herself in catalogs and is selected by a man for marriage. In nineteenth-century America, mail-order brides came from well-developed areas on the Eastern seaboard to marry men in Western frontier lands. In the twentieth century, the trend was towards women living in [[developing country|developing countries]] seeking men in more developed nations. In the twenty-first century, the trend is now based primarily on internet-based meeting places which do not per se qualify as mail-order bride services.  The majority of the women listed in the twentieth-century and twenty-first-century services are from [[Southeast Asia]], countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and (to a lesser extent) from [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/files/article/MobRept_AppendixA.pdf uscis.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926052612/http://www.uscis.gov/files/article/MobRept_AppendixA.pdf |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] large numbers of eastern European women have advertised themselves in such a way, primarily from [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]]. Men who list themselves in such publications are referred to as "mail-order husbands," although this is much less common.

The term "mail-order bride" is both criticized by owners (and customers) of international marriage agencies and used by them as an easily recognizable term.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Love Stops at the Border": Marriage, Citizenship, and the "Mail-Order Brides" Industry |author=AM D'Aoust |year=2009 |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/dcc/workshops/documents/DAoust_DCC_Grad_Workshop_paper.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710103400/http://www.sas.upenn.edu/dcc/workshops/documents/DAoust_DCC_Grad_Workshop_paper.pdf |archivedate=July 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Services}}International marriage agency==
Mail-order brides work with "international marriage agencies".

An international marriage agency (also called an international introduction agency or international marriage broker) is a business that endeavors to introduce men and women of different countries for the purpose of [[marriage]], [[dating]], or [[Pen pal|correspondence]]. Many of these marriage agencies are based near women in developing countries (such as Ukraine, Russia, Colombia, Brazil, India, China, Thailand, and the Philippines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Gender: Social Science Perspectives |last1=Marchbank |first1=Dr. Jennifer |last2=Letherby |first2=Prof. Gayle |date=2007 |pages=194–195 |isbn=978-1405858441}}&lt;/ref&gt; International marriage agencies encourage women to register for their services, and facilitate communication and meetings with men from developed regions of North America, Western Europe, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 14 [http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?bc=1016|6715|16871|17119|13775 International Matchmaking Organizations: A Report to Congress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803040117/http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?bc=1016%7C6715%7C16871%7C17119%7C13775 |date=2014-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This network of smaller international marriage agencies is often affiliated with web-based international dating sites that are able to market their services on a larger scale, in compliance with regulations such as the [[International Marriage Broker Regulation Act]].&lt;ref&gt;IMBRA law: [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ162.109.pdf Violence Against Women and Department Of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203073115/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ162.109.pdf |date=2010-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experian, a market research firm, reports that the top 10 international dating sites attracted 12 million visitors in March 2013, up 29% from March 2012. One of the biggest international dating sites, based on market share, is [[AnastasiaDate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/09/the-mail-order-bride-boom/?iid=SF_F_River|title=The Mail Order Bride Boom|date=April 9, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225083057/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/09/the-mail-order-bride-boom/?iid=SF_F_River|archivedate=December 25, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; International dating sites provide a wide variety of online communication, including instant messaging, email letters, webchat, phone translation, virtual gifts, live games, and mobile-based chat.&lt;ref&gt;Level of Services (paragraph 13) [http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?bc=1016|6715|16871|17119|13775 International Matchmaking Agencies: A Report to Congress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803040117/http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?bc=1016%7C6715%7C16871%7C17119%7C13775 |date=2014-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ukrainian Mail Order Brides (AskMen): [http://www.askmen.com/entertainment/better_look/10_ukrainian-mail-order-brides-part-1.html Ukrainian Mail Order Brides] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803195837/http://www.askmen.com/entertainment/better_look/10_ukrainian-mail-order-brides-part-1.html |date=2011-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International marriage agencies are frequently referred to as "mail-order bride" agencies. However, many consider the term "mail-order bride" derogatory and feel it demeans foreign women by comparing them to commodities for sale and by falsely implying that (unlike local women), they exercise no judgment over the men they meet and would marry anyone from a relatively wealthy country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Services offered by marriage agencies typically include:
*Introductions
*Translation of correspondence between clients not speaking a common language
*Excursions, in which a man is introduced to several women interested in marriage

Few agencies still offer introductions and excursions, but pioneering marriage agency [[A Foreign Affair (company) | A Foreign Affair]] still conducts these services.

==History==
There are at least two historical roots of the mail-order bride industry that emerged in the 1800s in the [[American frontier]]: [[Coolie#In the Americas|Asian workers]] in the frontier regions (although Asian workers were scattered throughout the world), and American men who had headed west across the United States to work out on the frontier.

[[European Americans|European American men]] found financial success in the migration West, but the one thing that was missing was the company of a wife.  Very few women lived there at this time, so it was hard for these men to settle down and start a family. They attempted to attract women living back East; the men wrote letters to churches and published personal advertisements in magazines and newspapers. In return, the women would write to the men and send them photographs of themselves.  Courtship was conducted by letter, until a woman agreed to marry a man she had never met.&lt;ref&gt;Enns, C. (2005) Hearts west: the true stories of mail-order brides on the frontier. Connecticut: Globe Pequot Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many women wanted to escape their present way of living, gain financial security and see what life on the frontier could offer them.  Most of these women were single, but some were [[widow]]s, divorcées or [[Runaway (dependent)|runaways]].&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, E. (1976). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3346071 Imperfect unions class and gender in cripple creek] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423173450/http://www.jstor.org/stable/3346071 |date=2016-04-23 }}. Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian men also worked through mail-order agencies to find wives as they worked overseas in the 1800s. Key variables determining the relationship between migration and marriage were demographics, legal policies, cultural perceptions and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Migration for labor, migration for love: marriage and family formation across borders|author=S Sinke|publisher=Magazine of History|year=1999|jstor=25163323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imbalances between the number of available women and the number of men desiring partners created a demand for immigrant women. As a result of this imbalance, a new system of "picture brides" developed in predominantly male settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Search for June Cleaver|author=Itta C. Englander|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=itta_englander|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629194605/http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=itta_englander|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the institution of "[[picture bride]]s" developed due to immigration restrictions. The [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Japanese-American Passport Agreement of 1907]] allowed [[Japan]] to grant passports to the wives of immigrants to America.&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;Waldo R. Browne (ed.), "Picture Bride," in ''What's What in the Labor Movement: A Dictionary of Labor Affairs and Labor Terminology.'' New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1921; pg. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; As immigration of unmarried Japanese women to America was effectively barred, the use of "picture brides" provided a mechanism for willing women to obtain a passport to America, while Japanese workers in America could gain a female helpmate of their own nationality.&lt;ref name="Browne" /&gt;

==Mail order brides: motivations and stories==

===Eastern Europe===
Women in [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and other Eastern European countries are common mail-order bride candidates.

Economic and social conditions for women in Russia and other Postsoviet countries are a motivational factor in finding foreign arrangements. 52 percent of Russia’s [[workforce]] is made up of women, yet according to some sources they often hold low positions of prominence in their home country and work jobs with less respect and lower wage (such as teaching or physician positions);&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Mail Order Bride Case Study." Welcome to American University, Washington, DC USA. Web. 10 Oct. 2010.{{full citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women earn 43 percent of what men do.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Donna M.

On the other hand, according to [[Grant Thornton International]] Business Report for 2014, as cited by [[Forbes magazine]], Russia has the highest proportion of women in senior management worldwide at 43%, followed closely by other Postsoviet countries such as Lithuania, Latvia, Georgia and Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2014/03/06/number-of-women-in-senior-management-stagnant-at-24/|title=Number of Women In Senior Management Stagnant At 24%|first=Mary E.|last=Scott|date=|website=forbes.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927202104/https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2014/03/06/number-of-women-in-senior-management-stagnant-at-24/|archivedate=27 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an earlier Grant Thornton International Business Report for 2012, Russia had an even higher proportion of women in senior management at 46%, still highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantthornton.sn/spub-1-women_in_senior_management.pdf|title=Women in senior management:still not enough|author=|date=|website=grantthornton.sn|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818133714/http://grantthornton.sn/spub-1-women_in_senior_management.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finding a foreign husband gives a woman a chance to leave her country and find better economic opportunities. [[Marriage]] is a substantial part of [[Russian culture]], with 30 years being the age at which a woman is considered an "old maid".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Kevin.

Web. 12 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With 4,138,273 more women than men from the ages of 15 to 64, marriage opportunities are slim at home and worsened by the [[life expectancy]] difference between men (64.3 years) and women (73.17 years), as well as the fact that a large portion of successful males are emigrating out of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"Foreign-Born Population – CPS March 2009 Detailed Tables."

===Asia===
Many international brides come from developing countries in [[Asia]]. The countries the women come from are faced with [[unemployment]], [[malnutrition]] and [[inflation]].&lt;ref name="Meng, Eddy 1994"&gt;Meng, Eddy. "Mail-Order Brides: Gilded Prostitution and the Legal Response." ''Journal of Law Reform''; 28 (1994): 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who marry foreign men tend to be better-educated than most women from their country or their husbands. However, economic factors are not the only driving factor for women in Asia to enter the mail-order industry. Filipina women often entered the mail-order industry in the hope of marrying abroad, and then sponsoring their family for [[immigration]].&lt;ref name="Meng, Eddy 1994"/&gt; In some cases women were recruited based on their physical appearance, with an emphasis placed on [[youth]] and [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="Meng, Eddy 1994"/&gt; This is found among boutique agencies, most of which cater to wealthy men from other Asian nations. The majority of Asian mail-order brides come from the Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1123&amp;context=ijgls/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314175439/http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1123&amp;context=ijgls%2F |date=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country-specific information==

===Australia===
Since 2003, the [[Government of Australia]]'s resolve to decrease what was deemed "inappropriate immigration" by then-[[Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] has gained momentum.  Initial reactions to the program were mixed. However, during the January 2004 visit to [[Eastern Europe]] by the [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection]], [[Philip Ruddock]], Australian-Russian relationships were strengthened while both nations committed to a timetable for reductions in Russian [[human trafficking]] into Australia. The Australian public further embraced its government's new policies following the [[media circus]] of the Jana Klintoukh case. This case first exploded into the public's view when current-events program ''[[Today Tonight]]'' aired footage of a young Russian-born Australian, claiming she was imported via an Internet site and was kept as a [[Sexual slavery|sexual slave]] by her "husband" while being confined to his [[Sydney]] home.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Belarus===
In 2005, President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] attempted to regulate "marriage agencies" in [[Belarus]] and make it difficult for them to operate. He believed that Western men were draining his country of women of child-bearing age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.data.minsk.by/belarusnews/082005/100.html "Belarus News and Analysis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060725073358/http://www.data.minsk.by/belarusnews/082005/100.html |date=2006-07-25 }}, Anna Volk (the reference cited does not actually say this, plus the fact there are more Southeast Asian women going with Western men, than in Eastern Europe altogether)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as most agencies are being run from outside Belarus (either in Russia, European countries or the United States), he has been unable to stop (or otherwise regulate) this activity.

===Canada===
Canadian [[immigration law]]s have traditionally been similar to (but slightly less restrictive than) their U.S. counterparts; for instance, previously not requiring the Canadian citizen to prove minimum-income requirements (as has been a long-standing requirement of United States immigration laws).  While there is still no formal requirement for a minimum salary, the sponsor must provide evidence of income (such as the T4 income tax slip from an employer) with their IMM 5481 Sponsorship Evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5481e.pdf|title="IMM 5481E: Sponsorship Evaluation"|author=|date=|website=cic.gc.ca|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031104755/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/IMM5481E.pdf|archivedate=31 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2001 Canada's immigration policy designated mail-order brides under the "family class" to refer to spouses and dependents and "fiancé(e)" class for those intending to marry, with only limited recognition of externally married opposite-sex "common law" relationships; same-sex partners were processed as independent immigrants or under a discretionary provision for "humane and compassionate" considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.utoronto.ca/documents/globalization/Laviolette-PaperOct26.pdf|title="LaViolette – Immigration of Same-Sex Couples"|author=|date=|website=utoronto.ca|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930175011/http://www.law.utoronto.ca/documents/globalization/Laviolette-PaperOct26.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Canadian Immigration Law was completely revised. One of the major changes was conjugal partner sponsorship, available for any two people (including [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex couple]]s) who have had conjugal relations together for at least one year. Canadian immigration authorities frown upon conjugal-partners sponsorship for heterosexual couples, and now require the couple to marry before a visa is granted{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} (unless serious reason can be demonstrated why the couple is not yet married).

There have been reported instances in which foreign spouses have abandoned their Canadian sponsors upon arrival in Canada or soon thereafter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/10/29/pol-marriage-fraud.html |title=CBSA urged to act on marriage fraud complaints |publisher=CBC News |date=2011-10-29 |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402055311/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/10/29/pol-marriage-fraud.html |archivedate=2013-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; often collecting [[welfare]], which the sponsor is obligated to repay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/10/19/bc-marriagebill.html |title=Russian bride leaves elderly man with $25K welfare bill |publisher=CBC British Columbia |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094107/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/10/19/bc-marriagebill.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some of the cases, federal immigration authorities have made no attempt to revoke fraudulently-obtained landed immigrant status or deport the claimants, treating cases where one spouse is duped by the other as low-priority and difficult to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2010/06/14/bc-marriagefraud.html |title=B.C. woman wants 'fake' husband deported |publisher=CBC British Columbia |date=2010-06-14 |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401232647/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2010/06/14/bc-marriagefraud.html |archivedate=2013-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-year conditional residence requirement (like that in force in Australia and the United States) was proposed in 2011 and is now applied to new arrivals.

===China===

China is one of the main Heritage countries of East Asian Mail-order brides. [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese women]] are traveling to [[China]] as mail order brides for rural [[Han Chinese]] men to earn money for their families and a rise in the standard of living, matchmaking between Chinese men and Vietnamese women has increased and has not been affected by troubled relations between Vietnam and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/society/vietnamese-brides-happy-enough-with-chinese-husbands-30068.html|title=Vietnamese brides happy enough with Chinese husbands|date=19 August 2014|work=thanhniennews.com|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510210426/http://www.thanhniennews.com/society/vietnamese-brides-happy-enough-with-chinese-husbands-30068.html|archivedate=10 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/feature/news-feature/Leftover-men-buy-brides-from-Vietnam/shdaily.shtml|title=‘Leftover’ men buy brides from Vietnam|work=shanghaidaily.com|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510072715/http://www.shanghaidaily.com/feature/news-feature/Leftover-men-buy-brides-from-Vietnam/shdaily.shtml|archivedate=10 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/rural-chinese-men-are-buying-vietnamese-brides-for-3200-2014-8|title=Rural Chinese Men Are Buying Vietnamese Brides For $3,200|work=businessinsider.com|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213010153/http://www.businessinsider.com/rural-chinese-men-are-buying-vietnamese-brides-for-3200-2014-8|archivedate=13 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1576383/joy-and-pain-vietnamese-brides-cash|title=Joy and pain of the Vietnamese 'brides for cash'|work=scmp.com|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510131806/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1576383/joy-and-pain-vietnamese-brides-cash|archivedate=10 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/east-wed-china-seeks-brides-richer-poorer-040218390.html|title=The East is wed: China seeks brides for richer, for poorer|work=yahoo.com|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303095842/http://news.yahoo.com/east-wed-china-seeks-brides-richer-poorer-040218390.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/people/2014/08/22/seeking-vietnamese-brides/|title=Personals: Chinese men seek Vietnamese brides, will pay RM10,000, must relocate - People - The Star Online|first=Tom|last=Hancock|work=thestar.com.my|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510135529/http://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/people/2014/08/22/seeking-vietnamese-brides/|archivedate=10 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenh14.vn/the-gioi/cuoc-song-cua-co-dau-viet-tai-thi-tran-ngheo-o-trung-quoc-20140818075811320.chn|title=Cuộc sống của cô dâu Việt tại thị trấn nghèo ở Trung Quốc|first=|last=VCCorp.vn|work=kenh14.vn|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619051818/http://kenh14.vn/the-gioi/cuoc-song-cua-co-dau-viet-tai-thi-tran-ngheo-o-trung-quoc-20140818075811320.chn|archivedate=19 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinasmack.com/2010/stories/chinese-man-spends-35k-for-obedient-vietnamese-wife.html|title=Chinese Man Spends 35K For ‘Obedient’ Vietnamese Wife|date=31 January 2010|work=chinasmack.com|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926151310/http://www.chinasmack.com/2010/stories/chinese-man-spends-35k-for-obedient-vietnamese-wife.html|archivedate=26 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
According to immigration statistics from the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], Colombia has ranked in the top 10 of countries since 1999 from which fiancées have emigrated for the United States. As well, the number of Colombians being admitted to the United States between 1999 and 2008 using fiancé visas (including children) has increased 321 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031224007/https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics |date=October 31, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the large number of Colombians wishing to leave their country by marrying foreigners, a [[black market]] for marriages to foreigners has developed, with some people allegedly paying as much as 20 million pesos ($10,000) to illegal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/7021-colombians-marry-foreigners-seeking-other-nationalities.html |title=Colombians seeking new nationalities marry foreigners – Colombia news |publisher=Colombia Reports |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130330143334/http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/7021-colombians-marry-foreigners-seeking-other-nationalities.html |archivedate=2013-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Colombia Decrees No. 2668/88 and 1556/89, passed in 1988, foreigners are allowed to marry nationals in the country provided they supply the proper paperwork, including a birth certificate and proof that both parties are not already married. A notary is required, but because the laws are open to interpretation, the requirements can vary from notary to notary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bogota.usembassy.gov/marriage.html |title=Marriage in Colombia |publisher=Embassy of the United States – Bogota |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327103103/http://bogota.usembassy.gov/marriage.html |archivedate=2013-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{main|Asian migrant brides in Japan}}
During the 1980s and 1990s, local authorities started government-led initiatives encouraging marriage between women from other Asian countries and Japanese farmers due to the lack of Japanese women who wanted to live in the countryside.&lt;ref name="Japansource"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=JImIBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Transformation of the Intimate and the Public in Asian Modernity |publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Asian brides came from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and South Korea.&lt;ref name="Japansource"/&gt; The phenomenon of marrying women from other Asian countries later spread to urban parts of Japan as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/12/world/yodo-journal-where-want-ads-are-bait-and-weddings-forced.html|title=Yodo Journal; Where Want Ads Are Bait and Weddings Forced|date=April 14, 1991|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
The Philippines prohibits the business of organizing or facilitating marriages between Filipinas and foreign men. The Philippine congress enacted the [[Anti Mail-Order Bride Law]] on June 13, 1990, as a result of stories in the local media about Filipinas being abused by their foreign husbands.  Because of this, Filipinas often used "reverse publications" – publications in which ''men'' advertise themselves – to contact foreign men for marriage to Filipina women.

Successful prosecution under this statute is rare or non-existent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzhEUE35pRcC&amp;pg=PA103 |title=Trafficking And the Global Sex Industry |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as widespread deployment of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s brought a proliferation of websites operating outside the Philippines which legally remain beyond the reach of Filipino law.

Based on data from the Korean government, there are 6,191 Filipinas in South Korea who are married to Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/10/211_53320.html koreatimes.co.kr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201072334/http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/10/211_53320.html/ |date=2017-02-01 }} This is only the women from the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; After contacting a mail-order agency, the majority of Filipina mail-order brides met their husbands by attending "show-ups", a meeting in which a group of Filipina women are brought to meet a Korean man who is looking for a wife. At the show-up the Korean man picks a prospective wife from among the group, and in a matter of days they are married.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/10/211_53320.html|title=Filipina Mail-Order Brides Vulnerable to Abuse|date=11 October 2009|work=koreatimes.co.kr|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201072334/http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/10/211_53320.html/|archivedate=1 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An anthropological study on Filipina wives and Korean men by professor Kim Min-jung of the Department of Cultural Anthropology at Kangwon National University found that these Korean men find it difficult to marry Korean women, so they look for girls in poorer countries with difficult economic circumstances.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt; The Korean men feel that because of the difficult circumstances from which the Filipina women come, cultural differences and the language barrier, they "will not run away". Further, she said, Korean men characterize Southeast Asian women as friendly, hardworking (due to agrarian backgrounds), "docile and obedient, able to speak English, and are familiar with Korean patriarchal culture".&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt;

A recent study by matchmaking firm Bien-Aller polled 274 single South Korean men through its website concerning motivations for marrying non-Korean women and found that men choose foreign brides primarily for one of four reasons. "According to the poll, 32.1 percent of the men said they felt the biggest benefit of marrying foreign women is their lack of interest in their groom's educational background and financial or social status. The next best reason was their belief that foreign brides would be submissive (23 percent), make their lives more comfortable (15.3 percent), and that the men would not have to get stressed about their in-laws (13.8 percent)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/10/18/2012101800458.html |title=Why Korean Men Marry Foreign Women |publisher=The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition) |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315032100/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/10/18/2012101800458.html |archivedate=2013-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence against foreign brides in South Korea====
In June 2013, The Philippine embassy in Seoul reported that it had received many complaints from Filipinas who have married Korean men through mail-order, frequently becoming "victims of grave abuses".&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/06/27/13/philippines-rescues-29-mail-order-brides-south-korea|title=Philippines rescues 29 mail-order brides to South Korea|first=Agence|last=France-Presse|work=abs-cbnnews.com|accessdate=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701030759/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/06/27/13/philippines-rescues-29-mail-order-brides-south-korea|archivedate=1 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine police rescued 29 mail-order brides on their way to marry South Korea men whom Chief Superintendent Reginald Villasanta, head of an organised crime task force, says were "duped into promises of an instant wealthy life through marriage with Korean gentlemen". The women were advertised in online and offline "catalogs" to South Korean men. In many cases however, victims were fed false information about the background of their future spouse and family, and suffered abuse from the South Korean men, which led to "abandonment of the marital home, separation and divorce", Villasanta said.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"/&gt;

There have been several murders of mail-order brides in South Korea. On May 24, 2011, one South Korean man "stabbed his Vietnamese wife to death while the couple’s 19-day-old baby lay next to her. The man, a farmer, had been matched up with his foreign bride through a broker. In 2010, another Vietnamese woman was killed by her husband a week after they were married. In 2008, a Vietnamese woman jumped from an apartment building to her death after being abused by her husband and mother-in-law."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/south-korea/110601/vietnam-integration-foreign-brides?page=0,0|title=For better or worse: foreign brides in South Korea|work=GlobalPost|accessdate=8 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017094131/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/south-korea/110601/vietnam-integration-foreign-brides?page=0,0|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Philippine Ambassador to South Korea Luis T. Cruz warned Filipina women against marrying Korean men. He said in recent months that the Philippine Embassy in Seoul has received complaints from Filipina wives of abuses committed by their Korean husbands that caused separation, divorce and abandonment.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/pinoy-migration/11/22/09/korea-–-pinoy-mixed-marriages-and-tensions-multicultural-family abs-cbnnews.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402162906/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/pinoy-migration/11/22/09/korea-%E2%80%93-pinoy-mixed-marriages-and-tensions-multicultural-family |date=2013-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As language and cultural differences become an issue, the Filipina women are regarded as commodities bought for a price.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt;

===Turkmenistan===
On June 4, 2001, Turkmenian President [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] (also known as Turkmenbashi) authorized a decree that required foreigners to pay a $50,000 fee to marry a Turkmen citizen (regardless of how they met), and to live in the country and own property for one year. Authorities indicated that the law was designed to protect women from being duped into abusive relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav061901.shtml|title=Turkmenistan's Marriage Decree Helps Deepen the Isolation of Citizens|work=EurasiaNet.org|accessdate=8 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017094131/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav061901.shtml|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2005, Niyazov scrapped the $50,000 and the property-owning requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/06/c2984fe7-fbca-4bc1-98d3-d5d4b42bfded.html|title=Turkmenistan: Marriage Gets Cheaper As Turkmenbashi Drops $50,000 Dollar Foreigners' Fee|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=8 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706085749/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/06/c2984fe7-fbca-4bc1-98d3-d5d4b42bfded.html|archivedate=6 July 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

U.S. immigration law provides protection for brides once they arrive. “In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act... Section 652 of this legislation specifically addresses the mail-order bride industry”.&lt;ref name="Order Bride Case Study 2010"&gt;"Russian Mail Order Bride Case Study." Welcome to American University, Washington, DC USA. Web. 10 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[International Marriage Broker Regulation Act]] (IMBRA) as part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3402 "Violence against women"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204043909/http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3402 |date=2012-02-04 }}, 109th U.S. Congress (2005–2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements of the law are controversial, and some commentators have claimed that it presumes that American men are abusers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2006/0111.html "Mail Order Bride Law Brands U.S. Men Abusers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519043038/http://www.ifeminists.net/introduction/editorials/2006/0111.html |date=2006-05-19 }}, Wendy McElroy January 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In enacting IMBRA, Congress was responding to claims by the [[Tahirih Justice Center]] (TJC), a woman's advocacy group, that mail-order brides were susceptible to domestic abuse because they are unfamiliar with the laws, language and customs of their new home. The TJC insisted that special legislation was needed to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/05/politics/main561828.shtml "Mail Order Bride in Works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615130356/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/05/politics/main561828.shtml |date=2006-06-15 }}, CBS News July 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The TJC asked Congress to consider several notable cases mentioned in the [[Congressional Record]]. Critics of IMBRA claim that the TJC failed to ask Congress to consider the relative amount of abuse between mail-order bride couples and other couples (including the thousands of spousal murders that occurred in the US over the past 15 years).

Two federal lawsuits (''European Connections &amp; Tours v. Gonzales'', N.D. Ga. 2006; ''AODA v. Gonzales'', S.D. Ohio 2006) sought to challenge IMBRA on constitutional grounds.  The AODA case was terminated when the plaintiffs withdrew their claim.  The European Connections case ended when the judge ruled against the plaintiff, finding the law constitutional regarding a dating company.

On March 26, 2007, U.S. District Judge [[Clarence Cooper (judge)|Clarence Cooper]] dismissed with [[prejudice (legal term)|prejudice]] a suit for injunctive relief filed by European Connections, agreeing with Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] and TJC that IMBRA is a constitutional exercise of Congressional authority to regulate for-profit dating websites and agencies where the primary focus is on introducing Americans to foreigners.  Additionally, the federal court specifically found that: "the rates of domestic violence against immigrant women are much higher than those of the U.S. population". The judge also compared background checks on American men to background checks on [[firearm]] buyers by stating, "However, just as the requirement to provide background information as a prerequisite to purchasing a firearm has not put gun manufacturers out of business, there is no reason to believe that IMBs will be driven from the marketplace by IMBRA".

====Legal matters for mail-order brides in the United States====
Marriage agencies are legal in almost all countries. On January 6, 2006, the United States Congress enacted IMBRA.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3402|title=Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (2006; 109th Congress H.R. 3402) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=8 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204043909/http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3402|archivedate=4 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires certain actions of some businesses prior to selling a foreign woman's address to a US citizen or resident or otherwise facilitating contact, including the following:
*The man must complete a questionnaire on his criminal and marital background
*The seller must obtain the man's record from the [[United States National Sex Offenders Public Registry]] database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsopr.gov/|title=United States Department of Justice National Sex Offender Public Website|author=NSOPW|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505234611/http://www.nsopr.gov/|archivedate=5 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The questionnaire and record must be translated into the woman's native language and provided to her
*The woman must certify that she agrees to permit communication
*A lifetime limit of two [[K-1 visa]]s is imposed, with a waiver required for the approval of any subsequent fiancée visa

====Visa regulations in the United States====
In order to bring a spouse into the United States, Form I-130 must be filed, which is an immigrant petition on behalf of a relative. After that, a K-3/K-4 &amp; V-1/V-2 Entry Visa for Spouse must be filed.&lt;ref&gt;"Apply for Green Card Through Marriage." Apply for US Immigration Services: USCIS, Green Card, US Citizenship, US Visas, Forms. Immigration Direct, 2007–2010. Web. 12 Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Immigration and Nationalization Service advises that “in some cases, it may be to a couple's advantage to pursue a [[K visa|K-1 fiancee visa]] before getting married. In other cases, applicants may find that it is more cost effective to get married abroad and then apply for an immigrant visa overseas. In many cases, the K-1 visa application process takes just as long as the immigrant visa process”. Couples must remain together at least two years. There were 849,000 female naturalized citizens between the ages of 20 and 29 and 2,084,000 women of the same age living without U.S. citizenship in 2016, accounting for 13.3% of the female population of that age bracket.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/topics/population/foreign-born/data/tables.2016.html&lt;/ref&gt; “Despite well over 2,000 mail-order marriages a year, there is no information on the amount of mail-order brides entering the United States. The purpose of this law is two-fold: to protect the safety of mail-order brides and to prevent fraud”.&lt;ref name="Order Bride Case Study 2010"/&gt;

In [[visual arts]], [[Minimal music|music]], and other mediums, '''minimalism''' is an [[art movement]] that began in post–[[World War II]] Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with minimalism include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10459 |title=Christopher Want, ''Minimalism'', Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minimalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm|title=Minimalism|publisher=theartstory.org|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of [[modernism]] and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|postminimal]] art practices.

[[Minimalist music|Minimalism in music]] often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Julius Eastman]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. The term ''minimalist'' often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has accordingly been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]]. &lt;!--The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe a 1915 composition by the Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 13 November 2013 |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as "minimal art", "literalist art"&lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. "Art and Objecthood", ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "ABC Art"&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. "ABC Art", ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October–November 1965): 57–69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan, as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture'' shown from April 27 – June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 |title=''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art |title=Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the art movement called ''minimal art'' emerged.

In a more broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of Kazimir Malevich, [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ |title=Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'' |publisher=Artcritical.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein had painted [[Monochrome painting|monochromes]] as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950—but his first public showing was the publication of the [[Artist's book]] ''[[Yves: Peintures]]'' in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Weitemeier, ''Yves Klein, 1928–1962: International Klein Blue'', Original-Ausgabe (Cologne: Taschen, 1994), 15. {{ISBN|3-8228-8950-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Paint Uncovered|chapter=Restoring the Immaterial: Study and Treatment of Yves Klein's ''Blue Monochrome (IKB42)''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false |title=Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161–172 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 [[Artforum]] essay ''Last Exit: Painting,'' minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's&lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |title=Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960 |publisher=Sharecom.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson, minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this interpretation of what he said, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1–3", originally published across three issues of ''Artforum'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] – "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''Artforum'', 1969, continuing on to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.

One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early "black paintings" were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber he used for stretchers to support the canvas, visible against the canvas as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side. Stella's decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, but other artists—including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Robert Ryman]]—had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticized by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of Artforum. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing—namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''&lt;ref&gt;in Barbara Rose, ed. ''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an interview with Dorothy Strickler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Oral history interview with Lee Krasner, 1964 Nov. 2-1968 Apr. 11 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I brought Hofmann up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann’s reaction was—one of the questions he asked Jackson was, "Do you work from nature?" There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson’s answer was, "I am nature." And Hofmann’s reply was, "Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself." To which Jackson did not reply at all. The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in [[design]] and [[architecture]], wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Minimalist architectural designers focus on the connection between two perfect planes, elegant lighting, and the void spaces left by the removal of three-dimensional shapes in an architectural design.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 

Minimalistic design has been highly influenced by [[Japanese architecture|Japanese traditional design and architecture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The works of [[De Stijl]] artists are a major reference: De Stijl expanded the ideas of expression by meticulously organizing basic elements such as lines and planes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With regard to home design, more attractive "minimalistic" designs are not truly minimalistic because they are larger, and use more expensive building materials and finishes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There are observers who describe the emergence of minimalism as a response to the brashness and chaos of urban life. In Japan, for example, minimalist architecture began to gain traction in the 1980s when its cities experienced rapid expansion and booming population. The design was considered an antidote to the "overpowering presence of traffic, advertising, jumbled building scales, and imposing roadways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fractal Dimension of Architecture|last=Ostwald|first=Michael|last2=Vaughan|first2=Josephine|publisher=Birkhauser|year=2016|isbn=9783319324241|location=Newcastle|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaotic environment was not only driven by urbanization, industrialization, and technology but also the Japanese experience of constantly having to demolish structures on account of the destruction wrought by World War II and the earthquakes, including the calamities it entails such as fire. The minimalist design philosophy did not arrive in Japan by way of another country as it was already part of the Japanese culture rooted on the Zen philosophy. There are those who specifically attribute the design movement to Japan's spirituality and view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of Minimalism|last=Cerver|first=Francisco|publisher=Arco|year=1997|isbn=9780823061495|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (1886–1969) adopted the motto "Less is more" to describe his aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philip Johnson]], op. cit.  A similar sentiment was conveyed by industrial designer Dieter Rams' motto, "Less but better."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tactic was one of arranging the necessary components of a building to create an impression of extreme simplicity—he enlisted every element and detail to serve multiple visual and functional purposes; for example, designing a floor to also serve as the radiator, or a massive fireplace to also house the bathroom. Designer [[Buckminster Fuller]] (1895–1983) adopted the engineer's goal of "Doing more with less", but his concerns were oriented toward technology and engineering rather than aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Johnson]], ''Mies van der Rohe'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1947, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Barragán]] is an exemplary modern minimalist designer.{{According to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other contemporary minimalist architects include [[Kazuyo Sejima]], [[John Pawson]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[Álvaro Siza Vieira]], [[Tadao Ando]], [[Alberto Campo Baeza]], [[Yoshio Taniguchi]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Hugh Newell Jacobsen]], Vincent Van Duysen, [[Claudio Silvestrin]], [[Michael Gabellini]], and [[Gluckman Mayner Architects|Richard Gluckman]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006).

==Minimalist architecture and space==
Minimalist architecture became popular in the late 1980s in London and New York,&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; where architects and fashion designers worked together in the boutiques to achieve simplicity, using white elements, cold lighting, large space with minimum objects and furniture.

===Concepts and design elements===
The concept of minimalist architecture is to strip everything down to its essential quality and achieve simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is not completely without ornamentation,&lt;ref name="Rossell"&gt;Rossell (2005), Minimalist Interiors, New York: HapperCollins. p6.&lt;/ref&gt; but that all parts, details, and joinery are considered as reduced to a stage where no one can remove anything further to improve the design.&lt;ref name="Pawson"&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The considerations for ‘essences’ are light, form, detail of material, space, place, and human condition.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalist architects not only consider the physical qualities of the building. They consider the spiritual dimension and the invisible, by listening to the figure and paying attention to  details, people, space, nature, and materials.,&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; believing this reveals the abstract quality of something that is invisible and aids the search for the essence of those invisible qualities—such as natural light, sky, earth, and air. In addition, they "open a dialogue" with the surrounding environment to decide the most essential materials for the construction and create relationships between buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Rossell"/&gt;

In minimalist architecture, design elements strive to convey the message of simplicity. The basic geometric forms, elements without decoration, simple materials and the repetitions of structures represent a sense of order and essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p8.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of natural light in buildings reveals simple and clean spaces.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"/&gt; In the late 19th century as the arts and crafts movement became popular in Britain, people valued the attitude of ‘truth to materials’ with respect to the profound and innate characteristics of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. P.87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimalist architects humbly 'listen to figure,' seeking essence and simplicity by rediscovering the valuable qualities in simple and common materials.&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"/&gt;

===Influences from Japanese tradition===
{{see also|Japanese architecture}}

[[Image:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|right|Ryōan-ji dry garden.The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock garden "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "[[wabi-sabi]]".&lt;ref&gt;森神逍遥 『侘び然び幽玄のこころ』桜の花出版、2015年 Morigami Shouyo, "Wabi sabi yugen no kokoro: seiyo tetsugaku o koeru joi ishiki" (Japanese) {{ISBN|978-4434201424}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]&lt;!-- The size of this image is specified because its default size is a bit too small considering the importance of the garden -- and the details can be more fully appreciated in an enlarged scale. --&gt;

The idea of simplicity appears in many cultures, especially the Japanese traditional culture of Zen Philosophy. Japanese manipulate the Zen culture into aesthetic and design elements for their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p.85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of architecture has influenced Western Society, especially in America since the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster (September 1953), Japanese Buildings in the United States before 1900: Their Influence upon American Domestic Architecture, The Art Bulletin, vol. 35, no. 3. p217–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it inspired the minimalist architecture in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt;

Zen concepts of simplicity transmit the ideas of freedom and essence of living.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt; Simplicity is not only aesthetic value, it has a moral perception that looks into the nature of truth and reveals the inner qualities and essence of materials and objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p87.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[sand garden]] in [[Ryoanji]] temple demonstrates the concepts of simplicity and the essentiality from the considered setting of a few stones and a huge empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic principle of [[Ma (negative space)|Ma]] refers to empty or open space. It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.&lt;/ref&gt; It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself. People cut off the branches, leaves and blossoms from the plants and only retain the essential part of the plant. This conveys the idea of essential quality and innate character in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1.p86.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, far from being just a spatial concept, Ma is ever-present in all aspects of Japanese daily life, as it applies to time as well as to daily tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html |title=When Less is More: the Concept of Japanese "MA" |publisher=Wawaza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist architects and their works===
The Japanese minimalist architect, [[Tadao Ando]] conveys the Japanese traditional spirit and his own perception of nature in his works. His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Ando’s works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism. Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees (2003) Tokyo.

In Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light, and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995–96, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein’s ideas of fashion. John Pawson’s interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary minimalism==
Literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in creating the story, to "choose sides" based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than react to directions from the writer.

Some 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel inline|date=November 2011}}

Another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Minimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K. J. Stevens]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Mary Robison]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Alicia Erian]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

American poets such as [[Stephen Crane]], [[William Carlos Williams]], early [[Ezra Pound]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]], and [[Aram Saroyan]] are sometimes identified with their ''minimalist'' style. The term "minimalism" is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=Samuel Beckett|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5161|website=Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]]. Intending to represent the psychological state (agitation) of the novel's main character, the section's successive lines of text are built on repetitive and developing phrases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Minimal music==
{{main article|Minimal music}}

The term "minimal music" was derived around 1970 by [[Michael Nyman]] from the concept of minimalism, which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=Bernard93&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Jonathan W.|title=The Minimalist Aesthetic in the Plastic Arts and in Music|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1993|volume=31|issue= 1 (Winter)|page=87|jstor=833043}}, citing Dan Warburton as his authority.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warburton88&gt;{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Dan|title=A Working Terminology for Minimal Music|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/archives/minimalism.html|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, it was in a 1968 review in ''The Spectator'' that Nyman first used the term, to describe a ten-minute piano composition by the Danish composer [[Henning Christiansen]], along with several other unnamed pieces played by [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Nam June Paik]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nyman 1968, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mixe''' (Spanish ''{{lang|es|mixe}}'' or rarely ''{{lang|es|mije}}'' {{IPA-es|ˈmixe|}}) are an [[indigenous people of Mexico]] inhabiting the eastern highlands of the state of [[Oaxaca]]. They speak the [[Mixe languages]], which are classified in the [[Mixe–Zoque]] [[language family|family]], and are more culturally conservative than other indigenous groups of the region, maintaining their language to this day. A population figure of 90,000 speakers of Mixe were estimated by [[SIL international]] in 1993. The Mixe name for themselves is ''ayuujkjä'äy'' meaning "people who speak the mountain language"&lt;ref&gt;According to the Monography about the Mixes at the official website of the [[Instituto Nacional Indigenista]] {{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/ini/monografias/mixes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234013/http://www.cdi.gob.mx/ini/monografias/mixes.html |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Mixe" itself is probably derived from the [[Nahuatl]] word for cloud: ''mīxtli''.

==Geography==
The region where the Mixe live is known as the [[Sierra Mixe]] and is located north east of the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], bordering on the [[Valley of Oaxaca]] to the southwest, the lowlands of [[Tehuantepec]] to the east, and the highlands of Choapam and the state of [[Veracruz]] to the north. The rugged and remote area is part the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. The western Mixe live in a mountainous temperate highland zone with the largest Mixe centers in San Pedro and Pablo Ayutla (in Mixe called ''Tu'ukyom''&lt;ref&gt;The names of in the Mixe languages are taken from Lipp,1991&lt;/ref&gt;), Tlahuitoltepec (''Xemgɨxp'') and [[Totontepec Villa de Morelos|Totontepec]] (''Añkɨwam'').

Here at elevations above 2400 meters [[maize]], [[beans]], [[potato]]es, and [[Squash (plant)|squash]] is produced. The midland Mixe are centered on Zacatepec (''Mɨɨygɨxy'') and Juquila (''Kɨngɨ'ɨm''), in this region [[coffee]] and [[chili pepper]]s are produced. The eastern Mixe live near the city Matías Romero in the tropical lowlands of the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], here, at elevations from 35 to 1000 meters tropical crops such as [[banana]]s and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s and [[sugar cane]] is produced.

The Mixe region borders on regions inhabited by [[Zapotec people|Zapotec]]s and [[Chinantec]]s, with whom the Mixe have some contact. The Mixe region is watered by three large rivers the [[Papaloapan River|Papaloapan]], the [[Coatzacoalcos River|Coatzacoalcos]] and the [[Tehuantepec River|Tehuantepec]]. Three peaks in the Sierra Mixe reach heights above 3300 meters: at Cempoaltepetl (in Mixe ''Ipxyukp'' "the Mountain of twenty heads"), Cerro Blanco and Cerro Malinche.

==History==
Linguistic evidence suggests connection with the [[Olmec]]s,&lt;ref&gt;First proposed in {{cite journal |author =Campbell, Lyle |authorlink=Lyle Campbell |author2=[[Terrence Kaufman]] |year=1976 |title=A Linguistic Look at the Olmec |journal=American Antiquity |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=80–89 |doi=10.2307/279044 |jstor =279044 |publisher =Society for American Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there has been some theories that don't associate the Mixe with the Olmec, but with the native cultures of the [[South America]]n [[Andes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iberopuebla.mx/ayuuk/historia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601234549/http://www.iberopuebla.mx/ayuuk/historia.htm |archivedate=2017-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the Mixe migration myth they came to settle at the holy mountain Cempoaltepetl&amp;mdash;where led by the legendary king Condoy (also known as Ëy Konk, or Ko’ong Oy&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/270/27035207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) they built a successful kingdom. Almost nothing is known about the Mixes in prehispanic times as there are very few archeological remains in the Mixe area and written sources are equally scarce. It is known that neither the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] kingdom of [[Zaachila]] nor the [[Aztec]] empire succeeded in subduing the Mixes completely.

After the Spanish conquest of central Mexico and the valley of Oaxaca a Spanish force under the command of Diego Sandoval was sent north to the Sierra Mixe to subdue the Mixes and [[Chinantec]]s of that region. The expedition failed and the Mixes remained unconquered. [[Hernán Cortés]] even mentions in his letters to the King of Spain that the provinces of the Zapotecs and the Mixes were the only ones to remain unconquered.
 
:::"''In the whole territory, from one sea to the other, the natives serve without complaint, save for two provinces which lie between those of [[Tehuantepec|Teguantepeque]], [[Chinantla|Chinanta]], [[Oaxaca|Guaxaca]] and [[Coatzacoalcos|Guazacualco]], in the middle of all four; the people of these two provinces are called Zapotecas and Mixes. Their land is so rocky that it cannot be crossed even on foot, for I have twice sent people to conquer them, who were unable to do so because of the roughness of the terrain, and because the warriors are very fierce and well armed''" Hernán Cortés, Fourth Letter to King Charles V&lt;ref&gt;Page 318 ''Letters from Mexico'' translated by [[Anthony Pagden]] (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986.) {{ISBN|0-300-09094-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1555 the first peaceful contact between Spaniards and Mixes were undertaken when the [[Dominican order]] began the spiritual conquest of the Mixes. They built churches and missions in Juquila, Totontepec and Quetzaltepec. The Mixes still pride themselves of never having been conquered.

==Culture==
The Mixe largely live from subsistence agriculture of maize, beans, squash and potatoes, complementing with hunting of small game and fishing on the smaller rivers and streams. However, in the past century the midland Mixe have begun to commercialize coffee, usually as small producers who sell their roasted beans to buyers from outside the Mixe area. The Mixe are well known in Oaxaca for their large [[banda music|brass band]]s – every Mixe town has a band that performs in their local festivals. In some towns traditional weaving is practiced on [[Loom#Backstrap looms|backstrap looms]] whereas other towns mainly produce [[pottery|ceramics]].

===Language===
{{main|Mixe languages}}
The Mixe language is a language of the Mixean branch of the [[Mixe–Zoquean languages|Mixe–Zoque]] language family. Its closest relatives are [[Sayula Popoluca]] and [[Oluta Popoluca]] spoken in [[Veracruz]]. The language is [[polysynthetic languages|polysynthetic]], [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] and employs a [[direct–inverse language|direct–inverse]] system for participant reference. It can be subdivided into three dialect areas: Highland Mixe (northern Highland spoken around Totontepec and Southern Highland spoken around Tlahuitoltepec, Ayutla and Tamazulapan), Midland Mixe (spoken around Juquila and Zacatepec) and Lowland Mixe (spoken around Guichicovi).&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, Søren, 1995, The Relationship Among the Mixe–Zoquean Languages of Mexico. University of Utah Press. Salt Lake City. {{ISBN|0-87480-487-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mixe languages are poorly documented and many variants are not documented at all. Best documented are the dialects of Totontepec,&lt;ref&gt;Schoenhals, Alvin &amp; Louise Schoenhals, 1965, Vocabulario Mixe de Totontepec, Serie de Vocabularios Indigénas "Mariano Silva y Aceves" Num. 14. SIL, Mexico, D.F.&lt;/ref&gt; Ayutla and Coatlán&lt;ref&gt;Hoogshagen, Searle &amp; Hilda Halloran Hoogshagen, 1993, Diccionario Mixe de Coatlán, Serie de Vocabularios Indigénas "Mariano Silva y Aceves" Num. 32. SIL, Mexico, D.F.&lt;/ref&gt; for which dictionaries and small grammars have been published by [[SIL international]].

===Social structure===
Apart from the nuclear family an important part of Mixe social structure is the [[cargo system]] which is an integrated part of Mixe society. In the cargo system a number of civic and religious offices called "cargos" rotate among the men of each village. Cargoholders assume responsibilities of public interest such as arranging and paying for certain religious celebrations, caring for religious images, or upholding. A cargo is unpaid and held for a year; some cargoes include rather large financial obligations to the cargoholder. Persons who have held many cargoes are respected and the few persons who have held all possible cargoes in the community are part of a council of elders. With the conversion of many Mixes to different [[Protestant]] branches the functionality of the cargo system has been challenged in many towns resulting in social tension.&lt;ref&gt;p.25 Frank J Lipp, 1991, The Mixe of Oaxaca: Religion, ritual and healing, University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Mixe religion is largely a [[syncretism|syncretic]] blend of [[Roman Catholicism]] together with traditions informed by their indigenous [[Mesoamerican religion|Mesoamerican religious beliefs]]. For most Mixe there is no contradiction between the tenets of Catholicism and their adherence to native [[belief system]]s and ritual practices.

In addition to and in modification of the Catholic system, the Mixe maintain a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of gods representing certain aspects. These include: 
*''Poj 'Enee'' ("Thunder wind"), a fertility and rain god who is also the protector of Mixe towns
*''Naaxwiiñ'' ("Earth Surface"), an earth and fertility goddess
*''Yuuk'', the "owner of the animals" and the deity of wild animals and the hunt
*''Hɨgɨñ'', a goddess of rivers and springs, venerated by fishermen
*''Mɨjku'', a god of wealth, luck, hurricanes, death and the underworld, who is often equated with the Catholic [[devil]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank J Lipp, 1991, The Mixe of Oaxaca: Religion, ritual and healing, University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mixe are among the few contemporary indigenous communities&lt;ref&gt;The [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of Guatemala are another notable indigenous group retaining knowledge and use of this calendar.&lt;/ref&gt; of Mesoamerica to still use the [[Mesoamerican calendars|260-day ritual calendar]] which was in use throughout Mesoamerica in [[pre-Columbian]] times.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] version of the 260-day calendar, the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', and the [[Aztec]]'s ''[[tonalpohualli]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mixe use the ritual calendar for divination, planning of rituals and in order to determine the names given to children. Mixes have two names: a calendrical name in the Mixe language given at birth and a Spanish-Catholic name given at baptism.

[[Nagualism]] also forms a part of Mixe religious beliefs: the Mixe believe that every person is born simultaneously with an animal which becomes their ''Tso'ok'' ([[Nahual]]/animal counterpart) – the animal carries part of the human's soul and the two beings will share a common destiny.

{{nihongo|'''Net idol'''|ネットアイドル|Netto aidoru}} is a Japanese term for a person who achieves celebrity status through the internet. Unlike an [[Internet celebrity]], a net idol is more focused on [[Japanese pop culture]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==History==
''Net idols'' emerged as an offshoot of [[Japanese idol]]s in the late 1990s. The world's first "cyber idol" or "virtual idol" was [[Kyoko Date]] in 1997&lt;ref name="ew.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1997/05/16/kyoko-date-worlds-first-virtual-pop-star/|title=Kyoko Date: The world's first virtual pop star|author=|date=|website=ew.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=SPyb1FmA9V4C&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=world's+first+virtual+idol&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij7fjGp8PYAhUKxLwKHc0EAWoQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=world's+first+virtual+idol&amp;f=false|title=Physical Culture, Power, and the Body|first1=Patricia|last1=Vertinsky|first2=Jennifer|last2=Hargreaves|date=28 November 2006|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has a fabricated history, statistics, and her own songs. Meanwhile, [[gravure idol]]s (グラビアアイドル, ''gurabia aidoru'') such as [[Yoko Matsugane]], [[Rio Natsume]] and [[Eiko Koike]], net idols themselves, have largely appeared skimpily clad in [[Pin-up girl|"cheesecake"]] photographs.

===Net idols in Japanese popular culture===
{{Expand list|date=October 2008}}
* In the [[anime]] and [[manga]] ''[[Sayonara Zetsubō Sensei]]''. Kotonon, one of the net idols in the show, in real life is obese and unattractive. Her website of heavily [[photoshop]]ped images is extremely popular. A real-life net idol is also mentioned on the show but she is given a [[pseudonym]]. 
* In the anime and manga ''[[Death Note]]''. Kira (''killer''), a.k.a. [[Light Yagami]] is a mass murderer who uses a mystical object, the Death Note, to kill criminals. His killings make an uproar on the [[Internet]]. People say that a new [[god]] has come to punish criminals. Using this method of fame and publicity, he gains huge public support.
* The anime and manga ''[[Negima|Mahou Sensei Negima]]'' has [[Chisame Hasegawa]] as the net idol among her class. She is an introverted recluse who, behind the scenes, is the top net idol. She features herself in risque outfits or cosplay outfits. Ironically, when she, the hero, and his crew go into "Cosmo Entelechia", the perfect world designed to be a prison, she resists the spell because her life is that of a "Rea-Juu", internet slang for "fully fulfilling life", when she thinks of herself as the complete opposite of a Rea-Juu. 
* In the anime and manga ''[[Kaichou wa Maid-sama]]'', a young boy named Aoi Hyoudou cross-dresses and becomes a well-known net idol, much to the dismay of his father. 
* In the game ''The iDOLM@STER: Dearly Stars'', the [[hikkikomori]] character Mizutani Eri begins her career as a net idol.

In 2010, he moved to  [[ETH Zurich]] where he was appointed full professor of RNA Biology.&lt;ref name="6profs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roessler"/&gt; His work has caused controversy due to allegations of image manipulation leading to multiple corrections and retractions of published articles.

==Manipulation investigated==

In 2015, his work was investigated for manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/04/allegations-under-investigation.html|title=Allegations under investigation|work=ethz.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation at ETH Zurich found that the scientist "breached his duty of care in the handling of figures as well as in his supervisory duties as a research director... and will receive an admonition in relation to his conduct" but also concluded that "this is not a case of scientific misconduct as defined in ETH Zurich's Rules of Procedure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/07/investigation-result-voinnet.html|author=Press release|title=Conducted properly – published incorrectly|publisher=|work=ethz.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, independent, investigation by CNRS established "the existence of deliberate chart/diagram manipulations, in breach of the ethical standards applicable to the presentation of scientific results" and went on to say that such "inappropriate presentation of experimental data, however, does not amount to fabrication."&lt;ref name="cnrs_investigation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/2593.htm|title=Completion of the procedure against Olivier Voinnet|author=Press release|work=cnrs.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight of Voinnet's scientific articles have been retracted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Voinnet%20O%5BAuthor%5D)%20AND%20%22retracted%20publication%22%5BPublication%20Type%5D|title=PubMed search; Voinnet and retractions|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 13 publications have published corrections &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Voinnet%20o)%20AND%20%22published%20erratum%22%5BPublication%20Type%5D|title=PubMed search; Voinnet and erratum|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bans, suspensions==

As of July 2015, Voinnet has been suspended from the [[CNRS]] (the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]]) for 2 years. That suspension will start once/if he asks to return from his leave of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2015/07/le-cnrs-exclut-olivier-voinnet.html|title=Le CNRS exclut Olivier Voinnet|work=liberation.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2015/07/10/high-profile-biologist-is-suspended-after-two-investigations-found-he-breached-his-duty-of-care-committed-misconduct/|title=High-profile biologist is suspended after two investigations found he "breached his duty of care", committed "misconduct"|work=retractionwatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016 the [[SNSF]] (the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]]) stopped funding Voinnet and banned him for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2016/01/26/swiss-funding-agency-cuts-off-voinnet-bans-him-for-3-years/|title=Swiss funding agency cuts off Voinnet, bans him for 3 years|work=retractionwatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

In 2009 Voinnet was awarded the [[EMBO Gold Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://embo.org/news/press-releases/press-releases-2009/olivier-voinnet-awarded-2009-embo-gold-medal|title=Olivier Voinnet awarded 2009 EMBO Gold Medal|author=|publisher=|work=embo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO) retracted the award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2016/01/28/embo-takes-back-voinnets-award-investigates-other-awardee-who-just-lost-a-nature-genetics-paper/|title=EMBO takes back Voinnet's award, investigates other awardee who just lost a Nature Genetics paper|work=retractionwatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/45183/title/Funding-Ban-for-Plant-Biologist/|title=Funding Ban for Plant Biologist|work=the-scientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 he was awarded the Rössler Prize at the [[ETH]] Zurich, sponsored by [[Max Rössler]] and awarded each year to a young male or female professor from ETH Zurich, considered to be of the ″most promising young scientists in the further development of their career″.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/research/science-awards-and-events/roessler-prize.html|title=Rössler Prize|author=|publisher=|work=eth.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4356">The '''Otuho''' '''people''', also known as the '''Lotuko''' or '''Latuka,''' are a [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic group whose traditional home is the [[Eastern Equatoria]] state of [[South Sudan]]. Their population is around 241,000.

The Lotuko are bordered by the Lokoro in the North, the [[Bari people|Bari]] on the West, the [[Acholi]] and the [[Madi people|Madi]] in the South, and the [[Didinga people|Didinga]] and the [[Boya people|Boya]] in the East. Their region is characterized by ranges and mountain spurs such as the Imotong mountain, the highest mountain in South Sudan with an altitude of 10,453 ft above sea level. It is divided into 5 major sub-regions: Imatong, Valley, Dongotolo, [[Lopit (disambiguation)|Lopit]], and the Great Plains.

As [[Agro-pastoralism|agro-pastoralists]], they keep large herds of cattle, sheep and goats, and supplement this with [[hoe-farming]], hunting, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoplegroups.org/Explore/groupdetails.aspx?peid=12089|title=Lotuho of South Sudan|author=|publisher=People Groups|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engage in some [[subsistence agriculture]]; their main crops are [[sorghum]], ground nuts, simsim ([[sesame]]), and [[maize]] in the plains, or telebun, dukhn, [[Sweet potato|sweet potatoes]], and [[tobacco]] in the hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gurtong.net/Peoples/ThePeopleandDemographicsofSouthSudan/LotukaOtuho/tabid/209/Default.aspx|title=Lotuko (Otuho)|last=|first=|date=|website=gartong.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Murle people|Murle]] people have recently raided the Lokuto, the [[Lopit people|Lopit]], and other tribes in the area, abducting their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/463/Lopit-and-Lotuko-Communities-Vow-to-End-Conflict.aspx|title=Lopit and Lotuko Communities Vow to End Conflict|author=Peter Lokale Nakimangole|date=22 Jan 2009|publisher=Gurtong Trust|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land is owned by no single person, but in trust by the community. In the mountains, after finding a site, the group decides the boundaries of each person's garden, with certain areas being [[fallow]] (for up to 10 years) and others open to cultivation (for up to 4 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwights-journey.blogspot.com/1980/07/interviewing-josiah-about-lotuko.html|title=Interviewing Josiah About Lotuko Agriculture|author=Dwight|date=5 July 1980|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Otuho religion{{anchor|Lotuko_religion}} ==
{{more references|date=June 2018}}Their primary religion is an [[ethnic religion]] based on nature and [[ancestor worship]] that is deeply rooted in their ethnic identity; conversion to another religion essentially equates to [[cultural assimilation]]. The chief god of the Lotuko is called Ajok; he is generally seen as kind and benevolent, but can be angered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African Mythology A to Z|first=Patricia Ann |last=Lynch|publisher= Facts on File}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lotuko mythology he once answered a woman's prayer for the [[resurrection]] of her son. Her husband, however, was angry and re-killed the child. Ajok was annoyed by his actions and swore never to resurrect any Lotuko again, and in this manner, [[death]] was said to have become permanent.

The '''Outback''' is the vast, remote interior of [[Australia]]. "The Outback" is more remote than those areas named "[[Australian bush|the bush]]" which is any location outside the main [[urban area]]s.

While often envisaged as being [[arid]], the Outback regions extend from the northern to southern Australian coastlines, and encompass a number of climatic zones; including [[tropical climate|tropical]] and monsoonal climates in northern areas, arid areas in the "red centre" and [[semi-arid]] and [[temperate climate|temperate]] climates in southerly regions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2014/10/the-modern-outback|title=The Modern Outback|website=www.pewtrusts.org|access-date=2016-12-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218131310/http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2014/10/the-modern-outback|archivedate=18 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, the Outback is unified by a combination of factors, most notably a low human population density, a largely intact, natural environment and, in many places, low-intensity land uses such as [[pastoralism]] (livestock grazing) in which production is reliant on the natural environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Culturally, the Outback is deeply ingrained in Australian heritage, history and folklore. In 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, the Queensland Outback was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as a "natural attraction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND’S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|dead-url=|access-date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Indigenous Australians|European exploration of Australia}}
[[File:Kata Tjuta Aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Kata Tjuta]]]]
Indigenous Australians have lived in the Outback for approximately 50,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamm|first=Giles|last2=Mitchell|first2=Peter|last3=Arnold|first3=Lee J.|last4=Prideaux|first4=Gavin J.|last5=Questiaux|first5=Daniele|last6=Spooner|first6=Nigel A.|last7=Levchenko|first7=Vladimir A.|last8=Foley|first8=Elizabeth C.|last9=Worthy|first9=Trevor H.|date=2016-11-10|title=Cultural innovation and megafauna interaction in the early settlement of arid Australia|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v539/n7628/full/nature20125.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=539|issue=7628|pages=280–283|doi=10.1038/nature20125|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occupied all Outback regions, including the driest deserts, when Europeans first entered central Australia in the 1800s. Many Indigenous Australians retain strong physical and cultural links to their traditional country and are legally recognised as the Traditional Owners of large parts of the Outback under Commonwealth [[Native title in Australia|Native Title]] legislation.

Early European exploration of inland Australia was sporadic. More focus was on the more accessible and fertile coastal areas. The first party to successfully cross the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] just outside Sydney was led by [[Gregory Blaxland]] in 1813, 25 years after the colony was established. People starting with [[John Oxley]] in 1817, 1818 and 1821, followed by [[Charles Sturt]] in 1829–1830 attempted to follow the westward-flowing rivers to find an "inland sea", but these were found to all flow into the [[Murray River]] and [[Darling River]] which turn south.
Over the period 1858 to 1861, [[John McDouall Stuart]] led six expeditions north from Adelaide into the outback, culminating in successfully reaching the north coast of Australia and returning, without the loss of any of the party's members' lives. This contrasts with the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]] in 1860–61 which was much better funded, but resulted in the deaths of three of the members of the transcontinental party.

The [[Overland Telegraph]] line was constructed in the 1870s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/overland-telegraph |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629144111/http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/overland-telegraph |archivedate=29 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; along the route identified by Stuart.

In 1865 the surveyor [[George Goyder]], using changes in vegetation patterns, mapped a [[Goyder's Line|line in South Australia]], north of which he considered rainfall to be too unreliable to support agriculture.

Exploration of the outback continued in the 1950s when [[Len Beadell]] explored, surveyed and built many roads in support of the [[Nuclear weapons tests in Australia|nuclear weapons tests]] at [[Emu Field]] and [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]] and rocket testing on the [[Woomera Prohibited Area]]. Mineral exploration continues as new mineral deposits are identified and developed.

While the early explorers used horses to cross the outback, the first woman to make the journey riding a horse was [[Anna Hingley]], who rode from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] to [[Cairns]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|author=|date=|website=thetimes.co.uk|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The savanna (or grassy woodlands) of northern Australia are the largest, intact [[savanna]] regions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/ecocheck-australias-vast-majestic-northern-savannas-need-more-care-59897|title=EcoCheck: Australia's vast, majestic northern savannas need more care|last=Murphy|first=Brett|newspaper=The Conversation|access-date=2016-12-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163138/https://theconversation.com/ecocheck-australias-vast-majestic-northern-savannas-need-more-care-59897|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the south, the [[Great Western Woodlands]], which occupy {{convert|16000000|ha}}, an area larger than all of England and Wales, are the largest remaining temperate woodland left on Earth.

=== Major ecosystems ===
Reflecting the wide climatic and geological variation, the Outback contains a wealth of distinctive and ecologically-rich ecosystems. Major land types include:
* the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] and [[Pilbara]] regions in northern Western Australia,
* sub-tropical savanna landscape of the [[Top End]], 
* ephemeral water courses of the [[Channel Country]] in western Queensland, 
* the [[Deserts of Australia|ten deserts]] in central and western Australia,
* the Inland Ranges, such as the [[MacDonnell Ranges]], which provide topographic variation across the flat plains,
* the flat [[Nullarbor Plain]] north of the Great Australian Bight, and
* the [[Great Western Woodlands]] in southern Western Australia.

=== Wildlife ===

The [[Australia|Australian]] Outback is full of very important well-adapted wildlife, although much of it may not be immediately visible to the casual observer.  Many animals, such as [[red kangaroo]]s and [[dingo]]es, hide in bushes to rest and keep cool during the heat of the day.

Birdlife is prolific, most often seen at waterholes at dawn and dusk.  Huge flocks of [[budgerigars]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[Corella (bird)|corellas]] and [[galah]]s are often sighted. On bare ground or roads during the winter, various species of snakes and lizards bask in the sun, but they are rarely seen during the summer months.

Feral animals such as camels thrive in central Australia, brought to Australia by pastoralists and explorers, along with the early [[Afghan (Australia)|Afghan drivers]]. Feral horses known as '[[brumby|brumbies]]' are station horses that have run wild.  Feral pigs, foxes, cats and rabbits are other imported animals also degrading the environment, so time and money is spent eradicating them in an attempt to help protect fragile rangelands.

The Outback is home to a diverse set of animal species, such as the kangaroo, emu and dingo. The [[Dingo Fence]] was built to restrict movements of dingoes and wild dogs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-06-29/last-dog-trapper-south-australia/7552974?section=sa Wild dog populations will be out of control within five years without dedicated dogger, former trapper says] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428020527/http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-06-29/last-dog-trapper-south-australia/7552974?section=sa |date=28 April 2018 }} ''SA Country Hour'', ''ABC News'', 29 June 2016.

Retrieved 13 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent. The marginally fertile parts are primarily utilised as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle grazing, on cattle stations which are leased from the Federal Government. While small areas of the outback consist of clay soils the majority has exceedingly infertile palaeosols.

[[Australian Fossil Mammal Sites (Riversleigh)|Riversleigh]], in Queensland, is one of Australia's most renowned fossil sites and was recorded as a World Heritage site in 1994. The 100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (39 sq mi) area contains fossil remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] age.

== Industry ==

=== Pastoralism ===
[[File:ISS007 Gosses Bluff.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gosses Bluff crater]], one of a number of [[meteor]] [[impact crater]]s that can be found across outback Australia]]
The largest industry across the Outback, in terms of the area occupied, is [[pastoralism]], in which cattle, sheep, and sometimes goats, are grazed in mostly intact, natural ecosystems. Widespread use of bore water, obtained from underground aquifers, including the [[Great Artesian Basin]], has enabled livestock to be grazed across vast areas in which no permanent surface water exists naturally.

Capitalising on the lack of pasture improvement and absence of fertiliser and pesticide use, many Outback pastoral properties are certified as [[Organic farming|organic]] livestock producers. In 2014, {{convert|17000000|ha}}, most of which is in Outback Australia, was fully certified as organic farm production, making Australia the largest certified organic production area in the world.

=== Tourism ===

"Nothing says Australia quite like our Outback," states the national tourism web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australia.com/en/things-to-do/outback-australia.html|title=The Outback – Tourism Australia|last=Australia|first=Tourism|date=2016-11-01|website=www.australia.com|access-date=2016-12-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210173849/http://www.australia.com/en/things-to-do/outback-australia.html|archivedate=10 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is a major industry across the Outback, and commonwealth and state tourism agencies explicitly target Outback Australia as a desirable destination for domestic and international travellers. There is no breakdown of tourism revenues for the "Outback" ''per se''. However, regional tourism is a major component of national tourism incomes. [[Tourism Australia]] explicitly markets nature-based and Indigenous-led experiences to tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tourism.australia.com/aboriginal.aspx|title=Aboriginal Tourism – Markets – Tourism Australia|last=Australia|first=Tourism|website=www.tourism.australia.com|access-date=2016-12-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122012139/http://www.tourism.australia.com/aboriginal.aspx|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015–2016 financial year, 815,000 visitors spent $988 million while on holidays in the Northern Territory alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tourismnt.com.au/en/research/latest-visitor-data|title=Latest visitor data – Tourism NT Corporate Site|website=www.tourismnt.com.au|access-date=2016-12-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221162856/http://www.tourismnt.com.au/en/research/latest-visitor-data|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
[[File:LightningRidgeMines.jpg|thumb|right|Fossicking field in [[Lightning Ridge, New South Wales|Lightning Ridge]]]]
Other than agriculture and tourism, the main economic activity in this vast and sparsely settled area is mining. Owing to the almost complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the [[Permian]] (in many areas since the [[Cambrian]]) ages, the outback is extremely rich in iron, aluminium, [[manganese]] and uranium ores, and also contains major deposits of gold, nickel, copper, lead and zinc ores. Because of its size, the value of grazing and mining is considerable. Major mines and mining areas in the Outback include opals at [[Coober Pedy, South Australia|Coober Pedy]], [[Lightning Ridge, New South Wales|Lightning Ridge]] and [[White Cliffs, New South Wales|White Cliffs]], metals at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]], [[Tennant Creek, Northern Territory|Tennant Creek]], [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Olympic Dam]] and the remote [[Challenger Mine]]. Oil and gas are extracted in the [[Cooper Basin]] around [[Moomba, South Australia|Moomba]].

In Western Australia the [[Argyle diamond mine]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] is the world's biggest producer of natural diamonds and contributes approximately one-third of the world's natural supply. The [[Pilbara]] region's economy is dominated by mining and petroleum industries.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pilbara's oil and gas industry is the region's largest export industry earning $5.0 billion in 2004/05 accounting for over 96% of the State's production.'' source – [http://www.pdc.wa.gov.au/industry/types-of-industries/oil-and-gas.aspx WA.gov.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719184734/http://www.pdc.wa.gov.au/industry/types-of-industries/oil-and-gas.aspx |date=19 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Australia's [[iron ore]] is also mined in the Pilbara and it also has one of the world's major [[manganese]] mines.
{{Panorama|image=File:Outback view from Chambers Pillar.jpg|fullwidth= 800|fullheight= 241|caption=View of dunefields and mesa, Central Australia|height= 241}}

== Population ==
[[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] communities in outback regions, such as the [[Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara]] lands in northern South Australia, have not been displaced as they have been in areas of intensive agriculture and large cities, in coastal areas.

The total population of the Outback in Australia declined from 700,000 in 1996 to 690,000 in 2006. The largest decline was in the [[Central Australia|Outback Northern Territory]], while the Kimberley and Pilbara showed population increases during the same period.  The sex ratio is 1040 males for 1000 females and 17% of the total population is indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdu.edu.au/thenortherninstitute/documents/publications/Brief2009037outback_australia_and_the_NT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325103731/http://www.cdu.edu.au/thenortherninstitute/documents/publications/Brief2009037outback_australia_and_the_NT.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
[[File:RFDS emergency landing strip sign.jpg|thumb|Sign on the [[Eyre Highway]] indicating that an RFDS emergency airstrip is ahead]]
{{Main|Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia}}
The [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]] (RFDS) started service in 1928 and helps people who live in the outback of Australia. In former times, serious injuries or illnesses often meant death due to the lack of proper medical facilities and trained personnel.

==Education==

{{Main|School of the Air}}

In most outback communities, the number of children is too small for a conventional school to operate. Children are educated at home by the [[School of the Air]]. Originally the teachers communicated with the children via radio, but now satellite telecommunication is used instead.
Some children attend boarding school, mostly only those in secondary school.

==Terminology==
The concept of 'back' country, which initially meant land beyond the settled regions, was in existence in 1800. Crossing of the Blue Mountains and other exploration of the inland however gave a different dimension to the perception. The term "outback" was first used in print in 1869, when the writer clearly meant west of [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales.&lt;ref name="Coupe"&gt;Coupe, Sheena (ed.),  Frontier Country, Vol. 1, Weldon Russell Publishing, Willoughby, 1989, {{ISBN|1-875202-01-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is colloquially said that 'the outback' is located "beyond the [[Black Stump]]". The location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore. It has been suggested that the term comes from the ''Black Stump Wine Saloon'' that once stood about {{convert|10|km}} out of [[Coolah, New South Wales]] on the Gunnedah Road. It is claimed that the saloon, named after the nearby Black Stump Run and Black Stump Creek, was an important staging post for traffic to north-west New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys.&lt;ref name="SMHOutback2005"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lewis | first = Daniel | authorlink =  | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/outback/outer-limits/2005/05/16/1116095894531.html | title = Outer limits | work = Travel | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 2005-05-17 | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080426230617/http://www.theage.com.au/news/outback/outer-limits/2005/05/16/1116095894531.html | archivedate = 26 April 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The [[Never Never (Australian outback)|Never-Never]]" is a term referring to remoter parts of the Australian outback. The Outback can also be referred to as "back of beyond", "back o' [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]]" although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere, or a long way away. The well-watered north of the continent is often called the "[[Top End]]" and the arid interior "The Red Centre", owing to its vast amounts of red soil and sparse greenery amongst its landscape.

==Transport==
[[File:Gibb River Rd-1.jpg|thumb|right|Road sign warning of potentially dangerous conditions ahead]]
The outback is criss-crossed by historic tracks. Most of the major highways have an excellent [[bitumen]] surface and other major roads are usually well-maintained dirt roads.  Tracks in very sandy or exceedingly rocky areas may require high-clearance four wheel drives and spare fuel, tyres, food and water before attempting to travel them, however most outback roads are easily traversed in ordinary vehicles, provided care is taken.  Drivers unused to dirt roads should be especially cautious – it is recommended that drivers reduce their speed, drive with extra care, and avoid driving at night because animals can stray onto roads.  Travelling in remote areas in northern Australia is not advisable during the wet season (November to April), as heavy tropical downpours can quickly make dirt roads impassable. In the remotest parts of Australia fuel sellers are located hundreds of kilometres apart, so spare fuel must be carried or refuelling spots calculated carefully in order not to run out of fuel in between towns. In addition, multiple trailer trucks (known as [[Road Train]]s) traverse these roads and extreme care must be taken when around these vehicles, due to their weight, length (often three full trailers long) and amount of dust thrown up by over 46 tyres.

The [[Stuart Highway]] runs from north to south through the centre of the continent, roughly paralleled by the [[Adelaide–Darwin railway]]. There is a proposal to develop some of the roads running from the south-west to the north-east to create an all-weather road named the [[Outback Highway]], crossing the continent diagonally from [[Laverton, Western Australia]] (north of [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], through the Northern Territory to [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]], in Queensland.

Air transport is relied on for mail delivery in some areas, owing to sparse settlement and wet-season road closures.  Most outback mines have an airstrip and many have a [[fly-in fly-out]] workforce. Most outback [[sheep station]]s and [[cattle station]]s have an airstrip and quite a few have their own light plane. Medical and ambulance services are provided by the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]]. The [[School of the Air]] is a radio-based school using the RFDS radios.

Visitors to the outback often drive their own or rented vehicles, or take organised tours. Travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no planning.  However travel through very remote areas, on isolated tracks, requires planning and a suitable, reliable vehicle (usually a [[four-wheel drive]]). On very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required; this can include prearranged caches. It is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle, unless fully equipped with good communication technology (e.g. a satellite phone, EPIRB etc.).  Many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy. Deaths of tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur, sometimes because insufficient water and food supplies were taken, or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help.  Travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected destination arrival time, and remember that a vehicle is much easier to locate in an aerial search, than a person, so in the event of a breakdown, they must not leave their vehicle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6260">A '''personality clash''' occurs when two (or more) people find themselves in conflict not over a particular issue or incident, but due to a fundamental incompatibility in their personalities, their approaches to things, or their [[style of life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200612/when-personalities-clash Judith Sills, 'When Personalities Clash']&lt;/ref&gt;

A personality clash may occur in work-related, family-related, or social situations.

==Types==

[[Carl Jung]] saw the polarity of [[extraversion and introversion]] as a major potential cause of personality conflicts in everyday life,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 46-7&lt;/ref&gt; as well as underlying many past intellectual and philosophical disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970) p. 700&lt;/ref&gt;

He also opposed thinking and feeling types, intuitive and sensation types, as potential sources of misunderstanding between people;&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (2004) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; while other typologies can and have been developed since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200612/when-personalities-clash Sills]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
{{Main|Workplace conflict}}
The issue of personality clashes in the workplace is controversial. According to the Australian government, the two types of workplace conflicts are when people's ideas, decisions or actions relating directly to the job are in opposition, or when two people just don't get along.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Workplace_conflict?OpenDocument Workplace conflict], [[Better Health Channel]].&lt;/ref&gt; Turner and Weed argue that in a conflict situation, don’t ask who, ask what and why. Managers should avoid blaming interpersonal conflicts on personality clashes. Such a tactic is an excuse to avoid addressing the real causes of conflict, and the department’s performance will suffer as a result. Managers must be able to recognize the signs of conflict behaviors and deal with the conflict in a forthright fashion. Approaching conflicts as opportunities to improve departmental policies and operations rather as ailments to be eradicated or ignored will result in a more productive work force and greater departmental efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Turner. S. and Weed. F., Conflict in Organizations, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs NJ (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to avoid recognizing harsher business bullying situations, employers are more likely to refer to these actions as a personality clash.&lt;ref&gt;Namie. G., Workplace bullying: Escalated incivility, Ivey Publishing, London, Ontario, (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In therapy==

[[Sigmund Freud]] thought a harmonious match of therapist and patient was essential for psychotherapy; but subsequent experience has demonstrated that success can follow even where there is an underlying personality clash.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Macolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neville Symington]] indeed saw a patient's willingness to proceed with therapy, ''despite'' her dislike of him, as a positive sign of health, and as a beginning repudiation of her [[narcissism]].&lt;ref&gt;Symington, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies==

Some suggest that the only answer to a personality clash is the [[folk remedy]] of distancing - reducing contact with the clashing personality involved.&lt;ref&gt;J. &amp; M. McCarthy, ''Software for your Head'' (2002) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Other recommendations are to focus on the positives in the other person, and to examine one's own psychodynamics for clues as to why one is finding them so difficult&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200612/when-personalities-clash?page=2 Sills]&lt;/ref&gt; - perhaps due to a [[Projection (psychology)|projection]] of some unacknowledged part of one's own personality.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Gardner]] saw a major part of what he called [[interpersonal intelligence]] as the ability to mediate and resolve such personality clashes from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 39 and p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Actual===

* Circumstances conspired to produce a painful personality clash between the ordered, cerebral, emotionally contained [[A. J. P. Taylor]], and the spendthrift, bohemian, expansive [[Dylan Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Wrigley, ''A. J. P. Taylor'' (2006) p. 92 and p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt;
* The clash between the cautious, moderate [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harley]] and the mercurial, extremist [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]] at the close of Queen Anne's reign did much to usher in the long [[Whig (British political party)#Whig supremacy|Whig ascendency]] that followed.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Trevelyan, ''The Peace and the Protestant Succession'' (1965) p. 301-10&lt;/ref&gt;
* The personality clash between [[Henry Tizard]] and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]] had adverse effects on the Allied conduct of World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wood/D. D. Dempster, ''The Narrow Margin'' (1992) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary===

* [[C. P. Snow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel on the [[Corridors of Power (novel)|corridors of power]] described caballing with someone whose temperament "clashed right at the roots with mine: even if he was not being offensive, he would have tempted me to say something hard. But I was doing a job, and I couldn't afford luxuries, certainly not the luxury of being myself".&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Corridors of Power'' (1975) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polish Uplanders''' ({{lang-pl|Pogórzanie}}; also known as '''Western Pogorzans''' and '''Eastern Pogorzans'''), are a distinctive subethnic group of [[Poles]] that mostly live in the Central Beskidian Range of the [[Subcarpathia]]n highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Na początku lat sześćdziesiątych XX wieku nazewnictwo to zakwestionował Franciszek Kotula. [in:] Polskie stroje ludowe. cz. 3. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Uplanders inhabited the central and the southern half of the [[Beskids]] in [[Poland]], including the Ciężkowickie, Strzyżowskie and Dynowskie Plateau as well as [[Doły Jasielsko-Sanockie]], from the White River (''Biała'') in the west to the [[San River]] in the east.

Polish Uplanders are neighbours with: ''Lachy sądeckie'' to the west; ''[[Kraków|Krakowiacy]]'' and ''[[Rzeszów|Rzeszowiacy]]'' to the north, and; ''Dolinians'' and [[Lemko]]s (both [[Rusyn people|Rusyn]] subgroups) to the south.

With regard to cultural differences Uplanders are divided into two parts: western (the area of [[Gorlice]], [[Jasło]] and [[Strzyżów]]), southern [[Sanok]], and eastern ([[Brzozów]]). The border between those two groups is in [[Krosno]]. The differences between western and eastern groups were especially seen in architecture and clothes.

Traditional occupations of the Polish Uplanders included agriculture, oil [[mining]] and the military; today these are joined by the service and petroleum industries, and agrotourism.
The Pogorzan language is considered by Polish scholars to be the most western of Polish dialects ([[Masurian dialect|Mazurian]] and Lesser Polish dialect).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32710">A '''prison gang''' is an inmate organization that operates within a prison system. It has a corporate entity and exists into perpetuity. Its membership is restrictive, mutually exclusive, and often requires a lifetime commitment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Skarbek, David. The Social Order of the Underworld: How Prison Gangs Govern the American Penal System. : Oxford University Press, 2014-07-01.Oxford Scholarship Online. 2014-06-19. Date Accessed 7 May. 2016 &amp;#x3C;http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199328499.001.0001/acprof-9780199328499&amp;#x3E;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prison officials and others in law enforcement use the euphemism "security threat group" (or "STG"). The purpose of this name is to remove any recognition or publicity that the term "gang" would connote when referring to people who have an interest in undermining the system.

== Origins ==

=== The convict code and informal governance of prisons ===

Before the rise of large, formal prison gangs, political scientists and researchers found that inmates had already organized around an understood "code" or set of norms. For example, political scientist [[Gresham Sykes]] in ''The Society of Captives,'' a study based on the New Jersey State Prison, claims that "conformity to, or deviation from, the inmate code is the major basis for classifying and describing the social relations of prisoners".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gresham M. Sykes, ''[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0691028141/qid=1099854629/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-0379743-8558219?v=glance&amp;s=books The Society of Captives: A Study of a Maximum Security Prison]'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1958), 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners achieved a social equilibrium around unwritten rules. The code may include an understanding of jail yard territory based on rank or ethnicity, or it could simply be loyalty between inmates and against guards. Sykes writes that an inmate may "bind himself to his fellow captives with ties of mutual aid, loyalty, affection, and respect, firmly standing in opposition to the officials."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hostility between wardens and prisoners, restrained freedom, and, some argue, the lack of access to heterosexual relationships shaped prison social environment and political dynamics.

=== Rising prison populations and the emergence of formal gangs ===

When researchers or political scientists actively discuss "classic prison gangs", they are referring to prison gangs in the United States of America;{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} such gangs began to form in the mid 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}} Around this time, across the United States prison system, the prison population increased markedly.
&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Over the last three decades of the 20th century, the United States engaged in an unprecedented prison-building boom that has given our nation the highest incarceration rate in the world.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As prison populations grew, the informal convict code no longer sufficed to coordinate and protect inmates. The constant surge of prisoners coming into the system with no understanding of the ''status quo'' had disrupted the established equilibrium cohesion. And as demographics inside prisons changed drastically, small groups centered on ethnicity, race, and pre-prison alliances were disrupted. John Irwin states in his book, ''Prisons in Turmoil,'' that by 1970 "there [was] no longer a single, overarching convict culture".&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, John. 1980. Prisons in Turmoil. Boston: Little, Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as the prison population grew so did the consumer base for [[contraband]] items, not only drugs and weapons but also items that are legal outside of prison but are illegal to trade within prisons, such as money, alcohol, tattoos, etc. Several challenges arose that destabilized the socio-political system of self-enforced cooperation that had existed under the convict code. These new conditions posed complications to consumer-supplier relationships in the already distrustful environment of an [[underground economy]]. It became more and more difficult for independent individual suppliers to accommodate this increased demand. Under tight prison security and with limited means, these individual suppliers could only provide a limited amount of product. Their consumer base was too small for them to establish a "[[brand]]" or credibility themselves. New consumers would have to buy products of unknown quality and bear the risk of the supplier being an undercover informant and even the possibility that he would not deliver at all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The ever-fluctuating inmate population also provided a dangerous [[market (economics)|market]] in which to operate. Individual suppliers had to protect themselves from possible murder and assault by consumers and other suppliers, as well as to ensure that their products would not be confiscated or stolen. They were vulnerable to those who delivered and carried the contraband into the prison, and they bore the risk of consumers not paying for the product, or (if operating on credit) not paying the loan. The consumers could also be informants.

In legal markets, governments mitigate such risks by means of [[contract]] enforcement and the upholding of [[property rights]]. Gangs may step into this role and fill the power vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: Skaperdas, Stergios. "The Political Economy of Organized Crime: Providing Protection When the State Does Not." Conflict and Governance (2003): 163-92. http://www.queensu.ca/dms/DMS_Course_Materials_and_Outline/Readings-MPA831/PolEconOfOrgCrime-831.pdf "Mafias and gangs are hierarchically organized and can be thought of as providing primitive state functions, with economic costs that are typically much higher than those associated with modern governance."&lt;/ref&gt; They vet and manage tax-paying supplier gangs within prisons, regulate transactions, and control violence in the marketplace and on the streets.

Prison gangs are effective in governing markets. They provide protection to their member suppliers more effectively than individual suppliers could do for themselves. They carry the credible threat of exercising violence - and even murder in case of theft or snitching - to ensure timely payments. They protect their members against competing suppliers. The size of prison gangs and their scale of product supply also means that they have a broad scope of knowledge about their client base. They share information on informants or inmates who default on payments. This scope of supply also gains a reputation with consumers, who can then feel safe in being able to gauge the quality of product and credibility of suppliers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A crucial difference between individual suppliers who operate under the convict code and prison gangs involves the time-frame in which they operate. Unlike individual suppliers who cycle in and out, prison gangs form long-term institutions, regardless of how often individual members enter or leave the system. There are always plenty of members to maintain the gang's functions - behind bars and on the streets. This means they have solid incentive to provide quality product to uphold a good reputation in the long run.

Prison gangs have evolved into complex organizations with hierarchies and vote-based ranks and intricate coalitions with exclusive and often permanent memberships.

=== Alternative factors and explanations ===

Another approach to understanding prison gang development is based upon observations of inmates in the Texas prison system. It provides a five-stage progression from an inmate's entrance to the prison to the formation of a prison gang.&lt;ref&gt;Buentello, Salvador, Robert S. Fong, and Ronald E. Vogel. 1991. "Prison Gang Development: A Theoretical Model." The Prison Journal 71(2): 3–14.&lt;/ref&gt; First an inmate enters the prison, alone and thus fearful until he finds a sense of belonging in a "clique of inmates." They band together without formal rules, leaders, or membership requirements. It then evolves into a "predatory group," creating exclusive requirements for membership and positioning itself against wardens, even assaulting them. Then, by engaging in illegal activities, they choose leaders to manage them. In its final stage the group emerges as a prison gang.

A gendered approach to prison gangs offers two arguments focusing on the idea of male domination and the inmate's adherence to a hyper-masculine ideal.

One argument claims that prison order is shaped by the inmates' desire or need for male domination, and the gang reconstructs this sense of power in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Dolovich, Sharon. 2011. "Strategic Segregation in the Modern Prison" American Criminal Law Review 48(1): 1–110.&lt;/ref&gt; As inmates can no longer "subjugate women," they find other forms of domination, resorting to force and violence to control each other.

Another approach, discussed by Erving Goffman, maps out four steps of inmate adaptation. In the first step, the inmate undergoes a "situational withdrawal" or mental withdrawal from the institution. "The inmate withdraws apparent attention from everything except events immediately around his body." The second step is called "colonization" when the inmate tries to rationalize the institution as preferable to life on the outside. The third step, "conversion," is when "the inmate takes over the staff's view of himself and tries to act out the role of the perfect inmate." The fourth step, which prison gang members fit into, is called "the intransigent line," when the inmate refuses the authority of the institution and acts against it.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving, Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates (London: Penguin, 1973) (first published in 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two prominent sociological theories surrounding prison gangs and the order within prisons: deprivation theory and importation theory.

Deprivation theory argues that social order within prisons arises due to the pain of imprisonment; studies focusing on this theory examine the experiences of prisoners and the nature of their confinement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaes|first=Gerald|date=September 1994|title=Prison Crowding Research Reexamined|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0032855594074003004|journal=The Prison Journal|volume=74|pages=329–363|via=SagePub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importation theory focuses instead on experiences prisoners had prior to incarceration. It explores the ways in which class, race, and drug culture outside the prison have shaped dynamics inside the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Operations and activities ==

The system of governance in Prison gangs, highlights the unusual mechanisms by which people (or groups of people) with no access to government institutions, manage to facilitate exchange and establish property rights within their scope of influence. The emergence of informal governance systems within prison gangs, runs parallel to successful systems of trade and control beyond bars. Skarbek (2011)&lt;ref name="Skarbek, David 2011"&gt;Skarbek, David. 2011. "Governance and prison gangs." American Political Science Review 105(4): 702-716.&lt;/ref&gt; uses the example of the illegal narcotics trade in Los Angeles to explain how an alternative system of governance behind bars, can lead to successful socioeconomic organization. Focusing on the Mexican Mafia prison gang, Skarbek argues that the mafia holds substantial control within local jail systems which allows it to yield power over drug dealers on the streets. Drug dealers outside the prison walls, anticipate future incarceration and thus future interaction with the mafia. Faced with the threat of these future run ins with the Mafia, drug dealers on the street comply with the current demands of prison gangs in order to secure their own future.

Since prison gangs gain a long-term profit if transactions in the illicit market run smoothly, they have the incentive to ensure that there is order and cohesion between suppliers and consumers.

Similar to stationary bandits that form governance out of anarchy in the model presented by economist [[Mancur Olson|Marcur Olson]],&lt;ref&gt;Mancur Olson, 2000. Power and Prosperity: Outgrowing Communist and Capitalist Dictatorships, Oxford University Press. Description and chapter-preview links. Foreign Affairs review&lt;/ref&gt; prison gangs are actors who have the ability to extract resources from their population by providing services. They act to maximize their profit, not only by restraining the amount they extort, but by providing services that facilitate exchange and imposing "gang taxes".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Mexican Mafia, for example, increases it's tax revenue by providing three types of services: protect street gang members while they are incarcerated, protect taxpaying drug dealers on the street, and settling of disputes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the process of maximizing profit, gangs may provide public goods to ensure smooth production, such as working to resolve gang disputes inside and outside of the prison.

Moreover, by holding the monopoly on violence in prisons, they pose a credible threat to street gangs, which they leverage to extort their profits. So prison gangs can extort street gangs because they pose a credible threat to inmates in the county jail, and street gang members rationally anticipate spending time there. They effectively use incarcerated street gang members as hostages to force non-incarcerated gang members to pay. Furthermore, they can encourage street gangs to steal from and make war with other non-taxpaying street gangs.

However, prison gangs cannot extort drug dealers whom they cannot harm in jail; for American prison gangs this usually means members of other races (the county jails segregate them based upon race). They also cannot extort taxes from people who do not anticipate incarceration, because there is no threat of facing violence in prison. And they cannot tax those outside the jurisdiction of a jail controlled by the gang. Non-incarcerated prison gang members collect taxes and regulate fraud and imposters acting as tax collectors. Taxpayers also ensure that their money is going to the right hand because consequences otherwise would be severe.

Political scientist David Skarbeck writes, "Like the stationary bandit, prison gangs provide governance institutions that allow illicit markets to flourish. They adjudicate disputes and protect property rights. They orchestrate violence so that it is relatively less disruptive. They do not do this because they are benevolent dictators but because they profit from doing so. In addition to governing prisons, gangs are also an important source of governance to the criminal world outside of prison. They wield tremendous power over street gangs, specifically those participating in the drug trade. Because of this power, governance from behind bars helps illicit markets to flourish on the streets."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The way they prison gangs consolidate and maintain power is also comparable to how actors behave in [[Charles Tilly]]'s predatory theory of state building model.&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, Charles (1990). Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990–1990. Cambridge, Mass., USA: B. Blackwell.{{ISBN|1-55786-368-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prison gangs engage in "war making," or monopolizing on force and occupying the power vacuum of state authority. They eliminate rivals (in the US mostly along racial lines) within their territories, and in doing so they carry out "state making." Gangs offer protection to their members, affiliates, and clients. They also extract or collect taxes from client gangs and those in the trade to maintain and expand their system.

One of the city in South Africa - Cape Town - has its own history of gang activity dating back to the 19th century. One of the authors that wrote about African gangs recorded in one of his books&lt;ref&gt;D. Pinnock, The botherhoods: street gangs and state control in Cape Town, Cape Town: David Phillip, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; gang activity escalated with the establishment in an area that known as the Cape Flats. Many young men, turned to gangs for protection, opportunity and a sense of belonging.

== Organization and structure ==

Prison gangs work to recruit members with street smarts and loyalty, and they look for inmates who will be able to carry out the gangs' functions and exercise force when necessary. They also create a structure to monitor activities of members and regulate the behavior of existing members within the gangs to ensure internal cohesion. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

To ensure that high quality, dedicated members are being recruited, many prison gangs rely on existing members to vouch for or refer new members into the group. To enter gangs, members often have to prove their loyalty through costly activity, often violent hazing. Gang members mark themselves as part of the gang with tattoos (or colors, on the streets) so that taxpayers know they are credible collectors and so that gangs can keep track of their members as they move in and out of prison.

Prison gangs maintain a hierarchy and have written and unwritten rules of conduct. They have constitutions to define expectations and to guide laws for those they govern as well as to direct the process for the creation of new rules. In terms of the hierarchy, at the top of most US prison gangs is a group of "shot callers" who are like major stakeholders that make the major decisions about operations. Having a single dictator-like shot caller is unusual. Checks and balances within prison gang organizations are lucrative; internally, there ways to voice dissatisfaction towards any level of the organization. For example, when conflicts arise or abuses occur where a higher-ranked gang member commits an offense against a lower-ranked member, an internal court-like body receives complaints and determines punishments. Actions are punished with violence. In many gangs exit is not an option (or is a very costly one); many prison gangs require a lifetime membership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Political scientist Ben Lessing differentiates between prison gangs that arise within the prison system, which he calling 'natives,' and those that were already formed outside, calling them 'imports'.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lessing, Benjamin. The Danger of Dungeons: Prison Gangs and Incarcerated Militant Groups. Small Arms Survey, Chapter 6  (http://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/overtime.html) 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that norms and culture-like initiation rituals, rules about sex, and relations with guards and non-members are shaped by the direction of formation. Natives have a 'prison character' in their imagery, traits, and codes that they retain even when native gangs engage in operations beyond the prison system. On the other hand, import gangs arrive with a "strong group identity, behavioral norms, and often their publicly known histories and reputations."&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; This gives these groups a stronger sense of solidarity and cohesion in prison, though they compensate in how they well they navigate the system within prison.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, James B. 1974. 'Street Gangs behind Bars.' Social Problems, Vol. 21, No. 3, pp. 395–409. —. 1978. Stateville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society. Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Imports have an advantage in their existing outside operations.

Discussing the organizational mechanism within prisoner gangs, Skarbek (2011)&lt;ref name="Skarbek, David 2011"/&gt; argues that both explicit and implicit rules governs behaviors within these groups. Explicit rules are those that are formally written and structured while implicit rules are those that are based on the values and norms of each group. Though the use of implicit and explicit rules (to what degree and to address which situations) may vary from group to group, Skarbek maintains that since codifying all rules is costly, prison gangs rely in great part, on the existence of implicit rules with values and norms forming a foundation from where informal governance begins. Other social scientists such as Ellickson (2009),&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Ellickson, Robert C. 2009. "Order without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes." Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; echo similar claims but with key distinctions. Ellickson states that close-knit groups rely heavily on specific norms and informal rules to achieve cooperation and to minimize transaction costs within governance institutions based on property rights. However while Ellickson's work focuses on non-hierarchical examples, Skarbek's example considers hierarchical system of prison gangs. Nevertheless, Skarbek maintains that norms that govern small communities, can also govern illegal markets such as those operated by prison gangs.

== List of American prison gangs ==
=== Hispanic prison gangs ===

'''[[Mexican Mafia|La Eme or the Mexican Mafia]]:''' (Blue) "Eme" is the Spanish name of the letter "M," and it is the 13th letter in the alphabet. The Mexican Mafia is composed mostly of Hispanics, although there are some Caucasian members. The Mexican Mafia and the Aryan Brotherhood are allies. They work together to control prostitution, drug-running, weapons, and "hits" or murders. Eme was originally formed in the 1956 in the Deuel Vocational Institute.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skarbek|first=David|date=2011|title=Governance and prison gangs|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|pages=702–716|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Hispanic prisoners from the southern part of that state. It has traditionally been composed of US-born and US-raised Hispanics and has retained ties to the Southern California-based "Sureños." During the 1970s and 1980s, Eme in California established the model of leveraging its power in prison to control and profit from criminal activity on the street. The gangs activities fall into two categories: conventional crimes - distributing drugs, robbery, and murder, and illicit market exchange - protecting property, enforcing agreements, and handling disputes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''[[Nuestra Familia]]:''' (Red) (family" in Spanish) "N," the 14th letter in the alphabet, along with the Roman numeral "XIV" is the symbol Nuestra Familia is another mostly Hispanic prison gang that is constantly at war with La Eme. It was originally formed by Northern-California- or rural-based Hispanic prisoners with ties to "Norteños" of Northern California, opposing domination by La Eme which was started by and associated with Los Angeles gang members. Nuestro Familia was first established California's Soledad Prison in the 1960s.[4]

'''The [[Texas Syndicate]]:''' A mostly Texas-based prison gang that includes mostly Hispanic members and does (albeit rarely) allow Caucasian members. The Texas Syndicate, more than La Eme or Nuestra Familia, has been associated or allied with Mexican immigrant prisoners, while Eme and Familia tend to be composed of and associate with US-born or US-raised Hispanics.

'''[[Ñetas]]:''' A Hispanic (mainly Puerto Rican) gang in Puerto Rico and on the eastern coast of the US. Originally formed in 1970 in Rio Pedras Prison, Puerto Rico.[5]

=== Black prison gangs ===

Most African-American prison gangs retain their street gang names and associations. These commonly include Rollin' sets (named after streets, i.e., Rollin' 30s, Rollin' 40s, etc.) that can identify with either [[Bloods|Blood]] or [[Crips|Crip]] affiliations.

'''The [[Black Guerrilla Family|Black Guerilla Family]]''' represents an exception. It was originally a politically based group with a significant presence in prisons and prison politics. It was founded in 1966 at San Quentin State Prison in California by former Black Panther member George L. Jackson.[6]

'''[[United Blood Nation]]''': An African-American prison gang on the east coast. They are rivals with the Netas and have ties with the Black Guerilla Family.

'''[[Folk Nation]]''': Found in Midwestern and Southern states, allied with Crips, bitter rivals with the People Nation.

'''[[People Nation]]:''' Found in Midwestern and Southern states, allied with Bloods, bitter rivals with the Folk Nation.

'''[[D.C. Blacks]]:''' Founded in Washington D.C. by African-American inmates, are allied with the Black Guerilla Family and United Blood Nation, and enemies to the Aryan Brotherhood and Mexican Mafia.

'''Conservative Vice Lords (CVL):''' A primarily African-American gang that originated in the St. Charles, Illinois Youth Center outside Chicago.[7] In Chicago, CVL operated primarily in the Lawndale section and used profits from drug sales to continue its operations and used prisons to train and recruit new members.[8]

=== White prison gangs ===

'''[[Aryan Brotherhood]]:''' A white prison gang that originated in California's San Quentin Prison amongst white American prisoners in 1964. Its emblem, "the brand," consists of a shamrock and the number 666. Other identifiers include the initials "AB," swastikas and the sigrune.[9] Perhaps out of their ideology and the necessity of establishing a presence among the more numerous Black and Hispanic gang members, the AB has a particular reputation for ruthlessness and violence. Since the 1990s, in part because of this reputation, the AB has been targeted heavily by state and federal authorities. Many key AB members have been moved to "supermax" control-unit prisons at both the federal and state level or are under federal indictment.

'''[[Nazi Lowriders]]:''' A newer white prison gang that emerged after many Aryan Brotherhood members were sent to the Security Housing Unit at Pelican Bay or transferred to federal prisons. NLR is associated with members originally from the Antelope Valley and is known to accept some light-skinned or Caucasian-identified Hispanic members.

'''[[European Kindred]]:''' A white supremacist prison gang founded in Oregon that is affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood and the Ku Klux Klan.

'''[[Confederate Knights of America]]:''' A white supremacist prison gang in Texas that is affiliated with the KKK and the AB.

'''[[Aryan Circle]]:''' A white supremacist prison gang concerned about race before money.

'''[[Dead Man Incorporated]] (DMI):''' A predominantly white prison gang founded in the Maryland Correctional System, with branches in many other correctional facilities throughout the U.S.

'''[[Aryan Brotherhood of Texas]]:''' Despite the similarity of the name, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas (A.B.T.) does not have ties with the original Aryan Brotherhood. Founded in Texas in the 1980s the A.B.T. was created mainly as a criminal enterprise.[10]

'''[[211 Crew|Brotherhood of Aryan Alliance]]''' (a. k. a. the "211's") [11]

== South Africa ==

Prominent prison gangs in South Africa: 26s, 27s and 28s, collectively known as the [[The Numbers Gang|Numbers]], originate from a gang called The Ninevites, in the 19th- and early 20th-century. It was born in Johannesburg, and the leader of the Ninevites, "Nongoloza" Mathebula, is said to have created laws for the gang. "Nongoloza" became a supernatural figure and left behind an origin myth that shapes the current laws of the Numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Jonny. "Nongoloza's Children: Western Cape Prison Gangs during and after Apartheid." Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation. Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, July 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gangs began to project outside the prison system starting in 1990, as globalization led to South Africa's illicit markets seeing the rise of large drug trafficking gangs. The Americans and the Firm, the two largest super gangs outside of prison made alliances with Numbers gangs. They imported imagery, laws, and parts of the Numbers's initiation system. Membership in these gangs is not determined by race as it is with US prison gangs, however, initiation is still a costly and violent process, sometimes involving sexual hazing.

The 26s, 27s, 28s by means of robbery, murder, extortion, brigandage, of their own culture, their own religious beliefs create a tradition handed down from generation to generation, which continues to exist to this day. They are the historically illegal group of individuals who united in gangs with numeric values mentioned above. They are formed a tradition located in South Africa and called South African criminal tradition originated in Southern Africa 200 years ago according to the official history, and it differs from other traditions with the case that it came first in the wild and then in prison, because most of other criminal traditions originated inside the prison.

=== Differences from other gangs ===

* They have a special '''cult of Counter God''' which is called '''the Ninevites'''
* '''Special rules''' divided from the legend of '''Nongoloza Mathebula''' that set the rules of life of 26s, 27s and 28s 
* They have a special '''cult of knife''' which they use as a form of punishment and execution. There are two kind of knives: the long and the short one. The short one is used for punishes and the long one is used for executions.
* They have a '''special combat system''' with a knife.
* They have a '''special language – sabela.'''
* They use a '''forced education''' of their adherents. 
* There is a hopelessness of the situation that creates a '''special religion'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Heather Parker: God's gangsters: The numbers, gangs and South African tattoo prison culture (Ihilihili press, Cape Town, 2006). - {{ISBN|1-920103-01-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brazil ==

The [[Primeiro Comando da Capital]] (or the PCC) is a Brazilian prison gang based in São Paulo. The gang rose in 1993 at a soccer game at Taubate Penitentiary to fight for prisoners' rights in the aftermath of the 1992 [[Carandiru massacre|Carandiru Massacre]], when São Paulo state military police killed more than 100 inmates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hanson, Stephanie. "Brazil's Powerful Prison Gang." ''Council on Foreign Relations''. Council on Foreign Relations, 26 Sept. 2006. Web. 08 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The gang orchestrated rebellions in 29 São Paulo state prisons simultaneously in 2001, and since then it has caught the attention of the public for ensuing waves of violence. The Brazilian police and media estimate that at least 6,000 members pay monthly dues and are thus a base part of the organization. According to São Paulo Department of Investigation of Organized Crime, more than 140,000 prisoners are under their control in São Paulo.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The gang does not allow mugging, rape, extortion, or the use of the PCC to resolve personal conflicts. It maintains a strict hierarchy, led by Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho. All members inside and outside are required to pay taxes. Members can be soldiers, towers (gang leaders in particular prisons), or pilots (who specialize in communications). The PCC has strong ties with the Red Command, Rio's most powerful drug-trafficking organization which is rumored to supply them with cocaine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Policy implications ==

Political scientist Benjamin Lessing predicts that crackdowns and harsher carceral sentences will increase prison gangs' control of outside actors, and that beyond a point, these policies limit state power. Lessing states, "the harsher, longer, and more likely a prison sentence, the more incentives outside affiliates have to stay on good terms with imprisoned leaders, and hence the greater the prison gangs' coercive power over those who anticipate prison."&lt;ref&gt;Lessing, Benjamin. "How to Build a Criminal Empire from Behind Bars: Prison Gangs and Projection of Power *." (n.d.): n. pag. IZA Logo Institute for the Study of Labor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3543">'''Raaphi (Raaphy, Rafi, Raphael, Rafael) Joseph Arie Persitz''' (26 July 1934 – 4 February 2009) was an English–Israeli–Swiss [[chess]] [[Chess master|master]], financial analyst, financial journalist, and chess writer. Persitz was [[Israeli Chess Championship|Israeli Junior Champion]] in 1951. He was born in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, then British Mandate of Palestine.
He studied at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and represented [[Oxford University]] in the annual match against [[Cambridge University]] on three occasions (1954, 1955 and 1956). In 1954 he won his individual game in the Oxford-Cambridge match in the morning, playing very quickly in order to be able to travel by train to [[Swindon]] (some 75 miles away) in time to play top board for his county ([[Oxfordshire]]) against [[Gloucestershire]] in the afternoon. He was paired against a former British champion, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander]], and managed to win this game as well.&lt;ref&gt;''[[British Chess Magazine]]'', May 1954, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Persitz played three times for England in the World Student Team Chess Championship.
* In 1954, at second board in 1st WST-ch in [[Oslo]] (+6 −0 =3);
* In 1956, at first board in 3rd WST-ch in [[Uppsala]] (+3 −1 =6);
* In 1957, at first board in 4th WST-ch in [[Reykjavík]] (+3 −6 =4).
He won the individual gold medal at Oslo 1954.

Persitz moved from the UK to [[Israel]], and then to [[Switzerland]]. He played for Israel at fourth board in [[14th Chess Olympiad]] at [[Leipzig]] 1960 (+6 −4 =2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olimpbase.org/players/m0uees2f.html Raaphi Persitz team chess record] at olimpbase.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1955/56, he tied for 6-7th in [[Hastings International Chess Congress|Hastings]] ([[Viktor Korchnoi]] and [[Friðrik Ólafsson]] won). In 1958, he played in [[Haifa]] / [[Tel Aviv]] ([[Samuel Reshevsky]] won). In 1961, he tied for 7-8th in [[Netanya]] ([[Moshe Czerniak]], [[Milan Matulović]] and [[Petar Trifunović]] won).&lt;ref&gt;[http://netanyachess.com/en_ev/ev_Netanya1961.htm International tournament, Netanya 1961&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968/69, he tied for 8-10th in Hastings ([[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Svetozar Gligorić]] won).

He was also a prolific and entertaining chess writer, contributing articles to a long-running column in ''[[British Chess Magazine]]'' entitled ''The Student's Corner''.

The '''Koch Rajbongshi (Koch)''', also known as '''Rajbangshi, Koch-Rajbangshi, Rangpuri''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoplegroups.org/explore/groupdetails.aspx?peid=48713|title=PEOPLE NAME: RANGPURI OF BANGLADESH|date=3 April 2018|website=PeopleGroups.org|publisher=International Mission Board, SBC.|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are one of the indigenous Assamese ethnic group living in [[Assam]],[[Northeast India]]. They belongs to Tibeto-Burmese ethnic group inhabiting parts of [[Assam]], northern [[West Bengal]], and some pockets on the eastern parts of [[Nepal]], [[Bihar]], [[Bhutan]] and northern Bangladesh. They are recognised as [[Other Backward Class|OBC]] in the state of [[Assam]] as Koch-Rajbangshi, [[Schedule Tribe|ST]] in the state of Meghalaya as Koch and [[Schedule Caste|SC]] in the state of [[West Bengal]] as Rajbanshi. Etymologically, the term 'Rajbongshi'; which derives from [[Kamtapuri language|Kamtapuri,]] of the [[Magadhi Prakrit]] sub-group; means 'Descendant of the king' ('''''Raj'''= King; '''Bongshi'''= descendant of''). The Rajbongshi or Koch Rajbongshi Tribe were ethnically and culturally related to the same Koch Dynasty who ruled their land, and vice versa{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, i.e., the [[Koch dynasty]] of Assam, northern Bengal, and Rangpur Part.

== Etymology ==
Etymologically, the term 'Rajbongshi'; which derives from [[Kamtapuri language|Kamtapuri,]] of the [[Magadhi Prakrit]] sub-group; means 'Descendant of the king' ('''''Raj'''= King; '''Bongshi'''= descendant of''). The Rajbongshi or Koch Rajbongshi Tribe were ethnically and culturally related to the same Koch Dynasty who ruled their land, and vice versa, i.e., the [[Koch dynasty]] of Assam, northern Bengal, Rangpur Part. Many however trace this etymological relation to the dynasties prior to that of the Kochs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Koch Kingdom: 1515-1615|last=Nath|first=D.|publisher=Mittal Publications|year=1989|isbn=|location=Delhi|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Assam the Koches are officially recognized by the Government of Assam as'Koch-Rajbongshi', in West Bengal they are known as Rajbanshi and in Nepal they are known as Rajbanshi and officially recognized as Adivashi.

== Origins ==
The origin of Koch Rajbongshi (Koch) dates back to the Vedas as stated by the Koch Scholar and Koch Ratna Sibendra Narayan Koch. The Koches were the ruler of the Kamarupa Kingdom{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and followed by the Koch Dynasty, Kamatapur Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
In the Historical Book "THe Cooch Behar State and its Land Revenue Settlements" Published by the Koch King of "Cooch Behar State" in the Year 1903, clearly states that Koch and the Rajvanshi are of Koch Origin and Rajvanshi or Koch is the same community of the State. A wide literature are available of the Koch Rajbongshi which were documented by the Koch King and their Princely State, however, their present homeland ranges from [[Pragjyotisha Kingdom|Pragjyotisha]], [[Pundravardhana|Pundra]] and [[Kamarupa]] in various ancient texts like [[Vishnu Purana]], [[Kalika Purana]], [[Harivamsa]], [[Yogini Tantra]], Bhramari tantra, and even in the great epics like the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. References are also found in the later texts from the medieval times like the  and . It is from such sources that the local traditions and myths about Koch Rajbongshi history developed. The very first proper ethnographic details were documented by Colonial ethnographers of erstwhile [[British Raj|British empire]], who aimed at 'scientifically' documenting various caste and tribal groups. [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Buchanan-Hamilton]] suggested that the Rajbanshi or Koch had a common ethnic origin and are from the same Old Koch Stock and when the Old Koch converted to Hinduism they were termed as either Rajbanshi or Koch Rajbongshi which was established since the time of the Koch King of Koch Dynasty.
The indigenous, aboriginal and traditional Koch-Rajbangshi people are spread across Assam, Meghalaya, North Bengal, Bihar within India and is also present in Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, and can be safely called the largest trans-border ethnic community of South Asia. And even though the emergence of modern nation states have divided this group of people, across provinces and nations, yet their shared history, past imagination and many commonalities still tie them and the Koch-Rajbongshi (Rajbanshi) people are one of the native peoples of South Asia region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kochrajbanshicentre.org/|title=Origins|last=|first=|date=25 June 2018|website=CKRSD|publisher=CKRSD.|archive-url=https://kochrajbanshicentre.org/|archive-date=9 September 2017|dead-url=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are spread mainly in the districts of [[Kamrup]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, [[Kokrajhar]], [[Bongaigaon]], [[Goalpara district|Goalpara]] and [[Dhubri district]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of Assam; Meghalaya; [[Cooch Behar district|Cooch Behar]], [[Jalpaiguri district|Jalpaiguri]], [[Uttar Dinajpur district|Uttar Dinajpur]], [[Dakshin Dinajpur district|Dakshin Dinajpur]], [[Darjeeling district|Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]]. Substantial small amount of Koch-Rajbongshi population can also be found in the [[Malda district]] of West Bengal, [[Purnia district]] of Bihar, the [[Jhapa District]] of Nepal and [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]], [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur District]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of Bangladesh.

== About Kamatapur ==
Kamatapur is a historical and cultural region of South Asia, comprising present areas of Northeast India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. The Koch Rajbanshi people of South Asia, particular Northeast India consider themselves as Kamatapuri, since the historical memory of the Kamatapur is still alive in their imagination and they continue to protect and preserve the Kamatapuri culture, language and art despite many challenges. In the mid of the 13th century Sandhya Rai established the Kamrup Kamata Kingdom comprising areas of present North Bengal, Lower Assam and some areas of present Bangladesh. The Kamrup Kamata kingdom was the continuation of the old powerful Kamrup Kingdom. Kamrup Kamata Kingdom went through various ups and downs in its seven hundred years of existence (1250 to 1950). It also went through various names i.e. Kamata, Koch Kamata, Koch Country, Behar and Koch (Cooch) Behar. Kamata alias Cooch Behar became a princely State of British India. After the Independence of India Cooch Behar joined Indian domain in 1948. In 1950 Cooch Behar was declared a District of West Bengal. Some important areas of the old Kamata Kingdom, like Bijni estate, Gauripur estate and Beltola Kingdom became part of present Assam and Rangpur became part of present Bangladesh. The traditional and historical identify of Kamatapur and the Kamatapuri people were lost in the post-independent scenario as both were adjusted in new political and cultural identities of the Indian sub continent. There has been a series of movements since the early of 20th century for the cultural and political recognition of the Kamatapuri identity. However, very little attempt had been made to preserve and document the art, culture, history and literature of Kamatapur and the Kamatapuris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamatapur.com/history/|title=History of Kamatapur|last=Das|first=Arup J|date=|website=http://www.kamatapur.com/history/|publisher=CKRSD.|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Kamatapur ==
The history of Kamatapur is not properly represented in the modern day historical writings. Unfortunately, it's not part of any post colonial nationalistic history of the Indian sub continent. The history of Kamatapur is partial history of present West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Meghalaya of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. The disappearance of Kamatapur as a region and emergence of Assamese and Bengali, two language based nationalism is the main reason behind the neglect of the History of Kamatapur. However, a glimpses into the pages of history books, particularly Assam, tells the rich and colourful history of Kamatapur without any doubt. Kamatapur is the other name of ancient Kamrup kingdom, medieval Kamrup Kamata or Koch Kamata kingdom and the native Koch Bihar (Cooch Behar) State of British India. When the kingdom of Kamrup of South Asia was invaded by Tughril Khan Malik Yuzbeg, the capital of the kingdom was transferred from Kamrup Nagar (North Guwahati) to Kamatapur (Koch Behar). From that time onward this kingdom was known as Kamata or Kamrup-Kamata Kingdom. At that time the Kingdom of Kamata comprised areas of Assam and undivided Bengal. Kamata was ruled by different rulers of different dynasties from the period of mid 13th century to 15th century, until the rise of the Koch Dynasty. Being at the entry point of present Northeast India the Kingdom of Kamata had to face the invaders coming from both Indian and Bhutan side. An attack on Kamata by Sultan Barbak in the mid 15th century was resisted by the then ruler of Kamatapur Chakradhvaj. Later at the end 15th Century during the reign of Nilambar (Son of Chakradhvaj), the Kingdom was attacked by the ruler of Bengal (Gaura), Hussain Shah. Hussain Shah destroyed the capital Kamatapur and established an Afghan colony over there. The people and the Bhuyans (Land Lords) of Kamata united under the able leadership of Bishwa Singha, an ambitious Koch youth from present Kokrajhar of Assam and throne way the Afghan colony from Kamatapur. Bishwa Singha established the Koch Dynasty in Kamatapur in the early of 16th Century and brought political stability in the Kamrup Kamata region. After Bishwa Singha, his elder son Nara Singha ruled Kamata for a while till his bother Naranaryan ascended the throne. Narnarayan, with the help of his bother Chilarai (also Minister and Commander in chief of the Koch Kamata Army) established the Koch sovereignty almost on entire Northeast Indian Kingdoms (Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Khasi, Jayantiya etc.) and established cordial relationship with the Mughal. This period of Koch rule is regarded as golden period in the history of the region since many valuable literary works were completed under the patronage of Narnarayan. Sankardev, the great scholar and saint of that time composed most of his major work under the patronage of these two brothers. After the death of Chilarai, Kamata Kingdom was split into two parts between Raghudev Narayan, son of Chilarai and Naranaryan as Koch Kamata (also Koch Behar) and Koch Hajo (Kamrup). The partition weakened the power of the Koches. The Koch Hajo Kingdom suffered several partitions in the later period and smaller kingdoms like Bijni, Darang and Beltola emerged from Koch Hajo. The Koch Kamata or the Koch Behar Kingdom became smaller and lost its sovereignty to the Mughals of India. It should be mentioned here that the independent minded Koches always tried to retain there sovereignty . In 1773, during the rule of Dharmendra Narayan Koch Behar came under the British India by a treaty were British agreed to drive away the Bhutiyas from the Kingdom. Thus Kamrup Kamata Kingdom became a princely state of British India. The territories were gradually lost to the British due to various conspiracy and politics and when Koch Behar joined the Indian Domain in 28 August 1949 it was only a symbolic version of the vast Kamrup Kamta kingdom of 16th century. It was hoped that Koch Behar would soon became an Indian state like other princely states of British India, but unfortunately Koch Behar was merged as a District of present West Bengal of India, despite opposition from the people of Koch Behar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamatapur.com/history/|title=History of Kamatapur|last=Arup J|first=Das|date=|website=|publisher=CKRSD.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifestyle and culture ==
The Koch Rajbongshi community had traditionally been a largely agricultural community, cultivating mainly rice, pulses and maize. Rice is the staple food for the majority of the population. Even in the 21st century, a large portion of this community still adhere to a rural lifestyle, though urbanization is on constant rise. The food consumed and the diet pattern is similar to all the Koches of Assam, West Bengal, Nepal, Bangladesh, Meghalaya. Rice and Pulses are consumed on regular basis along with vegetables and ''bhajis'' (fries- mainly potatoes).  Typical is the ''Dhékir sāg'' and ''naphā sāg,'' two types of vegetable preparation, mostly boiled with very little added oil, out of newly-born shoots of fern leaves. In lower Assam, a vegetable preparation of bamboo shoots is also consumed. Consumption of stale rice or ''pantha bhāt'' is common within Koch Rajbongshi. Cooking is mainly done using mustard oil, though sunflower oil is sometimes used. As far as non-vegetarian foods are concerned, the Koch Rajbongshi population consumes a large amount of meat and eggs unlike other neighborhood populations from Bengal region, who consume large amount of fish. Goat meat and sheep (if available) is generally consumed, and consumption of fowl meat is discouraged, especially by the older generations, though such barriers now cease to exist. Eggs of Ducks and poultry are consumed. Fish is also consumed but not in very large number. The rivers of northern Bengal does not sustain large varieties of fishes because of its non-perennial nature. However, in lower Assam areas, large rivers like the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] sustain large varieties of fish which becomes an important part of the dietary habit of the Koch Rajbongshi living there.
A typical Koch Rajbongshi home is essentially  of rectangular pattern, with an open space (aṅgina) in the middle. This is done mostly for protection against both wild animals and strong winds. The north side holds the betel nut and fruit gardens, the west contains Bamboo gardens while the east and the south is generally left open to allow sunshine and air penetrate into the household. Koch Rajbongshi traditional attires are mainly Patani, Agran, Angsha, Chadar, Dhoti and various other traditional costumes being weaved at their traditional hand loom in their home. The traditional clothing for men is ''Angsha and'' Jama or inners, while for women is bukuni-patani; Agran; Angsha; Chadar a piece of cloth tied around the chest that extends up to the knee. Regarding the traditional attire of the Koch Rajbongshi Tribe, it is clearly mentioned in the Historic Book which was published by the Koch King in 1903, "The Cooch Behar State and its Land Revenue Settlements". The Koch Rajbongshi Tribe has still preserved their age old ethnic attires and are being used on a regular basis as their common costumes, The Koch Rajbongshi (Koch) Tribe prefer to wear their traditional attires in-spite of the fact that the modern costumes are widely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cooch Behar State and its Land Revenue Settlements|last=Chaudhuri|first=Harendra Narayan|publisher=The Cooch Behar State Press|year=1903|location=Princely Cooch Behar State|pages=135|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music forms an integral part of Koch Rajbongshi (Koch) culture. The main musical forms of Koch Rajongshi(Koch) culture are Kamatapuri Folk Song,  [[Bhawaiya|Bhawaiyya]] and Chatka and pala gaan. Various instruments are used for such performances like, string instruments like-dotora, sarindra and bena;double membrane instruments like- tasi, dhak, khol and mridanga; gongs and bells like-kansi, kartal; and wind instruments like- sanai and kupa bansi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rajbansis of North Bengal|last=Sanyal|first=Charu Chandra|publisher=The Asiatic Society|year=1965|isbn=|location=Calcutta|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russians''' ({{lang-ru|русские}}, ''russkiye'') are an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] [[ethnic group]] native to [[Eastern Europe]]. The majority of Russians inhabit the [[nation state]] of [[Russia]], &lt;!--Do not change "nation state" to "sovereign state", if you don't understand why, ask on talk page.--&gt; while notable minorities exist in other former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states such as [[Russians in Belarus|Belarus]], [[Russians in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Russians in Moldova|Moldova]], [[Russians in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and the [[Russians in the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. A large [[Russian diaspora]] also exists all over the world, with notable numbers in the [[Russian Americans|United States]], [[Russians in Germany|Germany]], [[Russians in Israel|Israel]], and [[Russian Canadians|Canada]]. Russians are the most numerous ethnic group in Europe.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The Russians share many cultural traits with other East Slavic ethnic groups, specifically [[Belarusians]] and [[Ukrainians]]. They are predominantly [[Orthodox Christians]] by religion. The [[Russian language]] is official in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Tajikistan]], [[List of territorial entities where Russian is an official language|and also spoken]] as a secondary language in many former Soviet states.

==Ethnonym==
There are two Russian words which are commonly translated into English as "Russians". One is "{{lang|ru|русский}}" (''russkiy''), which most often means "ethnic Russians" (the subject of this article). Another is "{{lang|ru|россияне}}" (''rossiyane''), which means "[[citizens of Russia]]". The former word refers to ethnic Russians, regardless of what country they live in and irrespective of whether or not they hold [[Russian nationality law|Russian citizenship]]. Under certain circumstances this term may or may not extend to denote members of other Russian-speaking ethnic groups from Russia, or from the former Soviet Union. The latter word refers to all people holding citizenship of Russia, regardless of their ethnicity, and does not include ethnic Russians living outside Russia. Translations into other languages often do not distinguish these two groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/63991.html Pravoslavie.ru]. Retrieved 10 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the Russians derives from the [[Rus' people]] (supposedly [[Varangians]]). According to the most prevalent theory, the name ''Rus{{'}}'', like the Finnish name for [[Sweden]] (''Ruotsi''), is derived from an [[Old Norse]] term for "the men who row" (''rods-'') as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of [[Roslagen]] (''Rus-law'') or ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'', as it was known in earlier times.&lt;ref name="Blöndal2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blöndal|first=Sigfús|title=The Varangians of Byzantium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFRug14ui7gC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=2007-04-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521035521|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPC"&gt;The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text Translated by O.

Until the [[1917 revolution]], Russian authorities never called specifically them "Russians", calling them "[[Great Russians]]" instead, a part of "Russians" (all the [[East Slavs]]).

==History==
{{see also|History of Russia}} {{summarize|from|History of Russia|section=y|date=July 2016}}

===Origin===
 {{further information|Rus' people}}
The modern Russians formed from two groups of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes: Northern and Southern. The tribes involved included the [[Krivichs]], [[Ilmen Slavs]], [[Radimichs]], [[Vyatich]]es and [[Severians]]. [[Genetic studies on Russians|Genetic studies show]] that modern Russians do not differ significantly from [[Belarusians]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Some ethnographers, like [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Zelenin]], affirm that Russians are more similar to Belarusians and to Ukrainians than southern Russians are to northern Russians. Russians in northern European Russia share moderate genetic similarities with [[Uralic peoples]],&lt;ref name="2008ydna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/28sep2005/russians.html |title=Новости NEWSru.com :: Ученые завершили масштабное исследование генофонда русского народа (Фотороботы) |publisher=Newsru.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in modern north-central European Russia and were partly assimilated by the [[Slavs]] as the Slavs migrated northeastwards. Such Uralic peoples included the [[Merya]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleksey Uvarov]], "Étude sur les peuples primitifs de la Russie. Les mériens" (1875)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Muromian]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emc.komi.com/01/12/115.htm|script-title=ru:Мурома, мещера|trans-title=Murom, Meschera|language=ru|work=emc.komi.com|deadurl=y|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523200115/http://www.emc.komi.com/01/12/115.htm |archivedate=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory of Russia has been inhabited since 2nd Millennium BCE by Indo-European, Ural-Altaic, and various other peoples, however, it is not much known about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia/History#ref979851|title=Russia - History|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside archaeological remains, little is known about the predecessors to Russians in general prior to 859 AD when the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' starts its records.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Primary Chronicle'' is a history of the Ancient Rus' from around 850 to 1110, originally compiled in Kiev about 1113&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought{{by whom|date=July 2014}} that by 600 AD, the [[Slavs]] had split linguistically into [[South Slavs|southern]], [[West Slavs|western]], and eastern branches. The eastern branch settled between the [[Southern Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]] Rivers in present-day [[Ukraine]]; from the 1st century AD through almost the turn of the millennium, they spread peacefully northward to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region, forming the [[Dregovichs|Dregovich]], [[Radimichs|Radimich]] and [[Vyatichs|Vyatich]] Slavic tribes on the Baltic substratum, and therefore experiencing changed language features such as [[Vowel reduction in Russian|vowel reduction]]. Later, both [[Belarusians]] and South Russians formed on this ethnic linguistic ground.&lt;ref name="pivtorak"&gt;Pivtorak. Formation and dialectal differenciaton of the Old Rus language. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 6th century onwards, another group of Slavs moved from [[Pomerania]] to the northeast of the [[Baltic Sea]], where they encountered the [[Varangians]] of the [[Rus' Khaganate]] and established the important regional center of [[Novgorod]]. The same Slavic ethnic population also settled the present-day [[Tver Oblast]] and the region of [[Beloozero]]. With the Uralic substratum, they formed the tribes of the [[Krivichs]] and of the [[Ilmen Slavs]].

===Kievan Rus'===
{{main article|Kievan Rus'}} 
[[Kievan Rus']] was a loose federation of states that existed from the late 9th to the mid-13th century. Modern Russians derive their name and cultural ancestry from Kievan Rus'.

===Russia===
{{see also|Demographics of Russia}}
Roughly 111 million ethnic Russians live in [[Russia]], 80% of whom live in the European part of Russia, and 20% in the Asian part of the country.

===Former Soviet states===
{{main article|Ethnic Russians in post-Soviet states}} [[File:Russians ethnic 94.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|Ethnic Russians in former Soviet Union states in 1994]]

After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] an estimated 25 million Russians began living outside of the Russian Federation, most of them in the former [[Soviet Republics]].

===Diaspora===
{{Main article|Russian diaspora}}
Ethnic Russians historically migrated throughout the area of former [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union]], sometimes encouraged to re-settle in borderlands by the Tsarist and later Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia]. BBC News. November 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On some occasions ethnic Russian communities, such as [[Lipovans]] who settled in the [[Danube delta]] or [[Doukhobor]]s in [[Canada]], emigrated as religious dissidents fleeing the central authority.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]] starting in 1917, many Russians were forced to leave their homeland fleeing the [[Bolshevik]] regime, and millions became refugees. Many [[white emigre|white émigrés]] were participants in the [[White movement]], although the term is broadly applied to anyone who may have left the country due to the change in regime.
[[File:Вилково, Дунайские плавни 1962 г.JPG|thumb|[[Lipovans]] in the [[Danube delta]]]]

Today the largest ethnic Russian diasporas outside Russia live in former Soviet states such as [[Ukraine]] (about 8 million), [[Kazakhstan]] (about 3.8 million), [[Belarus]] (about 785,000), [[Latvia]] (about 520,000) with the most Russian settlement out of the [[Baltic States]] which includes [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]], [[Uzbekistan]] (about 650,000) and [[Kyrgyzstan]] (about 419,000).

Over a million [[Russian Jews]] emigrated to [[Israel]] during and after the [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|Refusenik]] movements; some brought ethnic Russian relatives along with them. Over a million Russian-speaking immigrants live in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=59 |title=Study: Soviet immigrants outperform Israeli students |accessdate=2006-06-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619001321/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=59 |archivedate=19 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. April 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Central European nations such as [[Germany]] and [[Poland]], as well Russians settled in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Australia]]. These communities may identify themselves either as Russians or citizens of these countries, or both, to varying degrees.

People who had arrived in [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] during the Soviet era, including their descendants born in these countries, mostly Russians, became [[Statelessness|stateless]] after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and were provided only with an option to acquire naturalised citizenship. The language issue is still contentious, particularly in Latvia, where ethnic Russians have protested against plans to liquidate education in minority languages, including Russian. Since 1992, Estonia has naturalized some 137,000 residents of undefined citizenship, mainly ethnic Russians. 136,000, or 10 percent of the total population, remain without citizenship. Both the [[European Union]] and the [[Council of Europe]], as well as the [[Russian government]], expressed their concern during the 1990s about minority rights in several countries, most notably [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]. In [[Moldova]], the [[Transnistria]] region (where 30.4% of population is Russian) broke away from government control amid fears the country would soon reunite with [[Romania]]. In June 2006, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] announced the plan to introduce a national policy aiming at encouraging ethnic Russians to immigrate to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bigg |first=Claire |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1070573.html |title=Latvia: Ethnic Russians Divided On Moscow's Repatriation Scheme |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eglise notre dame de l assomption 7.jpg|thumb|[[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]] in Paris, the resting place of many eminent [[White émigré|Russian émigrés]] after 1917]]
Significant numbers of Russians emigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States]]. [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn]] and [[South Beach, Staten Island]] in [[New York City]] is an example of a large community of recent Russian and [[Russian Jews|Jewish Russian]] immigrants. Other examples are [[Sunny Isles Beach]], a northern suburb of [[Miami]], and in [[West Hollywood]] of the [[Los Angeles]] area.

At the same time, many ethnic Russians from former Soviet territories have emigrated to Russia itself since the 1990s. Many of them became refugees from a number of states of [[Central Asia]] and [[Caucasus]] (as well as from the separatist [[Chechen Republic]]), forced to flee during political unrest and hostilities towards Russians.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, many Russians who were identified with the [[White army]] moved to [[China]]&amp;nbsp;— most of them settling in [[Harbin]] and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/21/style/21iht-shang.t.html The Ghosts of Russia That Haunt Shanghai]". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 21 September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, Harbin had 100,000 Russians. Many of these Russians had to move back to the Soviet Union after [[World War II]]. Today, a large group of people in northern China can still speak Russian as a second language.

[[Ethnic Russians in China|Russians (''eluosizu'')]] are one of the [[Nationalities of China|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]] (as ''the Russ''); there are approximately 15,600 Russian Chinese living mostly in northern [[Xinjiang]], and also in [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Heilongjiang]].

==Culture==

[[File:Ivan Bilibin 025.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', by [[Ivan Bilibin]]. Russian fairy tale collected by [[Alexander Afanasyev]] in ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]''.]]
Russian culture originated from that of the [[East Slavs]], who were largely [[polytheists]], and had a specific way of life in the wooded areas of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Northern Europe]]. The [[Scandinavia]]n [[Vikings]], or ''[[Varangians]]'', also took part in forming the Russian identity and state in the early [[Kievan Rus']] period of the late 1st millennium AD. The [[Rus' people|Rus']] [[Christianization of the Kievan Rus'|accepted Christianity]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 988, and this largely defined Russian culture for the [[Millennium of Russia|next millennium]], namely as a synthesis of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Byzantine]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;{{cite web|last=excerpted from Glenn E.

For most of the 20th century, [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]] shaped the [[Soviet culture|culture of the Soviet Union]], where Russia, i.e. the [[Russian SFSR]], was the largest and leading part.

[[Russian culture]] is varied and unique in many respects. It has a rich history and a long tradition in all of the arts,&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|title=Russia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in fields of [[Russian literature|literature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564269/Russian_Literature.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820090445/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564269/Russian_Literature.html|archivedate=2009-08-20|title=Russian Literature|last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian philosophy|philosophy]], [[Music of Russia|classical music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia::Music|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2009-10-05|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia/38636/Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petersburgcity.com/news/culture/2005/11/18/theatre/|title=A Tale of Two Operas|publisher=Petersburg City|accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian ballet|ballet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garafola, L|title=Diaghilev's Ballets Russes|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=576|isbn=0-19-505701-5|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian architecture|architecture]] and [[Russian visual arts|painting]], [[Russian cinema|cinema]]&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia::Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian animation|animation]], all of which had considerable influence on world culture.

[[Russian literature]] is known for such notable writers as [[Aleksandr Pushkin]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Andrei Platonov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], and [[Varlam Shalamov]]. Russians also gave the [[classical music]] world some very famous composers, including [[Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] and his contemporaries, the [[Mighty Handful]], including [[Modest Mussorgsky]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. In the 20th-century Russian music was credited with such influential composers as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Igor Stravinski]], [[Georgy Sviridov]], and [[Alfred Schnittke]].

'''Russian''' (&lt;span class="unicode audiolink"&gt;{{lang|ru|[[:Media:Ru-russkiy jizyk.ogg|русский язык]]}}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="metadata audiolinkinfo"&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikipedia:Media help|help]]·[[:File:Ru-russkiy jizyk.ogg|info]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, [[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]]: ''{{transl|ru|ALA|Russkiy yazyk}}'', {{IPA-ru|ˈruskʲɪj jɪˈzɨk|}}) is the most geographically widespread language of [[Eurasia]] and the most widely spoken of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages. Russian belongs to the family of [[Indo-European languages]] and is one of three (or, according to some authorities{{who|date=September 2012}}, four) living members of the [[East Slavic languages]], the others being [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]].

Examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onwards, and while Russian preserves much of East Slavonic grammar and a [[Proto-Slavic language|Common Slavonic]] word base, modern Russian exhibits a large stock of borrowed international vocabulary for politics, science, and technology.

[[File:Gorskii 04421u.jpg|thumb|A group of Russian children, 1909. [[Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky|Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]].]]
Russian has [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatal]] [[secondary articulation]] of [[consonant]]s, the so-called ''soft'' and ''hard'' sounds. This distinction is found in most consonant [[phoneme]]s and is one of the most distinguishing features of the language. Another important aspect is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] of [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] [[vowel]]s, not unlike a similar process in [[English language|English]]. Stress in Russian is often described as "unpredictable": it can fall on almost any syllable, and this is one of the difficult aspects for foreign language learners.

Due to the status of the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[super power]], Russian gained a great political importance in the second half of the 20th century. It is one of the [[United Nations#Languages|official languages]] of the [[United Nations]]. All astronauts working in the International Space Station are required to master Russian.

According to data published in the journal «Language Monthly» (№ 3, 1997), approximately 300 million people around the world at the time mastered the Russian language (making it the 5th most popular language in the world by total number of speakers), while 160 million considered Russian their native language (making it the 7th in the world by number of native speakers). The total number of Russian speakers in the world in the 1999 assessment was about 167 million, with about 110 million people speaking Russian as a second language.

Prior to 1991, Russian was the language of international communication of the USSR and the most common foreign language taught in schools in the countries of the Eastern Bloc in Central Europe. It continues to be used in the countries that were formerly parts of the Soviet Union, both as the mother tongue of a significant percentage of the population, and as a language of international communication. While for various reasons residents of these countries might be unwilling to openly identify with Russian language, a major sociological study on the Russian language in the post-Soviet states conducted by Gallup, Inc., revealed that 92% of the survey respondents in Belarus, 83% in Ukraine, 68% in Kazakhstan and 38% in Kyrgyzstan chose Russian-language forms to complete the questionnaire for the survey (most notably, over forms in corresponding national languages).

In the U.S. state of New York in 2009, an amendment to the electoral law was adopted, according to which in all cities in the state having over a million people, all documents related to the election process should be translated into Russian (thus gaining equal status with Spanish, Korean, Filipino, Creole languages and three [[varieties of Chinese]]).

In places of compact residence of immigrants from the countries of the former USSR (Israel, Germany, Canada, the United States, Australia, etc.) Russian-language periodicals, radio and television channels are available, as well as Russian-language schools.

===Religion===
{{Main article|Russian Orthodox Church|Religion in Russia}} [[File:RedSquare SaintBasile (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on the [[Red Square]], [[Moscow]]]]
As of a different sociological surveys on religious adherence, from 41% to over 80% of the total population of [[Russia]] adhere to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref name="ArenaAtlas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Filina"&gt;Olga Filina (Ogonek Magazine).

It has played a vital role in the development of Russian national identity. In other countries Russian faithful usually belong to the local Orthodox congregations which either have a direct connection (like the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[Autonomy (Eastern Christianity)|autonomous]] from the [[Patriarch of Moscow|Moscow Patriarchate]]) or historical origin (like [[the Orthodox Church in America]] or a [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]]) with the Russian Orthodox Church.

Non-religious Russians may associate themselves with the Orthodox faith for cultural reasons. Some Russian people are [[Old Believers]]: a relatively small [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] group of the Russian Orthodoxy that rejected the liturgical reforms introduced in the 17th century. Other schisms from Orthodoxy include [[Doukhobor]]s which in the 18th century rejected secular government, the Russian Orthodox priests, icons, all church ritual, the Bible as the supreme source of divine revelation and the divinity of Jesus, and later emigrated into Canada. An even earlier sect were [[Molokan]]s which formed in 1550 and rejected Czar's [[Divine right of kings|divine right to rule]], icons, the [[Trinity]] as outlined by the [[Nicene Creed]], Orthodox [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek-Catholicism|fasts]], military service, and practices including [[Baptism|water baptism]].

Other world religions have negligible representation among ethnic Russians. The largest of these groups are [[Islam]] with over 100,000 followers from national minorities,&lt;ref name="ArenaAtlas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sreda.org/arena/arena-v-pdf|title=Арена|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Baptists]] with over 85,000 Russian adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_639.html |title=statistics |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are mostly [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Lutherans]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] various new religious movements have sprung up and gathered a following among ethnic Russians. The most prominent of these are [[Slavic Neopaganism|Rodnovery]], the revival of the Slavic native religion also common to other [[Slavs|Slavic nations]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor Shnirelman. ''[http://legacy.wlu.ca/documents/6483/Christians_Go_home.pdf "Christians! Go home": A Revival of Neo-Paganism between the Baltic Sea and Transcaucasia]''. Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Another movement, very small in comparison to other new religions, is [[Vissarion (Russian mystic)|Vissarionism]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] group with an Orthodox Christian background.

==Notable achievements==

Russians have greatly contributed to the fields of [[Sports in Russia|sports]], [[Science and technology in Russia|science and technology]], [[Politics of Russia|politics]], business, and the arts.

In science and technology, notable Russian [[List of Russian scientists|scientists]] include [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] (inventor and designer of the [[AK-47 assault rifle]] and [[PK machine gun]]), [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] (a founding father of rocketry and astronautics), [[Andrei Kolmogorov]], [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Nikolai Semyonov]], [[Dmitri Ivanenko]], [[Alexander Lodygin]], [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]] (one of inventors of [[radio]]), [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]], [[Alexander Prokhorov]] and [[Nikolay Basov]] (co-inventors of [[laser]]), [[Vladimir Zworykin]], [[Lev Pontryagin]], [[Sergei Sobolev]], [[Pavel Yablochkov]], [[Aleksandr Butlerov]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]], [[Sergey Korolyov]] and [[Mstislav Keldysh]] (creators of the [[Soviet space program]]), [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]], [[Andrei Tupolev]], [[Yuri Denisyuk]] (the first practicable method of [[holography]]), [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], [[Pyotr Kapitsa]], [[Igor Sikorsky]], [[Ludvig Faddeev]], [[Konstantin Novoselov]], [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]], and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]].

The first man in space, [[Yuri Gagarin]], was a Russian, and the first [[artificial satellite]] to be put into [[outer space]], [[Sputnik 1]], was launched by the [[Soviet Union]] and was developed mainly by Russian aerospace engineer [[Sergey Korolyov]].

[[Russian Literature]] representatives like [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], and many more, reached a high status in world [[literature]]. Prominent Russian novelists such as Tolstoy in particular, were important figures and have remained internationally renowned. Some scholars have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian literature." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 16 July 2007 &lt;[http://www.britannica.com/art/Russian-literature]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian composers]] who reached a high status in the world of [[music]] include [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]].

Russian people played a crucial role in the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]. According to the [[United Kingdom|British]] historian [[Richard Overy]], the Eastern Front included more combat than all the other European fronts combined—the [[Wehrmacht]] suffered 80% to 93% of all of its total World War II combat casualties on the Eastern Front. Russia's casualties in this war were the highest of all nations, and numbered more than 20 million dead (Russians composed 80% of the 26.6 million people lost by the [[USSR]]), which is about half of all World War II casualties and the vast majority of Allied casualties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

"The biggest damage is to my brain. My physical and mental state isn't right. I'm a changed person. I don't laugh or enjoy myself much."

The Guardian reports that Muhammad's first suicide attempt followed a month of solitary confinement in a punishment cell.&lt;ref name=Guardian2003-12-03/&gt;  
Muhammad was not confined there because he had broken any of the camp rules — rather the camp's expansion meant they had run short of ordinary cells.

Muhammad reported having his suicidal impulses treated by involuntary injections with extremely powerful, long-lasting, [[psychoactive drugs]].&lt;ref name=Guardian2003-12-03/&gt;

Muhammad Shah's name is missing from that list.

Bowden described being met by "warmth and elaborate courtesy" by the two released men, who he described as "uneducated, unworldly, and dirt poor".  Bowden believed their accounts that they were rounded up and sold to the Americans by undiscriminating warlords, for a bounty, who didn't care if they were innocent.

On an official list of the captives' departure dates from Guantanamo published in November 2008, his name was published as "Sha Mohammed Alikhel".&lt;ref name=ConsolidatedReleaseList /&gt;

==Claim that he was killed fighting U.S. forces==
On 7 April 2009, the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] drafted a report, published on 27 May 2009, that listed a "Shah Mohammed" as having been "killed while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan". Despite the report, there are tens of thousands of "Shah Mohammeds" in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Dia2009-04-07&gt;

'''Spanish Mexicans''' are citizens or residents of [[Mexico]] who identify as [[Spaniards|Spanish]] as a result of nationality or ancestry.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Spanish immigration to Mexico began in the early 1500s and spans to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico/27384/Ethnic-groups|title=Mexico - History, Geography, Facts, &amp; Points of Interest|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three recognized large-scale Spanish immigration waves to Mexico: the first arrived during the colonial period, the second during the ''Porfiriato'', the third after the Spanish Civil War and the fourth (and current) after the 2008 financial crisis.

The first Spanish settlement was established in February 1519, as a result of the landing of [[Hernán Cortés]] in the [[Yucatan Peninsula]], accompanied by about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons.&lt;ref name=Grunberg&gt;Bernard Grunberg, ''"La folle aventure d'Hernán Cortés''", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1519, Cortés formally claimed the land for the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish crown]], and the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], a key event in the Spanish conquest of modern-day Mexico in general, was completed in 1521.

==Arrival of the Spanish==
{{Main|Spanish conquest of Mexico}}

The social composition of this immigration of the late sixteenth century included both common people, illiterates, and aristocrats with titles of counts and marquises, all of which quickly disintegrated over the [[Mexican territory|territory]].
The discovery of new deposits of various minerals in the central and northern areas (from Sonora to the southern provinces of Mexico) allowed New Spain to gradually occupy a privileged position, especially in the extraction of silver. Mining allowed the development of associated activities such as manufacturing and agriculture, that turned the Bajío regions or the valleys of Mexico and Puebla into prosperous agricultural regions with incipient industrial activity.

In the 16th century, following the military conquest of most of the new continents, perhaps 240,000 Spaniards entered ports in the Americas. They were joined by 450,000 in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |title= The Columbian Mosaic in Colonial America |first= James |last= Axtell |journal= Humanities |date= September–October 1991 |volume= 12 |issue= 5 |pages= 12–18 |accessdate= 2008-10-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517052031/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |archivedate = May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the conquest of [[Mexico]], this region became the principal destination of Spanish colonial settlers in the 16th century. The first Spaniards who arrived in Mexico were soldiers and sailors from [[Extremadura]], [[Andalucía]] and [[La Mancha]] after the [[conquest of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emperadores.es/circuitos/tierra-de-conquistadores|title=Emperadores|website=Emperadores.es|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allspainaccommodation.com/extremadura/extremadura.htm|title=Extremadura, Spain - Accommodation and Travel  Guide - Hotels &amp; Paradores - Rural Tourism|first=|last=Anne|website=Allspainaccommodation.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 16th century both commoner and aristocrat from Spain were migrating to Mexico. Also, a few Canarian families emigrated to Mexico in the 17th century (as in the case of the Azuaje families) and  when the Spanish crown encouraged Canarian emigration to the Americas through the ''Tributo de sangre'' (Blood Tribute) in the 18th century, many of them settled in Yucatán, where by the 18th century they controlled the trade network that distributed goods throughout the peninsula; their descendants are still counted among the most influential families of direct Spanish descent in Mexico. During the 20th century, another group of Canarians settled in Mexico in the early 1930s, and as with Galician and other Spanish immigrants of the time, there were high rates of illiteracy and impoverishment among them, but they adapted relatively quickly.

==History==
After of the independence of Mexico, a racism emerged against Spanish people in this new nation; in August 1827 to 1834, by the decree issued during the government of Lorenzo de Zavala, that expelled many Spaniards from the [[State of Mexico]] and killed Spanish families. The state government, influenced by English masons or Yorkers, based on the [[Plan of Iguala]] and [[Treaty of Córdoba]], stripped Spaniards of their haciendas, farms, ranches and properties in this state, leading many widows and orphans to flee to other Mexican states.&lt;ref&gt;Estado de México, Textos de su historia, Institute Mora, Mexico State government, Toluca, 1996. pp. 227-230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/600/60056205.pdf Los españoles en el México Independiente] Colegio de México, pp. 624-627&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 1827, was repealed the law Spanish expulsion by state deputies, many Creole families who were in misery, some returned to their farms and ranches protected by state congress deputies.&lt;ref&gt;Estado de México, Textos de su historia, Institute Mora, Mexico State government, Toluca, 1996. pp.230.&lt;/ref&gt; In the constitution of 1857, the ambiguities about Mexican citizens are removed, the Spaniards were recognized foreign people, they no longer recovered the important position during the colonial period.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/600/60056205.pdf Los españoles en el México Independiente] Colegio de México, pp. 620-622&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period 1850-1950, 3.5 million Spanish left for the Americas, and Mexico became one of the chief destinations, in 1876 Mexico establishes relationships with Spain; a second wave was particularly in the Northern region where president [[Porfirio Diaz]] started a campaign of European immigration to supply labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Patricia Rivas |url=http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/yvke/noticia.php?16783 |title=Reconocerán nacionalidad española a descendientes de exiliados :: YVKE Mundial |publisher=Radiomundial.com.ve |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105210817/http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/yvke/noticia.php?16783 |archivedate=2011-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, there were 30,000 Spaniards in Mexico, they participated in economic activities as agricultural labors and trade in urban areas, they could not influence the country's political life.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Most recent migrants came during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. More than 25,000 Spanish refugees settled in Mexico between 1939 and 1942, largely during the administration of President Lazaro Cardenas del Río. Some of the migrants returned to Spain after the civil war, but many more remained in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/firmas/carlos_tello_diaz/Exilio-espanol-Mexico_18_400339968.html|title=Exilio español en México|first=Carlos Tello|last=Díaz|website=Milenio.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Children of Morelia'' was formed in 1937 by 456 Spanish children, Republican's sons, which were brought from Spain in the vapor ship with French flag named Mexique, at the request of the Mexican Assistance Committee by Pueblo Spanish, based in Barcelona city. This children were received by Mexican President Lázaro Cardenas del Río.

Of these refugees is named as soon as "intellectual immigration" or "elite" was made up of approximately 25% of the total. It also notes that also came in greater numbers "factory workers and peasants" as well as soldiers, sailors and pilots, statesmen, economists, and businessmen, all linked to the Republican government defeated in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red-redial.net/doc_adj/4934-exilio-espanol.pdf|format=PDF|title=Exilio Espanol Exhibition|website=Red-redial.et|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[2008 Financial Crisis]] and the resulting economic decline and high unemployment in Spain, many Spaniards have been emigrating to Mexico to seek new opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newamericamedia.org/2013/02/as-spains-economy-worsens-young-adults-flock-to-mexico-for-jobs.php|title=As Spain's Economy Worsens, Young Adults Flock to Mexico for Jobs - New America Media|website=Newamericamedia.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during the last quarter of 2012, a number of 7,630 work permits were granted to Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanielparishflannery/2013/04/30/as-spain-falters-spaniards-look-to-latin-america/|title=As Spain Falters, Spaniards Look to Latin America|first=Nathaniel Parish|last=Flannery|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic and social issues==
The actual Spanish community in Mexico is integrated principally by business men, business women, actors, actresses, academics, artists and professional students, Mexico is now an important country by inversions in Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milenio.com/negocios/FTMercados-Gas_Natural_Fenos-inversionistas_en_Mexico_0_441556195.html Grupo Milenio] España el mayor inversor de México, January 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; when last time was poor people named ''gachupines'' or ''refugiados'' (war refugees). Now many Spaniards are owners of restaurants, department stores, supermarkets, bank institutions, luxury hotels, motels, gourmet bakeries, stationeries, ultramarine stores, trip agencies, building companies, textile factories, gas stations, iron factories, fashion houses, architecture studios, engineer offices, transport services, also private schools and universities, and cultural institutes as Intituto Cervantes, Casa de España or Ateneo Español.

==Discrimination and stereotypes==

The word ''gachupín'' is used for Spaniards who live in Mexico and Guatemala&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.thefreedictionary.com/gachup%C3%ADn|title=gachupín|website=Es.thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a slur, referring to conquistadors and people from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lavozdegalicia.es/lamiradaenlalengua/2013/01/26/los-nuevos-gachupines/|title=Los nuevos gachupines - La mirada en la lengua|website=Blogs.lavozdegalicia.es|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official history says [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] mentioned in the Grito de Dolores; ''Mueran los gachupines'', (Death to the gachupines!).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/el-grito-de-hidalgo-fue-contra-los-gachupines|title=El Grito de Hidalgo fue contra ‘los gachupines’ [Independencia - 15/09/2012 - Periódico Zócalo|website=Zocalo.com.mx|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://capsuladelengua.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/gachupines/|title=Gachupines|date=14 July 2009|website=Capsuladelengua.wordpress.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego Rivera]] was a Mexican painter, who caused controversy with a mural named ''La leyenda negra de la Conquista'' (The black legend of Conquest), painted between 1929 and 1930, he was accused of Hispanophobia creating diplomatic conflicts between Mexican government with Spanish government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3251/325146749010.pdf La utopia de forjar una sola raza para la nación], González Salinas, Omar Fabián, Historia Y MEMORIA magazine, 2016, number 13, p. 320, Tunja, Colombia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotypes about Spaniards in Mexico are men with barb and boina, people smoking ''habanos'' and drinking wine, many newspaper's cartoons describes this images for gachupines or Spanish people.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Education ==
[[File:Colmex007.JPG|thumb|right|220px|The [[El Colegio de México|Colegio de México]].]]
Important Spanish schools remain in Mexico, such as Colegio Madrid of Mexico City, a scholarly institute founded in 1941 by Spanish immigrants and Mexican teachers. This is a private school for elementary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colegiomadrid.edu.mx/index.php/historia|title=Colegio Madrid, A.C. - Historia|website=Colegiomadrid.edu.mx|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[El Colegio de México|Colegio de México]] (Colmex) was an organization of Spanish civil war exiles called firstly "Casa de España en México" (House of Spain in Mexico). In 1939, Alfonso Reyes would be president of the "Colegio" until his death. Historian [[Daniel Cosío Villegas]] played an important role in its institutionalization and the Colegio's library bears his name.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Spanish language|Mexican Spanish}}
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] was brought to [[Mexico]] around 500&amp;nbsp;years ago. As a result of Mexico City's central role in the colonial administration of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]], the population of the city included relatively large numbers of speakers from [[Spain]]. Mexico City ([[Tenochtitlán]]) had also been the capital of the [[Aztec]] Empire, and many speakers of the Aztec language [[Nahuatl]] continued to live there and in the surrounding region, outnumbering the Spanish-speakers for several generations. Consequently, Mexico City tended historically to exercise a standardizing effect over the entire country, more or less, evolving into a distinctive dialect of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] which incorporated a significant number of [[Hispanicization|Hispanicized]] Nahuatl words.

During the Spanish Exile, the [[Catalan language]] was expressed by writers and poets in Mexico, the Orfeó Català de Mèxic was a mecca for Catalan speakers and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crai.ub.edu/ca/coneix-el-crai/biblioteques/biblioteca-pavello-republica/jocs-florals|title=Els Jocs Florals de la Llengua Catalana a l'exili (1941-1977) - CRAI UB|website=Crai.ub.edu|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocm.cat/index.php/es/orfeo-mx/historia-mx|title=Historia|first=Super|last=User|website=Ocm.cat|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charreria ===
Charreria, a word encompassing all aspects of the art, evolved from the traditions that came to Mexico from [[Salamanca, Spain]] in the 16th century. When the Spanish first settled in [[Colonial Mexico]], they were under orders to raise horses named ''criollos'' (Spanish Creole people), but not to allow the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]] to ride. However, by 1528 the Spanish had very large [[Hacienda|cattle-raising estates]] and found it necessary to employ indigenous people as [[vaquero]]s or Criole herdsman, who soon became excellent horsemen. Smaller landholders, known as rancheros or ranchers, were the first genuine [[charro]]s and they are credited as the inventors of the charreada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnn.epcc.edu/nwlibrary/borderlands/10_la_charreada.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816195630/http://dnn.epcc.edu/nwlibrary/borderlands/10_la_charreada.htm |archivedate=2011-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bullfighting ===
[[Bullfighting]] arrived in Mexico with the first Spaniards and the rest of Latin America in the 16th century. Records are found of the first bullfights debuted in Mexico on June 26, 1526, with a bullfight in [[Mexico City]] held in honor of explorer [[Hernán Cortés]], who had just come back from [[Honduras]] (then known as Las Hibueras). From that point on, bullfights were staged all over Mexico as part of various civic, social and religious celebrations.
Today, there are about 220 permanent bullrings throughout Mexico with the largest venue of its kind is the [[Plaza de toros México]] in central [[Mexico City]] which opened in 1946 and seats 48,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/mexico/central_mexico.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605140518/http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/mexico/central_mexico.shtml |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holy week ===
Holy week is a Spanish tradition represented in many Mexican cities as San Luis Potosí City, Taxco de Alarcón or Morelia, this religious representation is very similar to Sevilla Holy week procession o ''Semana Mayor'' from other Spanish cities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

The Asturians are a very large community that has a long history in Mexico, dating from colonial times to the present.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.economia.unam.mx/cladhe/registro/ponencias/214_abstract.pdf Economía UNAM] Los asturianos y la modernización commercial de México y España en el siglo XX, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 42,000 people of Asturian birth in Mexico{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. The Catalans are also very numerous in Mexico. According to sources from the Catalan community, there are approximately 12,000 Catalan-born around the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. There are also as many as 8,500 [[Basques]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, 6,000 Galicians{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, and 1,600 Canary Islanders{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.

The largest population of Spanish descent are located in Mexico Valley, Puebla-Veracruz region, Bajío region, Guadalajara Valley, Altos de Jalisco, Northern region and Riviera Maya, where they make up the largest proportion of the Spanish population. Large populations are found in the states like [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico State]], [[Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Querétaro]], and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Also, Northern Mexico is inhabited by many millions of Spanish descendants. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some states like [[Zacatecas]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Baja California]], [[Sonora]], [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Tamaulipas]].

As the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish royal]] Government doted the [[New Spain]] from Kingdoms and Territories, a great part of them followed names. So we can find lots of Basque criollos in [[Durango]] and Southern [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] as those territories were part of the [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Kingdom of New Vizcay]], Galician descendants in [[Jalisco]] being part of the [[Nueva Galicia|Kingdom of New Galicia]].

=== Mexico City ===

=== Numbers ===
Spanish descendants make up the largest group of Europeans in Mexico and a majority of Mexicans have some degree of Spanish descent. Most of their ancestors arrived during the colonial period but further hundreds of thousands have since then immigrated, especially during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=083e0b4728d31cd23a57533cf02c46c5|title=New America Media|website=News.newamericamedia.org|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CIA World Factbook, whites make up 10% of Mexico's population.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook. See also [[White Latin American]] for external sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopædia Britannica states those of predominantly European descent make up closer to one-sixth (≈17%) of the Mexican population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico/27384/Ethnic-groups?anchor=ref394520|title=Mexico - History, Geography, Facts, &amp; Points of Interest|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to anthropological and archaeological evidence, Sri Lankan Tamils have a very long [[History of Sri Lanka|history in Sri Lanka]] and have lived on the island since at least around the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham|title=Aryan or Dravidian or Neither? – A Study of Recent Attempts to Decipher the Indus Script (1995–2000)|journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies|date=8 March 2002|volume=8|issue=1|authorlink=Iravatham Mahadevan|issn=1084-7561|url=http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0801/ejvs0801.txt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723121117/http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0801/ejvs0801.txt|archivedate=23 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Wenzlhuemer|2008|pp=19-20}}{{Efn|According to Wenzlhuemer it is not certain when the first Tamil settlers arrived at Sri Lanka. Also according to Wenzlhuemer, the first Tamils settled at Sri Lanka a few centuries after the first Indo-Aryan settlers, who arrived at Sri Lanka in the 5th century BCE.}} Most modern Sri Lankan Tamils claim descent from residents of [[Jaffna Kingdom]], a former kingdom in the north of the island and [[Vannimai]] [[chieftaincy|chieftaincies]] from the east. They constitute a majority in the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern Province]], live in significant numbers in the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]], and are in the minority throughout the rest of the country. 70% of Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka live in the Northern and Eastern provinces.

Although Sri Lankan Tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct, genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly [[Hindu]]s with a significant Christian population. [[Sri Lankan Tamil literature]] on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects]] are noted for their [[archaism]] and retention of words not in everyday use in the [[Tamil Nadu]] state in India.

Since Sri Lanka gained [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence]] from [[British Ceylon|Britain]] in 1948, relations between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities have been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along with [[Riots in Sri Lanka|ethnic riots]] in [[Gal Oya riots|1956]], [[1958 riots in Ceylon|1958]], [[1977 riots in Sri Lanka|1977]], [[Burning of Jaffna library|1981]] and [[Black July|1983]], led to the formation and strengthening of [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|militant groups]] advocating [[Tamil Eelam|independence for Tamils]]. The ensuing [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]] resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000&amp;nbsp;people and the [[Enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka|forced disappearance]] of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing [[Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War|allegations of atrocities]] being committed by the [[Sri Lankan Military]] and the rebel [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] during its final months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Post-war Sri Lanka|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11393458|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka|United Nations panel]] found that as many as 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final months of the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Darusman|first1=Marzuki|authorlink1=Marzuki Darusman|last2=Sooka|first2=Yasmin|last3=Ratner|first3=Steven R.|title=Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka|publisher=[[United Nations]]|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/POE_Report_Full.pdf|date=31 March 2011|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the civil war has not improved conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and the judiciary coming under political control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA 37/011/2012 Sri Lanka: Continuing Impunity, Arbitrary Detentions, Torture and Enforced Disappearances|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa37/011/2012/en/|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=28 July 2013|date=30 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Katrina|title=Press Freedom Under Attack In Sri Lanka: Website Office Raids and Online Content Regulation|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/sri-lankan-press-freedom-under-attack-website-office-raids-and-online-content|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=28 July 2013|date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jayasinghe|first=Amal|title=Amnesty accuses Sri Lanka of targeting judges|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hn9AglmnC6DNZxlKsgNw2snBfpnA?docId=CNG.5c69d36ecf59a5a931e1ea83f43326c5.5c1|newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One-third of Sri Lankan Tamils now live outside Sri Lanka. While there was significant migration during the British colonial period, the civil war led to more than 800,000&amp;nbsp;Tamils leaving Sri Lanka, and many have [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora|left the country]] for destinations such as Canada, India and Europe as refugees.

There is little scholarly consensus over the presence of the Sri Lankan Tamil people in Sri Lanka, also known as [[Eelam]] in [[Sangam literature]]. One theory states that there was not an organised Sri Lankan Tamil people presence in Sri Lanka until the creation of a Tamil Kingdom in the 7th century CE, followed by much earlier invasions from [[Tamilakam]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arunthavarajah|first=K.|date=2014|title=The Views of Tamil Scholars Regarding the Origin of Jaffna Kingdom|url=http://www.iiste.org/Journals/index.php/RHSS/article/view/13254|journal=Research on Humanities and Social Sciences|language=en|publisher=Department of History, University of Jaffna|volume=4|issue=10|page=110|issn=2225-0484|via=IISTE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory states that the Sri Lankan Tamils are descendant of the [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nagas]], who started to assimilate to Tamil culture and language around 3rd BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kj_aWm4DeFEC|title=The Sri Lanka Reader: History, Culture, Politics|last=Holt|first=John|date=2011-04-13|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=0-8223-4982-5|location=|pages=73–75|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories contends that Tamil people were one of the original inhabitants of the island.{{Sfn|Nadarajan|1999|p=9}}{{Sfn|Manogaran|1987|p=2}}

According to [[K.

Settlements of culturally similar early populations of ancient Sri Lanka and ancient [[Tamil Nadu]] in India were excavated at [[Megaliths|megalithic burial sites]] at Pomparippu on the west coast and in [[Kathiraveli]] on the east coast of the island.

Mention is made in literary sources of Tamil rulers bringing horses to the island in water craft in the second century BCE, most likely arriving at [[Kudiramalai]]. Historical records establish that Tamil kingdoms in modern India were closely involved in the island's affairs from about the 2nd century BCE.{{Sfn|de Silva|1987|pp=30–32}}{{Sfn|Mendis|1957|pp=24–25}} Kudiramalai, Kandarodai and [[Vallipuram]] served as great northern Tamil capitals and emporiums of trade with these kingdoms and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] from the 6th–2nd centuries BCE. The archaeological discoveries in these towns and the ''[[Manimekhalai]]'', a historical poem, detail how Nāka-Tivu of Nāka-Nadu on the [[Jaffna Peninsula]] was a lucrative international market for pearl and conch trading for the Tamil fishermen.

Under the terms of an agreement reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about forty percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and most of the remainder were [[repatriate]]d to India.{{Sfn|de Silva|1987|p=262}} By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.{{Sfn|de Silva|1987|p=262}}

=== Regional groups ===
Sri Lankan Tamils are categorised into three subgroups based on regional distribution, dialects, and culture: Negombo Tamils from the western part of the island, Eastern Tamils from the eastern part, and Jaffna or Northern Tamils from the north.

==== Western Tamils ====
{{Main|Negombo Tamils}}
Western Tamils, also known as [[Negombo Tamils]] or Puttalam Tamils, are native Sri Lankan Tamils who live in the western [[Gampaha District|Gampaha]] and [[Puttalam District|Puttalam]] districts. The term does not apply to Tamil immigrants in these areas.&lt;ref name=RD&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Fernando v. Proctor el al|vol=3|reporter=Sri Lanka|opinion=924|court=District Court, Chilaw|date=27 October 1909|url= http://www.lawnet.lk/docs/case_law/nlr/common/html/NLR12V309.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinguished from other Tamils by their dialects, one of which is known as the [[Negombo Tamil dialect]], and by aspects of their culture such as [[Custom (law)|customary laws]].&lt;ref name=RD /&gt;{{Sfn|Gair|1998|p=171}}&lt;ref name=Bonta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonta|first=Steven|title=Negombo Fishermen's Tamil (NFT): A Sinhala Influenced Dialect from a Bilingual Sri Lankan Community|journal=International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics|date=June 2008|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Negombo Tamils have assimilated into the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] ethnic group through a process known as [[Sinhalisation]]. Sinhalisation has been facilitated by [[caste]] myths and legends.&lt;ref name=Foell&gt;{{cite web|last=Foell|first=Jens|title=Participation, Patrons and the Village: The case of Puttalam District|publisher=[[University of Sussex]]|year=2007|url = http://www.sussex.ac.uk/development/archive/papers/fr.html|accessdate =25 June 2008|quote=One of the most interesting processes in Mampuri is the one of Sinhalisation. Whilst most of the Sinhala fishermen used to speak Tamil and/or still do so, there is a trend towards the use of Sinhala, manifesting itself in most children being educated in Sinhala and the increased use of Sinhala in church. Even some of the long-established Tamils, despite having been one of the most powerful local groups in the past, due to their long local history as well as caste status, have adapted to this trend. The process reflects the political domination of Sinhala people in the Government controlled areas of the country.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611140511/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/development/archive/papers/fr.html|archivedate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Tamils caste hierarchy is predominantly dominated by the maritime [[Karaiyar]]s, with other dominant groups such as the [[Bharatha people|Paravars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=50igCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=negombo+paravar&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU9vyL2cTaAhVDjywKHWRUC2kQ6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=negombo%20paravar&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Sri Lanka|last=Peebles|first=Patrick|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=|isbn=9781442255852|location=|page=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gampaha District, Tamils have historically inhabited the coastal region. In the Puttalam District, there was a substantial ethnic Tamil population until the first two decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Foell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goonetilleke|first=Susantha|title=Sinhalisation: Migration or Cultural Colonization?|journal=Lanka Guardian|date=1 May 1980|pages=18–29|url=http://www.noolaham.org/wiki/index.php?title=Lanka_Guardian_1980.05.01&amp;uselang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those who identify as ethnic Tamils live in villages such as [[Udappu]] and [[Maradankulama|Maradankulam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corea|first=Henry|title=The Maravar Suitor|url=http://www.defonseka.com/k21.htm|accessdate=24 June 2008|newspaper=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)]]|date=3 October 1960|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517173456/http://www.defonseka.com/k21.htm|archivedate=17 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal strip from [[Jaffna]] to [[Chilaw]] is also known as the "Catholic belt".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=SCIDFTjeDD4C&amp;q=catholic+belt+sri+lanka&amp;dq=catholic+belt+sri+lanka&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4vOSoysTaAhXEIpoKHeRYAQ4Q6AEIajAJ|title=Geographical Aspects of the Northern Province, Sri Lanka|last=Rajeswaran|first=S.T.B.|date=2012|publisher=Governor's Office|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=69|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tamil Christians]], chiefly Roman Catholics, have preserved their heritage in the major cities such as [[Negombo]], [[Chilaw]], [[Puttalam]], and also in villages such as [[Mampuri]].&lt;ref name=Foell /&gt;

Some residents of these two districts, especially the [[Karaiyar]]s, are bilingual, ensuring that the Tamil language survives as a [[lingua franca]] among migrating maritime communities across the island. Negombo Tamil dialect is spoken by about 50,000 people. This number does not include others, outside of Negombo city, who speak local varieties of the Tamil language.{{Sfn|Gair|1998|p=171}} The bilingual catholic [[Karava]]s are also found in the western coastal regions, who trace their origins to the Tamil [[Karaiyar]] however identify themselves as [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonta|first=Steven|date=2010|title=Negombo Fishermen's Tamil: A Case of Indo-Aryan Contact-Induced Change in a Dravidian Dialect|jstor=41330804|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=52|issue=3/4|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Tamil [[Sri Lankan placename etymology#Historical period|place names]] have been retained in these districts. Outside the Tamil-dominated northeast, the Puttalam District has the highest percentage of place names of Tamil origin in Sri Lanka. Composite or hybrid place names are also present in these districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=K.|last=Kularatnam|title=Tamil Place Names in Ceylon outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces|booktitle=Proceedings of the First International Conference Seminar of Tamil Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia vol.1|pages=486–493|publisher=International Association of Tamil Research |date=April 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eastern Tamils ====

Eastern Tamils inhabit a region that spans the [[Trincomalee District|Trincomalee]], [[Batticaloa District|Batticaloa]], and [[Ampara District|Ampara]] districts.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=2–4}} Their history and traditions are inspired by local legends, native literature, and colonial documents.{{Sfn|Subramaniam|2006|pp=1–13}}

In the 16th century the area came under the nominal control of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]], but there was scattered leadership under Vannimai chiefs in Batticaloa District&lt;ref&gt;McGilvray, D. ''Mukkuvar Vannimai: Tamil Caste and Matriclan Ideology in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka'', pp. 34–97&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=7–9}} who came with [[Kalinga Magha|Magha's]] army in 1215.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGilvray|first=Dennis B.|title=Caste Ideology and Interaction|year=1982|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-88AAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time on, Eastern Tamil social development diverged from that of the Northern Tamils.

Eastern Tamils are an agrarian-based society. They follow a [[Caste in Sri Lanka#Eastern Castes|caste system]] similar to the South Indian or [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] [[kinship]] system. The Eastern Tamil caste hierarchy is dominated by the [[Mukkuvar]], [[Sri Lankan Vellalar|Vellalar]] and [[Karaiyar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=Mw5cbpeFsvcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=eastern+tamils+caste&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN5LrixJzcAhWE_ywKHa-nAk4Q6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=eastern%20tamils%20caste&amp;f=false|title=Matrilineal Communities, Patriarchal Realities: A Feminist Nirvana Uncovered|last=Ruwanpura|first=Kanchana N.|date=2006|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=|isbn=0472069772|location=|pages=96|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main feature of their society is the ''kudi'' system.{{Sfn|Yalman|1967|pp=282–335}} Although the Tamil word ''kudi'' means a house or settlement, in eastern Sri Lanka it is related to matrimonial alliances. It refers to the [[exogamous]] [[matrilineal]] [[clan]]s and is found amongst most caste groups.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=5–6}} Men or women remain members of the ''kudi'' of their birth and be brother or sister by relation. No man can marry in the same ''kudi'' because woman is always become sister to him. But, a man can only marry in one of his ''sampantha'' ''kudi''s not in the ''sakothara'' ''kudi''s. By custom, children born in a family belong to mother's ''kudi''. ''Kudi'' also collectively own places of worship such as [[Hindu temple]]s.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=5–6}} &lt;!--The ''kuti'' system is also found among the Tamil speaking Muslims of Batticaloa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hussei|first=Asiff|title=Nindavur: The land of the matri-clans|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/06/29/fea22.html|accessdate=24 June 2008|newspaper=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)]]|date=29 June 2003|quote=It is more likely as suggested by M.Z. Mohideen in his contribution on the Kudi Maraikayars to the Souvenir of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home (1965) that the kudi is probably Mukkuvar in origin. The Mukkuvar Tamils of Batticoloa South, he notes also have the kudi form of social organization. In an adjacent Mukkuvar village, for example, there can be a Mukkuvar kudi bearing the same name as the Muslim kudi. Folk tales, as recited by village elders, tend to indicate a Mukkuvar origin for the Muslim kudis.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (need to find appropriate citation that is not copy vivo)--&gt; Each caste contains a number of ''kudis'', with varying names. Aside from castes with an internal ''kudi'' system, there are seventeen caste groups, called ''Ciraikudis'', or imprisoned ''kudis'', whose members were considered to be in captivity, confined to specific services such as washing, weaving, and [[toddy tapping]]. However, such restrictions no longer apply.

The Tamils of the Trincomalee district have different social customs from their southern neighbours due to the influence of the Jaffna kingdom to the north.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=5–6}} The [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Coast Vedda|Veddha]] people of the east coast also speak Tamil and have become assimilated into the Eastern Tamil caste structure.&lt;ref name=Seligmann1911&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seligmann|first1=C.G.|last2=Gabriel|first2=C.|last3=Seligmann|first3=B.Z.|year=1911|title=The Veddas|url=http://vedda.org/seligmann-coastal-veddas.htm|pages=331–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Eastern Tamils follow customary laws called [[Mukkuva laws]] codified during the [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Dutch colonial period]].{{Sfn|Thambiah|2001|p=2}}

==== Northern Tamils ====
[[Jaffna kingdom|Jaffna's history]] of being an independent kingdom lends legitimacy to the political claims of the Sri Lankan Tamils, and has provided a focus for their constitutional demands.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=4–12}} Northern Tamil society is generally categorised into two groups: those who are from the [[Jaffna peninsula]] in the north, and those who are residents of the [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] to the immediate south. The Jaffna society is separated by [[Caste system in Sri Lanka#Tamil castes|castes]]. Historically, the [[Sri Lankan Vellalar]] were in northern region dominant and were traditionally [[husbandman]] involved in [[agriculture]] and [[Livestock|cattle cultivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernando|first=A.

People in the Vanni districts considered themselves separate from Tamils of the Jaffna peninsula but the two groups did intermarry. Most of these married couples moved into the Vanni districts where land was available. Vanni consists of a number of highland settlements within forested lands using [[irrigation tank]]-based cultivation. An 1890 census listed 711 such tanks in this area. Hunting and raising livestock such as [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] and cattle is a necessary adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the [[Vavuniya District|Vavuniya]], [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaitivu]], and eastern [[Mannar District|Mannar]] districts. Historically, the Vanni area has been in contact with what is now South India, including during the medieval period and was ruled by the [[Vanniar (Chieftain)|Vanniar Chieftains]].{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=4–12}} Northern Tamils follow customary laws called [[Thesavalamai]], codified during the [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Dutch colonial period]].{{Sfn|Thambiah|2001|p=12}}

=== Genetic affinities ===
{{Main|Genetic studies on Sri Lankan Tamils}}
Although Sri Lankan Tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct, genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to other ethnic groups in the island while being related to the Indian Tamils from South India as well. There are various studies that indicate varying degrees of connections between Sri Lankan Tamils, Sinhalese and Indian ethnic groups.

{{See also|Hinduism in Sri Lanka|Christianity in Sri Lanka|Village deities of Tamils of Sri Lanka}}
In 1981, about eighty percent of Sri Lankan Tamils were [[Hindu]]s who followed the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] sect.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;{{cite web|title = Sri Lanka: Country study|publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]|year=1988|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/lktoc.html|accessdate=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest were mostly Roman Catholics who converted after the [[Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom]] and [[Portuguese Ceylon|coastal Sri Lanka]]. There is also a small minority of Protestants due to missionary efforts in the 18th century by organisations such as the [[American Ceylon Mission]].{{Sfn|Hudson|1982|p=29}} Most Tamils who inhabit the [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province]] are Roman Catholics, while those of the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern]] and [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Provinces]] are mainly Hindu.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=34–89}} [[Pentecostal]] and other churches, such as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], are active among the internally displaced and refugee populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/surveys/pentecostal/asia/|title=Overview: Pentecostalism in Asia|accessdate=24 March 2008|publisher=The pew forum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306030325/http://pewforum.org/surveys/pentecostal/asia/|archivedate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2012 Sri Lanka Census]] revealed a [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Buddhist]] population of 22,254 amongst Sri Lankan Tamils.

The Hindu elite, especially the [[Sri Lankan Vellalar|Vellalar]], follow the religious ideology of [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] (Shaiva school) while the masses practice [[List of Sri Lankan Tamil village deities|folk Hinduism]], upholding their faith in local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship and how it is housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a ''Koyil'', constructed according to the ''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamic]]'' scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with ''Agamic'' scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=34–89}} These temples observe daily ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]]'' (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a ''Kurukkal''. A ''Kurukkal'' may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like ''[[Pandaram]]'' or Iyer community.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=34–89}} In the Eastern Province, a ''Kurukkal'' usually belongs to ''[[Lingayat]]'' sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a [[trident]] (''culam''), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as ''[[Pongal (dish)|pongal]]'' would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the [[Thai Pongal]] day, and possibly on [[Tamil New Year#Festivals|Tamil New Year Day]].

There are seven worshipped deities: [[Ayyanar]], Annamar, [[Bhairava|Vairavar]], [[Kali]], [[Ganesha|Pillaiyar]], [[Murugan|Murukan]], or [[Pattini]]. Villages have more Pillaiyar temples, which are patronised by local farmers.{{Sfn|Sivathamby|1995|pp=34–89}} Tamil Roman Catholics, along with members of other faiths, worship at the [[Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison|first=Frances|title=Tamil Tigers appeal over shrine|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7336855.stm|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=8 April 2008|authorlink=Frances Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus have several temples with historic importance such as those at [[Ketheeswaram]], [[Koneswaram]], [[Naguleswaram]], [[Munneswaram temple|Munneswaram]], [[Tondeswaram]], and [[Nallur Kandaswamy temple|Nallur Kandaswamy]].{{Sfn|Manogaran|2000|p=46}} [[Kataragama]] temple and [[Adam's Peak]] are attended by all religious communities.

{{Main|Sri Lankan Tamil dialects}}
{{See also|Languages of Sri Lanka|Loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil|Sinhala words of Tamil origin}}

Sri Lankan Tamils predominantly speak Tamil and its Sri Lankan dialects. These dialects are differentiated by the phonological changes and sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCE–7th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form a group that is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the [[Negombo Tamil dialect]]s. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, [[Sri Lankan Moors|Moors]] and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.&lt;ref name=Kuiper /&gt; Sri Lankan Tamils, depending on where they live in Sri Lanka, may also additionally speak [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] and or [[English language|English]]. According to the 2012 Census 32.8% or 614,169 Sri Lankan Tamils also spoke Sinhala and 20.9% or 390,676 Sri Lankan Tamils also spoke English.&lt;ref name="Census2012"&gt;{{cite web |title=Census of Population and Housing 2011 |url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/CPH2011/index.php?fileName=FinalPopulation&amp;gp=Activities&amp;tpl=3 |website=www.statistics.gov.lk |publisher=Department of Census and Statistics |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Negombo Tamil dialect is used by bilingual fishermen in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]].&lt;ref name=Bonta /&gt; The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and [[Portuguese Burghers]] in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, while at the same time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day [[Malayalam]], a [[Dravidian language]] from Kerala that originated as a [[dialect]] of old Tamil around 9th century CE.{{Sfn|Subramaniam|2006|p=10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zvlebil|first=Kamil|title=Some features of Ceylon Tamil|journal=[[Indo-Iranian Journal]]|volume=9|issue=2|pages=113–138|publisher=[[Springer Netherlands]]|date=June 1966|doi=10.1007/BF00963656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.&lt;ref name=Kuiper /&gt;

The dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and closest to old Tamil. The long physical isolation of the Tamils of Jaffna has enabled their dialect to preserve ancient features of old Tamil that predate ''[[Tolkappiyam]]'',&lt;ref name=Kuiper /&gt; the grammatical treatise on Tamil dated from 3rd century BCE to 10th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swamy|first=B.G.L.|year=1975|title=The Date Of Tolksppiyam-a Retrospect|series=Silver|journal=Annals of Oriental Research|volume=Jubilee Volume|pages=292–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a large component of the settlers were from the [[Coromandel Coast]] and [[Malabar Coast]] which may have helped with the preservation of the dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=4IdR9N9R7T4C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=sri+lanka+tamils+malabar&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRue7m5sTaAhUEmbQKHYitCKEQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=sri%20lanka%20tamils%20malabar&amp;f=false|title=Ethnic Conflict and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka|last=Manogaran|first=Chelvadurai|date=1987|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=|isbn=9780824811167|location=|page=3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=02RKAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=sri+lanka+tamils+coromandel&amp;dq=sri+lanka+tamils+coromandel&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjezZ2M6MTaAhWSPFAKHT1KBKo4HhDoAQgmMAA|title=Pilgrimage and Traditional Authority in Tamil Sri Lanka|last=Pfaffenberger|first=Bryan|date=1977|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|year=|isbn=|location=|page=15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their ordinary speech is closely related to classical Tamil.&lt;ref name=Kuiper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuiper|first=L.B.J|title=Note on Old Tamil and Jaffna Tamil|journal=[[Indo-Iranian Journal]]|volume=6|issue=1|pages=52–64|publisher=[[Springer Netherlands]]|date=March 1964|doi=10.1007/BF00157142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservational Jaffna Tamil dialect and Indian Tamil dialects are to an extent not mutually intelligible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schiffman|first=Harold|title=Language Shift in the Tamil Communities of Malaysia and Singapore: the Paradox of Egalitarian Language Policy|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|date=30 October 1996|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/sparadox/sparadox.html|accessdate =4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the former is frequently mistaken for [[Malayalam]] by native Indian Tamil speakers. {{Sfn|Indrapala|2007|p=45}} The closest Tamil Nadu Tamil variant to Jaffna Tamil is literary Tamil, used in formal speeches and news reading.

=== Education ===
[[File:ACM 1890.gif|thumb|right|A group of [[American Ceylon Mission]] missionaries in Jaffna (circa 1890)]]
Sri Lankan Tamil society values education highly, for its own sake as well as for the opportunities it provides.{{Sfn|Gair|1998|p=171}} The kings of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were historically patrons of literature and education. Temple schools and traditional ''[[gurukul]]am'' classes on [[verandah]]s (known as ''Thinnai Pallikoodam'' in Tamil) spread basic education in religion and in languages such as Tamil and [[Sanskrit]] to the upper classes.{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|pp=64–65}} The Portuguese introduced western-style education after their conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619. The Jesuits opened churches and seminaries, but the Dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to [[Dutch Reformed church]]es when they took over Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|p=68}}

&lt;!--With the expansion of education during the British period, education became the gateway to white-collar jobs in the colonial governments of Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.--&gt;The primary impetus for educational opportunity came with the establishment of the American Ceylon Mission in Jaffna District, which started with the arrival in 1813 of missionaries sponsored by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. &lt;!--Due to geopolitical issues, the British colonial offices in India and [[Ceylon]] restricted the Americans to the relatively small [[Jaffna Peninsula]] for almost 40 years.--&gt; The critical period of the missionaries' impact was from the 1820s to the early 20th century. During this time, they created Tamil translations of English texts, engaged in printing and publishing, established primary, secondary, and [[Batticotta Seminary|college-level schools]], and provided health care for residents of the Jaffna Peninsula. American activities in Jaffna also had unintended consequences. The concentration of efficient Protestant mission schools in Jaffna produced a revival movement among local Hindus led by [[Arumuga Navalar]], who responded by building many more schools within the Jaffna peninsula. Local Catholics also started their own schools in reaction, and the state had its share of primary and secondary schools. Tamil literacy greatly increased as a result of these changes. This prompted the British colonial government to hire Tamils as government servants in British-held Ceylon, India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Singapore]].{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|pp=73–109}}

By the time Sri Lanka became independent in 1948, about sixty percent of government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed barely fifteen percent of the population. The elected Sinhalese leaders of the country saw this as the result of a British stratagem to control the majority Sinhalese, and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of the [[Policy of standardization]]&lt;!-- expand more on this --&gt;.&lt;!-- that was implemented strained the already tenuous political relationship between the communities and is believed to be one of the main causes of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]].--&gt;{{Sfn|Pfaffenberg|1994|p=110}}{{Sfn|Ambihaipahar|1998|p=29}}

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Sri Lankan Tamil literature}}
According to legends, the origin of Sri Lankan Tamil literature dates back to the [[Sangam literature|Sangam period]] (3rd century BCE–6th century CE). These legends indicate that the Tamil poet [[Eelattu Poothanthevanar]] (Poothanthevanar from Sri Lanka) lived during this period.&lt;ref name=Sivathamby&gt;{{cite web|last=Sivathamby|first=K.|title=50 years of Sri Lankan Tamil literature|url=http://tamilelibrary.org/teli/srilitt.html|publisher=Tamil Circle|accessdate=25 August 2008|authorlink=K. Sivathamby|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval period Tamil literature on the subjects of medicine, mathematics and history was produced in the courts of the Jaffna Kingdom.
&lt;!--During the reign of Jayaveera Singaiariyan, Karivaiya wrote a text on medical sciences (''Segarajasekaram''), astrology (''Segarajasekaramalai''),{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|pp=64–65}}&lt;ref name=c74&gt;Coddrington, H. ''Ceylon Coins and Currency'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and mathematics (''Kanakathikaram'').{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|pp=64–65}} A work about medicine known as ''Pararajasekaram'' was completed during the rule of Kunaveera Singaiariyan.{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|pp=64–65}}--&gt;During [[Singai Pararasasekaran]]'s rule, an academy for the propagation of the Tamil language, modelled on those of ancient [[Tamil Sangam]], was established in Nallur. This academy collected manuscripts of ancient works and preserved them in the Saraswathy Mahal library.&lt;!-- Singai Pararasasekaran's cousin Arasakesari is credited with translating the Sanskrit classic [[Raghuvamsha (play)|Raghuvamsa]] into Tamil.&lt;ref name=c74 /&gt; Many literary works of historic importance were compiled before the arrival of European colonizers, including the well-known ''Vaiyapatal'', written by Vaiyapuri Aiyar.(too much details)--&gt;{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|pp=64–65}}{{Sfn|Nadarajan|1999|pp=80–84}}

During the Portuguese and Dutch colonial periods (1619–1796), [[Muttukumara Kavirajar]] is the earliest known author who used literature to respond to Christian missionary activities. He was followed by [[Arumuga Navalar]], who wrote and published a number of books.&lt;ref name=Sivathamby /&gt; The period of joint missionary activities by the [[Anglican]], American Ceylon, and [[Methodist]] Missions also saw the spread of modern education and the expansion of translation activities.

The modern period of Tamil literature began in the 1960s with the establishment of modern universities and a free education system in post-independence Sri Lanka. The 1960s also saw a social revolt against the [[caste]] system in Jaffna, which impacted Tamil literature: [[Dominic Jeeva]], Senkai aazhiyaan, Thamizhmani Ahalangan are the products of this period.&lt;ref name=Sivathamby /&gt;

After the start of the civil war in 1983, a number of poets and fiction writers became active, focusing on subjects such as death, destruction, and rape. Such writings have no parallels in any previous Tamil literature.&lt;ref name=Sivathamby /&gt; The war produced displaced Tamil writers around the globe who recorded their longing for their lost homes and the need for integration with mainstream communities in Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=Sivathamby /&gt;

The [[Jaffna Public Library]] which contained over 97,000 books and manuscripts was one of the biggest libraries in Asia, and through the [[Burning of Jaffna Public Library|Burning of the Jaffna Public Library]] much of [[Sri Lankan Tamil literature]] has been obliterated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla72/papers/119-Knuth-en.pdf|title=Destroying a Symbol: Checkered History of Sri Lanka’s Jaffna Public Library|last=Knuth|first=Rebecca|publisher=University of Hawaii|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cuisine of Sri Lankan Tamils draws influence from that of India, as well as from colonialists and foreign traders. &lt;!--It is noted for its emphasis on using a minimal number of ingredients to turn out simple, nutritious food for the family, rather than gourmet fare for sophisticated palates.--&gt; Rice is usually consumed daily and can be found at any special occasion, while spicy [[Curry|curries]] are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. [[Rice and curry]] is the name for a range of Sri Lankan Tamil dishes distinct from Indian Tamil cuisine, with regional variations between the island's northern and eastern areas. While rice with curries is the most popular lunch menu, combinations such as [[curd]], tangy mango, and tomato rice are also commonly served.&lt;ref name=TH200703&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramakrishnan|first=Rohini|title=From the land of the Yaal Padi|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2003/07/20/stories/2003072000780700.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[String hoppers]], which are made of [[rice flour]] and look like knitted [[vermicelli]] neatly laid out in circular pieces about {{convert|12|cm|in}} in diameter, are frequently combined with tomato ''sothi'' (a soup) and curries for breakfast and dinner.{{Sfn|Pujangga|1997|p=75}} Another common item is ''[[puttu]]'', a granular, dry, but soft steamed rice powder cooked in a bamboo cylinder with the base wrapped in cloth so that the bamboo flute can be set upright over a clay pot of boiling water. This can be transformed into varieties such as ''[[Finger millet|ragi]]'', spinach, and tapioca puttu. There are also sweet and savoury puttus.{{Sfn|Pujangga|1997|p=72}} Another popular breakfast or dinner dish is [[Appam]], a thin crusty pancake made with rice flour, with a round soft crust in the middle.{{Sfn|Pujangga|1997|p=73}} It has variations such as egg or milk Appam.&lt;ref name=TH200703 /&gt;

Jaffna, as a peninsula, has an abundance of seafood such as crab, shark, fish, prawn, and squid. Meat dishes such as mutton, chicken and pork also have their own niche. Vegetable curries use ingredients primarily from the home garden such as pumpkin, [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[jackfruit]] seed, [[hibiscus]] flower, and various green leaves. [[Coconut milk]] and hot [[Chili pepper|chilli]] powder are also frequently used. Appetizers can consist of a range of ''[[Indian pickle|achars]]'' (pickles) and ''vadahams''. Snacks and sweets are generally of the homemade "rustic" variety, relying on [[jaggery]], [[sesame]] seed, coconut, and [[Sesame oil|gingelly oil]], to give them their distinct regional flavour. A popular alcoholic drink in rural areas is [[palm wine]] (toddy), made from [[Borassus|palmyra tree]] sap. Snacks, savouries, sweets and porridge produced from the palmyra form a separate but unique category of foods; from the fan-shaped leaves to the root, the palmyra palm forms an intrinsic part of the life and cuisine of northern region.&lt;ref name=TH200703 /&gt;

Sri Lanka became an independent nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil community has been strained. Sri Lanka has been unable to contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war.&lt;ref name=Peebles /&gt; The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and [[Sri Lankan place name etymology|place name etymologies]], and the political use of the national past.{{Sfn|Spencer|1990|p=23}} The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doucet|first=Lyse|title=UN 'failed Sri Lanka civilians', says internal probe|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20308610|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=13 November 2012|authorlink=Lyse Doucet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peachey|first=Paul|title=Sri Lanka snubs UN as it bids for more trade links with the UK|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sri-lanka-snubs-un-as-it-bids-for-more-trade-links-with-the-uk-8795379.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to human rights groups such as [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[forced disappearance]] of thousands of others (''see [[White van abductions in Sri Lanka]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=S Lanka civilian toll 'appalling'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7243595.stm|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=13 February 2008|quote=Sri Lanka's government is one of the world's worst perpetrators of enforced disappearances, US-based pressure group [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) says.

=== Before independence ===
The arrival of Protestant missionaries on a large scale beginning in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Anglican]] churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging them to think of themselves as a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|p=108}}{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|p=201}}

[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], which conquered the whole island by 1815, established a [[Legislative Council of Ceylon|legislative council]] in 1833 by unifying the Tamil and Sinhalese nations on the island and assigning three European seats and one seat each for Sinhalese, Tamils and [[Burgher people|Burghers]].&lt;ref name=McConnell2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=McConnell|first=D.|year=2008|title=The Tamil people's right to self-determination|journal=[[Cambridge Review of International Affairs]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=59–76|url=http://www.informaworld.com/index/790622093.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2008|doi=10.1080/09557570701828592}}&lt;/ref&gt; This council's primary function was to act as advisor to the [[Governors of British Ceylon|Governor]], and the seats eventually became elected positions.&lt;!--From the introduction of an advisory council to the [[Donoughmore Commission]] in 1931 until the [[Soulbury Commission]] in 1947, the main dispute between the elite of the Sinhalese and of the Tamils was over the question of representation, not the structure of the government. The issue of power-sharing was used by the nationalists of both communities to create an escalating interethnic rivalry that continues to gain momentum today.--&gt;{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|p=76}} There was initially little tension between the Sinhalese and the Tamils, when in 1913 [[Ponnambalam Arunachalam]], a Tamil, was appointed representative of the Sinhalese as well as of the Tamils in the national legislative council. British Governor [[William Manning (colonial governor)|William Manning]], who was appointed in 1918 however, actively encouraged the concept of "communal representation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Silva|first=K.M.|title=History of Sri Lanka|year=1995|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|authorlink=K. M. de Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Donoughmore Commission in 1931 rejected communal representation and brought in [[universal franchise]]. This decision was opposed by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in parliament according to their proportion of the overall population. In 1944, [[G. G. Ponnambalam]], a leader of the Tamil community, suggested to the [[Soulbury Commission]] that a roughly equal number of seats be assigned to Sinhalese and minorities in an independent Ceylon (50:50)—a proposal that was rejected.{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|p=5}} But under section 29(2) of the constitution formulated by the commissioner, additional protection was provided to minority groups, such requiring a two-thirds majority for any amendments and a scheme of representation that provided more weight to the ethnic minorities.{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|p=6}}

In 1972, a newly formulated constitution removed section 29(2) of the 1947 Soulbury constitution that was formulated to protect the interests of minorities.{{Sfn|Gunasingam|1999|p=6}} Also, in 1973, the [[Policy of standardization]] was implemented by the Sri Lankan government, supposedly to rectify disparities in university enrolment created under [[British Ceylon|British colonial rule]]. &lt;!--It was in essence an [[affirmative action]] program to assist geographically disadvantaged students get a college education.--&gt; The resultant benefits enjoyed by Sinhalese students also meant a significant decrease in the number of Tamil students within the Sri Lankan university student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jayasuriya|first=J.E.|title=Education in the Third World: Some Reflections|year=1981|publisher=ndian Institute of Education|location=Pune|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25SfAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, in 1973, the Federal Party decided to demand a [[Tamil Eelam|separate Tamil state]]. In 1976 they merged with the other Tamil political parties to become the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF). &lt;!--After the first National convention of TULF in 1976, the Ceylon Tamils moved towards a transformed nationalism, meaning they were now unwilling to live within a confined single island entity.--&gt;{{Sfn|Wilson|2000|pp=101–110}} &lt;!--Chelvanayakam and the Federal Party had always campaigned for a united country and thought, until 1973, that partitioning the country would be "suicidal".

By the end of 1987, the militant youth groups had fought not only the Sri Lankan security forces and the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] also among each other, with the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) eventually eliminating most of the others. Except for the LTTE, many of the remaining organisations transformed into either minor political parties within the [[Tamil National Alliance]] or standalone political parties. Some also function as paramilitary groups within the Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name=cstudy3 /&gt;

They left behind inscriptions in South India dated to the 13th century.{{Sfn|Indrapala|2007|pp=253–254}} In the late 19th century, educated Tamils from the Jaffna peninsula migrated to the British colonies of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] (Malaysia and Singapore) and India to assist the colonial bureaucracy.

After the start of the conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], there was a mass migration of Tamils trying to escape the hardships and perils of war. Initially, it was middle class professionals, such as doctors and engineers, who emigrated; they were followed by the poorer segments of the community. The fighting drove more than 800,000 Tamils from their homes to other places within Sri Lanka as [[internally displaced person]]s and also overseas, prompting the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) to identify them in 2004 as the largest asylum-seeking group.&lt;ref name=Acharya&gt;{{cite web|last=Acharya|first=Arunkumar|title=Ethnic conflict and refugees in Sri Lanka|publisher=[[Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon]]|year=2007|format=PDF|url=http://www.ujaen.es/huesped/rae/articulos2007/acharya0907.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa37/004/2006/en/|title=ASA 37/004/2006 Sri Lanka: Waiting to go home – the plight of the internally displaced|accessdate=22 April 2007|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=28 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turkish Canadians''' ({{lang-tr|Türk asıllı Kanadalılar;}} literally "Turkish-originating Canadians") are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] descent, or [[Turkey]]-born people who reside in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Karpat 2004 loc=632"&gt;{{Harvnb|Karpat|2004|loc=632}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell 2005 loc=297"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2005|loc=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]] there were 63,955 Canadians who claimed full or partial Turkish descent.&lt;ref name="Statistics Canada"/&gt;

== History ==
[[Turkish people|Turks]] first began to immigrate to [[Canada]] in small numbers from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. However, significant migration initially began in the late 1950s and early 1960s when the Turkish government encouraged student education abroad.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1277"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aksan|1999|loc=1277}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been Turks fleeing from unrest and oppression in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Cyprus]] who arrived in Canada as both [[political]] and [[economic]] [[refugees]].&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1277"/&gt;

===Ottoman migration===
In 1901, Canada had between 300–400 [[Muslim]] residents, equally divided between Turks and Syrian Arabs.&lt;ref name="Abu-Laban 1983 loc=76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Abu-Laban|1983|loc=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1911, the size of the Muslim community had increased to about 1,500, of whom 1,000 were of Turkish origin and the remainder were Arabs.&lt;ref name="Abu-Laban 1983 loc=76"/&gt; During the pre-[[World War I]] period Turks were to be found in [[mining]] and [[logging]] camps across Canada.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1276"/&gt; However, due to bad relations between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Europe]], further migration was made difficult for the Turks and the Canadian government discouraged "[[Asian people|Asian]]" immigration.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1276"/&gt; Thus, by the onset of World War I, Canada witnessed the return of many Turkish immigrants who were then classified as "enemy aliens".&lt;ref name="Abu-Laban 1983 loc=76"/&gt; Another reason for the return-migration of Ottoman Turks was because for the majority of Turks, the founding of the new republic of Turkey in 1923 was a greater incentive to stay at home.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1276"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aksan|1999|loc=1276}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainland Turkish migration===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the government of [[Turkey]] encouraged and financially supported Turkish students to study in Canada.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1277"/&gt; Thus, the early 1960s consisted primarily of students and professionals, especially doctors and engineers.&lt;ref name="Powell 2005 loc=298"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powell|2005|loc=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant Turkish immigration began during the 1960s and 1970s; most Turks went to Canada for educational and economic opportunities.&lt;ref name="Powell 2005 loc=298"/&gt; According to the 1972 Canada census there were 9,342 Turkish-born persons living in Canada.

===Bulgarian Turks migration===

In 1989, [[Turks in Bulgaria]] were fleeing from the unrest and oppression of the Bulgarian government; many have arrived in Canada as political and economic refugees.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1276"/&gt;

===Turkish Cypriot migration===

During the 1950s, [[Turkish Cypriots]] started to leave [[Cyprus]] for political reasons when the [[Greek Cypriots]] held a referendum in which 95.7% of Greek Cypriots  supported [[enosis]], the union of Cyprus with [[Greece]]. By 1963, inter-ethnic fighting broke out in [[Cyprus]], with [[Turkish Cypriots]] bearing the heavier cost in terms of casualties and some 25,000 Turkish Cypriots became internally displaced accounting to about a fifth of their population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cassia|2007|loc=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tension continued to grow by the late 1960s and approximately 60,000 Turkish Cypriots left their homes and moved into enclaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tocci|2004|loc=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in an [[Emigration|exodus]] of more Turkish Cypriots from the island, many migrating to [[Canada]]. In 1983, Turkish Cypriots [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|unilaterally proclaimed]] the establishment of their own state, the [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), which has since remained internationally unrecognized except by Turkey. Since the division of the island, the [[Economy of Northern Cyprus|Turkish Cypriot economy]] has remained stagnant and undeveloped because of the economic [[embargo]]es which have been imposed on the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tocci|2004|loc=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish Cypriots are still forced to emigrate, as a result of unemployment, and economic, social and moral degradation. Furthermore, due to the 'Turkeyfication' policies administered in the north, Turkish Cypriots responses to such policies of nationalisation have been to leave the island and moved to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Papadakis|Peristianis|Welz|2006|loc=94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==

According to the [[Canada 2006 Census]], there were 43,700 Turks living in Canada; the majority were concentrated in [[Toronto]] (14,970), [[Montreal]] (10,345), [[Vancouver]] (3,380), [[Ottawa]] (2,455), [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] (1,590), [[Calgary]] (1,305), and [[Edmonton]] (1,250).&lt;ref name="NSA"&gt;{{cite web |author=Statistics Canada|title=2006 Census|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=92333&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=801&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=80&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;GID=837928 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual number of Turkish Canadians is believed to be considerably higher,&lt;ref name="Powell 2005 loc=297"/&gt; as ethnic Turks have also immigrated to Canada via [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], and the [[Republic of Macedonia]].&lt;ref name="Powell 2005 loc=297"/&gt; Statistics on [[Bulgarian Turks]], [[Turkish Cypriots]], and [[Macedonian Turks]] present particular problems because it is unclear how many have immigrated to Canada; they are recorded by their citizenship (i.e. "Bulgarian", "Cypriot", and "Macedonian") rather than their ethnicity.

===Religion===
The vast majority of Turkish Canadians are [[Sunni Muslims]], whilst the remaining people generally do not have any religious affiliation. Prior to 1980, Turkish Canadian immigrants were from both [[urban area|urban]] and [[secular]] backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1279"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aksan|1999|loc=1279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion remained an affair of the private conscience.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1279"/&gt; In May 1983, the Canadian Turkish Islamic Heritage Association (Kanada Türk Islam Kültür Derneği) was established, followed by the Canadian Turkish Islamic Trust (Kanada Türk Islam Vakfi) in April 1987.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1279"/&gt;

Since 2005, [[Nile Academy]], a private school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nile Academy|url = http://nileacademy.ca/|website = nileacademy.ca|access-date = 23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; run by Turkish administration linked to a nonprofit organization called [[Canadian Turkish Friendship Community]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Job Offers - Nile Academy BlueHaven|url = http://nileacademy.ca/bluehaven/job-offers/|website = nileacademy.ca|access-date = 23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has grown exponentially over the years.

They have also opened a dormitory located near Jane Street and Eglinton Avenue West, Toronto. Throughout the years, [[Nile Academy]] has competed in [[Turkish Language Olympiads]] and many wrestling tournaments in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nile Academy, Plunkett’s Wrestling Team - Nile Academy-Plunkett Campus|url = http://nileacademy.ca/plunkett/nile-academy-plunketts-wrestling-team/|website = nileacademy.ca|access-date = 23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nile Academy is also linked with religious cleric and right-wing scholar [[Fethullah Gülen]] and the [[Gülen movement|Gülen Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fethullah Gülen Web Sitesi - Kanada'daki Türk Okulundan Büyük Başarı|url = http://tr.fgulen.com/content/view/17682/11/|website = tr.fgulen.com|access-date = 23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have had many notable alumni&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alumni - Nile Academy-Plunkett Campus|url = http://nileacademy.ca/plunkett/university-results/|website = nileacademy.ca|access-date = 23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; since they opened in 2005.

==Associations==
Since the 1960s, many community organizations have appeared representing various groups of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] immigrants. The various associations across [[Canada]] are currently represented by the "Federation of Canadian Turkish Associations", an umbrella organization founded in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aksan|1999|loc=1278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federation serves as a referral and communications centre for news of [[Turkey]], local events, business and governmental inquiries, and intergroup relations.  More recently, a similar Turkish Cypriot umbrella group, the "Federation of Turkish Cypriot Associations of Canada", was established; the "Canadian Association for Solidarity of Turks from Bulgaria" also forms part of the federation.&lt;ref name="Aksan 1999 loc=1278"/&gt;

The Federation of Canadian Turkish Associations is an umbrella organization representing 17 member associations from Victoria to Quebec, which include approximately 50,000 Canadians of Turkish origin. The federation was established in 1985 and is a non-profit organization with no political affiliations. It supports and encourages activities that deal with important cultural, economic, educational, historical, social and religious issues that relate to the Turkish community in Canada.

== History and background ==

In 1992, the economist [[Christiane Busch-Lüty]] and the physicist [[Hans-Peter Dürr]] gave a joint talk at a conference of [[Verein für Socialpolitik]] (VfS) on the topic of “economics and nature”.&lt;ref name="cblhpd"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Christiane Busch-Lüty]]|Surname2=[[Hans-Peter Dürr]]|EditorSurname1=Heinz König|Periodical=Umweltverträgliches Wirtschaften als Problem von Wissenschaft und Politik|Title=Ökonomie und Natur: Versuch einer Annäherung im interdisziplinären Dialog |Publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|PublicationPlace=Berlin|Year=1993|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;13–44|ISBN=3-428-07771-7|Date=  1993|language=German|AccessDate=2015-02-03}}. See also the [http://www.voeoe.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Busch-Luety_Duerr_1992_Oekonomie-und-Natur_VfS.pdf online version (PDF)] and the preliminary remark.&lt;/ref&gt; During the discussion, it turned out that the point of view presented had no backing among the attendees of VfS, and Busch-Lüty and colleagues decided to establish an independent society.&lt;ref name="cblhpd"/&gt; Busch-Lüty initiated in 1996 the establishment of VÖÖ as part of a small, [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] group of scientists as a German-speaking section of [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] (ISEE).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.oekologisches-wirtschaften.de/index.php/oew/article/download/790/790 Gründung einer Vereinigung für Ökologische Ökonomie im deutschsprachigen Raum: Call for Members].'' In: Ökologisches Wirtschaften, 1/1996. Accessed February 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The local mayor and former [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Beate Weber]] acted as a [[patronage|patron]] of the constitutive conference in April 1996 in [[Heidelberg]]. The 50 scientists present shared the belief that the calls of [[Earth Summit|Rio Earth Summit 1992]] for establishing a [[sustainable development]] are legitimate and need to be realized.&lt;ref name="leitbild"&gt;VÖÖ: [http://www.voeoe.de/die-voo/ Wir über uns, Leitbild], accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the insight that [[economic growth]] would be the wrong answer to persistent ecological problems, the scientists wanted to act strategically to alter the academic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Arne Daniels|Periodical=[[Die Zeit]]|Issue=18|Year=1996|Date=  1996|language=German|URL=http://www.zeit.de/1996/18/Teleunternehmen_Amerikanische_Hochzeit_Brauereien_Schwaebische_Allianz_Eurotunnel_Franzoesisch-briti/seite-2|Format= Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==
The society argues that the economic sciences are overcharged with the necessary transformation and claims, that other scientific fields, politics open to change and the cultural forces of the society as a whole are necessary to implement and shape the change assumed necessary.&lt;ref name="leitbild" /&gt; Since the beginning, VÖÖ emphasized the necessity of a [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Peter Finke|EditorSurname1=Vereinigung für Ökologische Ökonomie e.V.|EditorSurname2=Irmi Seidl|Periodical=Ökologische Ökonomie: Ansätze zur Positionsbestimmung der Vereinigung für Ökologische Ökonomie|Title=Transdisziplinarität und Methodologie |Year=1999|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;6–16|Date=  1999|language=German}}. [http://www.voeoe.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/voeoe-1-1999-oekologische-oekonomie.pdf Online access (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2010, VÖÖ was involved with establishing the concept of [[sustainability]] in its ecological, social and economic perspective.&lt;ref name="finke"&gt;Peter Finke: [http://www.voeoe2010.uni-freiburg.de/Dateien/peter-finke_-die-voeoe-am-scheideweg.pdf Die VÖÖ am Scheideweg] (PDF; 23&amp;nbsp;kB), accessed February 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a reorientation in 2010, the society promotes a [[post-growth]] economy based on the concepts of [[Niko Paech]] and others.&lt;ref name="leitbild" /&gt; The concept of [[sustainable growth]] is considered to be an [[oxymoron]],&lt;ref name="finke" /&gt; and the importance of [[eco-efficiency]], consistency and [[eco-sufficiency]] is emphasized.
