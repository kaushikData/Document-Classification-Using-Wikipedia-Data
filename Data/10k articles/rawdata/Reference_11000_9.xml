'''''A Guide to Window-Dressing''''' (sometimes [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylised]] as '''''A Guide to Window Dressing''''' or '''''A guide to window-dressing''''') is an illustrated [[anonymous work|anonymous publication]] and [[handbook]] on the subject of [[window-dressing]] first printed in London in 1883.&lt;ref name="GuideToWindowDressing1"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Guide to Window-Dressing |last= Anonymous |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1883 |publisher= W H &amp; L Collingridge |location= London |isbn= |page= 1 |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest known books printed on the topic specifically, providing detailed instructions and guidelines on window-dressing, drapery and display windows for the use of professional retailers and privately owned homes.

Through its descriptions of virtual topics in business, [[marketing]] techniques associated with window product display, and the use of windows as fashionable parts of residential spaces, the book is considered a seminal work on minute advertising procedures and [[home decor]] techniques exercised in late-19th-century Europe.

Through a lack of general reprinting, the work is considered extremely rare. As of February 2010, [[WorldCat.org]] displays only one result for the book in worldwide public libraries – the [[Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="GuideToWindowDressing5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/guide-to-window-dressing/oclc/39203562&amp;referer=brief_results |title= A guide to window-dressing. |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher= WorldCat.org|location= |page= |pages= |at= |trans-title=|format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 21 February 2010 |quote= |ref= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reprinted version was published in 2008 by the rare and out-of-print book publisher [[Kessinger Publishing]] under {{ISBN|1-4367-3078-3}}.&lt;ref name="GuideToWindowDressing6"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Guide To Window Dressing (1883) |last= Anonymous |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2008 |publisher= Kessinger |location=  Whitefish, Montana, United States |isbn=1-4367-3078-3 |page= |pages= |url=http://www.kessinger.net/searchresults-orderthebook.php?ISBN=1436730783 |accessdate= 21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''A Guide to Window-Dressing'' is designated with the [[OCLC]] number 39203562.

== Background ==

According to the original 1883 text, ''A Guide to Window-Dressing'' was first published earlier that year in a local [[periodical]], ''[[The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal]]''.  The journal article was written and submitted anonymously, the book citing the periodical's headquarters as "London: office of 'The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal,' 148 and 149, [[Aldersgate Street]], E.C." The book adapted was published by the now defunct [[W H &amp; L Collingridge]] publishing house, at the [[City Press (London)|City Press]] located on the same street.&lt;ref name="GuideToWindowDressing1" /&gt;

The preface to the book states that it was created in response to numerous inquiries to the proprietors of ''The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal'' for a comprehensive work on window-dressing, and goes on to promote itself by stating the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No such book in connection with the [[drapery]] trade has, so far as they [the journal proprieters] are aware, been hitherto published, with the exception of a small prize essay published several years ago in connection with the same journal."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name="GuideToWindowDressing3"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Guide to Window-Dressing |last= Anonymous |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1883 |publisher= W H &amp; L Collingridge |location= London |isbn= |page= 3 |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Google Books]] and a library stamp seen on its facsimile of the guide, an extant copy of the first edition was found in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford University, first placed in the library's collections on 9 March 1987. This copy appears as a full-view readable version on that website, digitised on 1 May 2007.&lt;ref name="GuideToWindowDressing2"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Guide to Window-Dressing |last= Anonymous |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1883 |publisher= WH and L Collingridge |location= London |isbn= |page= 2 |pages= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuideToWindowDressing4"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPEHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=A+Guide+to+Window-Dressing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;rview=1&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title= "A guide to window-dressing" – Book Overview |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher= Google Books|location= |page= |pages= |at= |trans-title=|format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 13 February 2010 |quote= |ref= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrations provided in the first edition of the work are, like the author, also uncredited.

== Contents ==

The first edition of the book had been divided into a preface, a table of contents and 15 chapters following them. These are chronicled as follows:

* Preface
* Contents
* Chapters
** I (1) — The Importance of a Good Window
** II (2) — Qualifications to Attain Success
** III (3) — Colour
** IV (4) — The Silk Window
** V (5) — The Print Window

Each section of the book addresses different aspects of window-dressing and their respectable applications, and puts forward a common aesthetic value for distinct types of windows and window display.

ASEAN's acronymitis|author=William Pesek|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2007-08-05|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are widely used in different sectors of Philippine society. Often, due to long full names of the institutions in the Philippines, acronyms are then utilized to shorten the name of an institution or a company in the country, making it more convenient to the majority of the [[Philippine population]], but sometimes causing ambiguity.

==Cultural predominance==

===Geography===
Geography is one area prone to acronyms. Many times, when a group of places is formed, instead of coining a descriptive term for the group, an acronym that stands for the individual places is created. An example outside the Philippines is [[Benelux]], which stands for the countries of [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].

A premiere example in the Philippines is ''Luzviminda''. This is an acronym that stands for [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]], the three island groupings of the country. Luzviminda is actually used as a name for many [[Filipino people|Filipino]] women. Another example in the [[Philippines]] is the region [[CALABARZON]]. This is a region consisting of the provinces of [[Cavite]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], [[Rizal]], and [[Quezon]].&lt;ref name="manila-times-2008-05-05"&gt;{{cite news|title=Redrawing the nation |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/may/04/yehey/opinion/20080504opi1.html |author= |work=[[The Manila Times]] |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2008-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515194337/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/may/04/yehey/opinion/20080504opi1.html |archivedate=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CALABARZON was split off from the former [[Southern Tagalog]] region in 2002. The region containing the remaining provinces in Southern Tagalog is also named as an acronym, [[MIMAROPA]], which stands for the provinces of [[Mindoro]] (Occidental and Oriental), [[Marinduque]], [[Romblon]], and [[Palawan]].&lt;ref name="manila-times-2008-05-05" /&gt; A last example is CAMANAVA, which stands for [[Caloocan]], [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]], and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]]&amp;mdash;all of which are located in Metro Manila.

==Entity uses==
Acronyms are not only prevalent in geography.

Many business owners also use acronyms in their company names. The name of the popular clothing company, Bench, is actually an acronym for the company's president, Ben Chan.

Acronyms are even used to name TV shows. Popular noontime variety shows like ''SOP'' and ''ASAP'' have appropriated common acronyms as the name of the TV show.

===Politics===
In political campaigns, many candidates names become acronyms stating their political platforms. A particularly stilted political acronym used was the slogan used by the [[People Power Coalition]] (PPC) in the 2001 senatorial elections: VOT FOR D CHAMPP. The slogan is an acronym that stands for the names of the 13 senator candidates fielded by PPC. The 11 administration senators who voted YES to block the opening of the second envelope during Estrada's impeachment trial were called "Jose's Cohort": Jaworski, Osmeña, Santiago, Enrile, Sotto, Coseteng, Oreta, Honasan, Ople, Revilla, Tatad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">The '''Bücherei des Schocken Verlag''' ("Library of the [[Schocken Verlag]]" in German) sometimes informally referred to as ''beliebte Reihe der Schocken-Bücherei'' ("popular series of the Schocken library")&lt;ref&gt;Spalek et al., ''Deutsche Exilliteratur seit 1933'' (Bern: Francke, 1976) 284.&lt;/ref&gt; with its distinct, uniform style is widely considered "one of the most important manifestations of the spiritual life of [[Jew]]s in Germany between 1933 and 1938" ("wichtigsten Erscheinungen des geistigen Lebens").&lt;ref&gt;Gödde et al. (ed.): Walter Benjamin,''Gesammelte Briefe: 1931-1934'' (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1998) 447n&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceived by [[Salman Schocken]], in consultation with Buber, Moritz Spitzer, and Lambert Schneider,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony David, ''The Patron. A Life of S. Schocken, 1877 - 1959'' (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; the series was "designed to select from the wellsprings of all Jewish literature texts of peculiar relevance to Jewish readers in Nazi Germany. In the spirit of the very first title--Isaiah's prophecies of comfort in the new translation by Buber and Rosenzweig--each selection vibrated with levels of meaning that comprised consolation and instruction."&lt;ref&gt;Ismar Schorsch, "German Judaism: From Confession to Culture" in Paucker et al. (ed.),''Die Juden Im Nationalsozialistischen Deutschland: The Jews in Nazi Germany, 1933-1943'' (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1986) 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer, in his position as editor of the Verlag, invited [[Walter Benjamin]] to help with the series.&lt;ref&gt;Gödde et al. (ed.): Walter Benjamin, ''Gesammelte Briefe: 1931-1934'' (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1998) 447&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider, as co-owner, brought with him the backlist from his Lambert Schneider Verlag, including ''Die Schrift'', the Buber-Rosenzweig translation of the [[Tanakh]].

In a representative assessment of the imprint's impact, [[Ismar Schorsch]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is most remarkable about this inspired series is its almost unbounded cultural range and the speed at which it was produced. The 83 titles convey a conception of Judaism as a religious civilisation that spans the Bible, rabbinic literature, medieval and modern Hebrew poetry, philosophy and mysticism, folklore and popular culture, letters and memoirs, modern belles lettres and poetry in German and Yiddish, as well as works of Jewish history and historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;Ismar Schorsch, "German Judaism: From Confession to Culture" in Paucker et al. (ed.),''Die Juden Im Nationalsozialistischen Deutschland: The Jews in Nazi Germany, 1933-1943'' (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1986) 68. "The format of the series," Schorsch adds," made it somewhat difficult to do more than allude to the accumulating expressions of Jewish music and art."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

More remarkable still is the fact that the series, which began publishing six months ''after'' the [[Nazi book burnings]], continued activity until the end of 1938, when the events following [[Kristallnacht]] made it impossible to continue. The last book in the series, [[Hermann Cohen]]'s ''Briefe'', although dated 1939, was actually printed in late 1938. The previous summer, volume 68, a reprint of ''[[Die Judenbuche]]'', a novel by [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]], was (save for a few copies) pulped by the Nazis. (A second volume 68, Schneersohn's ''Die Geschichte von Chajim'' was printed in its place.) From that point on, the series carried the Nazi-imposed "Jüdischer Buchverlag" (Jewish Publisher) on the title page of all volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Wiechner et Wiesner (ed.), ''In der Sprache der Mörder: Ausstellungsbuch'' (Literaturhaus Berlin, 1993) 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the planned two volumes a month was realized in only one of the five full years of publication (1935; the first five volumes were published in November and December 1933), "the production of a German library of 92 volumes of Jewish culture over a period of five years is testimony not only to the urgency of the hour and the dedication of Moritz Spitzer and Lambert Schneider, but also to the very existence of a living cultural legacy." All in all, the 83 titles represented over a third of the firm's production before it moved from Berlin to Palestine in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Ismar Schorsch, "German Judaism: From Confession to Culture" in Paucker et al. (ed.),''Die Juden Im Nationalsozialistischen Deutschland: The Jews in Nazi Germany, 1933-1943'' (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1986) 69.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series featured the first appearances (or translations) of major works by authors (such as [[S.Y. Agnon]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], and [[Gershom Scholem]]) who would become internationally recognized when the Verlag moved to New York, became [[Schocken Books]], and began publishing these authors (many of them for the first time) in English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6851">The '''Camel Club''' is a group of [[fictional character]]s created by American novelist [[David Baldacci]].  They are the protagonists of five of his novels: [[The Camel Club (novel)|''The Camel Club'']], [[The Collectors (novel)|''The Collectors'']], [[Stone Cold (Baldacci novel)|''Stone Cold'']], [[Divine Justice (novel)|''Divine Justice'']], and ''[[Hell's Corner]]''. The original members are Oliver Stone, Reuben Rhodes, Caleb Shaw, and Milton Farb.  The four are political watch-dogs, who are always looking for conspiracies within the government.

==Camel Club original members==
===Oliver Stone===
Oliver Stone is the leader of the Camel Club.  Stone is the crypt keeper of the Mt. Zion [[United Methodist Church]].  Stone is a false name (his real name, though rarely used, is John Carr), taken because of the real [[Oliver Stone]]'s conspiracy theory-themed movies.  Stone was a former member of the esteemed and fictional "Triple Six" division of the CIA that was composed of highly skilled government assassins.  Stone himself is also monitored by the government, which constantly has agents watching him.  In ''Stone Cold'', people connected to Stone's past are killed by Harry Finn, whose ultimate goal is to kill former CIA Director Carter Gray.

===Reuben Rhodes===
A [[West Point]] graduate and Vietnam vet, Reuben worked for the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] but quit and became a war protester.  After a few years of drug usage in England, Rhodes returned to the States, where he met Stone, who got him a job unloading trucks.  He and Stone are the best [[Marksman|marksmen]] in the group.

===Caleb Shaw===
Caleb Shaw is an employee of the Rare Book Wing of the [[Library of Congress]].  He, like Rhodes, was a protestor of the Vietnam war.  Shaw holds twin doctorates in [[political science]] and eighteenth century literature.  Shaw is also known for always wearing clothing from the 19th century.  In ''The Collectors'', Shaw's boss is murdered in the sealed Rare Book Room.

===Milton Farb===
Farb was a child prodigy who suffers from extreme [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[paranoia]].  As a child, his parents had him act in a side show, adding extremely high numbers in his head and reciting extremely long sections of text without faltering.  As is shown in ''Stone Cold'', Farb's gifts allow him to win extremely high amounts of money at casino games, such as blackjack.  Farb was hired by the National Health Institute, but was fired after sending a threatening letter to the President.  Stone met him and got him on the TV show ''[[Jeopardy!]]''  With medication, Farb was able to make a small fortune, with which he started a company for designing Web sites.  Farb was the first of the group to warm up to Annabelle Conroy. 

==Additional members==
Along with the original four, the Camel Club acquires additional members from people who share similar goals.

===Alex Ford===
A Secret Service agent, Ford helps the group in the first book, ''The Camel Club'', as they try to uncover a conspiracy that involves the kidnapping of President James H. Brennan and a captured Muslim terrorist. He is made a member of the Club at the end of the book.  In ''The Collectors'', Oliver Stone asks for Ford's help as part of the climax of the novel. In ''Stone Cold'', he helps Annabelle Conroy in her escape from casino king and mobster, Jerry Bagger.

===Kate Adams===
A lawyer with the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ), part-time bartender and Alex Ford's girlfriend. She, too, assists the Camel Club in ''The Camel Club'', and becomes a member at the end of the book. She and Ford have broken up by ''Stone Cold''.

===Annabelle Conroy===
A compulsive thief, Conroy runs scams on people to steal large amounts of money, including stealing millions from New Jersey mob boss Jerry Bagger. Conroy was briefly married (annulled) to Jonathan DeHaven, the director of the Rare Book Room at the [[Library of Congress]]. DeHaven's house was found to be the hiding place for a first edition of the [[Bay Psalm Book]], which was later revealed to have been stolen by Conroy.  During ''Stone Cold'' she joins the Camel Club in the fight against Jerry Bagger and Harry Finn.

The '''Center for the History of Collecting''' is a research institute of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]], which is attached to [[The Frick Collection]]. It promotes and sponsors the study of the history of collecting.

== History ==
Housed in the [[Frick Art Reference Library]] at 10 East 71st Street (between Madison and Fifth Avenue) in New York City, the Center for the History of Collecting was established in 2007 to encourage and sustain research on the development of public and private art collections in Europe and the United States from the early modern period to the present.&lt;ref name=wsj2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Ralph|title=The Art of Collecting|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323936804578229893194035224|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neyfakh|first1=Leon|title=At the Frick, a Focus on the Collector as Art History|url=http://observer.com/2009/11/at-the-frick-a-focus-on-the-collector-as-art-history/|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=The Observer|date=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumviews.com/2010/11/interview-with-the-frick-collections-inge-reist-on-collectors-merchant-princes-2/|title=Homa Taj In Conversation with The Frick Collections’ Inge Reist on Collectors &amp; Merchant Princes|work=museumviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center supports a broad range of intellectual initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/18/entertainment/la-ca-collectors-20100718|title=American art collectors ripe for study|first=Suzanne |last=Muchnic|publisher=LA Times|date=18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes and hosts a regular calendar of symposia, specialist lectures, and study days, and it contributes to undergraduate and graduate seminars taught in collaboration with local colleges. It also offers long and short term fellowships in the history of collecting, which attract scholars researching diverse aspects of cultural history. In addition, the center created and continues to expand a major digital archive of art collectors and dealers, and it is collaborating on the creation of software that will aid in the study of visual history. The center has an active publications program and awards a biennial book prize for excellent contributions to the History of Collecting in America.

From its inception under the leadership of founding director Inge Reist, the Center has had an advisory committee consisting of academics, collectors, librarians, archivists, and curators. In 2014, a Fellows Committee was introduced to garner financial support and to gather a dedicated community of individuals interested in engaging with collecting practices, especially through visits to the homes of private collectors.

[[Image:Thechildrenoflirduncan1914.jpg|thumb|''The Children of Lir'' (1914) by [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] ]]

The '''''Children of Lir''''' ({{lang-ga|Oidheadh chloinne Lir}}) is a legend from [[Irish mythology]]. It is a tale from the post-Christianisation period that mixes magical elements such as druidic wands and spells with a Christian message of faith bringing freedom from suffering.

==Naming and manuscripts==
Named in Irish as ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir'', the tale is today often known simply as "The Children of Lir" but the title has also been rendered as ''The Tragic Story of the Children of Lir'' or ''The Fate of the Children of Lir'', or, from the earlier title ''Aided Chlainne Lir'', as ''The Violent Death of the Children of Lir''.{{sfn|MacKillop|2004|loc = Entry for ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir''}}

In post 18th-century scholarship the tale has often been grouped with the ''Oidheadh chloinne Uisnigh'' ("The Fate of the Children of Uisnigh") and ''Oidheadh chloinne Tuireann'' ("The Fate of the Children of Tuireann") as the ''Trí truagha na sgéalaigheachta'', i.e. "The three sorrows of storytelling," also known as "The Three Sorrowful Tales of Erin."&lt;ref name="van1"&gt;{{citation| title = Oidheadh chloinne Lir| url =http://vanhamel.nl/codecs/Oidheadh_chloinne_Lir | work = vanhamel.nl }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|MacKillop|2004|loc =Entries for ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir'', ''Trí Truagha na Sgéalaigheachta''}}  Scholar and folklorist [[Robin Flower]] has suggested that all three tales may have had a common author sometime in the 14th century, by someone in the circle of the [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]]s in north-west [[Connacht]].{{sfn|Breatnach|1999|p=1}}

Manuscripts containing early versions of the tales include MS 72.1.38 and MS 72.2.6 at the [[National Library of Scotland]], MS Egerton 164 at the [[British Library]], and MS 24 A 13, and MS E vi 4 at the library of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref name="van1"/&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Ler swans Millar.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Lêr and the Swans'' by [[H. R. Millar|H.R. Millar]]'s (1905)]]
:''Based on {{harv|Duffy|1883|}} ; a point summary is given in {{harvnb|Duffy|1883|pp=xv-xvi}} Numerals refer to those in the point summary and in Duffy's text itself.''

The legendary historical setting of the story is the end of the dominion of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] in Ireland, and the corresponding rise of the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]].{{sfn|Duffy|1883|p=vii}}

[2-9] [[Bodb Derg]] was elected king of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], to the annoyance of Lir, who felt himself should have been chosen; Lir did not swear obedience to the new King, to the annoyance of those that elected him, causing strife, though Bodb sought to appease them. After some time Lir's wife died - to appease Lir, Bodb gave one of his daughters, Aoibh, to him in marriage - Lir agreed that he would yield the lordship, and form an alliance - ending the strike.

[10-13] Aoibh bore Lir four children: one girl, [[Fionnuala|Fionnghuala]], and three sons, [[Aed (god)|Aodh]] and twins, Fiachra and Conn. After the birth of the twins Aoibh died, causing great grief to Lir, though he was bolstered by his love for the four children. Bodb then sent another of his daughters, Aoife, to marry Lir, which he accepted happily. The children were a joy both to Lir and to Bodb.

[14-18] After a short while Aoife became jealous of the affection given to the four step children. Initially she feigned illness for around a year. One day she set out in her chariot with the four children, with design to kill them, and called her entourage to slay them, stating that because of them she had lost Lir's love, and promising them rich rewards. However they would not help, so she drew a sword, but was not able to follow through with the act. Next she took them to Loch Dairbhreach, and made to bathe - once in the water she cast a spell of metamorphosis to transform them in to four white swans.

[19-23] Fionnghuala rebuked her, stating that her magic power was not as great as that of their friends to undo the spell, and warned her of the revenge she would face - he asked her to set a limit on the time of the spell. She set a period of three hundred years as swan on ''Loch Dairbhreach'';&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Lake of the Oaks, [[Lough Derravaragh|Loch Derryvaragh]].{{harv|Duffy|1883|loc=note 29, p.84}}&lt;/ref&gt; three hundred more on ''Sruth na Maoilé'';&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''Sruth na Maoilé'' aka ''Sruthar na Maoilé Chinntiré'', the strong current near the [[Mull of Kintyre|Mull of Cantire]], see [[Straits of Moyle]].{{harv|Duffy|1883|loc=note 33 pp.84-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three hundred at ''Iorrus Domnann'' and ''Inis Gluairé''.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''Iorrus Domnann'', now known as [[Erris]] in County Mayo; ''Inis Gluairé'', "Glory Island", in the Bay of Erris, County Mayo. {{harv|Duffy|1883|loc = note 34, 35, 36 p.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also foretold that by expiration of the period of the spell Lairgenn (the great-grandson of the King of Connacht), and Deoch (the great-granddaughter of the King of Munster) would be wed. Aoife relented a little and allowed the children to retain the power of speech, stating they would sing plaintive songs without equal, and that they would not be distressed by being in the forms of birds. Aoife the returned to court of Bodb -when he asked why the children were not with her she claimed Lir did not trust him with them, but Bodb was suspicious and sent messengers to Lir.

[24-32] On receiving the messenger Lir became sad, realising Aoifé had done some harmful act. He then set out, and at the shores of ''Loch Dairbhreach'' he encountered the swans singing with human voices. They told him of Aoife's evil act, and Lir and his people lamented, though that night they stayed and listened to the swan's song. Lir reached Bodb, and told him of Aoifé's treachery. Bodb cursed her, saying her suffering would be greater than the children's, and asked what the worst form of being was that she could imagine - Aoifé stated a Demon of the air was the worst, and on this Bodh struck her with a druid's wand, metamorphosing her into such a demon - she flew off and remained that way.

[33-45] Bodb and the people of the De Danann went to Loch Dairbhreach and listened to the swan's singing. Milesians came too, and the music calmed and delighted all who heard it. After three hundred years the time came for the swans to go north to the cold Sruth na Maoilé. At this time it was proclaimed that no swan should be killed in Erin. At the Maoilé a cruel storm separated them, and though they eventually re-united their time there was wretched, with extremes of cold and weather to contend with, but they could not leave, as it was their lot to stay in the waters there.

[46-52] Eventually the swans came across a company of the De Danann and of the Milesians who had been seeking them, led by Aodh and Fergus sons of Bodb - near the mouth of the Banna.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[River Bann]], {{harv|Duffy|1883|loc = note 51 p.87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swans enquired and received good news about the De Danann, Lir, and Bodb. After the allotted time the swans then left for Iorrus Domhnann. There they encountered a young man who took an account of their adventures.

[53-55] One night at Iorrus the cold and weather became so intense that the waters froze, and their feet froze to the ice. Because of their suffering they pleaded to the "King of Heaven" to ease the plight of birds, and having and professing faith in a "true God, perfect, truly intelligent" their pleading was heard, and from then they were protected from storms and bad weather. Eventually the time allotted to Iorrus Domhnann passed and they decided to go to ''Sioth Fionnachaidh'', where Lir lived.

[56-61] However once there, they found it deserted, derelict, and overgrown. The next day they set off for ''Inis Gluairé'' - there many birds congregated around them at the lake. Eventually Saint Patrick and Christianity came to Ireland, and one day the holy man ''Mochaomhóg'' arrive at ''Inis Gluairé'' - the swans heard him ringing a bell calling matins, and became frightened at the sound. However Fionnghuala declared the sound of the bell would liberate them from the curse of the spell, and so they listened to it. When it finished they sang a song. The holy man heard their song, and discovered that it was swans that sang it. Speaking to them he asked if they were the Children of Lir, stating that he had travelled to that place for their sake.

[62-66] The swans put their trust in the holy man, and allowed him to bind them with silver chains. The birds felt no fatigue or distress in their situation in the company of the monk. Eventually the account of the swans reached Deoch, the wife of Lairgnen, the King of Connacht - she asked him to get the swans for her. He sent messenger's immediately but the monk Mochaomhóg refused, making Lairgnen angry. He went to Mochaimhóg himself, and attempted to grasp the swans, but on his touch the swan's feathers fell off revealing three very old men, and an old woman, all lean, and very bony. On this Lairgnen left.

[67-70] Fionnghuala asked the monk to baptise them and to bury each, stating he sensed they were close to death. They were baptised, then died, and were buried. Mochaomhóg was sad for them. That was the fate of the children of Lir.

{{Canon Law}}
The '''''Decretum Gratiani''''', also known as the '''''Concordia discordantium canonum''''' or '''''Concordantia discordantium canonum''''' or simply as the '''''Decretum''''', is a collection of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] compiled and written in the 12th century as a legal textbook by the [[jurist]] known as '''Gratian'''.  It forms the first part of the collection of six legal texts, which together became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''. It was used by [[canonist]]s of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] until Pentecost  (May 19) 1918, when a revised ''[[1917 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law]]'' (''Codex Iuris Canonici'') promulgated by [[Pope Benedict XV]] on 27 May 1917 obtained legal force.&lt;ref&gt;Ap. Const. Providentissima Mater Ecclesia (by Pope Benedict XV, 27 May 1917)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
It was about 1150 that [[#Author|Gratian]], teacher of theology at the monastery of Saints Nabor and Felix and sometimes believed to have been a [[Camaldolese]] monk,&lt;ref name=catenc/&gt; composed the work entitled by himself, ''Concordia discordantium canonum'', but called by others ''Nova collectio, Decreta, Corpus juris canonici'', also ''Decretum Gratiani'', the latter being now the commonly accepted name. He did this to obviate the difficulties which beset the study of practical, external theology (theologia practica externa), i. e. the study of canon law. In spite of its great reputation and wide diffusion, the Decretum has never been recognized by the Church as an official collection.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

It is divided into three parts (''ministeria, negotia, sacramenta''). The first part is divided into 101 distinctions (''distinctiones''), the first 20 of which form an introduction to the general principles of canon Law (tractatus decretalium); the remainder constitutes a tractatus ordinandorum, relative to ecclesiastical persons and function. The second part contains 36 causes (''causæ''), divided into questions (quæstiones), and treat of ecclesiastical administration and marriage; the third question of the 33rd causa treats of the Sacrament of Penance and is divided into 7 distinctions. The third part, entitled "De consecratione", treats of the sacraments and other sacred things and contains 5 distinctions. Each distinction or question contains ''dicta Gratiani'', or [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxims]] of Gratian, and canones. Gratian himself raises questions and brings forward difficulties, which he answers by quoting auctoritates, i. e. canons of councils, decretals of the popes, texts of the Scripture or of the Fathers. These are the canones; the entire remaining portion, even the summaries of the canons and the chronological indications, are called the maxims or dicta Gratiani. It is to be noted that many auctoritates have been inserted in the "Decretum" by authors of a later date. These are the ''Paleœ'', so called from [[Paucapalea]], the name of the principal commentator on the "Decretum". The Roman revisers of the 16th century (1566–82) corrected the text of the "Decree" and added many critical notes designated by the words Correctores Romani.

The ''Decretum'' is quoted by indicating the number of the canon and that of the distinction or of the cause and the question. To differentiate the distinctions of the first part from those of the third, question of the 33rd cause of the second part and those of the third part, the words de Pœn., i. e. ''de Pœnitentiâ'', and de Cons., i. e. ''de Consecratione'' are added to the latter. For instance, "c. 1. d. XI" indicates the first part of the "Decree". distinction XI, canon 1; "c. 1., de Pœn., d. VI," refers to the second part, 33rd cause, question 3, distinction VI, canon 1; "c. 8, de Cons., d. II" refers to the third part, distinction II, canon 8; "c. 8, C. XII, q. 3" refers to the second part, cause XII, question 3, canon 8. Sometimes, especially in the case of well-known and much-quoted canons, the first words are also indicated, e. g., c. Si quis suadente diabolo, C. XVII, q. 4, i. e. the 29th canon of the second part, cause XVII, question 4. Occasionally the first words alone are quoted. In both cases, to find the canon it is necessary to consult the alphabetical tables (printed in all editions of Gratian) that contain the first words of every canon.

==Author==
Gratian ({{lang-lat-med|Gratianus}}) was a [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]yer from [[Bologna]]. He flourished in the mid 12th century. Little else is known about him. 
[[File:Graciano.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Gratian]]
He is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Franciscus Gratianus,&lt;ref&gt;"{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Franciscus Gratianus |volume=XI |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Gratian,&lt;ref name=catenc&gt;Van Hove, Alphonse. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06730a.htm Johannes Gratian]" in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', {{nowrap|Vol. 6}}. Robert Appleton Co. (New York), 1909. Accessed 19 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; or Giovanni Graziano. For a long time he was believed to have been born at the end of the 11th century, at [[Chiusi]] in [[Tuscany]]. He was said to have become a monk at [[Camaldoli]] and then he taught at the [[monastery]] of [[St. Felix]] in Bologna and devoted his life to studying canon law, but contemporary scholarship does not attach credibility to these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last=Noonan |first=John T. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Gratian Slept Here: The Changing Identity of the Father of the Systematic Study of Canon Law |journal=Traditio |volume=35 |issue= |pages=145–172 |publisher= |location= |date= |year=1979 |url= |doi= |id= |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the 11th century, Bologna had been the centre of the study of [[canon law]], as well as of [[Roman law]], after the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' was rediscovered in western Europe. 
Gratian's work was an attempt, using early [[scholasticism|scholastic]] method, to solve seemingly contradictory canons from previous centuries. Gratian quoted a great number of authorities, including the [[Bible]], papal and conciliar legislation, church fathers such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], and secular law in his efforts to reconcile the canons.  Gratian found a place in [[Dante]]'s ''Paradise'' among the doctors of the Church:&lt;ref&gt;[http://danteworlds.laits.utexas.edu/paradiso/04sun.html University of Texas at Austin], accessed June-25-2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{cquote|''This next flamelet issues from Gratian’s smile, he who gave such help to the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|ecclesiastical]] and [[law|civil]] spheres as is acceptable in Paradise.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante]], [http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Italian/DantPar8to14.htm#_Toc64099871 Paradiso Canto X], accessed 25 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He has long been acclaimed as ''Pater Juris Canonici'' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]], "Father of Canon Law"), a title he shares with his successor [[Raymond of Penyafort|St. Raymond of Penyafort]].

==Textual history==
The vulgate version of Gratian's collection was completed at some point after the [[Second Lateran Council]], which it quotes. Research by [[Anders Winroth]] established that some manuscripts of an early version of Gratian's text, which differs considerably from the mainstream textual tradition, have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Winroth (Cambridge 2004), 138&lt;/ref&gt;
With later commentaries and supplements, the work was incorporated into the  ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''. The ''Decretum'' quickly became the standard textbook for students of canon law throughout Europe, but it never received any formal official recognition by the papacy. Only the [[1917 Code of Canon Law|''Codex Juris Canonici'' of 1917]] put it out of use.&lt;ref name=Crompton&gt;Crompton (2006):174&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1997, scholars commonly set the date of completion at 1140, but this accuracy in dating isn't possible after Anders Winroth's groundbreaking scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann &amp; Pennington, ''History of Medieval Canon Law in the Classical Period'', pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Anders Winroth]] shows that the ''Decretum'' existed in two published [[recension]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Winroth, (Cambridge, 2004), 3&lt;/ref&gt; The first dates to sometime after 1139, while the second dates to 1150 at the latest.  There are several major differences between the two recensions:
*The first recension is a more coherent and analytical work.
*The second recension places a much greater emphasis on papal primacy and power.
*The second recension includes Roman law extracts taken directly from the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'', whereas the first recension does not demonstrate substantial familiarity with Roman jurisprudence.
These differences led Winroth to conclude that Roman law was not as far developed by 1140 as scholars had previously thought.  He has also argued that the second recension was due not to the original author of the first recension (whom he calls Gratian 1), but rather another jurist versed in Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Winroth, (Cambridge, 2004), 146-74&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Winroth's thesis of two Gratians remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;See most recently Atria Larson, ''Master of  Penance: Gratian and the Development of Penitential Thought and Law, ca. 1120-1215'', Washington, DC:  Catholic University Press, 2013, arguing for even greater complexity in the addition and adaptation of the text of the ''Decretum''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Treegratian.jpg|thumb|An illustration from a 13th-century manuscript of the work, illustrating the kinds of blood relatives and common ancestry which made marriage impossible and contracted marriages null - it has since then been dispensed with so third cousins can now marry.{{clarify|date=December 2011}}]]

This field of inquiry is hampered by ignorance of the compiler's identity and the existence of manuscripts with abbreviated versions of the text or variant versions not represented by Winroth's two recensions. One of these is the manuscript St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek, 673 (=Sg), which some have argued contains the earliest known version (borrador) of the ''Decretum'',&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Larrainzar, ‘El borrador de la “Concordia” de Graciano: Sankt Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek MS 673 (=Sg)’, ''Ius Ecclesiae: Rivista internazionale di diritto canonico'' 11 (1999): 593-666&lt;/ref&gt; but which other scholars have argued contains an abbreviation of the first recension expanded with texts taken from the second recension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.t-j-l.de/Sg-Entw.PDF Titus Lenherr, "Ist die Handschrift 673 der St. Galler Stiftsbibliothek (Sg) der Entwurf zu Gratians Dekret?: Versuch einer Antwort aus Beobachtungen an D.31 und D.32" (unpublished paper)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402122239/http://www.t-j-l.de/Sg-Entw.PDF |date=2012-04-02 }}; Anders Winroth, “Recent Work on the Making of Gratian’s Decretum,” ''Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law'', n.s. 26 (2004-2006): 1-29; John Wei, “A Reconsideration of St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek 673 (Sg) in light of the Sources of Distinctions 5-7 of the De penitentia,” ''Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law'', n.s. 27 (2007): 141-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gratian's sources ==
Gratian's sources were Roman law, the [[Bible]], the writings of (or attributed to) the [[Church Fathers]], [[papal decretal]]s, the acts of [[ecumenical council|church councils]] and [[synod]]s.  In most cases, Gratian did not obtain this material from a direct reading of the sources, but rather through intermediate collections.  Thanks to the research of modern scholars - in particular, Charles Munier, Titus Lenherr, and Peter Landau - we now know that Gratian made use of a relatively small number of collections in the composition of most of the ''Decretum'', these being:
*[[Anselm of Lucca|Anselm (II) of Lucca]]’s canonical collection, originally compiled around 1083 and existing in four main recensions: A, B, Bb, and C.  Peter Landau suggests that Gratian probably employed a manuscript containing an expanded form of recension A which he calls recension A’;
*the ''Collectio tripartita'' attributed to [[Ivo of Chartres]], usually thought to date to 1095;
*the ''Panormia'' of [[Ivo of Chartres]], also usually dated to 1095, although several scholars have argued for a later date and some even question Ivo's authorship;
*[[Gregory of St. Grisogono]]'s ''Polycarpus'', completed some time after 1111;
*the ''Collection in Three Books'', composed some time between 1111 and 1139, though dated by some to around 1123;
*the ''Glossa ordinaria'' to the Bible.

Other sources are known to have been used in the composition of particular sections of the ''Decretum'':
*[[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''Etymologies'' for DD. 1-9 (the so-called ''Treatise on Laws'');
*[[Alger of Liège]]'s ''Liber de misericordia et iustitia'' for C. 1;
*the ''Sententiae magistri A.'' for the ''De penitentia'' and some other sections.

== Effect ==
Gratian himself named his work ''Concordia Discordantium Canonum'' - "Concord of Discordancies of Canons." The name is fitting: Gratian tried to harmonize apparently contradictory canons with each other, by discussing different interpretations and deciding on a solution. This [[dialectic]]al approach allowed for other law professors to work with the ''Decretum'' and to develop their own solutions and commentaries. These legalists are known as the [[decretist]]s.

{{quote|...the ''Concordance of Discordant Canons'' or ''Decretum'' served the function of giving the canonists a text like that of the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'' for the civilians or the bible for the theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, Jr., ''A Crisis of Law?'', pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These commentaries were called [[Gloss (annotation)|glosses]]. Editions printed in the 15th, 16th or 17th centuries frequently included the glosses along with the text. Collections of glosses were called "gloss apparatus" or ''Lectura in Decretum'' (see also [[glossator]]). Systematic commentaries were called ''Summae''. Some of these ''Summae'' were soon in circulation as well and obtained the same level of fame as the ''Decretum'' itself. Early commentators included [[Paucapalea]] and [[Magister Rolandus]]. The most important commentators were probably  [[Rufinus (decretist)|Rufin of Bologna]] (died before 1192) and [[Huguccio]] (died 1210). Less well-known was the commentary of [[Simon of Bisignano]], which consisted of the ''Glosses on the Decretum'' and the ''Summa Simonis''.

[[Peter Lombard]] borrowed and adapted from the ''Decretum'' when discussing [[penance]] in his ''[[Sentences]]'' (≈1150).&lt;ref&gt;See Appendix B in Larson, ''Master of  Penance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance to Western law===

The ''Decretum'' served as a model for 12th century jurists in the formation of Western law based on rational rules and evidence to replace barbaric laws which often involved trial by ordeal or battle.&lt;ref name="Woods_2005"&gt;{{cite book|title= How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization |last=Woods |first= Thomas E.|year= 2005|publisher =Regency Publishing|location= Washington, DC|isbn= 0-89526-038-7|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Decretum'' was called "the first comprehensive and systematic legal treatise in the history of the West, and perhaps in the history of mankind- if by 'comprehensive' is meant the attempt to embrace virtually the entire law of a given polity, and if by 'systematic' is meant the express effort to that law as a single body, in which all parts are viewed as interacting to form a whole.  ''Decretum'' made a direct contribution to the development of Western law in areas that it dealt with such as marriage, property and inheritance.  Specific  concepts included consent for marriage and wrongful intent in determining whether a certain act constituted a crime.&lt;ref name="Woods_2005"/&gt;

The '''Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs''' was a [[encyclical|letter]] issued in May, 1848 by the four eastern [[patriarch]]s of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], who met at Council in [[Constantinople]]. It was addressed to all Eastern Orthodox Christians, as a response against [[pope Pius IX]]'s ''[[Epistle to the Easterners]]'', issued in January (1848).{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|p=89-90}} 

The encyclical was solemnly addressed to "All the Bishops Everywhere, Beloved in the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]], Our Venerable, Most Dear Brethren; and to their Most Pious Clergy; and to All the Genuine Orthodox Sons of the [[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church]]." The encyclical explicitly denounces the [[Filioque clause]] added by Rome to the [[Nicene Creed]] as a heresy, censures the [[papacy]] for missionizing among Eastern Orthodox Christians, and repudiates [[Ultramontanism]] (papal supremacy).  It also describes the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as being in [[apostasy]], [[heresy]], and [[Schism (religion)|schism]].

In the course of all this, it notably makes reference to the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Eighth Ecumenical Council]] (879-880), in contrast with the opinion of many modern Eastern Orthodox Christians that there are only seven [[Ecumenical Councils]] accepted by the Orthodox Church.

The '''Estonian Open Air Museum''' ({{lang-et|Eesti Vabaõhumuuseum}}) is a life-sized reconstruction of an 18th-century rural/fishing village, which comes complete with church, inn, schoolhouse, several mills, a fire station, twelve farmyards and net sheds. The site spans 72 hectares of land and contains about 80 separate buildings and is located 8&amp;nbsp;km to the west of [[Tallinn]] city center at [[Rocca al Mare]]. Established in 1957, the museum showcases 68 farmhouses assembled into twelve farmyards from North, South and West [[Estonia]].

Along with the farmyards, old public buildings are arranged singularly and in groups in a way that represents an overview of [[Estonian vernacular architecture]] of the past two centuries.

The plans for founding the museum were first discussed in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evm.ee/id/13/ Muuseumist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154104/http://www.evm.ee/id/13/ |date=2012-01-03 }} (in Estonian)&lt;/ref&gt; when Estonian literati, inspired by Scandinavian open-air museums, wanted to establish such a museum in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Wood structures: a global forum on the treatment, conservation, and repair of cultural heritage |year= 2000 |publisher= ASTM International |isbn= 0-8031-2497-X |author= Stephen J.

'''FishBase''' is a [[Global Species Database|global species database]] of [[fish]] species (specifically [[finfish]]).&lt;ref&gt;Froese R and Pauly D (eds) (2000) [http://fishbase.org/manual/english/contents.htm ''FishBase 2000: concepts, design and data sources''] ICLARM, Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest and most extensively accessed online database on adult finfish on the web.&lt;ref name=Pew&gt;[http://www.pewenvironment.org/research-programs/marine-fellow/id/8589941905 Marine Fellow: Rainer Froese] ''Pew Environment Group''.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has "evolved into a dynamic and versatile ecological tool" that is widely cited in scholarly publications.&lt;ref&gt;Stergiou KI and Tsikliras AC (2006) [http://ichthyology.bio.auth.gr/files/tsikliras/d/d3.pdf Scientific impact of FishBase: A citation analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008223552/http://ichthyology.bio.auth.gr/files/tsikliras/d/d3.pdf |date=8 October 2011 }} In: Palomares MLD, Stergiou KI and Pauly D (eds.), ''Fishes in Databases and Ecosystems''. ''[[UBC Fisheries Centre]]'', Research reports '''14'''(4): 2–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.us/References/FBRefList.php References Citing FishBase] FishBase. Last modified 5 July 2010. Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

FishBase provides comprehensive species data, including information on [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], geographical distribution, [[biometrics]] and [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], behaviour and habitats, ecology and [[population dynamics]] as well as reproductive, metabolic and genetic data. There is access to tools such as [[trophic pyramid]]s, [[identification key]]s, [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] modelling and fishery statistics and there are direct species level links to information in other databases such as [[LarvalBase]], [[GenBank]], the [[IUCN Red List]] and the [http://research.calacademy.org/redirect?url=http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/Ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp Catalog of Fishes].&lt;ref&gt;Gert B and Snoeks J (2004) [http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/76736.pdf#page=48 "FishBase: encyclopaedia and research tool"] Page 48, VLIZ Special Publication 17, Brugge, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|11}}, FishBase included descriptions of 34,000 [[species]] and subspecies, 323,200 [[common name]]s in almost 300 [[language]]s, 58,900 pictures, and references to 55,300 works in the [[scientific literature]]. The site has about 700,000 unique visitors per month.&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.fishbase.org FishBase] web page, accessed November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origins of FishBase go back to the 1970s, when the fisheries scientist [[Daniel Pauly]] found himself struggling to test a hypothesis on how the growing ability of fish was affected by the size of their gills.&lt;ref name=Bakun&gt;Bakun A (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=baUySByM5DIC "The oxygen constraint"] Pages 11–23. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) ''Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-13022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses, such as this one, could be tested only if large amounts of empirical data were available.&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly"&gt;Palomares MLD and Bailly N (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=baUySByM5DIC "Organizing and disseminating marine biodiversity information: the Fishbase and SeaLifeBase story"] Pages 24–46. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) ''Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-13022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, [[fisheries management]] used analytical models which required estimates for fish growth and [[Fish mortality|mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Monro JL (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=baUySByM5DIC "Assessment of exploited stock of tropical fishes: an overview"] Pages 171–188. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) ''Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-13022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be difficult for [[fishery scientist]]s and managers to get the information they need on the species that concern them, because the relevant facts can be scattered across and buried in numerous journal articles, reports, newsletters and other sources. It can be particularly difficult for people in developing countries who need such information. Pauly believed that the only practical way fisheries managers could access the volume of data they needed was to assemble and consolidate all the data available in the published literature into some central and easily accessed repository.&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AFS &gt;[http://www.larvalbase.org/Downloads/ELHSMay2002.pdf LarvalBase: A Global Information System on Fish Larvae] ''American Fisheries Society'', Early Life History Section Newsletter, May 2002, '''23'''(2): 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a database would be particularly useful if the data has also been standardised and validated.&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly"/&gt; This would mean that when scientists or managers need to test a new hypothesis, the available data will already be there in a validated and accessible form, and there will be no need to create a new dataset and then have to validate it.&lt;ref&gt;Froese R (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=baUySByM5DIC "The science in FishBase"] Pages 47–54. In: Villy Christensen and Jay Maclean (Eds.) ''Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries: A Global Perspective'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-13022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pauly recruited [[Rainer Froese]], and the beginnings of a software database along these lines was encoded in 1988. This database, initially confined to tropical fish, became the prototype for FishBase. FishBase was subsequently extended to cover all [[finfish]], and was launched on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] in August 1996. It is now the largest and most accessed online database for fish in the world.&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly" /&gt; In 1995 the first [[CD-ROM]] was released as "FishBase 100". Subsequent CDs have been released annually. The software runs on [[Microsoft Access]] which operates only on [[Microsoft Windows]].

FishBase covers adult finfish, but does not detail the early and juvenile stages of fish. In 1999 a complimentary database, called [[LarvalBase]], went online under the supervision of Bernd Ueberschär. It covers [[ichthyoplankton]] and the juvenile stage of fishes, with detailed data on fish [[Fish egg|eggs]] and [[larva]]e, fish [[Identification (biology)|identification]], as well as data relevant to the rearing of young fish in [[aquaculture]]. Given FishBase's success, there was a demand for a database covering forms of aquatic life other than finfish. This resulted, in 2006, in the birth of [[SeaLifeBase]].&lt;ref name="Palomares and Bailly" /&gt; The long-term goal of SeaLifeBase is to develop an information system modelled on FishBase, but including all forms of aquatic life, both marine and freshwater, apart from the finfish which FishBase specialises in. Altogether, there are about 300,000 known species in this category.&lt;ref name=home&gt;[http://www.sealifebase.org/home/pages/index.htm SeaLifeBase – home page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814093158/http://www.sealifebase.org/home/pages/index.htm |date=14 August 2011 }} Accessed 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current organization==
As awareness of FishBase has grown among fish specialists, it has attracted over 2,310 contributors and collaborators. Since 2000 FishBase has been supervised by a consortium of nine international institutions. To date, the FishBase consortium has grown to twelve members. The [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel|GEOMAR - Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research for Ocean Research Kiel]] (GEOMAR) in Germany, functions as the coordinating body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/home.htm FishBase] Home page.

The '''Five Roses Cook Book''' was first published in 1913 by [[Lake of the Woods Milling Company]]. It is the longest-running recipe collection from a [[Canada|Canadian]] flour company.&lt;ref name="Driver2003"&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Five-Roses-Guide-Good-Cooking/dp/1552854582 Five Roses: A Guide to Good Cooking].

In 2003, a printed copy of the 1967 edition was produced, with an historical introduction by Elizabeth Driver, a food historian who has written extensively on cookbooks. The original edition had recipes submitted by women in a contest run by the Lake of the Woods Milling Company and cost approximately 40 cents.&lt;ref name="Food Historian on Cookbooks, The Globe &amp; Mail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-historian-on-cookbooks/article22501322/|title=Food historian on cookbooks|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2018|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn''''' - literally "Foundation of Knowledge on Ireland" but most often known in English as "The History of Ireland"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dh.tcd.ie/clontarf/Describing%20the%20Battle%3A%20Keating's%20'Foras%20Feasa%20ar%20%C3%89irinn'%20(1643)%20 "Describing the Battle - Keating's ''Foras Feasa ar Éireann'' (1643)], Battle of Clontarf, Trinity College Dublin, retrieved 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; - is a narrative history of Ireland by [[Geoffrey Keating]], written in [[Irish language|Irish]] and completed {{circa|1634}}.&lt;ref name=odbnb&gt;Bernadette Cunningham, ‘Keating, Geoffrey [Seathrún Céitinn] (b. c.1580, d. in or before 1644)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15224 accessed 17 Sept 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with a preface in which Keating defends the honour of Ireland against the denigrations of writers such as [[Giraldus Cambrensis]],&lt;ref name=HI&gt;Bernadette Cunningham, [http://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/geoffrey-keatings-foras-feasa-ar-eirinn/ "Geoffrey Keating’s ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn''"], ''History Ireland'' Vol. 9 issue 1, Spring 2001, retrieved 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a narrative history in two parts: part one, from the creation of the world to the arrival of Christianity in the 5th century, and part two, from the 5th century to the coming of the Normans in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=RIA&gt;[https://www.ria.ie/library/special-collections/manuscripts/foras-feasa-ar-eirinn.aspx Library: ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn''], Royal Irish Academy, retrieved 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts Ireland as an autonomous, unitary kingdom of great antiquity. The early part of the work is largely mythical, depicting the history of Ireland as a succession of invasions and settlements, and derives primarily from medieval writings such as the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', the ''[[Dindsenchas]]'', royal genealogies and stories of heroic kings. The later part depicts the Normans as the latest in this series of settlers.&lt;ref name=HI /&gt; Keating, a Catholic priest of Anglo-Norman descent, gave Irish people of both Gaelic and Norman ancestry a shared place in the history of the nation,&lt;ref name=RIA /&gt; and emphasised the role of the Church as a unifying factor in Irish society.&lt;ref name=HI /&gt;

The work was extremely popular, surviving in a large number of manuscripts,&lt;ref name=BB&gt;Brendan Bradshaw, Andrew Hadfield and Willy Maley, ''Representing Ireland: Literature and the Origins of Conflict, 1534-1660'', Cambridge University Press, 1993, pp. 166-168&lt;/ref&gt; and its prose style became the standard followed by generations of Irish-language writers.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmuid Ó Murchadha (2005) [http://www.nui.ie/eigse/pdf/vol35/eigse35.pdf "A review of some placename material from ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn''",] ''[[Éigse]], A Journal of Irish Studies'', Vol. 35, p. 81, National University of Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was received critically from the start, with [[Sir Richard Cox, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Cox]] describing it in the 1680s as "an ill-digested heap of very silly fictions".&lt;ref name=HI /&gt; Modern scholars view it in the context of the antiquarian tendency of [[Renaissance humanism]], with Keating expounding on ancient Irish sources, whose authority he defends, to provide "an origin-legend for Counter-Reformation Catholic Ireland."&lt;ref name=BB /&gt;

{{Loop constructs}}

'''For each''' (or '''foreach''', sometimes called an '''iterative for-loop''') is a [[control flow]] statement for traversing items in a [[Collection class|collection]]. Foreach is usually used in place of a standard [[for loop|for]] [[statement (programming)|statement]]. Unlike other for loop constructs, however, foreach loops&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.digitalmars.com/d/statement.html#ForeachStatement

}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually maintain no explicit counter: they essentially say "do this to everything in this set", rather than "do this ''x'' times". This avoids potential [[off-by-one error]]s and makes code simpler to read. In object-oriented languages an [[iterator]], even if implicit, is often used as the means of traversal.

The ''foreach'' statement in some languages has some defined order, processing each item in the collection from the first to the last.
The ''foreach'' statement in many other languages does not have any particular order, especially [[array programming]] languages, in order to support [[loop optimization]] in general and in particular to allow [[vector processing]] to process some or all of the items in the collection simultaneously.

== Syntax ==
Syntax varies among languages. Most use the simple word &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, roughly as follows:

 for each item in collection:
   do something to item

== Language support ==

[[Programming language]]s which support foreach loops include [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]], [[ActionScript]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C++11]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[ColdFusion Markup Language]] (CFML), [[Cobra (programming language)|Cobra]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Daplex]] (query language), [[ECMAScript]], [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (since 1.5, using the [[reserved word]] &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; for the for loop and the foreach loop), [[JavaScript]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Objective-C]] (since 2.0), [[ParaSail (programming language)|ParaSail]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[REALbasic]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], [[Tcl]], [[tcsh]], [[Unix shell]]s, [[Visual Basic .NET]], and [[Windows PowerShell]]. Notable languages without foreach are [[C (programming language)|C]], and [[C++]] pre-C++11.

=== ActionScript ===

[[ActionScript]] supports foreach loops by key/index and by value:

&lt;source lang="ActionScript"&gt;
for ( var key:String in someObject ) {
   var value = someObject[key];
   trace( "someObject[" + key + "] = " + someObject[key] );
}

for each ( var value in someArray ) {
   trace( typeof value + " " + value );
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Typical usage is as shown, but someArray could be any object, and someObject could be an array.

=== Ada ===
{{Wikibooks|Ada Programming|Control}}

[[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] supports foreach loops as part of the normal [[for loop]]. Say X is an [[Array data structure|array]]:

&lt;source lang="Ada"&gt;
for I in X'Range loop
   X (I) := Get_Next_Element;
end loop;
&lt;/source&gt;

This syntax is used on mostly arrays, but will also work with other types when a full iteration is needed.

Ada 2012 has generalized loops to foreach loops on any kind of container (array, lists, maps...):

&lt;source lang="Ada"&gt;
for Obj of X loop
   -- Work on Obj
end loop;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== C ===
The language [[C (programming language)|C]] does not have collections or a foreach construct.  However, it has several standard data structures that can be used as collections, and foreach can be made easily with a [[C macro|macro]].

However, two obvious problems occur:
* The macro is unhygienic: it declares a new variable in the existing scope which remains after the loop.
* One foreach macro cannot be defined that works with different collection types (e.g., array and linked list) or that is extensible to user types.

C string as a collection of char
&lt;source lang="C" enclose="div" line="" highlight="4"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
/* foreach macro for using a string as a collection of char */
#define foreach( ptrvar, strvar ) char* ptrvar; for( ptrvar=strvar ; (*ptrvar) != '\0' ; *ptrvar++)

int main(int argc,char* argv[]){
 char* s1 = "abcdefg";
 char* s2 = "123456789";
 foreach (p1, s1) {
  printf("loop 1 %c\n",*p1);
 }
 foreach (p2, s2){
  printf("loop 2 %c\n",*p2);
 }
 exit(0);
 return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

C int array as a collection of int (array size known at compile-time)

&lt;source lang="C" enclose="div" line="" highlight="5"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
/* foreach macro viewing an array of int values as a collection of int values */
#define foreach( intpvar, intary ) int* intpvar; for( intpvar=intary; intpvar &lt; (intary + (sizeof(intary)/sizeof(intary[0]))) ; intpvar++)
 int a1[] = { 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 };
 int a2[] = { 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9 };
 foreach (p1, a1) {
  printf("loop 1 %d\n", *p1);
 }
 foreach (p2, a2){
  printf("loop 2 %d\n", *p2);
 }
 exit(0);
 return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Most general: string or array as collection (collection size known at run-time)
: ''Note: idxtype can be removed and [[typeof]](col[0]) used in its place with [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]]''
&lt;source lang="C" enclose="div" line="" highlight="5"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
#define foreach(idxtype, idxpvar, col, colsiz ) idxtype* idxpvar; for( idxpvar=col ; idxpvar &lt; (col + (colsiz)) ; idxpvar++)
#define arraylen( ary ) ( sizeof(ary)/sizeof(ary[0]) )
 char* c1 = "collection";
 int c2[] = { 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9 };
 double* c3;
 int c3len = 4;
 c3 = (double*)calloc(c3len, sizeof(double)); 
 c3[0] = 1.2; c3[1] = 3.4; c3[2] = 5.6; c3[3] = 7.8;

 foreach (char, p1, c1, strlen(c1) ) {
  printf("loop 1 : %c\n",*p1);
 }
 foreach (int, p2, c2, arraylen(c2) ){
  printf("loop 2 : %d\n",*p2);
 }
 foreach (double, p3, c3, c3len ){
  printf("loop 3 : %3.1lf\n",*p3);
 }
 exit(0);
 return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== C# ===
In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], assuming that myArray is an array of integers:

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;

foreach (int x in myArray) { Console.WriteLine(x); }

&lt;/source&gt;

[[Language Integrated Query]] (LINQ) provides the following syntax, accepting a [[Delegate (CLI)|delegate]] or [[Lambda (programming)|lambda expression]]:

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;

myArray.ToList().ForEach(x =&gt; Console.WriteLine(x));

&lt;/source&gt;

=== C++ ===

[[C++11]] provides a foreach loop. The syntax is similar to that of [[Foreach loop#Java|Java]]:

&lt;source lang="Cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
  int myint[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  for (int i : myint)
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\n';
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Currently, C++11 range-based for statements have been implemented in [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) (since version 4.6), [[Clang]] (since version 3.0) and [[Visual C++]] 2012 (version 11 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/09/12/10209291.aspx |title=C++11 Features in Visual C++ 11 - Visual C++ Team Blog - Site Home - MSDN Blogs |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The C++ STL also supports for_each,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/for_each |title=std::for_each - cppreference |publisher=en.cppreference.com |date= |accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that applies each element to a function, which can be any predefined function or a lambda expression. While the direction of the range-based for is only from the beginning to the end, you can change the direction or range by altering the first two parameters.

&lt;source lang="Cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt; // contains std::for_each
#include &lt;vector&gt;

int main()
{
  std::vector&lt;int&gt; v {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [&amp;](int i)
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\n';
  });

  std::cout &lt;&lt; "reversed but skip 2 elements:\n";

  std::for_each(v.rbegin()+2, v.rend(), [&amp;](int i)
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\n';
  });
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Qt (software)|Qt]], a C++ framework, offers a macro providing foreach loops&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.2/containers.html#the-foreach-keyword |title=Qt 4.2: Generic Containers |publisher=Doc.qt.digia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the STL iterator interface:

&lt;source lang="Cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;QList&gt;
#include &lt;QDebug&gt;

int main()
{
  QList&lt;int&gt; list;

  list &lt;&lt; 1 &lt;&lt; 2 &lt;&lt; 3 &lt;&lt; 4 &lt;&lt; 5;

  foreach (int i, list)
  {
    qDebug() &lt;&lt; i;
  }
}&lt;/source&gt;

[[Boost (C++ libraries)|Boost]], a set of free peer-reviewed portable C++ libraries also provides foreach loops:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Niebler |url=http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/doc/html/foreach.html |title=Chapter 9. Boost.Foreach - 1.53.0 |publisher=Boost.org |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="Cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;boost/foreach.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
int main()
{
  int myint[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 
  BOOST_FOREACH(int &amp;i, myint)
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\n';
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== C++/CLI ===

The [[C++/CLI]] language proposes a construct similar to C#.

Assuming that myArray is an array of integers:
&lt;!-- At the time of writing, there is no documented C++/CLI support in the [[mw:Extension:SyntaxHighlight GeSHi|MediaWiki syntax highliter]] --&gt;
&lt;source lang="c#"&gt;
    for each (int x in myArray)
    {
        Console::WriteLine(x);
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) ===
{{Main|ColdFusion Markup Language}}

==== Script syntax ====

&lt;source lang="cfs"&gt;
// arrays
arrayeach([1,2,3,4,5], function(v){
    writeOutput(v);
});

// or

for (v in [1,2,3,4,5]){
    writeOutput(v);
}

// or

// (Railo only; not supported in ColdFusion)
letters = ["a","b","c","d","e"];
letters.each(function(v){
    writeOutput(v); // abcde
});

// structs
for (k in collection){
    writeOutput(collection[k]);
}

// or

structEach(collection, function(k,v){
    writeOutput("key: #k#, value: #v#;");
});

// or
// (Railo only; not supported in ColdFusion)
collection.each(function(k,v){
    writeOutput("key: #k#, value: #v#;");
});
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Tag syntax ====

&lt;source lang="CFM"&gt;
&lt;!--- arrays ---&gt;
&lt;cfloop index="v" array="#['a','b','c','d','e']#"&gt;
  &lt;cfoutput&gt;#v#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;&lt;!--- a b c d e  ---&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
CFML incorrectly identifies the value as "index" in this construct; the &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; variable does receive the actual value of the array element, not its index.

&lt;source lang="CFM"&gt;
&lt;!--- structs ---&gt;
&lt;cfloop item="k" collection="#collection#"&gt;
    &lt;cfoutput&gt;#collection[k]#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/cfloop&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Common Lisp ===

[[Common Lisp]] provides foreach ability either with the ''dolist'' macro:
&lt;source lang="LISP"&gt;
(dolist (i '(1 3 5 6 8 10 14 17))
  (print i))
&lt;/source&gt;
or the powerful ''loop'' macro to iterate on more data types
&lt;source lang="LISP"&gt;
(loop for i in '(1 3 5 6 8 10 14 17)
      do (print i))
&lt;/source&gt;

and even with the ''mapcar'' function:
&lt;source lang="LISP"&gt;
(mapcar #'print '(1 3 5 6 8 10 14 17))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== D ===
{{Main|D (programming language)}}

&lt;source lang="D"&gt;
foreach(item; set) {
  // do something to item
}
or
foreach(argument) {
  // pass value
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Dart ===
{{Main|Dart (programming language)}}

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
for (final element in someCollection) {
  // do something with element
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Object Pascal, Delphi ===
{{Main|Object Pascal}}

Foreach support was added in [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]] 2005, and uses an enumerator variable that must be declared in the ''var'' section.

&lt;source lang="Delphi"&gt;
for enumerator in collection do
begin
  //do something here
end;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Eiffel ===

The iteration (foreach) form of the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] loop construct is introduced by the keyword &lt;code lang=Eiffel&gt;across&lt;/code&gt;.

In this example, every element of the structure &lt;code&gt;my_list&lt;/code&gt; is printed:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="Eiffel"&gt;
            across my_list as ic loop print (ic.item) end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The local entity &lt;code&gt;ic&lt;/code&gt; is an instance of the library class &lt;code&gt;ITERATION_CURSOR&lt;/code&gt;. The cursor's feature &lt;code&gt;item&lt;/code&gt; provides access to each structure element. Descendants of class &lt;code&gt;ITERATION_CURSOR&lt;/code&gt; can be created to handle specialized iteration algorithms. The types of objects that can be iterated across (&lt;code&gt;my_list&lt;/code&gt; in the example) are based on classes that inherit from the library class &lt;code&gt;ITERABLE&lt;/code&gt;.

The iteration form of the Eiffel loop can also be used as a boolean expression when the keyword &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; is replaced by either &lt;code&gt;all&lt;/code&gt; (effecting [[universal quantification]]) or &lt;code&gt;some&lt;/code&gt; (effecting [[existential quantification]]).

This iteration is a boolean expression which is true if all items in &lt;code&gt;my_list&lt;/code&gt; have counts greater than three:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="Eiffel"&gt;
            across my_list as ic all ic.item.count &gt; 3 end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The following is true if at least one item has a count greater than three:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="Eiffel"&gt;
            across my_list as ic some ic.item.count &gt; 3 end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Go ===

[[Go (programming language)|Go's]] foreach loop can be used to loop over an array, slice, string, map, or channel.

Using the two-value form, we get the index/key (first element) and the value (second element):
&lt;source lang="go"&gt;
for index, value := range someCollection {
	// Do something to index and value
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Using the one-value form, we get the index/key (first element):
&lt;source lang="go"&gt;
for index := range someCollection {
	// Do something to index
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://golang.org/ref/spec#RangeClause | title=Range Clause | publisher=The Go Programming Language | work=The Go Programming Language Specification | accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groovy ===

[[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] supports ''for'' loops over collections like arrays, lists and ranges:

&lt;source lang="Groovy"&gt;
def x = [1,2,3,4]
for (v in x)           // loop over the 4-element array x
{
    println v
}

for (v in [1,2,3,4])   // loop over 4-element literal list 
{
    println v
}

for (v in 1..4)        // loop over the range 1..4
{
    println v
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Groovy also supports a C-style for loop with an array index:

&lt;source lang="Groovy"&gt;
for (i = 0; i &lt; x.size(); i++)
{
    println x[i]
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Collections in Groovy can also be iterated over using the ''each'' keyword
and a closure.  By default, the loop dummy is named ''it''

&lt;source lang="Groovy"&gt;
x.each{ println it }     // print every element of the x array
x.each{i-&gt; println i}    // equivalent to line above, only loop dummy explicitly named "i"
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Haskell ===

[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] allows looping over lists with [[Monad (functional programming)|monadic]] actions using &lt;code&gt;mapM_&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;forM_&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;mapM_&lt;/code&gt; with its arguments flipped) from [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Control-Monad.html Control.Monad]:

{| class="wikitable"
! code !! prints
|-
|
&lt;source lang=Haskell&gt;
mapM_ print [1..4]
&lt;/source&gt;
|
 1
 2
 3
 4
|-
|
&lt;source lang=Haskell&gt;
forM_ "test" $ \char -&gt; do 
    putChar char
    putChar char
&lt;/source&gt;
|
 tteesstt
|}

It's also possible to generalize those functions to work on applicative functors rather than monads and any data structure that is traversable using &lt;code&gt;traverse&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; with its arguments flipped) and &lt;code&gt;mapM&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;forM&lt;/code&gt; with its arguments flipped) from [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Data-Traversable.html Data.Traversable].

=== Haxe ===
{{Main|Haxe}}
&lt;source lang="actionscript"&gt;
for (value in iterable) {
    trace(value);
}

Lambda.iter(iterable, function(value) trace(value));
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Java ===

In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a foreach-construct was introduced in [[Java Development Kit]] (JDK) 1.5.0.&lt;ref name="jdk5release"&gt;
"Enhanced for Loop - This new language construct[...]"
{{cite web
|url=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/index.html
|title=Java Programming Language, Section: Enhancements in JDK 5
|accessdate=2009-05-26
|year=2004
|publisher=[[Sun Microsystems, Inc.]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official sources use several names for the construct. It is referred to as the "Enhanced for Loop",&lt;ref name="jdk5release"/&gt; the "For-Each Loop",&lt;ref&gt;
"The For-Each Loop"
{{cite web
|url=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html
|title=The For-Each Loop
|accessdate=2009-05-10
|year=2008
|publisher=[[Sun Microsystems, Inc.]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "foreach statement".&lt;ref&gt;
"Implementing this interface allows an object to be the target of the "foreach" statement."
{{cite web
|url=http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html
|title=Iterable (Java Platform SE 6)
|accessdate=2009-05-12
|year=2004
|publisher=[[Sun Microsystems, Inc.]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="Java"&gt;
for (Type item : iterableCollection) {
    // Do something to item
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== JavaScript ===

For unordered iteration over the keys in an Object, [[JavaScript]] features the &lt;code&gt;for...in&lt;/code&gt; loop:

&lt;source lang="JavaScript"&gt;
for (var key in object) {
    // Do stuff with object[key]
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To limit the iteration to the object's own properties, excluding those inherited through the prototype chain, it is sometimes useful to add a hasOwnProperty() test, [[Comparison of layout engines (ECMAScript)#Object object|if supported by the JavaScript engine]] (for WebKit/Safari, this means "in version 3 or later").

&lt;source lang="JavaScript"&gt;
for (var key in object) {
    if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        // Do stuff with object[key]
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In [[ECMAScript 5]] it is possible to use the keys method of the Object function to iterate over the own keys of an object more naturally.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys | title=Object.keys | work=Mozilla Developer Network | accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="JavaScript"&gt;
var book = { name: "A Christmas Carol", author: "Charles Dickens" }; 
Object.keys(book).forEach(function (key, index) {
    alert("PropertyName = " key + " Property Value = " + book[key]);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In [[ECMAScript 5]] it's also possible to use the &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt; method of a native array.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2FforEach | title=Array.prototype.forEach | work=Mozilla Developer Network | accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="JavaScript"&gt;
var animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bear'];
animals.forEach(function(animal, index) {
    alert(index + ':' + animal); // '0:dog', '1:cat', '2:bear'
});
&lt;/source&gt;

Gecko’s JavaScript engine also has a &lt;code&gt;for each...in&lt;/code&gt; statement, which iterates over the values in the object, not the keys.&lt;ref name="js_foreach"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/for_each...in | title=JavaScript - for each...in statement | work=Mozilla Developer Network | accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also note that it is inadvisable to use either a &lt;code&gt;for...in&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;for each...in&lt;/code&gt; statement on an Array object in JavaScript, due to the above issue of properties inherited from prototypes, and also because it only iterates over existent keys and is not guaranteed to iterate over the elements in any particular order.&lt;ref name="js_forin_arrays"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/for...in#Description | title=JavaScript - for...in statement on arrays | work=Mozilla Developer Network | accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A regular C-style for loop should be used instead. The [[EcmaScript 6]] standard has &lt;code&gt;[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of for..of]&lt;/code&gt; for index-less iteration over generators, arrays and more.

=== Lua&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lua_Programming/Tables#Foreach_loop|title=Lua Programming/Tables - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
{{Main|Lua (programming language)}}
Iterate only through numerical index values:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="lua"&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;Iterate through all index values:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="lua"&gt;
for index, value in pairs(array) do
	-- do something
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Mathematica ===
{{Main|Mathematica}}

In Mathematica, &lt;code&gt;Do&lt;/code&gt; will simply evaluate an expression for each element of a list, without returning any value.

&lt;source lang="Mathematica"&gt;
In[]:= Do[doSomethingWithItem, {item, list}]
&lt;/source&gt;

It is more common to use &lt;code&gt;Table&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the result of each evaluation in a new list.

&lt;source lang="Mathematica"&gt;
In[]:= list = {3, 4, 5};

In[]:= Table[item^2, {item, list}]
Out[]= {9, 16, 25}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== MATLAB ===
{{Main|MATLAB}}

&lt;source lang="MATLAB"&gt;
for item = array
%do something
end
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Mint ===

For each loops are supported in Mint, possessing the following syntax:
&lt;source lang="Ruby"&gt;
for each element of list
    /* 'Do something.' */
end
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;for (;;)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;while (true)&lt;/code&gt; [[infinite loop]]
in Mint can be written using a for each loop and an [[Infinite set|infinitely long list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prezi.com/ougvv1wzx2lb/mint-tutorial-part-0/ |title=Mint Tutorial |accessdate=20 October 2013 |author=Chu, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="Ruby"&gt;
import type
/* 'This function is mapped to'
 * 'each index number i of the'
 * 'infinitely long list.'
 */
sub identity(x)
    return x
end
/* 'The following creates the list'
 * '[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., infinity]'
 */
infiniteList = list(identity)
for each element of infiniteList
    /* 'Do something forever.' */
end
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Objective-C ===

Foreach loops, called [[Objective-C#Fast enumeration|Fast enumeration]], are supported starting in [[Objective-C]] 2.0. They can be used to iterate over any object that implements the NSFastEnumeration protocol, including NSArray, NSDictionary (iterates over keys), NSSet, etc.

&lt;source lang="ObjC"&gt;
NSArray *a = [NSArray new];       // Any container class can be substituted

for(id obj in a) {                // Note the dynamic typing (we do not need to know the
                                  // Type of object stored in 'a'.  In fact, there can be
                                  // many different types of object in the array.

    printf("%s\n", [[obj description] UTF8String]);  // Must use UTF8String with %s
    NSLog(@"%@", obj);                               // Leave as an object
}
&lt;/source&gt;

NSArrays can also broadcast a message to their members:

&lt;source lang="ObjC"&gt;
NSArray *a = [NSArray new];

[a makeObjectsPerformSelector:@selector(printDescription)];
&lt;/source&gt;

Where [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]] are available, an NSArray can automatically perform a block on every contained item:

&lt;source lang="ObjC"&gt;
[myArray enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop)
	{
		NSLog(@"obj %@", obj);
		if ([obj shouldStopIterationNow])
			*stop = YES;
	}];
&lt;/source&gt;

The type of collection being iterated will dictate the item returned with each iteration.
For example:

&lt;source lang="ObjC"&gt;
NSDictionary *d = [NSDictionary new];

for(id key in d) {
    NSObject *obj = [d objectForKey:key];      // We use the (unique) key to access the (possibly nonunique) object.
    NSLog(@"%@", obj);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== OCaml ===

[[OCaml]] is a [[functional language]]. Thus, the equivalent of a foreach loop can be achieved as a library function over lists and arrays.

For lists:

&lt;source lang="OCaml"&gt;
List.iter (fun x -&gt; print_int x) [1;2;3;4];; 
&lt;/source&gt;

or in short way:

&lt;source lang="OCaml"&gt;
List.iter print_int [1;2;3;4];; 
&lt;/source&gt;

For arrays:

&lt;source lang="OCaml"&gt;
Array.iter (fun x -&gt; print_int x) [|1;2;3;4|];;
&lt;/source&gt;

or in short way:

&lt;source lang="OCaml"&gt;
Array.iter print_int [|1;2;3;4|];;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== ParaSail ===

The [[ParaSail (programming language)|ParaSail]] parallel programming language supports several kinds of iterators, including a general "for each" iterator over a container:

&lt;source lang="parasail"&gt;
var Con : Container&lt;Element_Type&gt; := ...
// ...
for each Elem of Con concurrent loop  // loop may also be "forward" or "reverse" or unordered (the default)
  // ... do something with Elem
end loop
&lt;/source&gt;

ParaSail also supports filters on iterators, and the ability to refer to both the key and the value of a map. Here is a forward iteration over the elements of "My_Map" selecting only elements where the keys are in "My_Set":
&lt;source lang="parasail"&gt;
var My_Map : Map&lt;Key_Type =&gt; Univ_String, Value_Type =&gt; Tree&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; := ...
const My_Set : Set&lt;Univ_String&gt; := ["abc", "def", "ghi"];

for each [Str =&gt; Tr] of My_Map {Str in My_Set} forward loop
   // ... do something with Str or Tr
end loop
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Pascal ===

In [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], ISO standard 10206:1990 introduced iteration over [[Pascal (programming language)#Set types|set types]], thus:

&lt;source lang="Pascal"&gt;
var
  elt: ElementType;
  eltset: set of ElementType;

{...}

for elt in eltset do
  { ... do something with elt }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl ===

In [[Perl]], ''foreach'' (which is equivalent to the shorter for) can be used to traverse elements of a list.  The expression which denotes the collection to loop over is evaluated in list-context and each item of the resulting list is, in turn, aliased to the loop variable.

List literal example:

&lt;source lang="Perl"&gt;
foreach (1, 2, 3, 4) {
    print $_;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Array examples:

&lt;source lang="Perl"&gt;
foreach (@arr) {
    print $_;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="Perl"&gt;
foreach $x (@arr) { #$x is the element in @arr
    print $x;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Hash example:

&lt;source lang="Perl"&gt;
foreach $x (keys %hash) {
    print $x . " = " . $hash{$x}; # $x is a key in %hash and $hash{$x} is its value
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Direct modification of collection members:

&lt;source lang="Perl"&gt;
@arr = ( 'remove-foo', 'remove-bar' );
foreach $x (@arr){
    $x =~ s/remove-//;
}
# Now @arr = ('foo', 'bar');
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl 6 ===

In [[Perl 6]], a distinct language from Perl 5, ''for'' must be used to traverse elements of a list.  (''foreach'' is no longer allowed.)  The expression which denotes the collection to loop over is evaluated in list-context, but not flattened by default, and each item of the resulting list is, in turn, aliased to the loop variable(s).

List literal example:

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
for 1..4 {
    .say;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Array examples:

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
for @arr {
    .say;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The for loop in its statement modifier form:

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
.say for @arr;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
for @arr -&gt; $x {
    say $x;
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
for @arr -&gt; $x, $y {    # more than one item at a time
    say "$x, $y";
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Hash example:

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
for keys %hash -&gt; $key {
    say "$key: $hash{$key}";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
for %hash.kv -&gt; $key, $value {
    say "$key: $value";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
for %hash -&gt; $x {
    say "$x.key(): $x.value()";    # Parentheses needed to inline in double quoted string
}
&lt;/source&gt;


Direct modification of collection members with a doubly pointy block, ''&lt;-&gt;'': 

&lt;source lang="Perl6"&gt;
my @arr = 1,2,3;
for @arr &lt;-&gt; $x {
    $x *= 2;
}
# Now @arr = 2,4,6;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== PHP ===
{{Main|PHP}}

&lt;source lang="PHP"&gt;                                                 
foreach ($set as $value)
{
    // Do something to $value;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to extract both keys and values using the alternate syntax:

&lt;source lang="PHP"&gt;
foreach ($set as $key =&gt; $value) {
    echo "{$key} has a value of {$value}";
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Direct modification of collection members:

&lt;source lang="PHP"&gt;
$arr = array(1, 2, 3);
foreach ($arr as &amp;$value) { // Note the &amp;, $value is a reference to the original value inside $arr
    $value++;
}
// Now $arr = array(2, 3, 4);

// also works with the full syntax
foreach ($arr as $key =&gt; &amp;$value) {
    $value++;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
* [http://php.net/foreach More information]

=== Python ===
{{Main|Python (programming language)}}

&lt;source lang="Python"&gt;
for item in iterable_collection:
    # do something with item
&lt;/source&gt;

Python's tuple assignment, fully available in its foreach loop, also makes it trivial to iterate on (key, value) pairs in [[associative array]]s:

&lt;source lang="Python"&gt;
for key, value in some_dict.items(): # direct iteration on a dict iterates on its keys
    # do stuff
&lt;/source&gt;

As &lt;code&gt;for ... in&lt;/code&gt; is the only kind of for loop in Python, the equivalent to the "counter" loop found in other languages is...

&lt;source lang="Python"&gt;
for i in range(len(seq)):
    # do something to seq[i]
&lt;/source&gt;

... though using the &lt;code&gt;enumerate&lt;/code&gt; function is considered more "Pythonic":

&lt;source lang="Python"&gt;
for i, item in enumerate(seq):
    # do stuff with item
    # possibly assign it back to seq[i]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Racket ===
{{Main|Racket (programming language)}}
&lt;source lang="racket"&gt;
(for ([item set])
  (do-something-with item))
&lt;/source&gt;

or using the conventional Scheme &lt;code&gt;for-each&lt;/code&gt; function:

&lt;source lang="racket"&gt;
(for-each do-something-with a-list)
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;do-something-with&lt;/code&gt; is a one-argument function.

=== Ruby ===
{{Main|Ruby (programming language)}}

&lt;source lang="Ruby"&gt;
set.each do |item|
  # do something to item
end
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang="Ruby"&gt;
for item in set
  # do something to item
end
&lt;/source&gt;

This can also be used with a hash.

&lt;source lang="Ruby"&gt;
set.each do |item,value|
  # do something to item
  # do something to value
end
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Scala ===
{{Main|Scala (programming language)}}

&lt;source lang="Scala"&gt;
// return list of modified elements
items map { x =&gt; doSomething(x) }
items map multiplyByTwo

for {x &lt;- items} yield doSomething(x)
for {x &lt;- items} yield multiplyByTwo(x)

// return nothing, just perform action
items foreach { x =&gt; doSomething(x) }
items foreach println

for {x &lt;- items} doSomething(x)
for {x &lt;- items} println(x)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Scheme ===
{{Main|Scheme (programming language)}}
&lt;source lang="Scheme"&gt;
(for-each do-something-with a-list)
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;do-something-with&lt;/code&gt; is a one-argument function.

=== Smalltalk ===
{{Main|Smalltalk}}
&lt;source lang="Smalltalk"&gt;
collection do: [:item| "do something to item" ]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Swift ===

[[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] uses the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;…&lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; construct to iterate over members of a collection.&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/swift_programming_language/ControlFlow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH9-XID_153&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="objc"&gt;
for thing in someCollection {
    // do something with thing
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;…&lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; loop is often used with the closed and half-open range constructs to iterate over the loop body a certain number of times.

&lt;source lang="objc"&gt;
for i in 0..&lt;10 {
    // 0..&lt;10 constructs a half-open range, so the loop body
    // is repeated for i = 0, i = 1, …, i = 9.
}

for i in 0...10 {
    // 0...10 constructs a closed range, so the loop body
    // is repeated for i = 0, i = 1, …, i = 9, i = 10.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== SystemVerilog ===

[[SystemVerilog]] supports iteration over any vector or array type of any dimensionality using the &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; keyword.

A trivial example iterates over an array of integers:

{| class="wikitable"
! code !! prints
|-
|
&lt;source lang="systemverilog"&gt;
int  array_1d[] = '{ 3, 2, 1, 0 };

foreach array_1d[index]
  $display("array_1d[%0d]: %0d", index, array_1d[index]);
&lt;/source&gt;
|
 array_1d[0]: 3
 array_1d[1]: 2
 array_1d[2]: 1
 array_1d[3]: 0
|}

A more complex example iterates over an associative array of arrays of integers:

{| class="wikitable"
! code !! prints
|-
|
&lt;source lang="systemverilog"&gt;
int  array_2d[string][] = '{ "tens": '{ 10, 11 },
                             "twenties": '{ 20, 21 } };

foreach array_2d[key,index]
  $display("array_2d[%s,%0d]: %0d", key, index, array_2d[key,index]);
&lt;/source&gt;
|
 array_2d[tens,0]: 10
 array_2d[tens,1]: 11
 array_2d[twenties,0]: 20
 array_2d[twenties,1]: 21
|}

=== Tcl ===

[[Tcl]] uses foreach to iterate over lists. It is possible to specify more than one iterator variable, in which case they are assigned sequential values from the list. 
{| class="wikitable"
! code !! prints
|-
|
&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
foreach {i j} {1 2 3 4 5 6} {
    puts "$i $j"
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|
 1 2
 3 4
 5 6
|}

It is also possible to iterate over more than one list simultaneously. In the following &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; assumes sequential values of the first list, &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; sequential values of the second list:
{| class="wikitable"
! code !! prints
|-
|
&lt;source lang=Tcl&gt;
foreach i {1 2 3} j {a b c}  {
    puts "$i $j"
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|
 1 a
 2 b
 3 c
|}

=== Visual Basic .NET ===
{{Main|Visual Basic .NET}}
&lt;source lang="VBNet"&gt;
For Each item In enumerable
    ' Do something with item.
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

or without type inference

&lt;source lang="VBNet"&gt;
For Each item As type In enumerable
    ' Do something with item.
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Windows ===
==== Conventional command processor ====
{{main|COMMAND.COM|cmd.exe}}
Invoke a hypothetical &lt;code&gt;frob&lt;/code&gt; command three times, giving it a color name each time.
&lt;source lang="doscon"&gt;
C:\&gt;FOR %a IN ( red green blue ) DO frob %a
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Windows PowerShell ====
{{Main|Windows PowerShell}}
&lt;source lang="PowerShell"&gt;
foreach ($item in $set) {
    # Do something to $item
}
&lt;/source&gt;

From a pipeline

$list | ForEach-Object {Write-Host $_}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) ===
{{Main|XSL}}

'''''Harper's Hand-Book for Travellers''''' (est.1862) was a series of travel [[guide book]]s published by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] of New York. Each annual edition contained information for tourists in Europe and parts of the Middle East.

== Creating a hexafoil ==
One common form of the hexafoil has a ring of six [[tangent circles]] circumscribed by a larger circle. It may be constructed by compass and straightedge, by drawing six circles at the centers of a [[regular hexagon]], with diameter equal to the side of the hexagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Science and Art Drawing: Complete Geometrical Course ; Consisting of Plane and Solid Geometry, Orthographic and Isometric Projection, Projection of Shadow's the Principles of Map Projection, Graphic Arithmetic and Graphic Statics|first=John Humphrey|last=Spanton|publisher=Macmillan|year=1895|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuM0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The inner circles of the hexafoil have radius 1/3 that of the outer circle containing them, from which it is possible to derive the area and perimeter of the figure as a mathematical exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Plane Geometry|series=Mathematical texts for school|first1=William|last1=Betz|first2=Harrison Emmett|last2=Webb|first3=Percey Franklyn|last3=Smith|author3-link=Percey F.

== Architecture ==
A key component to Gothic architecture is a strong design principal involving [[geometry]] and harmony.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The hexafoil design is implemented in various Gothic buildings constructed in the 12th through 16th century. The traditional design is used in [[Cloister|cloisters]], [[Triforium|triforiums]] and [[stained glass]] windows of famous buildings such as [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]], [[Salisbury Cathedral]], and [[Regensburg Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hiveminer.com/Tags/hexafoil|title=The World's Best Photos of hexafoil -  Flickr Hive Mind|website=hiveminer.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone cut-out hexafoils are displayed in a plate tracery style in the Salisbury Cathedral, creating a pattern along the triforium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/medieval-world/gothic1/a/salisbury-cathedral|title=Salisbury Cathedral|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Religion ==
The hexafoil form can also be see as a framing design in ''[[Bible moralisée]].''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are often rendered in [[red]], [[blue]], [[Gold (color)|gold]] or vibrant [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and surround biblical scenes in the bible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ey3F_rZwNTUC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;lpg=PA282&amp;dq=hexafoil+in+architecture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K-hsk-rNHV&amp;sig=lRDb7FSdYgiVCgESNi16dUirBPI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpyYb7i-7dAhWQ3KQKHTpkC3IQ6AEwDXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hexafoil%20in%20architecture&amp;f=false|title=The Art of Illumination: The Limbourg Brothers and the Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry|last=Husband|first=Timothy|last2=Museum|first2=J.

==Magic==
Hexafoil designs are known to have links to [[folk magic]] practices in various countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], where a six leaf design with concentric circles have been found in homes and occasionally in public buildings to serve as a sign of protection.&lt;ref name="2017-02-22_ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-21/hexafoil-markings-point-to-hidden-magical-past/8290464 Mysterious hexafoil markings in Australian homes point to hidden magical past], Nicole Dyer and Damien Larkins, [[ABC News Online]], 2017-02-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Ian J|title=Defence Against the Devil: Apotropaic Marks in Australia|url=http://www.academia.edu/4148179/Defence_Against_the_Devil_Apotropaic_Marks_in_Australia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''home directory''' is a [[directory (file systems)|file system directory]] on a [[multi-user]] [[operating system]] containing [[Computer file|files]] for a given [[User (computing)|user]] of the system.  The specifics of the home directory (such as its name and location) are defined by the operating system involved; for example, [[Linux]] / [[BSD]] ([[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard|FHS]]) systems use /home/&lt;username&gt; and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] systems between [[Windows 2000|2000]] and [[Windows Server 2003|Server 2003]] keep home directories in a folder called ''Documents and Settings''.

==Description==
A user's home directory is intended to contain that user's files; including text documents, music, pictures or videos, etc.  It may also include their [[configuration file]]s of preferred settings for any software they have used there and might have tailored to their liking: [[web browser]] [[Internet bookmark|bookmarks]], favorite [[Desktop metaphor|desktop]] [[Computer wallpaper|wallpaper]] and [[Theme (computing)|themes]], [[password]]s to any external services accessed via a given software, etc. The user can install executable software in this directory, but it will only be available to users with permission to this directory. The home directory can be organized further with the use of sub-directories.

The content of a user's home directory is protected by [[file system permissions]], and by default is accessible to all authenticated users and administrators. Any other user that has been granted administrator privileges has authority to access any protected location on the [[filesystem]] including other users home directories.

==Benefits==
Separating user data from system-wide data avoids redundancy and makes backups of important files relatively simple. Furthermore, [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]]s, [[computer virus|virus]]es and [[computer worm|worm]]s running under the user's name and with their privileges will in most cases only be able to alter the files in the user's home directory, and perhaps some files belonging to workgroups the user is a part of, but not actual [[system file]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Other features per operating system==
===Unix===
In Unix, a user will be automatically placed into their home directory upon [[Logging (computer security)|login]].  The &lt;tt&gt;~user&lt;/tt&gt; shorthand variable refers to a user's home directory (allowing the user to navigate to it from anywhere else in the filesystem, or use it in other Unix commands). The &lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Tilde#Directories and URLs|tilde]] character) shorthand command refers to that particular user's home directory.

The Unix [[superuser]] has access to all directories on the filesystem, and hence can access home directories of all users. The superuser's home directory  on older systems was &lt;tt&gt;[[root directory|/]]&lt;/tt&gt;, but on many newer systems it is located at &lt;tt&gt;[[/root]]&lt;/tt&gt; (Linux, BSD), or &lt;tt&gt;[[/var]]/root&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Mac OS X]]).

===VMS===
In the [[OpenVMS]] operating system, a user's home directory is called the "root directory", and the equivalent of a Unix/DOS/Windows/AmigaOS "root directory" is referred to as the "Master File Directory".{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Contrast with single-user operating systems==
Single-user operating systems simply have a single directory or [[Disk partitioning|partition]] for all user files, there is no individual directory setup per user (though users can still setup and maintain directories inside this main working directory manually).
* [[AmigaOS]] versions 2 and up have "System" and "Work" partitions on hard disks by default. 
* [[BeOS]] (and its successors) have a /home directory which contain the files belonging to the single user of the system. 
* Versions of Windows prior [[Windows 95]] OEM Service Release 2 did not have a user folder, but since that release, &lt;tt&gt;\[[My Documents]]&lt;/tt&gt; became in effect the single user's home directory. 
* [[NeXTSTEP]] and [[OPENSTEP]] in a single user, non-networked setup, &lt;tt&gt;/me&lt;/tt&gt; is used, as well as &lt;tt&gt;/root&lt;/tt&gt; when logged in as superuser.

The Index of Economic Freedom is a series of 10 economic measurements created by the [[Heritage Foundation]] and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. Per the Heritage Foundation, the index's definition is: "Economic freedom is the fundamental right of every human to control his or her own labor and property. In an economically free society, individuals are free to work, produce, consume, and invest in any way they please, with that freedom both protected by the state and unconstrained by the state. In economically free societies, governments allow labor, capital and goods to move freely, and refrain from coercion or constraint of liberty beyond the extent necessary to protect and maintain liberty itself."&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite news | author=  |url = http://www.heritage.org/Index/FAQ.aspx | title = Frequently Asked Questions |publisher = Index of Economic Freedom |accessdate = 2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index scores nations on 10 broad factors of economic freedom using statistics from organizations like the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]:
* Business freedom
* Trade freedom
* Monetary freedom
* Government size
* Fiscal freedom
* Property rights
* Investment freedom
* Financial freedom
* Freedom from corruption
* Labor freedom

The 10 factors are averaged equally into a total score.

===''Economic Freedom of the World'' – Fraser Institute===
{{main|Economic Freedom of the World}}
The annual ''Economic Freedom of the World'' is an indicator of economic freedom produced by James Gwartney and Robert Lawson, and is published by the Canadian [[Fraser Institute]]. This index uses a definition of economic freedom similar to [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]] and it has been more widely used than any measure of economic freedom. Its use stems in part from the longer time period covered (data exists from 1980–2008), and the fact that this index is constructed from third party information (in contrast to the index created by the [[Heritage Foundation]]). According to this index, the cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to compete, and security of privately owned property.

In practice, the index measures:
* Size of government: expenditures, taxes, and enterprises
* Legal structure and security of property rights
* Access to sound money
* Freedom to trade internationally
* Regulation of credit, labor, and business

The report uses 42 distinct variables collected from a number of different sources (including the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and others). Some examples: [[tax rate]]s, degree of juridical independence, [[inflation]] rates, costs of importing, and regulated prices. Each of the 5 areas above is given equal weight in the final score. Scores are available (largely dependent on data available) for 141 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freetheworld.com/2008/EconomicFreedomoftheWorld2008.pdf Economic Freedom of the World: 2008 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204112458/http://www.freetheworld.com/2008/EconomicFreedomoftheWorld2008.pdf |date=2008-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''World Survey of Economic Freedom'' – Freedom House===
[[Freedom House]] published a measure of economic freedom in 1996, but publication of this measure has been discontinued. They defined economic freedom through two dimensions – lack of state infringements on citizens' rights to exchange goods and services, and state establishment of the rules governing contracts, property rights and other institutional prerequisites required for the conduct of economic affairs. To determine level of economic freedom Freedom House used six indicators:&lt;ref&gt;World Survey of Economic Freedom 1995–1996: A Freedom House Study. Transaction Publishers. 1996. {{ISBN|978-1-56000-929-0}}. pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;
* freedom to hold property
* freedom to earn a living
* freedom to operate a business
* freedom to invest one's earnings
* freedom to trade internationally
* freedom to participate in the market economy

===India===
Two different measures have been proposed for India, both called Economic Freedom Index for India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/mar/08spec.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; One is produced by  [[Bibek Debroy]], Shubashis Gangopadhyay and [[Laveesh Bhandari]] and places weight on measures of both [[positive freedom]] and [[negative freedom]]. The other is an adaption of the Fraser Institute measure produced by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indicus.net/Research/Home/Sectors/Governance%20and%20State/Economic%20Freedom%20For%20States%20of%20India,%202005/10067/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Asia===
In the 2016 Index of Economic Freedom, Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan ranked as "mostly unfree" taking 96th and 149th places 178 respectively.&lt;ref name="Ranking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Rankings|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking|website=www.heritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uzbekistan (#166) and Turkmenistan (#174) ranked as "repressed".&lt;ref name="Ranking"/&gt; Largest economy in the region, Kazakhstan is ahead of all other Central Asian countries and neighboring Russia. Kazakhstan ranked an overall score of 63.6 out of 100 taking 68th place out of 178 countries, one place better than last year.&lt;ref name="Ranking"/&gt;

==Critical analysis==
In a review of the literature, Lawson and Hall documented that "[o]ver two-thirds of these studies found economic freedom to correspond to a 'good' outcome such as faster growth, better living standards, more happiness, etc. Less than 4% of the sample found economic freedom to be associated with a 'bad' outcome such as increased income inequality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joshua C. |last=Hall |first2=Robert A. |last2=Lawson |title=Economic Freedom of the World: An Accounting of the Literature |journal=Contemporary Economic Policy |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2014 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1111/coep.12010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.0950-0804.2006.00278.x | volume=20 | issue=2 | title=Market-oriented institutions and policies and economic growth: A critical survey | year=2006 | journal=Journal of Economic Surveys | pages=157–91 | last1 = De Haan | first1 = Jakob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, supporters contend that the size of government has shown correlations with negative growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andreas |last=Bergh |first2=Magnus |last2=Henrekson |title=Government Size and Growth: A Survey and Interpretation of the Evidence |work=IFN Working Paper No. 858 |year=2011 |url=https://www.ifn.se/wfiles/wp/wp858.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Antonio |last=Afonso |first2=Alma |last2=Romero-Barrutieta |first3=Emma |last3=Monsalve |title=Public Sector Efficiency: Evidence for Latin America |work=ISEG Economics Working Paper No. 20/2013/DE/UECE |date=December 2013 |ssrn=2365007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=António |last=Afonso |first2=Ludger |last2=Schuknecht |first3=Vito |last3=Tanzi |title=Public sector efficiency: An international comparison |journal=[[Public Choice (journal)|Public Choice]] |year=2005 |volume=123 |issue=3 |pages=321–47 |doi=10.1007/s11127-005-7165-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert J. |last=Barro |title=Economic Growth in a Cross Section of Countries |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=106 |issue=2 |year=1991 |pages=407–43 |doi=10.2307/2937943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taricani, an investigative reporter for [[WJAR]] television, an [[NBC]] affiliate in [[Cranston, Rhode Island]], refused to reveal who leaked a surveillance tape to him. He was convicted of criminal contempt of court on November 18, 2004, and sentenced on December 9, 2004 to six months of home confinement.

The tape was used during a municipal corruption probe of then-Providence Mayor [[Buddy Cianci|Vincent "Buddy" Cianci]] known as [[Operation Plunder Dome]].

Since that time, he has lectured at journalism schools throughout the country and has worked with the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to urge Congressional passage of a federal shield law for reporters.

Taricani retired in April 2014.

Taricani was the recipient of a heart transplant in 1996.  He is a volunteer spokesperson for the Rhode Island branch of the [[American Heart Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.turnto10.com/staff/12546/ |title=Profile for Jim Taricani |publisher=Turn to 10 |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314225618/http://www2.turnto10.com/staff/12546/ |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The (1066) '''''Leipian''''' 類篇 is a [[Chinese dictionary]] compiled by [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279) lexicographers under the supervision of chancellor [[Sima Guang]]. It contains 31,319 [[Chinese character|character]] [[headword|head entries]], more than twice as many as the 12,158 in the (c. 543) ''[[Yupian]]'', and included many new characters created during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618-907) and Song dynasties. ''Leipian'' entries are arranged by a 544-[[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] system adapted from the 540 radicals of the classic (121) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''.

==Text==
The dictionary title combines two common Chinese words: ''lèi'' [[wikt:類|類]] " category; kind; type; class" and ''piān'' [[wikt:篇|篇]] "piece of writing; sheet (of paper); chapter". ''Piān'' 篇, written with the "[[radical 118|bamboo radical]]" [[wikt:⺮|⺮]] and ''biǎn'' 扁 "flat" phonetic, originally meant "[[bamboo slip]] (for writing)", comparable with ''biān'' [[wikt:編|編]] "weave; organize; compile" with the "[[radical 120|silk radical]]" [[wikt:糸|糸]]—seen in the (1726) ''Pianzi leipian'' 駢字類編 "Classified Collection of Phrases and Literary Allusions" dictionary title (Needham et. al 1986: 219).

English translations include ''Dictionary of Character Sounds'' (Needham and Wang 1954), ''Collection of Categorized Characters'' (Zhou and Zhang 2003), ''The Classified Chapters'' (Yong and Peng 2008), and ''The Categories Book'' (Theobald 2010).

The ''Leipian'' text consists of 15 books (册), each subdivided into 3 parts, for a total of 45 volumes (卷). The 31,319 character head entries are organized by a 544-radical system (Yip 2000: 19). Each entry gives the character in [[Small Seal Script]] (following the ''Shuowen jiezi'' format), the pronunciation in the ''[[fanqie]]'' system, definition, and exegesis. The ''Leipian'' also notes [[Variant Chinese character|variant characters]], alternate pronunciations, and multiple meanings.

==History==
[[Emperor Renzong of Song]] (r. 1022-1063) commissioned the ''Leipian'' character dictionary project in 1039 and it was completed in 1066. There were four chief editors, three of whom died before completing the dictionary: Wang Zhu 王洙 (997-1057), Hu Xiu 胡宿 (995-1067), Zhang Cili 張次立 (1010-1063), and Fan Zhen 范鎮 (1007-1088).

Emperor Renzong also ordered the compilation of the (1037) ''[[Jiyun]]'', which was a phonologically arranged [[rime dictionary]] intended to complement the ''Leipian'' character dictionary. The ''Leipian'' Preface (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 190) says all phonetically related characters are included in the ''Jiyun'' while all formally related ones are included in the ''Leipian''.

The historian and chancellor Sima Guang (1019-1086) carried out the final editing on the expanded ''Jiyun'' and the ''Leipian'', and in 1067, he submitted the printed versions of both dictionaries to [[Emperor Yingzong of Song]] (r. 1063-1067). At that time, the ''Jiyun'' and ''Leipian'' were the most complete [[reference works]] in the history of Chinese [[lexicography]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23776">'''Martial arts manuals''' are instructions, with or without illustrations, specifically designed to be learnt from a book. Many books detailing specific techniques of [[martial arts]] are often erroneously called manuals but were written as [[treatise]]s.

Prose descriptions of martial arts techniques appear late within the [[history of literature]], due to the inherent difficulties of describing a technique rather than just demonstrating it.

The earliest extant manuscript on armed combat (as opposed to unarmed wrestling) is [[Royal Armouries Ms. I.33]] ("I.33"), written in [[Franconia]] around 1300.

Not within the scope of this article are books on [[military strategy]] such as [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (before 100 BC) or [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus]]' ''[[De Re Militari]]'' (4th century), or military technology, such as  ''[[De rebus bellicis]]'' (4th to 5th century).

==Predecessors==
[[Image:Beni Hassan tomb 15 wrestling detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of the wrestling scenes at Beni Hasan.]]
Some early testimonies of [[history of martial arts|historical martial arts]] consist of series of images only. The earliest example is a fresco in tomb 15 at [[Beni Hasan]], showing illustrations of [[wrestling]] techniques dating to the 20th century BCE. Similar depictions of wrestling techniques are found on [[pottery of ancient Greece|Attic vases]] dating to [[Classical Greece]].

The only known instance of a book from [[classical antiquity]] is [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 466]] from the 2nd century CE, detailing [[Greek wrestling]] techniques. There are some examples in the [[Chinese classics]] that may predate the turn of the [[Common Era]]: the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]] (c. 100 BCE) documents [[wrestling]], referring to earlier how-to manuals" of the [[Han dynasty#Western Han|Western Han]] (2nd century BCE), which have however not survived. An extant Chinese text on wrestling is "Six Chapters of Hand Fighting" included in the 1st century CE ''[[Book of Han]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henning, Stanley E.|date=1999|title="Academia Encounters the Chinese Martial arts"|journal=China Review International|volume=6 |issue=2|pages=319–332|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/china_review_international/v006/6.2henning.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All other extant manuals date to the [[Middle Ages]] or later. The "combat stele" at [[Shaolin Monastery]] dates to 728 CE. The earliest text detailing [[Indian martial arts]] is the ''[[Agni Purana]]'' (c. 8th century), which contains several chapters giving descriptions and instructions on fighting techniques.&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1992&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zarrilli, Phillip B. |year=1992 |title=To Heal and/or To Harm: The Vital Spots (Marmmam/Varmam) in Two South Indian Martial Traditions Part I: Focus on Kerala's Kalarippayattu  |url=http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/healharm.html |journal=Journal of Asian Martial Arts |volume=1 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Chakravarti (1972). ''The art of warfare in ancient India''. Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; It described how to improve a warrior's individual prowess and kill enemies using various methods in warfare whether they went to war in chariots, horses, [[war elephant|elephant]]s or on foot. Foot methods were subdivided into armed combat and unarmed combat.&lt;ref name=Svinth&gt;J. R. Svinth (2002). [http://ejmas.com/kronos A Chronological History of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports.] ''Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; The former included the bow and arrow, the sword, spear, noose, armour, iron dart, club, battle axe, [[chakram]] and [[trishula|trident]].&lt;ref name=Zarrilli1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spa.ex.ac.uk/drama/staff/kalari/power.html |title=Actualizing Power and Crafting a Self in Kalarippayattu |publisher=Spa.ex.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter included wrestling, knee strikes, punching and kicking methods.&lt;ref name=Svinth/&gt;

The oldest extant [[historical European martial arts|European martial arts]] manual is [[Royal Armouries Ms. I.33]] (c. 1300).

"Illustrations only" manuals do not become extinct with the appearance of prose instructions, but rather exist alongside these, e.g. in the form of the Late Medieval German [[illuminated manuscript]]s.

===German Fechtbücher===
{{see|German school of fencing}}
[[Image:MS 44 A 8 2r.jpg|thumb|250px|fol. 2r of the [[Cod. 44 A 8]], depicting two fencers in the ''vom tag'' and ''alber'' wards.]]
'''Fechtbuch''' (plural '''Fechtbücher''') is [[Early New High German]] for "combat manual",&lt;ref&gt;''[[:wikt:fechten|fechten]]'' is cognate to English ''fight'' and still meant "fight, combat" in general in Early Modern times; in contemporary [[Standard German]], ''fechten'' translates to "fencing", while the noun ''[[:wikt:Gefecht|Gefecht]]'' retains the generic meaning of "fight, battle".&lt;/ref&gt; one of the manuscripts or printed books of the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] containing descriptions of a martial art. Usually, the term is taken to include 15th- and 16th-century German manuals, but the nature of the subject matter does not allow a clear separation of these from treatises from other parts of Europe on one hand (particularly from the Italian and French schools), and from manuals of later centuries on the other hand.

A list of ''Fechtbücher'' include:

===Italian treatises===
The [[Italian school of swordsmanship|Italian school]] is attested in an early manual of 1410, at which time it is not yet clearly separable from the German school. Indeed, the author [[Fiore dei Liberi]] states that he has learned much of his art from one "Master Johannes of Swabia". The heyday of the Italian school comes in the 16th century, with the [[Dardi school]].

===French manuals===
Similar to the situation in Italy, there is one early manual (c. 1400, dealing with the [[pollaxe]] exclusively, and later treatises set in only after a gap of more than a century.

*[[Le jeu de la hache]] (c. 1400)
*Andre Pauernfeindt "La noble science des joueurs d'espee" (1528)—This is a French translation of Pauernfeindt's 1516 work.  One notable difference between it and the original is that the "noble science" print has colored images, unlike the German.

*Monsieur L'Abbat "The Art of Fencing, or, the Use of the Small Sword" (1734)

===Venetian treatises===
The most ancient European school of fencing is considered to be a Venetian one, since the first time it is mentioned is dated by XII century. Written sources that remained to this day date from the XVI century.

* Giacomo di Grassi "The Reasons of Victorious Weapon Handling for Attack and Defense" (1570)

* Francesco Alfieri “The Art of Excellent Handling of the Sword” (1653)

* Camillo Agrippa "The Treatise on the Science of Weapons with Philosophical Reflections" (1553)

===Spanish treatises===
The first mention of Destreza dates back to the 15th-16th centuries, however the exact date of the Spanish fencing school’s establishment is unknown.

===Iberian manuals===
There are some manuals containing training advice for the [[medieval tournament]] and [[jousting]] such as the early Portuguese work ''[[bem cavalgar|A ensinança de bem cavalgar em toda a sela]]'' by [[Edward of Portugal]] (1391&amp;ndash;1438). A riding instruction manual that also included martial information.

17th-century Spanish [[Destreza]] is very much steeped in the Spanish [[Baroque]] noblemen mindset, so doesn't contain much graphical explanations of the fencing techniques so much as hard to understand explanations based on mathematics and philosophical sciences in general. The subsequent difficulty on interpreting the theory and practice of [[Destreza]] correctly has led many times to this school of fencing being misunderstood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1365">The '''National Video Archive of Performance''' is a film and video archive in London, England which holds recordings of stage performances.

In 1992 the [[Theatre Museum]], a branch museum of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, began recording stage performance in the United Kingdom. The project was named the National Video Archive of Stage Performance and later renamed the National Video Archive of Performance. The model for the project was the Theatre on Film and Tape Archive at the [[New York Public Library]] at the [[Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/the/the.specfea.html New York Public Library at the Lincoln Center]&lt;/ref&gt; The first production recorded was the [[Royal National Theatre]] production of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' starring [[Ian McKellen]] and directed by [[Richard Eyre]].

The National Video Archive of Performance (NVAP) was the outcome of an agreement between the [[Federation of Entertainment Unions]] and the V&amp;A Theatre Collections enabling the museum to make high quality archival recordings of live performance without payment of artists' fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/nvap/ NVAP on the V&amp;A website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Neighbours''''' (French title: '''''Voisins''''') is a 1952 [[anti-war film]] by [[Scottish Canadians|Scottish Canadian]] filmmaker [[Norman McLaren]]. Produced at the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in [[Montreal]], the film uses the technique known as [[pixilation]], an animation technique using live actors as stop-motion objects. McLaren created the soundtrack of the film by scratching the edge of the film, creating various blobs, lines, and triangles which the [[graphical sound|projector read as sound]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] called this the greatest film ever made.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Plot==
Two men, [[:fr:Jean-Paul Ladouceur|Jean-Paul Ladouceur]] and [[Grant Munro (filmmaker)|Grant Munro]], live peacefully in adjacent cardboard houses. When a flower blooms between their houses, they fight each other to the death over the ownership of the single small flower.

The moral of the film is, simply, ''Love your neighbour'' {{bibleref2|Matthew| 22:39|KJV}}. The moral is also shown in other languages, including:
*[[French language|French]]: ''Aimez votre prochain''
*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 同胞に親切なれ (''Dōhō ni shinsetsu nare'')
*[[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 親善鄰居 (''Qīnshàn línjū'')
*[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: אהבתי לרעך; (''Ahavthi l'reacha'')
*[[Russian language|Russian]]: Любите ближнего своего; ''Lyubite blizhnego svoyego''
*[[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Ama a tu prójimo''
*[[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Amate il prossimo''
*[[German language|German]]: ''Liebe deinen Nächsten''
*[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Elsk din nabo''
*[[Esperanto language|Esperanto]]: ''Amu vian najbaron''

==Controversy==
''Neighbours'' has been described as "one of the most controversial films the NFB ever made".&lt;ref name=violent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animation.filmtv.ucla.edu/program/anihist.html|title=A rather incomplete but still fascinating history of animation|last=McLaughlin|first=Dan|year=2001|accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060812142657/http://animation.filmtv.ucla.edu/program/anihist.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-minute film was politically motivated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I was inspired to make ''Neighbours'' by a stay of almost a year in the People's Republic of China. Although I only saw the beginnings of Mao's revolution, my faith in human nature was reinvigorated by it.  Then I came back to Quebec and the Korean War began. (...) I decided to make a really strong film about anti-militarism and against war." — ''Norman McLaren'' &lt;ref name=antiwar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://films.nfb.ca/normanmclaren/dvd_en/page6.html|title=Norman McLaren|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The version of ''Neighbours'' that ultimately won an Oscar was not the version McLaren had originally created. In order to make the film palatable for American and European audiences, McLaren was required to remove a scene in which the two men, fighting over the flower, murdered the other's wife and children.&lt;ref name=removed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.wcsu.edu/mccarneyh/fva/M/neighbors.html|title=Neighbours|last=Cartagena|first=Rene|year=2003|accessdate=2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], public opinion changed, and McLaren was asked to reinstate the sequence. The original [[Original camera negative|negative]] of that scene had been destroyed, so the scene was salvaged from a positive print of lower quality.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, David.  Norman McLaren.  Edinburgh: Scottish Arts Council Catalogue, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

NFB founder [[John Grierson]], who had invited McLaren to the NFB to form its first animation unit, would ultimately disparage ''Neighbours'' and McLaren's attempt at political cinema:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I wouldn't trust Norman around the corner as a political thinker. I wouldn't trust Norman around the corner as a philosophic thinker. That's not what Norman is for. Norman is for ''[[Hen Hop]]''. Hen Hop. That's wonderful. And so many other things. That's his basic gift. He's got joy in his movement. He's got loveliness in his movement. He's got fancy in his changes. That's enough"&lt;ref name=Kristmanson&gt;{{cite book|last=Kristmanson|first=Mark|title=Plateaus of Freedom: Nationality, Culture, and State Security in Canada, 1920–1960|year=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-541803-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPTYERMGBgIC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Hen+Hop%22+McLaren&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hVCCTZCqFZLogQei-O3eCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hen%20Hop%22%20McLaren&amp;f=false|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Pixilation==
The term 'pixilation' was created by [[Grant Munro (filmmaker)|Grant Munro]], who had worked with McLaren on ''Two Bagatelles'', a pair of short pixilation films made prior to ''Neighbours.'' While ''Neighbours'' is often credited as an animated film by many film historians,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.10.31.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515174814/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.10.31.html |date=May 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; very little of the film is actually animated. The majority of the film is shot with variable-speed photography, usually in fast motion, with some stop-frame techniques. During one brief sequence, the two actors appear to levitate: this effect was actually achieved in stop-motion; the men repeatedly jumped upward but were photographed only at the top of their trajectories. Under the current definition of an animated short,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/79academyawards/rules/rule19.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029041756/http://www.oscars.org/79academyawards/rules/rule19.html |date=October 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is unlikely that ''Neighbours'' would qualify as either a documentary short or an animated short.

McLaren followed ''Neighbours'' with two other films using a similar combination of pixilation, live action, variable speed photography and string-puppets. The first, ''[[A Chairy Tale]]'' (1957) was a collaboration with [[Claude Jutra]] and [[Ravi Shankar]]. The second, ''Opening Speech by Norman McLaren'' (1960) was made for the International Film Festival of Montreal, and starred McLaren himself.

[[Wolf Koenig]] served as cameraman on the film.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/for-wolf-koenig-it-was-about-framing-that-decisive-moment/article20187065/?page=all|title=For Wolf Koenig, it was about framing that decisive moment|last=Martin|first=Sandra|date=24 August 2014|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
''Neighbours'' is the winner of both a [[Canadian Film Award]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], for the latter of which it was nominated twice, for [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Short Subject (One-reel)]] and for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary (Short Subject)]]. Strangely, it was in the Documentary category that this short, stylized drama won its Oscar. A press release issued by [[AMPAS]] states that ''Neighbours'' is "among a group of films that not only competed, but won Academy Awards in what were clearly inappropriate categories."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel_print.asp?aId=5158 |title=Oscar's Docs Resumes with Nature Documentaries |publisher=Webwire.com |date=2005-10-31 |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This film was designated as a "masterwork" by the [[Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada]], a charitable non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada’s audio-visual heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avtrust.ca/masterworks/2000/en_film.htm AV Trust | Preserving Canada's Visual and Audio Treasures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930013551/http://avtrust.ca/masterworks/2000/en_film.htm |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''Neighbours'' was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]], listing the most significant documentary heritage collections in the world.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neighbours, animated, directed and produced by Norman McLaren in 1952|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=26905&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|work=Memory of the World|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=16 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivatives==
[[Extreme (band)|Extreme]]'s video for the first single, "[[Rest in Peace (song)|Rest in Peace]]", from their third album ''[[III Sides To Every Story]]'' was closely modelled after ''Neighbours'', except instead of a flower, the neighbors fight over a TV set showing the band performing the song. The NFB took legal action and the matter was settled out of court, with withdrawal of the video from circulation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. However, the withdrawn video was subsequently posted on YouTube where it can be viewed in its entirety.

'''''Oriental Magic''''', by [[Idries Shah]], is a study of magical practices in diverse cultures from Europe and Africa, through Asia to the Far East. Originally published in 1956 and still in print today,&lt;ref&gt;The Idries Shah Foundation page on ''Oriental Magic''&lt;/ref&gt; it was the first of this author’s 35 books. The work was launched with the encouragement of the [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], Professor Louis Marin,&lt;ref&gt;Member of the Institut de France, Director of the Ecole d”Anthropologie de Paris and Deputy-President of the International Institute of Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheMysteriousEast"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-06-08}} "Dr. Louis Marin hailed his anthropological text ''Oriental Magic'' as an important work—and he is head of the Paris School of Anthropology."&lt;/ref&gt; who in his preface to the book stressed its “scholarly accuracy” and “real contribution to knowledge”.

[[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] had long been considered outside the discipline of academic study, but Shah’s approach, which involved five years of study and field work, was – very unusually for the 1950s – multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural. His documented material came from [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[religion]], and [[psychology]], as well as from artefacts, obscure manuscripts, and an impressive range of expert informants, who made (often unpublished) specialist material available to him.  As a result, the secrecy and obfuscation around magical operations and practitioners was defused by the author’s informed, dispassionate approach to the array of arcane information he had assembled, some of it printed for the first time. 
''Oriental Magic'' seems also to have been a clearly stated invitation for magic in general to be investigated as any other subject in the West would be, with coolness, objectivity and scientific method. The book in itself can be seen as providing a ground plan for future researchers, signalling useful directions their investigations might take, and specifying topics which might yield to further study.

==Content==

The author examines a vast accumulation of materials on human beliefs, magical practices and ceremonies, from [[North Africa]] to [[Japan]]. Among much else, these include a conspectus of [[Jewish]], [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]], [[Arabian]], [[Iran]]ian and Indian magic, an account of [[Sufism]] and its origins, legends of the [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]], examples of [[alchemy]], [[talismans]] and magical rites found in the cultures studied, and topics such as [[love magic]], the witchdoctors of the [[Nile Valley]], the ‘singing sands’ of [[Egypt]], subcutaneous electricity, and the prehistoric sources of [[Babylonia]]n occult practices. There are also personal accounts of, for instance, Shah’s ‘training’ under a Ju-Ju witch doctor, a demonstration of [[Hindu]] levitation, and translations of what were considered secret alchemical and magical formulae.

Shah finds that magical origins in High [[Asia]] have influenced communities halfway across the world, and that the westward drift from that original source might explain the great similarity in magical beliefs, practices and terminology in places as diverse as China, the [[Near East]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[Africa]]. The type of witch-doctoring (shamanism) practised in the east, for example, is duplicated among the [[Finns]], the [[Sami shamanism|Sami]], and even the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]].

The author tracks distortions from original sources, winnows fact from supposition, allows for alternative explanations of phenomena, such as physiological and psychological responses which are separate from the apparent “magic”, and shows how much dross has accumulated around many of the practices he inspects. But he suggests there also remains a residue of what, in magical terminology, could be called “pure gold”, and that some of this “gold” is likely to reflect hitherto little-understood forces “which may very possibly be harnessed to individual and collective advantage”.

==Reception==

''Oriental Magic'' has been in print for more than 50 years.  The Book Exchange, referring to its re-publication in 1968, said the book had “come to be regarded as essential reading for those concerned with research in the fields of human beliefs”.
At the time of first publication, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' described it as containing a “wealth of illustrative material” for which the lay reader might be grateful. The religious periodical, ''[[Hibbert Journal]]'', called it “fascinating and illuminating”, with “a great deal of interesting information”, and said that “the accounts of personal experience in the [[Sudan]] and [[Tibet]] were “especially … fascinating”. ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time &amp; Tide]]'', a general circulation weekly, said it was “a most interesting collection of facts concerning magical practices and their history”, with “an admirable bibliography” and also  …. “heaped with various jewels” … [which] “should provide a rich source of data for psychologists, anthropologists and psychical research”. The scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' said Shah’s approach was “a point of view of which too little has been heard in the past”, and recommended the work as “valuable and entertaining reading”.  Contemporary Review called it “a serious work of considerable anthropological interest.” Professor Louis Marin wrote: “Oriental Magic deserves to find a wide audience of educated readers”.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com page on ''Oriental Magic''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in the ''Journal of Bible and Religion'' (1958), Swami [[Akhilananda]] of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], wrote that Shah had been "the first to write on Oriental Magic as it is presented in this fascinating book."&lt;ref name="JournalOfBibleAndReligion" /&gt; He praised the breadth of the book's coverage, noting that it covered many different religious traditions, and commented on the fact that Shah had evidently travelled widely to collect his source material.&lt;ref name="JournalOfBibleAndReligion"&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book in the ''[[Journal of Asian Studies]]'' (1958), Alan J. A. Elliot wrote that "Shah obviously has a profound personal interest in the occult, and has gone to very great lengths to collect a great amount on interesting information. His method of exposition is, however, most likely to appeal to the reader without a strongly developed scientific interest in the subject."&lt;ref name="JournalOfAsianStudies"&gt;{{cite journal

{{italic title}}
'''''Play-Doh''''' is a painted aluminum sculpture by [[Jeff Koons]], made between 1994 and 2014. Five copies were made, each measuring approximately 120 × 108 × 108 in. (304.8 × 274.3 × 274.3 cm). It is formed of 27 separate pieces of polychromed aluminum and was first publicly shown at the retrospective of Koons' work in 1994 at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in NYC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://whitney.org/Education/ForTeachers/TeacherGuides/JeffKoons Whitney Museum of American Art 2014 Teacher Guide/Jeff Koons]&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the modeling compound named [[Play-Doh]] which is used for arts and crafts projects by young children.

While speaking in reference to the sculpture ''"Play-Doh",'' Koons has said that he tries to "make objects that you can't make any judgements about". In the same commentary Koons said "If you take Play-Doh apart...they're organic shapes that all stack on top of each other...so that these surfaces are meeting on the inside and you never see that...the public doesn't see it but I think that you feel it and it has kind of a Freudian quality to it. I really thought that Play-Doh captures the twentieth century and you have this aspect of Freud with this mound of Play-Doh and the way the organic shapes are on top of each other...and within art you have this [[abstract expressionism]]...you have this aspect of [[Willem de Kooning|DeKooning]] or something..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://whitney.org/WatchAndListen/154 Whitney Museum, Koons, Play-Doh sculpture]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polydactyly in early tetrapods''' should here be understood as having more than five digits to the finger or foot, a condition that was the natural state of affairs in the very first [[tetrapod]]s. The polydactyly in these largely [[aquatic animal]]s is not to be confused with [[polydactyly]] in the medical sense, i.e. it was not an anomaly in the sense it was not a [[congenital disorder|congenital condition]] of having more than the typical number of [[digit (anatomy)|digit]]s for a given [[taxon]].&lt;ref name=hall&gt;''Evolutionary developmental biology'', by Brian Keith Hall, 1998, {{ISBN|0-412-78580-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JhSwumfgTQ4C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=polydactyly+tetrapods p. 262]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, it appears to be a result of the early [[evolution]] from a limb with a [[fin]] rather than digits.

[[Tetrapod]]s evolved from animals with fins such as found in [[lobe-finned fish]]es. From this condition a new pattern of limb formation evolved, where the development axis of the limb rotated to sprout secondary axes along the lower margin, giving rise to a variable number of very stout skeletal supports for a paddle-like foot.&lt;ref&gt;Coates, M.I. and Clack, J.A. (1990): Polydactyly in the earliest known tetrapod limbs. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 347, pp.66-69.&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is thought to have arisen from the loss of the [[Fish anatomy#Spines and rays|fin ray]]-forming proteins [[actinodin 1]] and [[actinodin 2]] or modification of the expression of [[HOXD13]].&lt;ref name="zhang2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = J. | last2 = Wagh | first2 = P. | last3 = Guay | first3 = D. | last4 = Sanchez-Pulido | first4 = L. | last5 = Padhi | first5 = B.

Early groups like ''[[Acanthostega]]'' had eight digits, while the more derived ''[[Ichthyostega]]'' had seven digits, the yet-more derived ''[[Tulerpeton]]'' had six toes.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt; ''[[Crassigyrinus]]'' from the fossil-poor [[Romer's gap]] in early [[Carboniferous]] is usually thought to have had five digits to each foot.

Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing knowledge of Labyrinthodonts from Romer's gap has led to the challenging of the hypothesis that [[pentadactyly]], as displayed by most modern tetrapods, is [[plesiomorphic]].

The catalog included detailed discussions of 85 paintings from various collection holders, that together give an overview of four basic aspects of daily life in 17th-century Dutch family portrait paintings; family values during the contrareformation, educating children, children at play, and children's fashions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codart.nl/exhibitions/details/78/ Pride and joy: children's portraits in the Netherlands, 1500-1700] on codart&lt;/ref&gt; Since children's portraits are often quite popular, the exhibition was restricted by rules governing insurance and loans of popular pieces and thus the introduction includes several images of paintings that could not be lent out. The [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]] however was able to lend out 11 works for the exhibition. The catalog is organized loosely by time period, starting with the earliest works.

The '''Quellinusschool''' or ''Kunstnijverheidsschool Quellinus'', was a school for sculptors in [[Amsterdam]] named after the [[Quellinus family]] of sculptors, founded in 1877.

It was founded as the ''Teekenschool voor Kunstambachten'' (Drawing school for art crafts) by [[Pierre Cuypers]] and [[Eduard Colinet]] in the workshop of the [[Rijksmuseum]] during the building of that institution, which itself contains several large sculptures and was intended to rival the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]], which itself is full of works by the Quellinus family. The name was changed after the opening of the museum in 1885 to ''Kunstnijverheidsschool Quellinus'', or simply ''Quellinusschool''. In 1924 it merged with the [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]].

Currently [[:w:en:Royal Dutch Antiquarian Society|Royal Dutch Antiquarian Society]] has an office in the school&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kog.nu/contact Contact info of the Royal Dutch Antiquarian Society], site visited 22-4-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5016">The '''Ray Society''' is a scientific [[text publication society]] that publishes works devoted principally to British flora and fauna. As of 2017, it had published 179 volumes. These are predominantly academic works of interest to naturalists, zoologists, botanists and collectors.

The society was founded in 1844, largely on the initiative of [[George Johnston (naturalist)|George Johnston]]. It is named after the naturalist [[John Ray]] (1627–1705). It is based at the [[Natural History Museum, London]], and is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|208082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Ray Society's publications are concerned with natural history, and have special but not exclusive reference to British flora and fauna. They include original monographs on particular groups and topics, facsimiles of historically important volumes and translations of existing works. 

During [[Charles Darwin]]'s lifetime, the Ray Society published not only Darwin's two volumes on living barnacles (1851 and 1854) but also the work of many of the foremost British naturalists: [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[William Crawford Williamson]], [[John Blackwall]], [[Albert Günther]], [[James Scott Bowerbank]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.books.google.com/books?id=QtlLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA116 List of the Annual Volumes of the Ray Society, from their Commencement, in 1844, to August, 1880]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA)''' is a [[trade association]] that represents the collective interests of producers of music sound recordings, major and independent record labels in South Africa.  Formerly known as the '''Association of the South African Music Industry''' (ASAMI) it was established in the 1970s. The association consists of approximately 2,000 members, including the [[big four record labels]], [[Sony Music]], [[Universal Music]], [[EMI]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]] (part of [[Gallo Record Company|Gallo]] Warner in South Africa).

RiSA is responsible for running the annual [[South African Music Awards]] (SAMAs) and for acknowledging certification awards for album sales. A weekly top 20 album chart is aired every Saturday by [[Radio Sonder Grense]], based on CD sales figures compiled by RiSA. RiSA is recognised by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] as the official National Group for the Recording Industry in South Africa.

==Membership==
The RiSA has various [[procedural law|rules and procedures]] which govern membership, but in practice applicants (any record company) are not rejected. No current member has been expelled from the [[organization|organisation]]. RiSA has a policy to seek to accommodate [[diversity (business)|diversity]] within its ranks and structures. The ultimate control of the organisation is vested in the members in an [[annual general meeting]] where an executive of twelve members is elected. No company or group of companies may have more than two representatives on the board of directors which elects its own chairman. The chairperson, in consultation with and on the advice of the board of directors, appoints various executive members and other member representatives to serve on a variety of [[committee#Subcommittees|subcommittees]] which report directly to the executive committee through a duly elected chairman. The organisation itself and the board of directors and the subcommittees are served by a full-time secretariat comprising seven people and the RiSA Anti-Piracy Unit (RAPU). The board of directors meet on a quarterly basis. Subcommittees are expected to meet on a monthly basis and to report their activities to the board of directors through the secretariat.&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoppiracy.org.za/risa/ |title=RiSA |accessdate=18 June 2010 |work=StopPiracy.org.za |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701030203/http://stoppiracy.org.za/risa/ |archivedate=1 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of the RiSA entitles a member to the following benefits:
#To have its repertoire protected by the  RiSA Anti-Piracy Unit  to the extent that the unit is able to do so. The RAPU is only entitled to carry out its work on behalf of members and in regard to [[counterfeit]] products that violate the [[copyright]]s of members. RiSA members are required to support the RAPU in regard to proving chain of title in regard to their intellectual property rights which have been infringed by the manufacture of counterfeit products.
#Entering their releases for the annual South African Music Awards at a preferential rate compared to non-members.
#Using the services of RiSA to participate in the licensing of their video products to broadcasters and other.
#RiSA members are required to operate subject to a [[Code of Conduct]]. RiSA members or artists contracted to RiSA members are entitled to refer [[controversy]] to RiSA which they believe are subject to the provisions of the Code of Conduct and RiSA endeavours to resolve such controversies through [[mediation]] when its possible to do so.
#[[Legal advice]] on a variety of matters affecting their business regularly requested by RiSA's secretariat by a large number of members. Such advice is rendered free of charge although members are required to consult their own legal advisors in relation to specific disputes of [[lawsuit|litigation]].
#Being part industry recognition agreements with representative bodies of copyright holders. If a record company is not a member, the company will have to negotiate with these [[entity|entities]] individually regarding a mechanical transfer rate.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;

==Format shifting and illegal copying==

==RiSA certifications==
Since August 2006, albums were required to sell 20,000 copies to be certified gold, and 40,000 copies to be certified platinum. These requirements were later adjusted for albums released from 1 December 2015; albums would need to achieve sales of 15,000 to be certified gold and 30,000 to be certified platinum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sahiphopmag.co.za/2015/09/risa-new-certification-might-just-mean-ko-riky-rick-and-aka-sold-platinum/|title=RiSA New Certification Might Just Mean KO, Riky Rick And AKA sold platinum|website=SA Hip Hop Mag|date=2 October 2015|access-date=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17213">[[File:C. Mather dated signature.png|thumb|[[Cotton Mather]]'s date and signature on September 2, 1692 letter now held by [[Boston College]]]]

In a '''letter dated September 2, 1692, [[Cotton Mather]]''' wrote to judge [[William Stoughton (judge)|William Stoughton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bc-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ALMA-BC21344122680001021&amp;context=L&amp;vid=bclib_new&amp;search_scope=bcl&amp;tab=bcl_only&amp;lang=en_US], Cotton Mather Letters, [1691?]–[1692?], MS1990.023, John J. Burns Library, Boston College&lt;/ref&gt; Among the notable things about this letter is the provenance: it seems to be the last important correspondence from Cotton Mather to surface in modern times, with the holograph manuscript not arriving in the archives for scholars to view, and authenticate, until sometime between 1978 and 1985.&lt;ref&gt;David Levin provides this range of dates in note 19 of his 1985 essay (available as [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44539342.pdf PDF from AAS]) "DId the Mathers Disagree About the Salem Witchcraft Trials" p 36.  Levin's note also discusses the typescript copy that was the only version available to scholars previous to K. Silverman's reprint of the letter 1971. Levin does not offer provenance date for the AAS typescript copy. I have been unable to find a single reference to this letter previous to Silverman in 1971. (For further discussion see Talk page of this article.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and content==
On August 19, 1692, five accused individuals had been executed in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], bringing the total to eleven (reaching twenty by the end of September.) Cotton Mather had attended this execution and one account shows him [[Cotton Mather#Caution on the use of spectral evidence|giving a speech on horseback]] that seemed to quiet a crowd that had previously been calling for mercy for the accused.&lt;ref&gt;Three independent contemporary sources place CM at this execution: Sewall, Brattle, and Calef. Diary of Samuel Sewall, p. 363. https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yiwTAAAAYAAJ GL Burr ''Narratives'' Brattle p. 177. Calef p. 361.https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4hgOAAAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton Mather begins the September 2 letter by writing that he has "made the world sensible of my zeal to assist... your honour...[in the] extinguishing of as wonderful a piece of devilism as has been seen in the world; and yet... one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen."&lt;ref&gt;"Stacy Schiff, "The Witches" (New York, 2015) Chapt IX, pp. 285–6. Schiff begins her summary of this letter in quoting the 'zeal to assist' and Schiff observes, "The claim rather upended the muddled equivocal letters to Foster and Richards."&lt;/ref&gt; Further alluding to the delicate care and subterfuge he employs in his presentation, he writes, "I have laboured to divert the thoughts of my readers, even with something of a designed contrivance..." He asks for Stoughton's permission and approbation in writing on the specifics of the current trials.  This strongly suggests CM's later claim that his book was "commanded" by colonial Governor [[William Phips]] may have been a bold inversion of the truth, as Phips letter on October 10, 1692 says he "put a stop to the printing of any discourses one way or other."&lt;ref&gt;GL Burr ''Narratives'' p, 197. https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4hgOAAAAIAAJ On the same page, Phips seems to be referring to Stoughton and CM when he writes "the persons who have made so ill improvement of these matters here are seeking to turn it all upon me." The book ''Wonders'' was, relative to the output of the province, a very large production, and with its last internal dates around the beginning of October, it would likely have been at the printer's around the same date as Phip's letter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the letter, CM sends a lengthy portion of the book he has already written, telling Stoughton to feel free to skip the first 34 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Schiff "The Witches" p 285.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he says he has "not included all the papers mentioned in my title."&lt;ref&gt;Clive Holmes focusses on how much of the book had already been written by this time. See Clive Holmes, "Reconsiderations" in New England Quarterly, December 2016, Vol. LXXXIX, Number 4, p. 662, note 78. D. Levin also discusses this issue, "Did the Mathers Disagree" p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Against this backdrop, and the "swelling public outcry" of August, [[Stacy Schiff]] concludes that Cotton Mather's book must be viewed as "a propaganda piece"&lt;ref&gt;Schiff "The Witches" p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; departing from a common late twentieth century view of the book as a "defense" of the trials.&lt;ref&gt;D. Levin uses this term in the early part of his essay, "Did the Mathers Disagree" p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoughton responded enthusiastically to the letter, and his personal endorsement of the forthcoming ''Wonders'' is re-printed therein.&lt;ref&gt;D. Levin "Did the Mather's Disagree" (link above) p 24 outlines Stoughton's contributions. See Cotton Mather "Wonders of the Invisible World" ed SG Drake, (1865) Vol. I. Stoughton letter is pp. 5–6. This volume and the other two in Drakes "Witchcraft Delusion" series (volumes II and III being a full reprint of Robert Calef's book) can be found online, including [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBzkQ7sXr6UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false here].&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoughton may have aided CM in going around Phips's ban by helping him ship the book to England to be published there.&lt;ref&gt;''Diary of Cotton Mather'', p. 153. "The shield given by the Lt. Govr. of the Province, under which, that book is walk'd abroad, is enough, and, I confess, too much." For context around this work, which seem to be memoirs presented in the format of a diary, see introduction and notes by WC Ford. https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G-0RAAAAYAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; But another major goal of CM, as expressed in September 2 letter, seems to have been the hope of obtaining copies of the official trial records, and in this he seems to have been further stalled, as can be seen in his letter to the trial clerk Stephen Sewall on September 20, 1692. CM probably did not receive these records until September 22, 1692 when Stephen Sewall travelled to Boston for a meeting at his brother's house with CM and Stoughton.&lt;ref&gt;Sewall DI, pp. 365–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1985: A notable year in the Mather historiography==
There are some indications that the arrival of the holograph of this letter in the archives may have come as an unwelcome surprise to some twentieth-century scholars of the colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;Levin "Did the Mathers Disagree" p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; David Levin points out that the letter demonstrates the timeline used by both "Thomas J. Holmes and [[Perry Miller]]" is off by "three weeks." Writing in the same year as Levin, 1985, Harold Jantz had submitted an essay describing various frauds and fakes and he included the AAS typescript copy of what he calls the "Stoughton letter" (September 2, 1692) calling it a "nasty, pathological" forgery. But in an addendum to the essay, Jantz writes that just before publication "barely in time for this added note, new information reached me about the letter... at present the manuscript is firmly labelled as 'original' and 'holograph'" &lt;ref&gt;Harold Jantz, "Fictions and Inventions in Early America" in Mythos und Aufklarung in der Amerikanishen Literature (Erlangen, 1985) pp. 6–9, 16–19&lt;/ref&gt; Yet as Jantz continues the essay, he still seems to harbor suspicions, referring to the letter's "author" instead of Cotton Mather. "What if it should turn out that the Stoughton letter cannot be proved to be a forgery?" Jantz writes. "This would make it doubly fascinating, doubly perplexing." And "would require that we rewrite Cotton Mather's biography as two Cotton Mather's biographies."&lt;ref&gt;Jantz, Fictions pp. 17,19&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year as the Jantz essay, 1985, [[Kenneth Silverman]] had been awarded a [http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/kenneth-silverman Pulitzer] and a [http://library.columbia.edu/about/awards/bancroft/previous_awards.html Bancroft Prize] for a biography of Cotton Mather published the year before, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;For a 2017 description of the book, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/books/kenneth-silverman-pulitzer-winning-author-dies-at-81.html (NYTimes Obituary)]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jantz, Silverman's introduction to the September 2, 1692 letter in his book of Cotton Mather correspondence (1971) does not directly dispute the authenticity of the letter beyond saying the holograph could not be located, but his basic assessment of Cotton Mather ("he did not want to defend [the trials]") &lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Silverman, ''Selected Letters of Cotton Mather'' (Baton Rouge, 1971) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Silverman, like TJ Holmes, Perry Miller, Jantz (and also perhaps Levin, who published a bio of Cotton Mather in 1978), did not previously believe the typescript copy of the letter was authentic and this would have affected work conducted prior to the knowledge of the holograph in 1985.

Also published in 1985, and written presumably before the holograph of the letter reached the archives, David D. Hall strikes a triumphant note for the revision lead by [[George Lyman Kittredge|GL Kittredge]] at Harvard. "With him one great phase of interpretation came to a dead end."&lt;ref&gt;David D. Hall, "Witchcraft and the Limits of Interpretation" NEQ Vol 58 No. 2 (June, 1985) see pp. 261–3. https://www.jstor.org/stable/365516 Note, Hall doesn't mention the CM letter in this essay.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall writes that whether the old interpretation favored by "antiquarians" had begun with the "malice of [[Robert Calef]] or deep hostility to Puritanism," either way "such notions are no longer... the concern of the historian." But David Hall notes "one minor exception. Debate continues on the attitude and role of Cotton Mather... though none of his recent biographers is at all interested in making him responsible for Salem..." Hall mentions both Levin and Silverman. In 1991, Hall published "Witch-hunting in Seventeenth Century New England: A Documentary History." Hall does not publish or mention the recently controversial Sept. 2 letter and in a footnote Hall writes, "The circumstances under which Mather composed ''Wonders''... are admirably sketched by Thomas J. Holmes..." &lt;ref&gt;David D. Hall ''Witch-hunting in Seventeenth-Century New England'' (Northeaster, 1991)p. 282, note 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance of the Mather letter and typescript copy==

Associated with the holograph in the Burns Library is a faint one-page typescript leaflet, dated April 7, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Boston College, John J. Burns Library, this leaflet filed under MS1990.023 together with September 2, 1692 holograph including typescripts, and two other period documents.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaflet is a description of three Cotton Mather A.L.S. (Autograph Letter Signed) being offered for sale. The leaflet begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt; These three Cotton Mather A.L.S. are addressed to William Stoughton who presided at the Trials of the Witches in Salem and these letters pertain entirely to Witchcraft. Being written to William Stoughton, they are of the greatest importance. According to Mr. Brigham of the American Antiquarian Society, there is a similar letter, same as the longest one here, written to John Richards which is an exact copy of this letter. The reason Mr. Brigham is sure that the Richards letter is a copy is because it is on 2 1/2 pages whereas the enclosed is 4 pages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The leaflet concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Brigham offered me $500 for this which means that it is worth from $1000 to $1500 for he is a good buyer and very conservative in price. He considers this one of the best finds in A.L.S. in years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the three A. L. S. being offered, the letter from which an "exact copy" was taken and sent to John Richards is discussed at length. In 1971, Ken Silverman noted that Mather's letter to Richards, dated May 31, 1692, was "not in Mather's hand."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Silverman, ''Selected Letters of Cotton Mather'' (Baton Rouge, 1971) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; A second A.L.S., the "Return of Several Ministers" is mentioned only in passing. The third A.L.S., the letter of September 2, 1692 and subject of this article, is not mentioned explicitly at all. Although this letter is of extremely high research value, the seller apparently did not think its value to collectors would be as great as the other two well-known documents. The leaflet also mentions showing the A.L.S. to Mr Brigham of the American Antiquarian Society, offering a clue as to the origin and date of the Society's typescript copy of the Sept 2, 1692 letter.

[[File:Stoughton response and CM salutation.png|thumb|Stoughton's handwriting upper left, Cotton Mather's salutation on the right]]

==Establishing the authenticity of the holograph==
According to Jantz, the original manuscript of the letter was sold by the widow of the collector who once owned it to the [[Boston College]] and David Levin had reaffirmed the authenticity and "double checked with some of the experts who had verified Mather's handwriting at the time of acquisition..." and found the paper "of the right age."  Neither Jantz nor Levin seem to have noted that the letter could be further verified by a line of handwriting by William Stoughton (the AAS typescript also contains this line at the end, copied with a pen) a paraphrased version of this opening line was reprinted by Cotton Mather in his book some weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton Mather "Wonders of the Invisible World" ed SG Drake, (1865) Vol. I. Stoughton letter is pp. 5–6. This volume and the other two in Drakes "Witchcraft Delusion" series (volumes II and III being a full reprint of Robert Calef's book) can be found online, including [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBzkQ7sXr6UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false here].&lt;/ref&gt;  Stacy Schiff, writing thirty years after Jantz and Levin, seems to be the first person on record to take notice of this fact, "Stoughton began his fulsome reply on the verso."
Schiff also might be the first scholar, following Jantz and Levin, to note the location of the holograph at the John J. Burns Library of Rare Books and Special Collections at Boston College.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy Schiff, "The Witches" p 286.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stoughton's handwriting also verified by script expert Margo Burns via email April 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent notice of the letter==
Between 1985 and 2015, there appears to have been little notice of what Jantz called the "doubly fascinating, doubly perplexing" letter, or its location and availability for scholarship in the archives, including the interest that coincided with the tercentary of the trials in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;A web search (Aug 10, 2017) for the letter brought up a copy in [http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/letters/to_stoughton.html online Salem archives] (copyright 2010 Benjamin Ray) seems to match K. Silverman's abridged reprint of the letter addressed to Stoughton but missing any reference to Cotton Mather. Bernard Rosenthal's "Records of the Salem Witchhunt" (Cambridge, 2009) only notice of the letter is a non-sequitur folded into an unrelated note with no citation or location information for the letter, see p. 579 or search the date. Emerson Baker in "Storm of Witchcraft" (2014) mentions the date and information that would seem to come from the letter without citation or location information.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2002, Mary Beth Norton seems to accept the Sept. 2 letter's authenticity and quotes some milder passages, citing the reprint in Silverman (1971). It is unclear whether Norton was aware of the controversy around the letter expressed in 1985. In the citation, Norton does not address the Kittredge-Holmes-Miller lineage, which David D. Hall had praised in early 1985, but Norton distances her work from chapter 13 of Perry Miller's 1953 book (Miller cites TJ Holmes for this chapter). Miller's book, she writes, contains "an interpretation of Mather's work on ''Wonders'' that differs considerably from mine."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton ''In the Devil's Snare'' (New York, 2002) p.269 and p.400 note 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clive Holmes in a 2016 essay underscores the importance of the content of the September 2 letter and makes note of the typescript at AAS (but not the holograph at Boston College) and suggests Silverman's abridgement of the letter in 1971 was overly severe.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Holmes, "Reconsiderations" in New England Quarterly, December 2016, Vol. LXXXIX, Number 4, p.662 note 78.&lt;/ref&gt; If Silverman was working within a lineage that distrusted the authenticity of the AAS typescript, as the 1985 essays by Jantz and Levin suggest, it would be understandable why his reprint of the letter in 1971 was truncated.

Digital copies of the letter are now available via email from both AAS (original typescript) and [[Boston College]] (holograph).

==Legend==
The ''soucouyant'' is a [[shapeshifting]] Caribbean folklore character who appears as a reclusive old woman by day. By night, she strips off her wrinkled skin and puts it in a mortar. In her  true form, as a [[Ball lightning|fireball]] she flies across the dark sky in search of a victim. The soucouyant can enter the home of her victim through any sized hole like cracks, crevices and keyholes.

Soucouyants suck people's blood from their arms, legs and soft parts while they sleep leaving blue-black marks on the body in the morning.&lt;ref name=HeritageLibrary&gt;Courtesy The Heritage Library via the [[Trinidad Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt; If the soucouyant draws too much blood, it is believed that the victim will either die and become a soucouyant or perish entirely, leaving her killer to assume her skin. The soucouyant practices [[black magic]]. Soucouyants trade their victims' blood for evil powers with [[Bazil (demon)|Bazil]], the demon who resides in the [[Ceiba pentandra|silk cotton tree]].&lt;ref name=HeritageLibrary /&gt;

To expose a soucouyant, one should heap rice around the house or at the village cross roads as the creature will be obligated to gather every grain, grain by grain (a herculean task to do before dawn) so that she can be caught in the act.&lt;ref name=HeritageLibrary /&gt; To destroy her, coarse salt must be placed in the mortar containing her skin so she perishes, unable to put the skin back on. Belief in soucouyants is still preserved to an extent in Guyana and some Caribbean islands, including Dominica, Haiti, Suriname and Trinidad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maberry|first=Jonathan |title=Vampire Universe: The Dark World of Supernatural Beings That Haunt Us, Hunt …|publisher=Citadel|date=September 1, 2006|pages=203|isbn=978-0-8065-2813-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H1axCZifXdwC&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=Loogaroo%2C%20skin%2C%20tree&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q=Loogaroo,%20skin,%20tree&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skin of the soucouyant is considered valuable, and is used when practicing black magic.

==Origin==
Soucouyants belong to a class of spirits called [[jumbie]]s. Some believe that soucouyants were brought to the Caribbean from European countries in the form of French vampire-myths. These beliefs intermingled with those of enslaved Africans.

In the [[French West Indies]], specifically the island of Guadeloupe, and also in Suriname, the Soukougnan or Soukounian is a person able to shed his or her skin to turn into a vampiric fireball. In general these figures can be anyone, not only old women, although some affirm that only women could become Soukounian, because only female breasts could disguise the creature's wings.

The term "Loogaroo" also used to describe the soucouyant, possibly comes from the French mythological creature called the [[Loup-garou]], a type of werewolf; often confused with each other since they are pronounced the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pYZDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Vampire Mythology |editor=Bane, Theresa |page=96 |year=2012 |isbn=9780786455812 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Haiti, what would be considered a [[werewolf]], is called ''jé-rouges'' ("red eyes").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ltyiiqR3-EC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Twilight Companion: The Unauthorized Guide to the Series |editor=Gresh, Lois H. |year=2008 |isbn=9781429983334 |accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Haiti, the Loogaroo is also common in [[Culture of Mauritius|Mauritian culture]]. In Suriname this creature is called "Asema".

As the legend of the Soucouyant has been verbally passed down over the centuries, the story has changed with the passage of time, so that the Soucouyant is no longer exclusively described as an elderly woman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In [[Wayne Gerard Trotman]]'s [[novel]] ''Kaya Abaniah and the Father of the Forest'', a vicious soucouyant appears as a main antagonist.
* In [[Jean Rhys]]'s ''[[Voyage in the Dark]]'' a soucouyant is one of Anna Morgan's daydreaming fears before she undergoes an abortion that leaves her bleeding to death.  It is worth noting that before the ending was edited, Anna Morgan dies of the abortion.
* Also used in Rhys's short story "The Day They Burned the Books", in a servant's description of Mrs. Sawyer, a main character in the story: "...Mildred told the other servants in the town that her eyes had gone wicked, like a soucriant's eyes, and that afterwards she had picked up some of the hair he pulled out and put it in an envelope, and that Mr. Sawyer ought to look out (hair is obeah as well as hands)".
* Also used in a third [[Jean Rhys]] book, ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'', when the former slave, Christophine, describes Antoinette's eyes as "red like soucriant".
* In "Greedy Choke Puppy", a short story by [[Nalo Hopkinson]], a soucouyant narrates part of the story. Hopkinson's book ''Brown Girl in the Ring'' also features a soucouyant, who is delayed from her purpose of consuming blood by another character who drops rice grains on the floor, forcing the soucouyant to pick them up before proceeding.
* Appears in the novel ''White is for Witching: A Novel'' by [[Helen Oyeyemi]].
* ''Soucouyant'' is the title and one of the primary plot devices of a novel by [[David Chariandy]].
* A soucouyant is the title creature in the book "Nightwitch" by author Ken Douglas, which was also published under a previous pseudonym, Jack Priest.
* In [[Timothy Williams (author)|Timothy Williams]]'s  Guadeloupe novel, "Un autre soleil", "Another Sun" the spelling soucougnan is adopted in both French and English. 
* A Soucouyant appears in ''The Night Piece'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Night Piece and Other Stories: Amazon.co.uk: Andre Alexis: 9780747544616: Books|publisher=|id= {{ASIN|0747544611|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of short-stories written by [[André Alexis]].
* In [[Byzantium (film)|Byzantium]], a [[Neil Jordan]] film, one of the protagonists, Eleanor Webb, refers to vampires in her story as "soucriants". On the other hand, there isn't any reference to Caribbean mythology in the movie itself and the vampires' origin is hinted as pre-Christian European.
* In Season 3 episode 6 of ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', a soucouyant appears. This creature is a swarm of red insects that can gather itself into a female humanoid shape, and whose sting causes paranoid insanity. As the soucouyant is the queen of her swarm, she targets authority figures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">'''The Hamburg Bible''' (also '''Biblia Latina''' or '''The Bible of Bertoldus''') a manuscript in [[The Royal Library, Denmark]], inscribed in 2011 on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]].&lt;ref name="Biblia Latina"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/ms-gks-4-2-vol-i-iii-biblia-latina-commonly-called-the-hamburg-bible-or-the-bible-of-bertoldus/#c200529] Memory of the World Register&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hamburg Bible is a richly illuminated Latin Bible in three very large volumes made for the [[Hamburg Cathedral|Cathedral of Hamburg]] in 1255. As a witness to the medieval book culture in Europe, it is a monument in its own right. It is the result of a small group of highly talented clergy- and craftsmen who not only exercised their skills to an extraordinary perfection, but also allowed themselves - or were allowed - to show their fascination of their own craft. The 89 illuminated initials contained in the three volumes illustrate themes of biblical books, with one illustrating the production of the medieval book, from the manufacturing of parchment at the beginning of the process to the illumination of initial letters when the work approached completion.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Petersen: ''Bertoldus' bibel. Bøger, billeder og bogstaver i et håndskrift fra 1255'' Fund og Forskning i Det Kongelige Biblioteks Samlinger (Copenhagen), Vol. 32, 1993. pp.7-38&lt;/ref&gt; The images are unique both as expressions of medieval art and as sources to the craft and history of the medieval book.

The '''Vulcan Hotel''' is an historic [[hotel]] and [[public house]], that was located in [[Adamsdown]] suburb of [[Cardiff]], [[South Wales]]. Scheduled for demolition in 2009, after a long public campaign to preserve what had become Cardiff's oldest public house, in 2012 it was donated to the [[St Fagans National Museum of History|National History Museum]] at [[St Fagans]], where it is being reconstructed.

[[File:The Vulcan pub sign, Cardiff geograph-3487704.jpg|The Vulcan pub sign, February 2012|thumb|left]]

The Vulcan Hotel was built in 1853, in the early stages of the expansion of Cardiff and the development of the [[Adamsdown]] area of Cardiff, with an original address on Whitmore Lane, [[Newtown, Cardiff|Newtown]]. The name Vulcan, the ancient Roman [[Vulcan (mythology)|God of Fire]], which it kept throughout its existence, referred to the nearby ironworks.&lt;ref name=SWE253538422/&gt;

Close to the bustling [[railway station]] of [[Cardiff Queen Street railway station|Queen Street]] and within walking distance of [[HM Prison Cardiff|Cardiff Gaol]],&lt;ref name=JOMEC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SWE253538422/&gt; the pub was south of the [[A4161 road|Newport Road]] in the suburb's working-class area. It was frequently busy over lunch times and in the early evening, patronised by working-class people, often of Irish descent.

The building was substantially rebuilt in about 1900,&lt;ref name=CADW/&gt; and internally refurbished in 1914 by local architect F. J. Veall,&lt;ref name=CADW/&gt; at which time the building was decorated throughout with green and brown [[ceramic tiles]].&lt;ref name=CADW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savebritainsheritage.org/news/article.php?id=57 Historic Welsh Pub Threatened with Demolition], Save Britains Heritage. Retrieved 22 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With a functional and easy-to-clean internal style, while adjoining [[Victorian era|Victorian]] buildings were demolished and redeveloped, twice on one side, it remained untouched, both outside and in, except for an occasional coat of paint. The pub retained its brown ceramic [[urinal]]s, although the rest of the interior was updated in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=JOMEC&gt;{{cite news|last=Preston |first=James |title=Cardiff's oldest pub looks set to close |work=The Cardiffian |date=20 March 2012|url=http://cardiffian.jomec.co.uk/article/cardiffs-oldest-pub-looks-set-close |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local writer John Williams commented in 2011:&lt;ref name=PfctPub/&gt;
{{cquote|The place is a total time warp. Inside it's forever 1975. The Brains beer is cheap, the toilets are outside in the rain, and the bikers come down to drink every Saturday lunchtime. It's full of Cardiff history.}}
The opening, directly opposite the pub, in November 2007, of the [[Atrium, Cardiff|Atrium campus]] of the [[University of Glamorgan]], home to the Cardiff School of Creative &amp; Cultural Industries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.glam.ac.uk/news/en/2007/nov/28/cardiffs-most-exciting-campus-opens/|publisher= [[University of Glamorgan]]|title= Cardiff's Most Exciting Campus Opens|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the pub a substantial potential new customer base.

The Vulcan was voted Cardiff Pub of the Year by the local branch of [[CAMRA]] in both 1997 and 2009.&lt;ref name=SWE253538422&gt;{{cite news|last=Flynn|first=Jessica|title=Strange world of pub names |work=South Wales Echo|date=8 April 2011|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/STRANGE+WORLD+OF+PUB+NAMES%3B+In+our+continuing+campaign+to+Support+Our...-a0253538422 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Brains Brewery]] confirmed that they were to terminate their lease on the property. Site owner and freeholder, businessman Derek Rapport via his company Marcol Asset Management, had plans accepted at [[Cardiff Council]] for the demolition of the building and subsequent mixed-use redevelopment of the surrounding site, based around a multi-storey car park.&lt;ref name=PfctPub&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moody |first1=Paul |last2=Turner |first2=Robin |title=The Search for the Perfect Pub: Looking For the Moon Under Water|chapter=Cardiff Afterlife |year=2011|publisher=Orion Publishing|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lop1YrE8xhYC&amp;pg=PT129&amp;dq=%22the+vulcan%22+cardiff#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20vulcan%22%20cardiff&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1409112679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deconstruction_of_the_Vulcan,_Cardiff_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3092172.jpg|thumb|left|The Vulcan being dismantled in August 2012]]

A local campaign began to protect what by then was Cardiff's oldest surviving original public house. A petition was raised that gathered over 5,000 signatures,&lt;ref name=BBC17955268/&gt; politicians lobbied, and celebrities including [[James Dean Bradfield]] of the [[Manic Street Preachers]] and actor [[Rhys Ifans]] actively supported the campaign and visited the premises. The Cardiff band [[Future of the Left]] recorded the video for their single ''[[The Hope That House Built]]'' on the premises. But [[Cadw]] declined to make the pub a [[listed building]], due to the fact that it had been substantially rebuilt in the 1900s and that there were better surviving examples elsewhere.&lt;ref name=CADW&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Cadw|author=Cadw|title = Vulcan Public House, Adamsdown, Cardiff (report)|publisher=[[National Assembly of Wales]]|date=17 March 2009|url=http://www.assemblywales.org/2009.03.17_cadw_paper.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of public pressure, the freeholders agreed to a three-year extension of the lease to Brains.

But in early 2012, Brains confirmed that they would be terminating their lease when it expired in March 2012, stating that the business was commercially unviable.&lt;ref name=SWE2033834&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardiff's oldest pub The Vulcan set to close |work=Wales Online|date=8 March 2012|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/cardiffs-oldest-pub-vulcan-set-2033834 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the building again threatened with demolition, but still with a growing local media campaign to save the building, Marcol Asset Management agreed to donate the building to the [[St Fagans National Museum of History]]. Brains subsequently closed the pub as scheduled in May 2012, while the museum started an appeal for photographs, objects and stories relating to the Vulcan and its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/waleshistory/2012/05/vulcan_pub_cardiff_st_fagans_museum.html|title=Historic Cardiff pub to move to St Fagans National History Museum|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|date=4 May 2012|accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, building contractors and preservationists were deployed by the National History Museum to start deconstruction of the building by hand, to allow brick by brick movement to St Fagans.&lt;ref name=BBC17955268&gt;{{cite news|title=Vulcan pub in Cardiff dismantled for St Fagans museum rebuild in 'several years' |publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|date=4 May 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-17955268 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photos show dismantling of Cardiff's 'Vulcan' pub |work=ITV Wales News|date=21 August 2012|url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/update/2012-08-21/ddd/ |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2013, the de-constructed parts of the building were held between the museums sites at St Fagans and Nantgarew,{{what|date=April 2017}} awaiting [[planning permission]] for the buildings reconstruction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plans to rebuild Cardiff's Vulcan pub at St Fagans submitted |publisher=BBC News|date=28 July 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-23482063 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is estimated to be reopened in 2019.&lt;ref name=WO11139903&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/historic-vulcan-pub-reopen-doors-11139903|title= Historic Vulcan pub to reopen its doors and serve alcohol again – but you'll have to wait until 2019 |date=5 April 2016|accessdate=5 April 2016|work=WalesOnline|publisher=Media Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WO4726497&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=James|title=The Vulcan: Boldly going where no pub has ever gone before |work=Wales Online|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/vulcan-boldly-going-no-pub-4726497|date=28 June 2013|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual plan is to reopen the pub with a suitably-styled historic theme, with actors serving historic ales.

It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in [[New York City]] and how his firm [[Stratton Oakmont]] engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on [[Wall Street]] that ultimately led to his downfall. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] (who was also a producer) stars as Belfort, with [[Jonah Hill]] as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, [[Margot Robbie]] as his wife Naomi Lapaglia and [[Kyle Chandler]] as Patrick Denham, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who tries to bring him down. [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[Jon Favreau]], [[Joanna Lumley]] and [[Jean Dujardin]] also star. The film marks the [[Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio|director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio]], after ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006) and ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter after the television series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' (2010–14).

''The Wolf of Wall Street'' premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was the first to be released entirely through [[digital distribution]]. It was a major commercial success, grossing more than $392 million worldwide during its original theatrical run to become Scorsese's highest-grossing film and the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2013&amp;p=.htm|title=2013 Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was controversial for its morally ambiguous depiction of events, explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, depiction of hard drug use and the [[Animals in film and television|use of animals]] during production. The film also caused controversy due to accusations that it was financed by illegally obtained funds from [[1Malaysia Development Berhad]] (1MDB).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/336199 | title = WSJ: US$155m of 1MDB funds went to ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ |website=Malaysiakini.com|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/red-granite-settlement-1mdb-corruption-scandal-1202170872/|title=Red Granite Settles With U.S. Government Over 2 Films As Part Of 1MDB Case|last=Busch|first=Patrick Hipes, Anita|date=2017-09-15|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise for Scorsese's direction, the comedic performance of DiCaprio and the fast-paced and consistent humor. The film was [[List of accolades received by The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|nominated for several awards]] including five nominations at the [[86th Academy Awards|86th Academy Awards ceremony]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]], as well as [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] nominations for DiCaprio and Hill, respectively.

==Plot==
In 1987, [[Jordan Belfort]] procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for [[L.F. Rothschild]], employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] and takes a job at a [[Boiler room (business)|boiler room brokerage firm]] on Long Island that specializes in [[penny stock]]s. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.

Jordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell". The basic method of the firm is a [[pump and dump]] scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of [[Stratton Oakmont]]. After an exposé in ''[[Forbes]]'', hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Steve Madden (company)|Steve Madden]]. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a [[Swiss bank account]] with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.

Donnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.

Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Now fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Infuriated, Jordan hits Naomi twice, insults her as a "[[cunt]]" and tries to run off with his daughter Skylar in his car, but he ends up crashing in the driveway. The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him. Donnie keeps the note and rats out Jordan to the FBI. Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite his breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves three years in a minimum security prison. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.

===Development===
In 2007, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]/[[Warner Bros.]] won a bidding war against [[Brad Pitt]]/[[Paramount Pictures]] for the rights to Jordan Belfort's memoir ''The Wolf of Wall Street'', and Martin Scorsese was considered to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pamela McClintock |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/scorsese-dicaprio-cry-wolf-1117961782/ |title=Scorsese, DiCaprio cry ‘Wolf’ |newspaper=Variety |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter" /&gt; During pre-production, Scorsese worked on the film's script before working on ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]''. He describes having "wasted five months of [his] life" without getting a [[Green-light|green light]] on production dates by the Warner Bros. studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Saravia |title=Raging Bull of Cinema Part II|url=http://jerrysaravia.blogspot.com/2011/08/raging-of-bull-of-cinema-part-2.html |date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Belfort made $1 million on the movie rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Charlie Gasparino |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/2013/03/12/wolf-wall-street-gets-1m-pay-day-for-movie-rights/ |title='Wolf of Wall Street' Gets $1M Pay Day for Movie Rights |publisher=Fox Business |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2014-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217034106/http://www.foxbusiness.com/2013/03/12/wolf-wall-street-gets-1m-pay-day-for-movie-rights/ |archivedate=February 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Warner Bros. had offered [[Ridley Scott]] to direct the film, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the male lead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/ridley-scott-eyeing-reteam-with-leo-dicaprio-on-the-wolf-of-wall-street/ |title=Ridley Scott Eyeing Reteam With Leo DiCaprio On 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the studio eventually dumped the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/cannes-red-granite-acquires-leonardo-dicaprio-pic-the-wolf-of-wall-street/ |title=Cannes: Red Granite Acquires Leonardo DiCaprio Pic 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a green light was given by the [[Independent film|independent company]] [[Red Granite Pictures]] allowing no restrictions to the content development.

Christina McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis, who worked closely with the real-life Belfort at Stratton Oakmont, wrote an [[open letter]] addressing Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Belfort himself, criticizing the film for insufficiently portraying the victims of the financial crimes created by Stratton Oakmont, for disregarding the damage that was done to her family as a result, and for giving celebrity to persons (Belfort and his partners, including her father) who do not deserve it.&lt;ref name="laweekly"&gt;{{cite web | date = December 26, 2013 | author = Christina McDowell | url = http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2013/12/wolf_of_wall_street_prousalis.php?page=2 | title = An Open Letter to the Makers of The Wolf of Wall Street, and the Wolf Himself | work = [[LA Weekly]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Perlberg of ''[[Business Insider]]'' saw an [[screener (promotional)|advance screening]] of the film at a [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Cinemas]] near the [[Goldman Sachs]] building, with an audience of financial workers. Perlberg reported cheers from the audience at what he considered to be all the wrong moments—"When Belfort — a drug addict attempting to remain sober — rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash, there were cheers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banker-pros-cheer-wolf-of-wall-street-2013-12|title=Banker Pros Cheer At Wolf Of Wall Street|publisher=Business Insider|date=19 December 2013|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 2nd ref shows [[WP:NOTABLE]] --&gt;&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite web|date=26 December 2013|author=Katey Rich|title=The Wolf of Wall Street Is Enraging Moviegoers, Thrilling Bankers, And Making Tons Of Cash|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/12/the-wolf-of-wall-street-christmas-box-office|quote=meaning audiences liked it less than everything else currently in theaters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Assistant United States Attorney]] who prosecuted the real Belfort criticized both the movie and the book on which it is based. He said he believes some of Belfort's claims were "invented", as for instance "[Belfort] aggrandized his importance and reverence for him by others at his firm." He strongly criticizes the film for not depicting the "thousands of [scam] victims who lost hundreds of millions of dollars", not accepting the filmmakers' argument that it would have detracted attention from the wrongdoers. Furthermore, he deplores the ending—"beyond an insult" to his victims—in which the real Belfort appears, while showing "a large sign advertising the name of Mr. Belfort's real motivational speaking company", and a positive depiction of Belfort uttering "variants of the same falsehoods he trained others to use against his victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Joel M.|title=The Real Belfort Story Missing From 'Wolf' Movie|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/the-real-belfort-story-missing-from-wolf-movie/?_r=0|accessdate=9 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Warburg Institute''' is a research institution associated with the [[University of London]] in central [[London]], [[England]]. A member of the [[School of Advanced Study]], its focus is the study of cultural history and the role of images in culture - cross-disciplinary and global. It is concerned with the histories of art and science, and their relationship with superstition, magic, and popular beliefs.

The researches of the Warburg Institute are historical, philological and anthropological. It is dedicated to the study of the survival and transmission of cultural forms – whether in literature, art, music or science – across borders and from the earliest times to the present including especially the study of the influence of [[classical antiquity]] on all aspects of [[Europe]]an [[Western civilization|civilization]].

Based originally in Hamburg, Germany, in 1933 the collection was moved to London, where it became incorporated into the University of London in 1944.

==History==

===Hamburg===
The Institute was formed in [[Hamburg]], Germany, from the library of [[Aby Warburg]] (1866–1929), a student of [[Renaissance]] art and culture, and a scion of the wealthy Jewish [[Warburg family]].

As an [[art historian]], Warburg had become dissatisfied with an aestheticising approach to art history and was interested in a more philosophical and [[interdisciplinary]] approach. While studying the culture of Renaissance [[Florence]], he grew interested in the influence of [[Classical tradition|antiquity on modern culture]], and the study of this second life of the [[Classical World]] became his life work.

In 1900 he decided to establish the Warburg-Bibliothek für Kulturwissenschaft,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warburg-haus.de/texte/abym.html "Aby M. Warburg"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091056/http://www.warburg-haus.de/texte/abym.html |date=2015-04-02 }} at the Aby-Warburg-Stiftung website (in German). Retrieved 3 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; but, although he had begun collecting books in 1886, he didn't actually establish his library until 1909.&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;Deborah J. Haynes (1996). [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000090664 "Warburg, Aby"], vol. 32, pp. 854–855,  in ''[[The Dictionary of Art]]'' (34 vols.), edited by Jane Turner. New York: Grove. {{ISBN|9781884446009}}. Also at [[Oxford Art Online]], subscription required.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg was joined in 1913 by the [[Vienna]] art historian [[Fritz Saxl]] (1890–1948).&lt;ref name=WarburgInstituteHistory&gt;[http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/home/aboutthewarburginstitute/history/ "History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308175011/http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/home/aboutthewarburginstitute/history |date=2015-03-08 }} at The Warburg Institute website. Retrieved 3 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; They discussed the possibility of converting the library into a research institute in 1914, but [[World War I]] and illness interfered. After Warburg returned to Hamburg in 1924, he and Saxl initiated the process of conversion, and the  Warburg-Bibliothek officially opened its doors as a research institute in 1926.&lt;ref name=Hayes/&gt;

Eventually, the privately funded library, built around the interdisciplinary approach, became enormous. Warburg "famously forfeited his right to a share of his fortune on condition that his younger brother Max would buy him any books he required".&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/warburg-institute-library-saved-from-nazis-awaits-its-fate/2014023.article|title=Warburg Institute: library saved from Nazis awaits its fate|last=Grove|first=Jack|date=19 June 2014|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The World’s Weirdest Library|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/in-the-memory-ward|website = The New Yorker|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was later affiliated to the [[University of Hamburg]]. [[Neo-Kantian]] Philosopher and professor at the newly founded University [[Ernst Cassirer]] used it, and his students [[Erwin Panofsky]] and [[Edgar Wind]] worked there.

The original Warburg Library building in Hamburg is now a research institute, [[Warburg-Haus Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warburg-haus.de/|title=Warburg-Haus Hamburg|year=2006|language=German|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===London===
[[File:Warburg Institute from Woburn Square.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The Warburg as seen from Woburn Square]]

In 1933, under the shadow of [[Nazism]], the Institute was relocated to London, where, with the aid of [[Lord Lee of Fareham]], [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], and the Warburg family, it was installed in [[Thames House]] in 1934. The Institute moved to the [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute Buildings]] in 1937. In 1944 it became associated with the University of London.&lt;ref name=WarburgInstituteHistory/&gt;

[[Henri Frankfort]] succeeded Saxl as Director in 1949, and in 1955 was succeeded by [[Gertrud Bing]], who had joined the organization in 1922. During her term as Director, the Institute moved to its current home at the University in 1958. Bing was succeeded by [[Ernst Gombrich]] in 1959. From 1976 to 1990, [[J. B. Trapp]] was Director, and from 1991 to 2001, [[Nicholas Mann (academic)|Nicholas Mann]].  In 1994 the Warburg became a founding institute of the University of London's [[School of Advanced Study]].&lt;ref name=WarburgInstituteHistory/&gt;

Recent directors have been Charles Hope (2001 to 2010),&lt;ref name=WarburgInstituteHistory/&gt; Peter Mack (2010 to 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/home/staff-contacts/academic-staff/peter-mack/ |title=Peter Mack, Director and Professor of the History of the Classical Tradition |accessdate=2015-03-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703100413/http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/home/staff-contacts/academic-staff/peter-mack/ |archivedate=July 3, 2014 |df= }}, originally at The Warburg Institute website.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Freedberg]] (from July 2015 to April 2017).&lt;ref&gt;[http://warburg-archive.sas.ac.uk/fileadmin/images/Home/freedberg.pdf Distinguished international scholar David Freedberg appointed Director of The Warburg Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914133026/http://warburg-archive.sas.ac.uk/fileadmin/images/Home/freedberg.pdf |date=2016-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, legal action was started by the University of London together with the Institute's Advisory Council about their disagreement regarding the meaning of the 1944 deed of trust that granted the University the collection; the pledge "to maintain and preserve the collection 'in perpetuity' as 'an independent unit'" is problematised by the institute's annual deficit, estimated at half a million pounds.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Several students and scholars who had used the Warburg resources or studied there protested this planned merge.  A petition on Change.org to save the Warburg's independence was started by Brooke Palmieri, a student of University College London after working on her PhD. thesis at the Warburg.  In only two months, the petition had almost twenty five thousand signatures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In recent years, the University has charged a proportion of its total estate expenditure to the Warburg Institute; as a result, the finances of the once solvent Institute have been strongly affected. In November 2014, a judgement established that the University's conduct in this regard was not acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/home/news/high-court-ruling/ |title=Warburg Institute Press Release (6 November 2014) |accessdate=2014-11-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108144222/http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/home/news/high-court-ruling/ |archivedate=8 November 2014 |df= }}, originally at The Warburg Institute website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
[[File:Warburg Institute entrance.JPG|thumbnail|Entrance to the Warburg Institute in Woburn Square]]
The Institute occupies a large building on [[Woburn Square]], in the University of London's [[Bloomsbury]] campus in the central [[London Borough of Camden]]. Designed by [[Charles Holden]] and built in 1957, the building is adjacent to the University of London Student Union, [[Birkbeck College]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], and Christ the King Church. It is also the home of the studio of the [[Slade School of Fine Art]], [[University College, London]].

The Warburg Institute maintains a research library of more than 350,000 volumes. These volumes, except for a small number of rare and valuable books, are kept on open shelves and are accessible to all. The Institute also holds a large photographic collection and the personal archives of Aby Warburg. The Institute is notable for its unusual and unique reference system: the Institute's collection is arranged by subject according to Warburg's division of human history into the categories of Action, Orientation, Word, and Image. The photographic collection holds the valuable archive of [[the Image of the Black in Western Art]].

==Organisation==
In addition to its primary purpose as an academic reference library, the Institute accepts a small number of graduate students each year. The Institute awards the degrees of [[Master of Arts]] in Cultural and Intellectual History (1300–1650) and  [[Master of Arts]] in Art History, Curatorship and Renaissance culture,  [[Master of Philosophy]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]]; the first and the second are one-year degrees with taught and research components, the MPhil is a two-year research degree which would usually be expected to lead onto a PhD with further study, and the last is a three-year research degree.

The emphasis of these programs is on developing interpretative skills in a number of different academic subjects, which follows from the Institute's interdiscplinary mission. Considerable attention is devoted to improving language skills and knowledge of primary sources.

==Students and faculty==
Scholars associated with the Warburg Institute include [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Rudolf Wittkower]], [[Otto Kurz]], [[Henri Frankfort]], [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], [[Ernst Gombrich]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Edgar Wind]], [[Frances Yates]], [[D. P. Walker]], [[Michael Baxandall]], [[Anthony Grafton]], and [[Elizabeth McGrath (art historian)|Elizabeth McGrath]]. The current group of scholars continues the Institute's tradition of interdisciplinary research into history, philosophy, religion, and art. The permanent staff includes a number of academics and graduate students who hold short and long-term fellowships. Due to the small number of staff, students, and regular users, the Institute prides itself on a friendly and informal teaching and research atmosphere.

Together with the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], the Institute publishes ''The Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', an annual publication of about 300 pages.&lt;ref&gt;http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/publications/journal/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William John Potts''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OOnt}} (June 25, 1915 &amp;ndash; February 4, 1990) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by his [[ring name]] '''"Whipper" Billy Watson''', and was a two-time world heavyweight wrestling champion.

==Early life==
Watson was born in 1915 in East York, Ontario{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=201}} (now part of Toronto) to an English born father, John Potts and a Canadian born mother, Alice Mary Wilken.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=201}} Watson began wrestling in Toronto under his real name. He was a member of the Scarborough Athletic Club in the mid-1930s and was wrestling on what were billed as amateur wrestling shows in Toronto.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Exposure to wrestling===
For four years as a teenager, Watson sold the [[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]] at the corner of Danforth and Dawes Road. He was convinced by his brother George to play hooky from piano lessons one Saturday to attend a wrestling session at the All Hallows Anglican Church gymnasium. The event changed Watson's life. He furthered his wrestling training with Phillip Lawson at the Bowles Athletic Club and later the Central YMCA.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=202}}

In 1936, wrestling as Bill Potts, Watson appeared on cards at British Consols Stadium in Toronto that were advertised as amateur wrestling shows. In June of that year, he went on a tour of the United Kingdom along with fellow Toronto wrestlers Tommy Nelson, Al Korman, and Ken "Tiger" Tasker and their manager, Harry Joyce. English wrestling often involved hard-nosed shooting and he was sidelined for six months with a fractured shoulder and numerous broken ribs.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=202}} It was on this tour that William Potts became Billy Watson. Booked by former Olympic Gold Medalist [[George de Relwyskow]], Watson traveled through England and [[Ireland]].{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=202}}

===Star attraction at Maple Leaf Gardens===
After four years abroad, Watson and his wife returned to Canada, and he began wrestling at [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] in Toronto under 27-year-old promoter [[Frank Tunney]]. Watson made his Gardens debut in the opening match of the October 3, 1940. Newspaper reports in November said Watson was frustrated with not getting a main event match in his first six appearances at the Gardens. He appeared in one Gardens main event in February 1941 but his big push came two months later. According to storyline, Watson filed a lawsuit against Tunney for breach of contract, claiming that he had been signed to wrestle a main event against Masked Wolf. When Tunney held an open tournament to determine the number one contender for the world title on May 1, 1941, Watson entered; filing a copy of his entry form with the Ontario Athletics Commission so that Tunney would be unable to claim he did not enter, and then won four matches in one night to win the tournament.

From that point on, Watson was positioned as a legitimate main event performer, a position that was cemented during Watson's feud with Nanjo Singh, which began in January 1942. Watson soon became a crowd favourite and within a few years was a mainstream celebrity and one of Toronto's most popular citizens. [[Frank Tunney]] estimated that Whipper Watson drew more than five million people in main events of shows in Toronto. As one of the most popular wrestlers in the city's history, Watson spent 31 years entertaining fans. His debut at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] was on October 3, 1940, and his last match was held on November 28, 1971.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=201}}

===Championship runs===
Watson defeated Nanjo Singh for the British Empire title on April 30, 1942.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=203}}  He feuded with [[Bill Longson]], [[Lou Thesz]], [[Yvon Robert]], [[Gene Kiniski]], [[Gorgeous George]], and [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]], among many others. Watson earned a reputation as someone who was willing to lose clean in the ring.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=203}} He earned an "everyman" image and Watson went on to hold the city of Toronto's regional title and the British Empire title on a regular basis.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=203}}

Tunney cut Watson in on the business side of things. Their combined booking efforts resulted in large fortunes for the two of them. With connections to St. Louis promoter [[Tom Packs]], Watson's notoriety resulted in Watson ending Longson's four year title reign with a victory at the Kiel Auditorium in [[St. Louis]] on February 21, 1947.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=203}} The territory of St. Louis became a home away from home for Watson. More than 10,000 St. Louis fans watched local hero [[Lou Thesz]] beat Watson for the world title on April 25, 1947.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=203}} After Packs retired in 1948, Tunney bought into the territory in St. Louis and this resulted in many more matches for Watson in the city.

Watson became one of a small group of wrestlers to have membership in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]].{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=203}} In 1955, Watson expanded his business ventures by purchasing the [[Seattle]] territory from Bob Murray.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=203}} Wrestlers from Toronto such as Doug Hepburn and Sky-Hi Lee wrestled for Watson in Seattle. Ken Kenneth ran the day-to-day operations for Watson and imported wrestlers from San Francisco to compete in Seattle. The territory folded a few months later.

On March 15, 1956, Watson ended Thesz's six-year reign as World Champion in front of 15,000 fans. Former boxing champion Jack Dempsey was the referee in the match.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=204}} Watson traveled throughout North America and took on legends such as Gorgeous George, [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]], [[Dick Hutton]], [[Richard Dempk]], [[Bobo Brazil]], [[Hans Schmidt (wrestler)|Hans Schmidt]], [[Fritz Von Erich]], [[Killer Kowalski]] and Buddy Rogers. Thesz regained the title from Watson on November 9, 1956 in St. Louis.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=204}}

He also trained several wrestlers, including [[Farmer Brooks]], a [[midget professional wrestler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/brooks_farmer.html|title=Canadian Hall of Fame: Farmer Brooks|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rocky Johnson]], a multiple-time tag team champion and father of [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]].

Outside of wrestling, Watson considered playing football for the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] in the 1950s. Watson tested the waters of politics as the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] candidate in [[York East]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 federal election]]. Watson placed second with 32% of the vote, falling about 2,500 votes behind [[Liberal Party of Canada]] candidate [[Steve Otto]]. Watson also promoted his own soft drink brand.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=204}}

===End of the road===
On November 28, 1971, he teamed with [[Bulldog Brower]] at the Gardens to beat Dingo the Sundowner and Man Mountain Cannon in less than five minutes.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=204}}

Watson was hit by an out-of-control car while placing a fireplace screen in the trunk of his car on November 30 on [[Rogers Road (Toronto)|Rogers Road]] in Toronto. After a three-hour surgery at Northwestern Hospital, his knee eventually recovered, but Watson could never wrestle again.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=204}} Although he nearly lost a leg, he continued his fundraising activities into his retirement.

Watson was well known for his contributions to charity. He raised millions for campaigns such as the [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]] and was responsible for having 150,000 children join a safety club.{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=204}} He made many public appearances across Canada in support of children with physical disabilities and held an annual Easter Seals skate-a-thon at the Gardens. In 1974, he also started the "Whipper Watson Snowarama for Timmy" to raise money for the construction of a therapeutic pool. To date, Snowarama for Easter Seals Kids has raised over 16.1 million dollars provincially to help support children and youth with physical disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=44834|title=Riders support Easter Seals Snowarama|publisher=SooToday|accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, his campaign to build The Whipper Watson Therapeutic Pool at [[Southlake Regional Health Centre]] is illustrated in a mural in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southlakeregional.org/foundation.whipperlegacy.html Southlake Regional Health Centre - Foundation - Whipper Watson Therapeutic Pool&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Watson was quoted in the [[Sault Star]] on January 31, 1979, "They deserve a chance to live life as normally as you or I and we can help them do it. We can tear down some of those needless barriers that the handicapped face everyday. We can give thanks that our kids and families aren't afflicted and we can get out and sincerely work hard to make the 1979 Snowarama the most successful yet."

Over the course of the next twelve years, Watson gained 130 pounds to weigh 350 pounds. He died on February 4, 1990 in [[Orlando, Florida]].{{sfnp|Hornbaker|2007|p=204}} He is well-remembered in [[Regional Municipality of York, Ontario|York Region]] where he lived. W.J. Watson Public School in [[Keswick, Ontario]] is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wjwatson.ps.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/profile.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[Ontario Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whipper Billy Watson|url=http://oshof.ca/index.php/honoured-members/item/106-whipper-billy-watson|website=oshof.ca|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Watson was the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]]'s candidate in [[York East]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 federal election]], losing by 3,000 votes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">The '''Wireless Experimental Centre''' was one of two overseas outposts of Station X, [[Bletchley Park]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] signals analysis centre during [[World War II]]. The other outpost was the [[Far East Combined Bureau]]. Codebreakers [[Wilfred Noyce]] and Maurice Allen broke the Japanese Army's [[Japanese army and diplomatic codes|Water Transport Code]] here in 1943, the first high-level Japanese Army code broken. [[John Tiltman]] broke prewar Russian and Japanese codes at Simla and Abbottabad.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=54-55, 175-180}}
 
== Location and function == 
The WEC was located in [[Ramjas College]] (formerly part of the Delhi University campus), atop a hill called Anand Parbat "the hill of happiness" and was several miles out of Delhi and hence secure.{{sfn|Elphick|1998|p=396}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/mar1944.rhtm March 1944 : The Invasion Postponed], from [[Bletchley Park]] archives, accessed 15 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Staff were from the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]], the British and Indian armies and the Royal Air Force. Section C under Colonel Marr-Johnson was a radio (wireless) intercept station and decoding section for Japanese codes. There were three outstations: the Wireless Experimental Depot in [[Abbottabad]] (where Russian (Soviet) transmissions were monitored in the interwar period), the Western Wireless sub centre at [[Bangalore]] and the Eastern Wireless sub centre at [[Barrackpore]]. There were also about 88 listening wireless sets around India, and several mobile [[Y-stations]].&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence and the War Against Japan: Britain, America and the Politics of Secret Service, Richard James Aldrich, Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on [[Japanese army and diplomatic codes#BULBUL|BULBUL]] the IJA air-to-ground code which was first broken at Bletchley Park was transferred to the WEC as it provided valuable tactical information on Japanese air raids.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=244-246}}{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=150}}

== Sections == 
Apart from Section C, the other four sections carried out administration, collating and evaluating signals intelligence, traffic analysis and radio interception. Colonel Aldridge headed the signals section, and had under his command No. 5 Wireless Detachment, Royal Corps of Signals.{{sfn|Elphick|1998|p=396}} 

== Peter Marr-Johnson ==
Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Marr-Johnson was the head of Section C of the Wireless Experimental Centre from 1943.  He ran a successful but "too rigid" operation, with staff finding him distant and snobbish.{{sfn|Elphick|1998|pp=396,397}} He was a regular Army officer, having been commissioned in the Royal Artillery. He showed a talent in languages, and in 1932 with two other officers was sent to Japan as a language student. He received training in cryptography at GC&amp;CS, and was in a BP SLU (Special Liaison Unit) in Singapore and possibly Java (for Wavell). He was sent to Hong Kong in early 1939, and in 1939-40 (as a Captain, then Major) was attached to the [[FECB]] in Hong Kong, where he objected to being under Admiralty control. He had little time for war-commissioned officers, referring to one who had been in business before the war as a "Bombay carpet-bagger".{{sfn|Elphick|1998|pp=75,174,175}}

== Maurice Allen == 
Maurice Allen was an Oxford Don who with Wilfrid Noyce broke the Water Transport Code in spring 1943 at the WEC, the first high-level Japanese Army code broken (at the WEC and also at [[Central Bureau]] in Melbourne).{{sfn|Elphick|1998|pp=396,397}}

[[File:WorldBrain.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]])]] 
'''''World Brain''''' is a collection of essays and addresses by the English science fiction pioneer, [[social reform]]er, evolutionary biologist and historian [[H. G. Wells]], dating from the period of 1936–1938.&lt;ref name=WB38&gt;Wells, H.G. (1938). ''World Brain''. London: Methuen &amp; Co., Ltd.; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., Inc. [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/wells/hg/world_brain Ebook: World Brain]&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, Wells describes his vision of the World Brain: a new, free, synthetic, authoritative, permanent "World Encyclopaedia" that could help [[world citizen]]s make the best use of universal information resources and make the best contribution to world peace.

== Background ==
{{See also|Encyclopedism}}
Plans for creating a global knowledge network long predate Wells. [[Andrew Michael Ramsay]] described, c. 1737, an objective of [[freemasonry]] as follows:&lt;ref name=Heylighen&gt;Francis Heylighen, "[http://www.sociostudies.org/almanac/articles/conceptions_of_a_global_brain_an_historical_review/ Conceptions of a Global Brain: An Historical Review]", in ''[https://publications.hse.ru/en/books/135069644 Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social]'', ed. H. Barry et al.; Volgograd: Uchitel, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... to furnish the materials for a Universal Dictionary ... By this means the lights of all nations will be united in one single work, which will be a universal library of all that is beautiful, great, luminous, solid, and useful in all the sciences and in all noble arts. This work will augment in each century, according to the increase of knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Encyclopédistes|Encyclopedist]] movement in France in the mid eighteenth century was a major attempt to actualize this philosophy. However, efforts to encompass all knowledge came to seem less possible as the available corpus expanded exponentially.&lt;ref name=Heylighen /&gt;

[[Paul Otlet]], a contemporary of Wells and [[information science]] pioneer, revived this movement in the twentieth century. Otlet wrote in 1935, "Man would no longer need documentation if he were assimilated into a being that has become omniscient, in the manner of God himself." Otlet, like Wells, supported the internationalist efforts of the [[League of Nations]] and its [[International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation]].&lt;ref name=Heylighen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reagle&gt;{{cite book |last=Reagle |first=Joseph Michael |authorlink=Joseph M. Reagle Jr. |date=2010 |title=Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of Wikipedia |series=History and Foundations of Information Science |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=9780262014472 |oclc=496282188 |url=http://reagle.org/joseph/2010/gfc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–24}}

For his part, Wells had advocated [[world government]] for at least a decade, arguing in such books as ''[[The Open Conspiracy]]'' for control of education by a scientific elite.&lt;ref name=Reagle /&gt;{{rp|24}}

==Synopsis==
In the wake of the first World War, Wells believed that people needed to become more educated and conversant with events and knowledge that surrounded them. In order to do this he offered the idea of the knowledge system of the World Brain that all humans could access.&lt;ref name=Rayward&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rayward |first=W. Boyd |authorlink=W. Boyd Rayward |date=January 1999 |title=H.G.

=== World Encyclopedia ===
This section, Wells's first expression of his dream of a World Brain, was delivered as a lecture at the [[W:Royal Institution|Royal Institution of Great Britain]], Weekly Evening Meeting, Friday, 20 November 1936.

Wells begins the lecture with a statement on his preference for cohesive worldviews rather than isolated facts. Correspondingly, he wishes the world to be such a whole "as coherent and consistent as possible". He mentions ''[[The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind]]'' (1931), one of his own attempts at providing intellectual synthesis, and calls it disappointingly unmatched.

He expresses dismay at the ignorance of social science among the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and [[League of Nations]] framers. He mentions some recent works on the role of science in society and states his main problem as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We want the intellectual worker to become a more definitely organised factor in the human scheme. How is that factor to be organised? Is there any way of implementing knowledge for ready and universal effect?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In answer he introduces the doctrine of New Encyclopaedism as a framework for integrating intellectuals into an organic whole. For the ordinary man, who will necessarily be an educated citizen in the modern state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From his point of view the World Encyclopaedia would be a row of volumes in his own home or in some neighbouring house or in a convenient public library or in any school or college, and in this row of volumes he would, without any great toil or difficulty, find in clear understandable language, and kept up to date, the ruling concepts of our social order, the outlines and main particulars in all fields of knowledge, an exact and reasonably detailed picture of our universe, a general history of the world, and if by any chance he wanted to pursue a question into its ultimate detail, a trustworthy and complete system of reference to primary sources of knowledge. In fields where wide varieties of method and opinion existed, he would find, not casual summaries of opinions, but very carefully chosen and correlated statements and arguments. [...] This World Encyclopaedia would be the mental background of every intelligent man in the world. It would be alive and growing and changing continually under revision, extension and replacement from the original thinkers in the world everywhere. Every university and research institution should be feeding it. Every fresh mind should be brought into contact with its standing editorial organisation. And on the other hand its contents would be the standard source of material for the instructional side of school and college work, for the verification of facts and the testing of statements—everywhere in the world. Even journalists would deign to use it; even newspaper proprietors might be made to respect it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such an encyclopedia would be akin to a secular bible. Universal acceptance would be possible due to the underlying similarity of human brains. For specialists and intellectuals, the World Encyclopedia will provide valuable coordination with other intellectuals working in similar areas.

Wells calls for the formation of an Encyclopaedia Society to promote the project and defend it from exploitation (e.g. by an "enterprising publisher" trying to profit from it). This society would also organize departments for production. Of course, the existence of a society has its own risks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And there will be a constant danger that some of the early promoters may feel and attempt to realise a sort of proprietorship in the organisation, to make a group or a gang of it. But to recognise that danger is half-way to averting it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The language of the World Encyclopedia would be English because of its greater range, precision, and subtlety.

Intellectual workers across the world would be increasingly bound together through their participation.

Wells wishes that wise world citizens would ensure world peace. He suggests that a world intellectual project will have more positive impact to this end than will any political movement such as communism, fascism, imperialism, pacifism, etc.

He was a [[communalism|communalist]] and [[contextualism|contextualist]] and ended his lecture as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hat I am saying ... is this, that without a World Encyclopaedia to hold men's minds together in something like a common interpretation of reality, there is no hope whatever of anything but an accidental and transitory alleviation of any of our world troubles.&lt;ref name=WB38/&gt;{{rp|34–35}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Brain Organization of the Modern World ===
This section was first delivered as a lecture in America, October and November 1937.

This lecture promotes the doctrine New Encyclopedism described previously. Wells begins with the observation that the world has become a single interconnected community due to the [[History of telecommunication|enormously increased speed of telecommunications]]. Secondly, he says that [[energy]] is available on a new scale, enabling, among other things, the capability for mass destruction. Consequently, the establishment of a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]] is imperative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One needs an exceptional stupidity even to question the urgency we are under to establish some effective World Pax, before gathering disaster overwhelms us. The problem of reshaping human affairs on a world-scale, this World problem, is drawing together an ever-increasing multitude of minds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neither Christianity nor socialism can solve the World Problem. The solution is a modernized "World Knowledge Apparatus"—the World Encyclopedia—"a sort of mental clearing house for the mind, a depot where knowledge and ideas are received, sorted, summarized, digested, clarified and compared".&lt;ref name=WB38/&gt;{{rp|49}} Wells thought that technological advances such as [[microfilm]] could be used towards this end so that "any student, in any part of the world, will be able to sit with his projector in his own study at his or her convenience to examine ''any'' book, ''any'' document, in an exact replica".&lt;ref name=WB38/&gt;{{rp|54}}

In this lecture Wells develops the analogy of the encyclopedia to a brain, saying, "it would be a clearing house for universities and research institutions; it would play the role of a cerebral cortex to these essential ganglia".

He mentions the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]], an advisory branch of the [[League of Nations]], and the 1937 [[World Congress of Universal Documentation]] as contemporary forerunners of the world brain.

=== A Permanent World Encyclopedia ===
This section was first published in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', April 1937, and contributed to the new ''[[Encyclopédie française]]'', August 1937.

In this essay, Wells explains how current encyclopaedias have failed to adapt to both the growing increase in recorded knowledge and the expansion of people requiring information that was accurate and readily accessible. He asserts that these 19th-century encyclopaedias continue to follow the 18th-century pattern, organisation and scale. "Our contemporary encyclopedias are still in the coach-and-horse phase of development," he argued, "rather than in the phase of the automobile and the aeroplane."&lt;ref name=WB38/&gt;{{rp|58}}

Wells saw the potential for world-altering impacts this technology could bring. He felt that the creation of the encyclopaedia could bring about the peaceful days of the past, "with a common understanding and the conception of a common purpose, and of a commonwealth such as now we hardly dream of".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sherlock.berkeley.edu/wells/world_brain.html "The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia"]. Contribution by H. G. Wells to the new ''Encyclopédie Française'', August 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells anticipated the effect and contribution that his World Brain would have on the [[university]] system as well.&lt;ref name=Rayward/&gt;{{rp|561}} He wanted to see universities contributing to it, helping it grow, and feeding its search for holistic information. "Every university and research institution should be feeding it" (p.&amp;nbsp;14). Elsewhere Wells wrote: "It would become the logical nucleus of the world's research universities and post-graduate studies."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H.G. (1931a) ''[[The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind]]'', New York: Greenwood. p.&amp;nbsp;796&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the organization he was proposing "would outgrow in scale and influence alike any single university that exists, and it would inevitably take the place of the loose-knit university system of the world in the concentration of research and thought and the direction of the general education of mankind".&lt;ref name=WB38/&gt;{{rp|95}} In fact the new encyclopedism he was advocating was "the only possible method I can imagine, of bringing the universities and research institutions around the world into effective cooperation and creating an intellectual authority sufficient to control and direct collective life".&lt;ref name=WB38/&gt;{{rp|48}} Ultimately the World Encyclopaedia would be "a permanent institution, a mighty super-university, holding together, utilizing and dominating all of the teaching and research organizations at present in existence".&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H.G. (1942a) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.159480 ''Science and the World Mind''], London: New Europe Publishing Co. p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speech to the Congrés Mondial De La Documentation Universelle ===
This section provides a brief excerpt of Wells's speech at the [[World Congress of Universal Documentation]], 20 August 1937. He tells the participants directly that they are participating in the creation of a world brain. He says:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I am speaking of a process of mental organisation throughout the world which I believe to be as inevitable as anything can be in human affairs. The world has to pull its mind together, and this is the beginning of its effort. The world is a Phoenix. It perishes in flames and even as it dies it is born again. This synthesis of knowledge is the necessary beginning to the new world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Informative Content of Education ===
This section was delivered as the Presidential Address to the Educational Science Section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], 2 September 1937.

Wells expresses his dismay at the general state of public ignorance, even among the educated, and suggest that the Educational Science Section focus on the bigger picture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For this year I suggest we give the questions of drill, skills, art, music, the teaching of languages, mathematics and other symbols, physical, aesthetic, moral and religious training and development, a rest, and that we concentrate on the inquiry: What are we telling young people directly about the world in which they are to live?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He asks how the "irreducible minimum of knowledge" can be imparted to all people within ten years of education—realistically, he says, amounting to 2400 hours of classroom instruction. He suggests minimizing the teaching of names and dates in British history and focusing instead on newly available information about [[prehistory]], early [[civilisation]] (without the traditionally heavy emphasis on [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Israelites]]), and the broad contours of [[world history]]. He suggests better education in [[geography]], with an inventory of the world's [[natural resources]], and a better curriculum in [[money]] and [[economics]]. He calls for a "modernised type of teacher", better paid, with better equipment, and continually updated [[teacher education|training]].

== Influence ==

===1930s: World Congress of Universal Documentation===
{{Main|World Congress of Universal Documentation}}
One of the stated goals of this Congress, held in Paris, France, in 1937, was to discuss ideas and methods for implementing Wells's ideas of the World Brain. Wells himself gave a lecture at the Congress.&lt;ref name=doccong&gt;{{cite journal|title=Documentation Congress Step toward Making 'World Brain{{'-}}|journal=The Science News-Letter|date=9 October 1937|volume=32|issue=861|pages=228–9| jstor=3913334|doi=10.2307/3913334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reginald Arthur Smith]] extended Wells's ideas in the book ''A Living Encyclopædia: A Contribution to Mr. Wells's New Encyclopædism'' (London: Andrew Dakers Ltd., 1941).

=== 1960s: The World Brain as a supercomputer ===

==== From World Library to World Brain ====
In his 1962 book ''Profiles of the Future'', [[Arthur C. Clarke]] predicted that the construction of what H. G. Wells called the World Brain would take place in two stages. He identified the first stage as the construction of the ''World Library'', which is basically Wells's concept of a universal encyclopaedia accessible to everyone from their home on [[computer terminal]]s. He predicted this phase would be established (at least in the [[developed countries]]) by the year 2000. The second stage, the ''World Brain'', would be a [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]] [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[supercomputer]] that humans would be able to mutually interact with to solve various world problems. The "World Library" would be incorporated into the "World Brain" as a subsection of it. He suggested that this supercomputer should be installed in the former [[war room]]s of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] once the superpowers had matured enough to agree to co-operate rather than conflict with each other. Clarke predicted the construction of the "World Brain" would be completed by the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Arthur C.]] ''Profiles of the Future; an Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2010}}

In 1964, [[Eugene Garfield]] published an article in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' introducing the [[Science Citation Index]]; the article's first sentence invoked Wells's "magnificent, if premature, plea for the establishment of a world information center", and Garfield predicted that the Science Citation Index "is a harbinger of things to come—a forerunner of the World Brain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |authorlink=Eugene Garfield |date=May 1964 |title=Science Citation Index—a new dimension in indexing |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=144 |issue=3619 |pages=649–654 |doi=10.1126/science.144.3619.649 |jstor=1712875 |pmid=17806988 |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v7p525y1984.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World Wide Web as a World Brain ====
{{Main article|World Wide Web}}

[[Brian R. Gaines]] in his 1996 paper "Convergence to the Information Highway" saw the [[World Wide Web]] as an extension of Wells's "World Brain" that individuals can access using personal computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | first = Brian R. | last = Gaines | authorlink = Brian R. Gaines | title = Convergence to the Information Highway| booktitle = Proceedings of the WebNet Conference| pages = | publisher = | year = 1996| location = San Francisco| url = http://algo.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/bibliothek/proceedings/webnet96/Html/KGaines/Gaines.htm| doi = | id = | accessdate = 7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In papers published in 1996 and 1997 that did not cite Wells, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] envisaged the further development of the World Wide Web into a [[global brain]], i.e. an intelligent network of people and computers at the planetary level.&lt;ref name=Rayward/&gt;{{rp|558}} The difference between "global brain" and "world brain" is that the latter, as envisaged by Wells, is centrally controlled,&lt;ref name=Rayward/&gt; while the former is fully decentralised and [[self-organization|self-organizing]].

In 2001, Doug Schuler, a professor at [[Evergreen State University]], proposed a worldwide [[civic intelligence]] network as the fulfillment of Wells's world brain. As examples he cited [[Sustainable Seattle]] and the "Technology Healthy City" project in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schuler |first=Doug |date=January 2001 |title=Cultivating society's civic intelligence: patterns for a new 'World Brain' |journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=157–181 |doi=10.1080/13691180122844 |url=https://www.academia.edu/2518107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wikipedia as a World Brain====
There are a few similarities that link Wells' World Brain as a precursor to [[Wikipedia]]. Two to mention are the noncommercial aspect of both Wikipedia and the World Brain, as well as its international aspect. Wells did not want the Brain to be commercially funded, just as [[Jimmy Wales]] has decided not to have advertisements on Wikipedia, ensuring both were free from commercial bias. In addition, Wells envisioned microfilm as a universal format for which people could share information through the World Brain. His intention of using microfilm as the form for the World Brain mimics the use of the internet because he contended that the use of microfilm would abolish the distance between information and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Rayward/&gt;{{rp|564}}

A number of commentators have suggested that [[Wikipedia]] represents the World Brain as described by Wells.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stromberg, [https://www.vox.com/2015/2/23/8078973/hg-wells-wikipedia In 1937, H.G. Wells predicted Wikipedia. But he thought it'd lead to world peace], [[Vox.com]], February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reagle /&gt;{{rp|24}} [[Joseph Reagle]] has compared Wells's warning about the need to defend the World Encyclopedia from [[propaganda]] with Wikipedia's [[WP:Neutral point of view|"Neutral Point of View"]] norm:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In keeping with the universal vision, and anticipating a key Wikipedia norm, H. G. Wells was concerned that his ''World Brain'' be an "encyclopedia appealing to all mankind," and therefore it must remain open to corrective criticism, be skeptical of myths (no matter how "venerated") and guard against "narrowing propaganda." This strikes me as similar to the pluralism inherent in the Wikipedia "Neutral Point of View" goal of "representing significant views fairly, proportionately, and without bias."&lt;ref name=Reagle /&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
