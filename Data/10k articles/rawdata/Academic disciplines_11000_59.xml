==Utility==
It is used to stain basal [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in [[prostate|prostatic glands]]; loss of basal cells is seen in prostate adenocarcinoma (the most common form of [[prostate cancer]]).

It can be used to differentiate ''[[in situ]]'' cancers of the breast; [[lobular carcinoma in situ]] (LCIS) exhibits peri[[nucleus (cell)|nuclear]] staining with 34βE12. [[Ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) does not stain for 34βE12.&lt;ref name=yeh/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16892">In [[psychology]], an '''affectional bond''' is a type of attachment behavior one individual has for another individual,&lt;ref name="Bowlby 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowlby, J. |title=The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds |publisher=Routledge Classics |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-35481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically a caregiver for her or his child,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/pendry.html&lt;/ref&gt; in which the two partners tend to remain in proximity to one another.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 2005"/&gt; The term was coined and subsequently developed over the course of four decades, from the early 1940s to the late 1970s, by psychologist [[John Bowlby]] in his work on [[attachment theory]]. The core of the term ''affectional bond'', according to Bowlby, is the attraction one individual has for another individual. The central features of the concept of affectional bonding can be traced to Bowlby's 1958 paper, "The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother".&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1958). "The Nature of the Childs Tie to his Mother." ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' 39: 350–373.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five criteria==
Bowlby referred to attachment bonds as a specific type of "affectional" bond, as described by him and developmental psychologist [[Mary Ainsworth]]. She established five criteria for affectional bonds between individuals, and a sixth criterion for attachment bonds:
* An affectional bond is persistent, not transitory.
* An affectional bond involves a particular person who is not interchangeable with anyone else.
* An affectional bond involves a relationship that is emotionally significant.
* The individual wishes to maintain proximity or contact with the person with whom he or she has an affectional tie.
* The individual feels sadness or distress at involuntary separation from the person.

An attachment bond has an additional criterion: the person seeks security and comfort in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M.D.S. (1989). Attachments beyond infancy. ''American Psychologist'', 44, 709716. Reference for the entire section "Five criteria"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attachment theory==

===Background===

Bowlby believed that there were four distinguishing characteristics of attachment. These included:

*Proximity Maintenance: The desire to be near the people we are attached to.
*Safe Haven: Returning to the attachment figure for comfort and safety in the face of fear or threat.
*Secure Base: The attachment figure acts as a base of security from which the child can explore the surrounding environment.
*Separation Distress: Anxiety that occurs in the absence of the attachment figure.

Bowlby's thoughts on distinguishing attachment led the way for many other psychologists' viewpoints on attachment and the various bonds that attachment coincides with.&lt;ref name = "Bowlby, J."&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A Secure Base. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment through the lifespan==

===Attachment style===
Child psychologist Mary Ainsworth further expanded on Bowlby's research by conducting an experiment that is known as the "Strange Situation" experiment. In the experiment, a parent and child are alone in the room. A stranger then walks into the room and talks to the parent. After some amount of time, the parent quietly exits the room, leaving the stranger and child in the room. The child then reacts to the situation at hand and then the parent re-enters the room and comforts the child. From this groundbreaking study, Ainsworth developed different forms of attachment styles that infants display with the people they are close to.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth"&gt;Ainsworth, M.; Blehar, M.; Waters, E.; and Wall, S. (1978). Patterns of Attachment. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secure attachment====
[[Secure attachment]] in infancy was characterized by noticeable distress when the parent left the room. When the parent returned, the child was extremely happy to see them. Infants are more likely to choose a parent over any other person, especially a stranger. As they embark on childhood, those who maintain secure attachment have an easier time making friends and meeting new people and hold a trustworthy bond with their parents.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt; Adolescents benefit from parental support, but they are also beginning to make the transitions from relying heavily on their parents to a more independent environment with more freedom.&lt;ref name = "Doyle, Moretti, Voss &amp; Margolese"&gt;Doyle, A. B., Moretti, M. M., Voss, K., &amp; Margolese, S. (2006, February). Attachment to parents and adjustment in adolescents: Literature review and policy implications. Retrieved from http://www.cyc-net.org/cyc-online/cycol-0206-attachment.html&lt;/ref&gt; In adulthood, they are more likely to have long-lasting relationships, high self-esteem, find pleasure from romantic relationships and are able to easily talk with their partners.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt;

====Ambivalent-insecure attachment====
'''Ambivalent attachment''' is characterized by a strong wariness towards strangers. Children get extremely uncomfortable when they do not have a noticeable face in the room. When the parent returns, the child receives no comfort from their return and is inconsolable.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt; In childhood, these children tend to act "clingy" towards their parents and tend to heavily rely on others. In adulthood, they have difficulty with trust and feel that their partner does not exhibit the same feelings towards them. Insecurely attached adults tend to act cold and experience many break-ups throughout their life.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"/&gt;

====Avoidant-insecure attachment====
Infants and children with '''avoidant attachment''' tend to show no preference between their caregivers and the stranger. They do not actively seek much comfort of contact from their parents and usually tend to avoid them. In adulthood, those with avoidant attachment have difficulty maintaining relationships due to the inability to display emotions. They are more likely to engage in casual sex and think about other people or things while they are having sex. Finally, they are not likely to be supportive when other people are in stressful situations and have an inability to look at ideas in another person's perspective.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"/&gt;

====Disorganized-insecure attachment====

'''Disorganized Attachment''' in infants tends to display avoidant and unsure behavior. They tend to be in a daze and seem confused about the situation that they are in. They tend not show any clear signs of attachment at any point in their lives.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt;

This fourth form of attachment was observed in later studies conducted by Main and Solomon.&lt;ref name = "Main &amp; Solomon"&gt;Main, M., &amp; Solomon, J. (1986). Discovery of an insecure-disorganized/ disoriented attachment pattern: Procedures, findings and implications for the classification of behavior. In T. B. Brazelton &amp; M. Yogman (Eds.), Affective Development in Infancy, 95-124. Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have supported Ainsworth's observations. These studies have also shown that attachment styles developed in infancy can influence behavior later in life. Children in this group tend to take on a parental role and act like a caregiver toward their parent. They display an overall inconsistent form of behavior. Research by Main and Hesse showed that parents who use tactics of fear and assurance contribute to this disorganized form of attachment.&lt;ref name = "Main &amp; Hesse"&gt;Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E. (1990). Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infant disorganized attachment status: Is frightened/frightening parental behavior the linking mechanism? In M. T. Greenberg, D. Cicchetti, &amp; E. M. Cummings (Eds.), Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention, 161-182. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal corrected partnership===

According to Bowlby's ideas of attachment, '''goal-corrected partnership''' is the last stage that a child experiences. It usually happens around age three. As the child begins spending more time with their caregiver, they begin to realize that their caregiver has goals and ideas of their own that may not concern the child.&lt;ref name = "Benson"&gt;Benson, J. B. (2009). Social and emotional development in infancy and early childhood. (1 ed., Vol. 1, p. 34). San Diego, CA: Academic Press. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VUvdHreepDYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq Social and Emotional Development in Infancy and Early Childhood&amp;ots=Ox_xcFAxi9&amp;sig=UZW8V21UjzOOCsExAThrRCY_CHk&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the child begins to "mold their behavior in order to please or impress the caregiver". This type of bond is most likely to occur between the infant and the mother.

==Caregivers==

[[Caregivers]] play an important role in children's lives for several reasons. It is important for the child to have an affectional bond with the person who is caring for that child. According to Bowlby, caregivers can be anyone who is caring for the child but is usually the mother or father of that child. Children place a high value on their relationship with their parents and will alter their behavior to meet the desired behavior from their parents. Bowlby explains by the time the child has reached twelve months of age the child has developed a strong relationship with his mother.  Freud who is cited in Bowlby's article "The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother" says that a child's first love is a satisfaction of the need for food and an object for food, so either the mother's breast or bottle of milk.&lt;ref name = "Bowlby"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1958). "The Nature of the Childs Tie to his Mother." International Journal of Psychoanalysis 39: 350–373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby has four theories that explain how the attachment and bond are created between a child and his or her caregiver.

*Secondary drive: When the physiological needs of the child are met, for example when the child needs are met by the mother feeding or keeping her child warm.
*Primary object sucking: Infants have an innate quality that needs to be filled by sucking on the mother's breast which he realized is connected to his mother, therefore creating a stronger bond.
*Primary object clinging: Besides food as a primary need, the feel or touch of another human is also a primary need for infants so they cling to their parents to meet this need.
*Primary return-to-womb craving: Infants crave to go back inside their mother's womb.

==Other affectional bonds through the lifespan==

===Mother to infant===
The bond between mothers and infants has been determined to be the core bond during the lifespan for mothers and children.  At birth, mothers go through a postpartum period where they feel detached from their infant and need to create a new bond different from the one that was created during the prenatal period.  The bond between mother and infant is just as important to the mother as it is to the infant.  This bond can be formed after the once believed critical period of postpartum skin contact.  This first emotional bond is the basis of all future relationships and bonds in the child's future.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"&gt;
https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=0BBIVLW5HKUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=affectional+bond&amp;ots=XVKDgT4Lxb&amp;sig=WAuJ7vWXdX_qQ7h2FmQA2WPpItc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Father to child===
The bond between father and child has been found to be more important than previously believed, however it has not been found to be as important as the bond between mother and child.  Children do bond with fathers as a caregiver but the level of the strength of the bond is dependent upon the level of involvement by the father.  However, there is not sufficient research on the subject to draw any other conclusions on the bond and on father's involvement.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

===Sexual partnership===
The bond between sexual partners is characterized with three components which are reproductive, attachment and caregiver, and they may be more prevalent in certain relationships than in others.  In some sexual partnerships there is only a reproductive component, with no emotional attachment.  When an attachment is formed on top of the reproductive bond, the male is likely to take on a caregiver role with offspring as well as his mate; which in western culture is usually his wife.  In western culture the pair often exchanges levels of care, and attachment throughout the lifespan.  In traditional married couples the level of sexual attachment changes throughout the lifespan of the relationship thus stating that there are other important aspects of the bond between man and wife.  Couples share an emotional and intellectual bond on top of the sexual one.  In western society traditional gender roles are being challenged which is impacting the level of male caregiver attachment to his wife; however there is not a large field of research on the subject.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

Homosexual couples are hypothesized to share much of the same attachment components; however there is little research on the subject to draw conclusions from.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

===Friends, companions, intimates===
The bond formed between friends, companions and intimates are essential bonds to the lifetime.  These bonds are essential for social development because they differ from the bonds formed with parents and other kin.  Humans are naturally social creatures thus forming bonds with other people comes naturally.  These relationships are often formed through common interests, and proximity.  Friendships begin in early childhood, and last throughout adulthood.  Many different friendships are formed throughout the lifespan and they can be any length of time.  Again, these bonds tend to not be as strong as those formed with other kin, but the social aspects of them are essential to development.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com" /&gt;

===Siblings and other kin===
The bond between siblings and other kin is largely dependent upon the age of the kin, and the level of involvement with the child.  Older siblings can take on more of a parental role with younger siblings thus creating more of a parental bond.  This parental bond is found when a parent dies, or when the level of parental involvement is low, however this area of research is still fairly new.  Siblings that are close in age often have more of a friendship bond.  Siblings can also have a different type of bond that is not seen in other relationships because siblings have a close bond but may have more indecisive feelings towards each other.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

The bond between other kin is largely dependent on the society that the child grows up in.  In more collectivist cultures the bond between kin is stronger than in the individualistic ones.  The level of bond between kin is often because of shared values, culture, background, and personal experiences.  There is little research on this subject thus the level of information is still low.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

==Harlow's attachment in non-human animals==
Attachment is not something that is only limited to humans, it is seen in non-human animals as well. A classic study demonstrating attachment in animals was done by Harry Harlow with his macaque monkeys. His study suggests that an infant not only feels attachment to his/her mother because of needs for nutrients and protection, but they feel attachment to their mother for needs of comfort as well.&lt;ref name = "Harlow"&gt;Harlow, H. F. (1958). The nature of love. American Psychologist, 13, 673-685.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Harry Harlow's experiment he separated infant monkeys from their mothers 6–12 hours after birth and raised them in a laboratory, isolated from humans and other monkeys. In each cage these infant monkeys had two "mothers." One mother was made solely from wire, and the other mother was made from a block of wood and sponge rubber which was then wrapped with terry cloth; both radiated heat. In one condition only the wire mother nursed, and in the other condition only the terry cloth mother nursed.&lt;ref name = "Harlow"/&gt;

The results show that infant monkeys spent significantly more time with the terry cloth mother whether she provided nutrients or not.&lt;ref name="Harlow"/&gt; This demonstrates that infants not only need their mothers to provide food and protection, but they need to provide some sort of comfort as well.

[[File:Litoria xanthomera amplexus.jpg|thumb|[[Orange-thighed frog]]s (''[[Litoria xanthomera]]'') in amplexus]]
'''Amplexus''' (Latin "embrace") is a type of mating behavior exhibited by some [[External fertilization|externally fertilizing]] species (chiefly [[amphibian]]s and [[horseshoe crabs]]) in which a male grasps a female with his front legs as part of the mating process, and at the same time or with some time delay, he [[fertilize]]s the eggs as they are released from the female's body. In amphibians, females may be grasped by the head, waist, or armpits, and the type of amplexus is characteristic of some taxonomic groups. Amplexus involves direct contact between male and female, distinguished from other forms of external fertilization such as [[broadcast spawning]], where sperm and eggs are freely shed into water without direct contact by individuals. 

==Amphibians==
[[File:Amplexus Bufo bufo 2010-03-29.jpg|thumb|European [[common  toad]] (''[[Bufo bufo]]'').]]
[[File:Common toad Bufo bufo multiple amplexus mating ball.jpg|thumb|[[Common toad]] mating ball (multiple amplexus).]]
[[File:Red-eyed tree frogs mating.JPG|thumb|[[Red-eyed tree frog]] (''[[Agalychnis callidryas]]''), [[Costa Rica]]]]
===Anurans===
Amplexus chiefly occurs aquatically, but some more terrestrial [[Frog|anurans]] (frogs and toads) like the [[disc-tongued frog]]s ([[Discoglossidae]]) perform amplexus on land. In crown-group anurans like the true frogs ([[Ranidae]]), the [[tree frog]]s (Hylidae), and the true toads ([[Bufonidae]]), amplexus is axillary (in the armpits). Other anurans (the [[Archaeobatrachia]], [[Sooglossidae]] and [[Myobatrachidae]]), show the ancestral state which is inguinal or lumbar amplexus (abdominal, in front of the hindlegs). Some species show cephalic amplexus where the head of the female is held while others show complete lack of amplexus.&lt;ref name=Duellman&amp;Trueb/&gt;

In most anurans, the males deposit sperm onto the eggs as they are being laid, however males of the genus ''[[Ascaphus]]'' possess an [[intromittent organ]], unique among anurans, for internal fertilization.  Internal fertilization does occur in a few other genera, including ''[[Nectophrynoides]]'', ''[[Mertensophryne]]'', and ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]''.&lt;ref name=Duellman&amp;Trueb&gt;Duellman, W. E. and L. Trueb. 1986. Biology of Amphibians. New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linzey, D. 2001. Vertebrate Biology, McGraw Hill Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newts===
In the case of [[newt]]s the process of amplexus is often observed soon after the newts become seasonally active. In the western USA, for example, this time is typically soon after the onset of the winter rainy season, when [[intermittent stream]]s and [[vernal pools]] become available as breeding habitat.  The [[rough-skinned newt]] is a specific widespread example of a newt in the western USA that can be observed in quiet stream pools and shallow ponds engaging in amplexus.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) ''[http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=43182 Rough-skinned Newt (Taricha granulosa)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527153302/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=43182 |date=2009-05-27 }}'', Globaltwitcher, ed. N. Stromberg  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Horseshoe crabs==
[[File:Limulus polyphemus1.jpg|thumb|right|Amplectant pair of ''[[Limulus polyphemus]]''. The male is the smaller individual.]]
Amplexus occurs in all  four species of [[horseshoe crab]].

An '''anal piercing''' is a [[body piercing]] in the surrounding area of the [[human anus]], usually the [[perineum]].&lt;ref name="Angel2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elayne Angel|title=The Piercing Bible: The Definitive Guide to Safe Body Piercing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83sjmTPnz48C&amp;pg=PA25|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|isbn=978-0-307-77791-1|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, piercing of the anal sphincter itself is rather rare. Some report difficulty cleaning the area after defecation and increases chances of infection.&lt;ref name="Angel2011"/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] the minimum age for an anal piercing is 16 enacted in the Sexual Offense Act of 2003.&lt;ref name="Allen2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Allen|title=Age Restricted Sales: The Law in England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GBDCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178|date=28 October 2015|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-78462-419-4|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, anal piercings have been used as a form of humiliation.&lt;ref name="Stoichita2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor I.

'''Architectural analytics''' is the field of study that focuses on the discovery and identification of meaningful patterns in [[architecture]].

Architecture represents a snapshot in time and can, in a very detailed fashion, animate the [[civilisation]] and people that created it. Architectural analytics can allow a large amount of information about a monument, settlement or civilisation to be discerned. This ability to inform and present previously unknown facts makes architectural analytics important in piecing together the larger understanding of civilisations and the human story.

An '''automated teller machine''' ('''ATM''') is an electronic telecommunications device that enables customers of [[financial institution]]s to perform [[financial transaction]]s, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, transfer funds, or obtaining account information, at any time and without the need for direct interaction with bank staff.

ATMs are known by a variety of names, including '''automatic teller machine''' in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Automatic teller machine|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield, MA|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/automatic%20teller%20machine|accessdate=7 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812213416/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/automatic%20teller%20machine|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/FNSRTS307A|title=training.gov.au - FNSRTS307A - Maintain Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) services|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070931/https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/FNSRTS307A|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/automatic-teller-machine Cambridge Dictionary ''Automatic Teller Machine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407090534/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/automatic-teller-machine |date=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''ATM''', [[American English|American]], [[British English|British]], [[Australian English|Australian]], [[Malaysian English|Malaysian]], [[South African English|South African]], [[Singaporean English|Singaporean]], [[Indian English|Indian]], [[Maldivian English|Maldivian]], [[Hiberno-English|Hiberno]], [[Philippine English|Philippines]] and [[Sri Lankan English]]), often [[RAS syndrome|redundantly]] '''ATM machine''', '''automated banking machine''' ('''ABM''', [[Canadian English]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interac.ca/en/faq/faq/136-what-is-interac-cash-2.html|title=Interac FAQ|publisher=Interac Association|access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/0,,316,00.html Automatic Bank Machine definition from a Canadian bank, ''Scotiabank''.]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Many ATMs have a sign above them, &lt;!-- easily verified by internet search and looking at an actual ATM--&gt; indicating the name of the bank or organisation that owns the ATM, and possibly including the networks to which it can connect. In Canada, ABMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as [[White-label ABMs in Canada|"white-label ABMs"]].

On most modern ATMs, customers are identified by inserting a plastic [[ATM card]] (or some other acceptable payment card) into the ATM, with authentication being by the customer entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN), which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped), or in the issuing financial institution's database.

Using an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions such as [[cash]] withdrawals, check balances, or credit mobile phones. ATMs can be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated, the money will be converted at the financial institution's [[exchange rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schlichter |first=Sarah |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16994358/ |title=Using ATM's abroad - Travel - Travel Tips - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-02-05 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was operational in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;'Fast Machine With a Buck',"Pacific Star and Stripes", 7 July 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Instant Cash with a Credit Card', "ABA Banking Journal", January 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian Ashfield invented the basic idea of a card combining the key and user's identity in February 1962. This was granted UK Patent 959,713 for "Access Controller" in June 1964 and assigned to W. S. Atkins &amp; Partners who employed Ashfield. He was paid ten shillings for this, the standard sum for all patents. It was originally intended to dispense petrol but the patent covered all uses.

In the US patent record, [[Luther George Simjian]] has been credited with developing a "prior art device". Specifically his 132nd patent (US3079603), which was first filed on 30 June 1960 (and granted 26 February 1963). The roll-out of this machine, called Bankograph, was delayed by a couple of years, due in part to Simjian's Reflectone Electronics Inc. being acquired by Universal Match Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;"Universal Match Maps Acquisition", ''The New York Times'', 22 March 1961&lt;/ref&gt; An experimental Bankograph was installed in [[New York City]] in 1961 by the [[Citibank|City Bank of New York]], but removed after six months due to the lack of customer acceptance. The Bankograph was an automated envelope deposit machine (accepting coins, cash and cheques) and did not have cash dispensing features.&lt;ref&gt;"Machine Accepts Bank Deposits", ''The New York Times'', 12 April 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article/217157/From-punchcard-to-prestaging-50-years-of-ATM-innovation |title=From punchcard to prestaging: 50 years of ATM innovation |publisher=ATM Marketplace |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815222832/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article/217157/From-punchcard-to-prestaging-50-years-of-ATM-innovation |archivedate=15 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patent for this device (GB1329964) was filed in September 1969 (and granted in 1973) by John David Edwards, Leonard Perkins, John Henry Donald, Peter Lee Chappell, Sean Benjamin Newcombe, and Malcom David Roe.

Both the DACS and MD2 accepted only a single-use token or voucher which was retained by the machine, while the Speytec worked with a card with a magnetic stripe at the back. They used principles including [[radiation|Carbon-14]] and low-coercivity [[magnetism]] in order to make fraud more difficult.

The idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a group of engineers working at [[Smiths Group]] on the Chubb MD2 in 1965 and which has been credited to [[James Goodfellow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013n554|title=James Goodfellow, Series 2, Pioneers - BBC Radio 4 Extra|author=|date=|website=BBC|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system was that it enabled the verification of the customer with the debited account without human intervention. This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete "currency dispenser system" in the patent record. This patent was filed on 5 March 1968 in the US (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash dispenser market such as [[NCR Corporation]] and [[IBM]] licence Goodfellow's PIN system, but a number of later patents reference this patent as "Prior Art Device".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/9461.html | title = Evidence from the patent record on the development of cash dispensing technology | author = B.

=== Propagation ===
Devices designed by British (i.e. Chubb, De La Rue) and Swedish (i.e. Asea Meteor) quickly spread out. For example, given its link with [[Barclays]],  [[Bank of Scotland]] deployed a DACS in 1968 under the  [http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/our-group/our-heritage/timeline/1951-1990/ 'Scotcash'] brand. Customers were given personal code numbers to activate the machines, similar to the modern PIN. They were also supplied with £10 vouchers. These were fed into the machine, and the corresponding amount debited from the customer's account.

A Chubb-made ATM appeared in [[Sydney]] in 1969. This was the first ATM installed in [[Australia]]. The machine only dispensed $25 at a time and the bank card itself would be mailed to the user after the bank had processed the withdrawal.

Asea Metior's Bankomat was the first ATM installed in [[Spain]] on January 9, 1969, in downtown [[Madrid]] by [[Banesto]]. This device dispensed 1,000 [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] bills (1 to 5 max). Each user had to introduce a security personal key using a combination of the ten numeric buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/01/09/048.html | title = Bancomat (In Spanish) | author = Marino Gomez-Santos | publisher = ABC | date = 9 January 1969 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811221708/http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/01/09/048.html | archivedate = 11 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March of the same year an ad with the instructions to use the Bancomat was published in the same newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/03/18/058.html | title = Bancomat Banesto (commercial ad with instructions for use in Spanish) | publisher = ABC | date = 18 March 1969 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811221714/http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/03/18/058.html | archivedate = 11 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Docutel in the United States (1969)===
After looking firsthand at the experiences in Europe, in 1968 the ATM was pioneered in the U.S. by [[Donald Wetzel]], who was a department head at a company called Docutel.&lt;ref name="Networld Media Group"/&gt; Docutel was a subsidiary of Recognition Equipment Inc of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], which was producing optical scanning equipment and had instructed Docutel to explore automated baggage handling and automated gasoline pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Essinger  |title= ATM Networks: Their Organization, Security and Future |publisher= Elsevier International |date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 1969, [[Chemical Bank]] installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in [[Rockville Centre, New York]]. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Kirkpatrick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZMrIchANY4C&amp;pg=PA266 |title=1969: The Year Everything Changed |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |date=2009 |page=266 |isbn=9781602393660 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225211738/http://books.google.com/books?id=XZMrIchANY4C&amp;pg=PA266 |archivedate=25 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted "On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;pg=PA84 |title=Popular Mechanics - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225214202/http://books.google.com/books?id=BtEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;pg=PA84 |archivedate=25 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by [[Donald Wetzel]] and his company Docutel. Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines.  Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/wetzel.htm |title=Interview with Mr. Don Wetzel |publisher=Americanhistory.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110220214346/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/wetzel.htm| archivedate= 20 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[Smithsonian National Museum of American History]] recognised Docutel and Wetzel as the inventors of the networked ATM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thocp.net/hardware/atm.htm |title=Automatic teller machine |publisher=Thocp.net |work=The History of Computing Project |date=17 April 2006 |accessdate=2011-02-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110220215034/http://www.thocp.net/hardware/atm.htm| archivedate= 20 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, Docutel had acquired 70 percent of the U.S. market; but as a result of the early 1970s worldwide recession and its reliance on a single product line, Docutel lost its independence and was forced to merge with the U.S. subsidiary of [[Olivetti]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Wetzel was recognised by the United States Patent Office as having invented the ATM in the form of [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3761682.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3761682&amp;RS=PN/3761682 U.S. Patent # 3,761,682]; the application had been filed in October 1971 and the patent was granted in 1973. However, the U.S. patent record cites at least three previous applications from Docutel, all relevant to the development of the ATM and where Wetzel does not figure, namely [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3662343.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3662343&amp;RS=PN/3662343 US Patent # 3,662,343], [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3651976.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3651976&amp;RS=PN/3651976 U.S. Patent # 3651976] and [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=368569.PN.&amp;OS=PN/368569&amp;RS=PN/368569 U.S. Patent # 3,68,569]. These patents are all credited to Kenneth S. Goldstein, MR Karecki, TR Barnes, GR Chastian and John D. White.

===Continued improvements===
The first modern ATM was an IBM 2984 and came into use at Lloyds Bank, High Street, Brentwood, Essex, the UK in December 1972. The IBM 2984 was designed at the request of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]]. The 2984 Cash Issuing Terminal was the first true ATM, similar in function to today's machines and named by Lloyds Bank: Cashpoint. Cashpoint is still a [[registered trademark]] of Lloyds Banking Group in the UK but is often used as a [[List of generic and genericized trademarks|generic trademark]] to refer to ATMs of all UK banks. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a U.S. bank. A couple of well known historical models of ATMs include the IBM 3614, [[IBM 3624]] and [[IBM 473x|473x]] series, [[Diebold 10xx]] and [[TABS 9000]] series, [[NCR 1780]] and earlier NCR 770 series.

The first switching system to enable shared automated teller machines between banks went into production operation on February 3, 1979, in Denver, Colorado, in an effort by Colorado National Bank of Denver and Kranzley and Company of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;personal knowledge of William Patterson who was there supporting the network&lt;/ref&gt;

The newest ATM at [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] allows customers to withdraw cash up to £130 without a card by inputting a six-digit code requested through their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18409560 |title=ATMs to operate without a card |date=June 12, 2012 |work=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613035141/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18409560 |archivedate=13 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:World's Highest ATM.jpg|thumb|The world's highest ATM, located at the [[Khunjerab Pass]] in [[Pakistan]].]]
ATMs can be placed at any location but are most often placed near or inside banks, shopping centers/malls, airports, [[railway station]]s, [[metro station]]s, grocery stores, petrol/gas stations, restaurants, and other locations. ATMs are also found on [[cruise ship]]s and on some [[US Navy]] ships, where sailors can draw out their pay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fms.treas.gov/navycash/index.html Overview: Navy Cash/Marine Cash: Programs and Systems: Financial Management Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303190236/http://www.fms.treas.gov/navycash/index.html |date=3 March 2013 }}. Fms.treas.gov. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

ATMs may be on- and off-premises. On-premises ATMs are typically more advanced, multi-function machines that complement a bank branch's capabilities, and are thus more expensive. Off-premises machines are deployed by financial institutions and Independent Sales Organisations (ISOs) where there is a simple need for cash, so they are generally cheaper single function devices.

In the US, Canada and some [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Gulf countries]], banks may have [[drive-thru]] lanes providing access to ATMs using an automobile.

In recent times, countries like India and some countries in Africa are installing ATMs in rural areas, which are solar powered.&lt;ref name="nanoATM"&gt;{{cite news |title=The nano of ATMs for rural masses comes to town |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-the-nano-of-atms-for-rural-masses-comes-to-town-1358865 |first=Balanarayan |last=NT |date=14 March 2010 |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |location=Bangalore |accessdate=May 24, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525014956/http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-the-nano-of-atms-for-rural-masses-comes-to-town-1358865 |archivedate=25 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial networks ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--only last paragraph is cited--&gt;
[[File:Geldautomaat.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[logo]]s of a number of [[interbank network]]s to which it is connected are shown.]]

Most ATMs are connected to [[interbank network]]s, enabling people to withdraw and deposit money from machines not belonging to the bank where they have their accounts or in the countries where their accounts are held (enabling cash withdrawals in local currency). Some examples of interbank networks include [[NYCE]], [[Pulse (interbank network)|PULSE]], [[Plus (interbank network)|PLUS]], [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]], [[AFFN]], [[Interac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interac.ca/en/interac-cash-consumer.html|title=Interac Cash web page|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|access-date=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interswitch, [[STAR (interbank network)|STAR]], [[LINK (UK)|LINK]], [[MegaLink]], and [[BancNet]].

ATMs rely on authorization of a [[financial transaction]] by the card issuer or other authorizing institution on a communications network. This is often performed through an [[ISO 8583]] messaging system.

Many banks charge [[ATM usage fees]]. In some cases, these fees are charged solely to users who are not customers of the bank that operates the ATM; in other cases, they apply to all users.

In order to allow a more diverse range of devices to attach to their networks, some interbank networks have passed rules expanding the definition of an ATM to be a terminal that either has the vault within its footprint or utilises the vault or cash drawer within the merchant establishment, which allows for the use of a [[scrip cash dispenser]].

[[File:Diebold 1063 ATM with modem.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Diebold 1063]]ix with a dial-up modem visible at the base]]

ATMs typically connect directly to their host or [[ATMC|ATM Controller]] on either [[ADSL]] or dial-up [[modem]] over a [[telephone]] line or directly on a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) lines because they require less time to establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a POTS line rather than using a leased line, since a leased line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a POTS line. That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet [[VPN]] connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include [[Systems Network Architecture|SNA]] over [[Synchronous Data Link Control|SDLC]], [[TC500]] over [[Asynchronous communication|Async]], [[X.25]], and [[TCP/IP]] over [[Ethernet]].

In addition to methods employed for transaction security and secrecy, all communications traffic between the ATM and the Transaction Processor may also be encrypted using methods such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=794] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073750/http://www.ebcvg.com/press.php?id=794|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global use ==

There are no hard international or government-compiled numbers totaling the complete number of ATMs in use worldwide.

To simplify the analysis of ATM usage around the world, financial institutions generally divide the world into seven regions, due to the penetration rates, usage statistics, and features deployed.

== Hardware ==
[[File:Atm blockdiagram.png|thumb|upright|A block diagram of an ATM]]

An ATM is typically made up of the following devices:
* [[CPU]] (to control the user interface and transaction devices)
* [[Magnetic stripe card|Magnetic]] or [[chip card]] reader (to identify the customer)
* [[Personal identification number|PIN]] pad EEP4 (similar in layout to a [[touch tone]] or [[calculator]] keypad), manufactured as part of a secure enclosure
* [[Secure cryptoprocessor]], generally within a secure enclosure
* Display (used by the customer for performing the transaction)
* [[Function key]] buttons (usually close to the display) or a [[touchscreen]] (used to select the various aspects of the transaction)
* Record printer (to provide the customer with a record of the transaction)
* [[Bank vault|Vault]] (to store the parts of the machinery requiring restricted access)
* Housing (for aesthetics and to attach signage to)
* Sensors and indicators

Due to heavier computing demands and the falling price of [[personal computer]]–like architectures, ATMs have moved away from custom hardware architectures using [[microcontroller]]s or [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s and have adopted the hardware architecture of a personal computer, such as USB connections for peripherals, Ethernet and IP communications, and use personal computer operating systems.

Business owners often lease ATMs from service providers. However, based on the economies of scale, the price of equipment has dropped to the point where many business owners are simply paying for ATMs using a credit card.

New ADA voice and text-to-speech guidelines imposed in 2010, but required by March 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.firstdata.com/downloads/thought-leadership/atm_ada_accessibility.pdf |title=Summary of New 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ATM Standards |publisher=firstdata.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611031808/http://www.firstdata.com/downloads/thought-leadership/atm_ada_accessibility.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; have forced many ATM owners to either upgrade non-compliant machines or dispose them if they are not upgradable, and purchase new compliant equipment. This has created an avenue for hackers and thieves to obtain ATM hardware at junkyards from improperly disposed decommissioned machines.&lt;ref&gt;

The vault of an ATM is within the footprint of the device itself and is where items of value are kept. [[Scrip cash dispenser]]s do not incorporate a vault.

Mechanisms found inside the vault may include:
* Dispensing mechanism (to provide [[cash]] or other items of value)
* Deposit mechanism including a cheque processing module and bulk note acceptor (to allow the customer to make deposits)
* Security sensors (magnetic, thermal, seismic, gas)
* Locks (to ensure controlled access to the contents of the vault)
* Journaling systems; many are electronic (a sealed flash memory device based on in-house standards) or a solid-state device (an actual printer) which accrues all records of activity including access timestamps, number of notes dispensed, etc. This is considered sensitive data and is secured in similar fashion to the cash as it is a similar liability.

ATM vaults are supplied by manufacturers in several grades. Factors influencing vault grade selection include cost, weight, regulatory requirements, ATM type, operator risk avoidance practices and internal volume requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmdepot.com/help.aspx#f4 |title=ATM ATM Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Atmdepot.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019065405/http://www.atmdepot.com/help.aspx#f4 |archivedate=19 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry standard vault configurations include [[Underwriters Laboratories]] [[UL-291]] "Business Hours" and Level 1 Safes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0291.html |title=Scope for UL 291 |publisher=Ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com |date=2004-12-21 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105114749/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0291.html |archivedate=5 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RAL (standards institute)|RAL]] TL-30 derivatives,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.com/en/products/hardware/hw_atm_p75_ts_product.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122113838/http://www.ncr.com/en/products/hardware/hw_atm_p75_ts_product.htm|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CEN EN 1143-1 - CEN III and CEN IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cenorm.be/catweb/13.310.htm|title=Home |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsonline.bsi-global.com/search/item/1928003 |title=BSI: Standards, Training, Testing, Assessment &amp; Certification |publisher=Bsonline.bsi-global.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012163647/http://bsonline.bsi-global.com/search/item/1928003 |archivedate=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATM manufacturers recommend that a vault be attached to the floor to prevent theft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tritonatm.com/en/service/manuals/07100-00008F%20(9100UsrMan(5.0)).pdf |title=Triton Systems &amp;#124; ATM manufacturer |publisher=Tritonatm.com |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2011-02-11}} {{Dead link |date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there is a record of a theft conducted by tunnelling into an ATM floor.&lt;ref name=tunnel /&gt;

== Software ==
[[File:Windows XP sighted 'in the wild' on a cash point, 3 August 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Although the operating system has been off support by Microsoft for over four years as of August 2018, a significant number of cash points still use versions of [[Microsoft Windows XP|Windows XP]], as seen with this machine at a branch of [[Tesco Express]] in [[Slough]], Berkshire.]]
With the migration to commodity Personal Computer hardware, standard commercial "off-the-shelf" operating systems and programming environments can be used inside of ATMs. Typical platforms previously used in ATM development include [[RMX (operating system)|RMX]] or [[OS/2]].

[[File:Postomat-Windows-p1020441.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] ATM running [[Windows 2000]]]]

Today, the vast majority of ATMs worldwide use a [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, primarily [[Windows XP Professional]] or [[Windows XP Embedded]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}{{update inline|date=September 2015|reason=Are the machines still using such an old operating system?

There is a computer industry security view that general public desktop operating systems(os) have greater risks as operating systems for cash dispensing machines than other types of operating systems like (secure) [[real-time operating system]]s (RTOS). [[RISKS Digest]] has many articles about ATM operating system vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/php/risks/search.php?query=cash+machine|title=Risks search results for "cash machine"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linux]] is also finding some reception in the ATM marketplace. An example of this is [[Banrisul]], the largest bank in the south of [[Brazil]], which has replaced the [[MS-DOS]] operating systems in its ATMs with Linux. [[Banco do Brasil]] is also migrating ATMs to Linux. Indian-based [[Vortex Engineering]] is manufacturing ATMs which operate only with Linux.
Common application layer transaction protocols, such as [[Diebold]] 91x (911 or 912) and [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|NDC or NDC+]] provide [[Hardware emulation|emulation]] of older generations of hardware on newer platforms with incremental extensions made over time to address new capabilities, although companies like NCR continuously improve these protocols issuing newer versions (e.g. NCR's AANDC v3.x.y, where x.y are subversions). Most major ATM manufacturers provide software packages that implement these protocols. Newer protocols such as IFX have yet to find wide acceptance by transaction processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 |title=Messaging standard to give multiple channels a common language |publisher=selfserviceworld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329032543/http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=1252 |archivedate=29 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the move to a more standardised software base, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in the ability to pick and choose the application programs that drive their equipment. [[WOSA/XFS]], now known as [[CEN/XFS|CEN XFS (or simply XFS)]], provides a common [[API]] for accessing and manipulating the various devices of an ATM. [[J/XFS]] is a Java implementation of the CEN XFS API.

While the perceived benefit of XFS is similar to the Java's [[Write once run anywhere|"Write once, run anywhere"]] mantra, often different ATM hardware vendors have different interpretations of the XFS standard. The result of these differences in interpretation means that ATM applications typically use a [[middleware]] to even out the differences among various platforms.

With the onset of Windows operating systems and XFS on ATMs, the software applications have the ability to become more intelligent. This has created a new breed of ATM applications commonly referred to as programmable applications. These types of applications allows for an entirely new host of applications in which the ATM terminal can do more than only communicate with the ATM switch. It is now empowered to connected to other content servers and [[video banking]] systems.

Notable ATM software that operates on XFS platforms include Triton PRISM, [[Diebold]] Agilis EmPower, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] [[NCR Corporation|APTRA Edge]], [[Absolute Systems]] AbsoluteINTERACT, [[KAL (Korala Associates Limited)|KAL]] [[KAL (Korala Associates Limited)|Kalignite Software Platform]], Phoenix Interactive VISTAatm, [[Wincor Nixdorf]] [[Wincor Nixdorf|ProTopas]], [[Euronet Worldwide|Euronet]] EFTS and Intertech inter-ATM.

With the move of ATMs to industry-standard computing environments, concern has risen about the integrity of the ATM's software stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html |title=Technology News: Security: Windows Cash-Machine Worm Generates Concern |publisher=Technewsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318100752/http://www.technewsworld.com/story/32350.html |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
{{main|Security of automated teller machines}}
[[Security]], as it relates to ATMs, has several dimensions. ATMs also provide a practical demonstration of a number of security systems and concepts operating together and how various security concerns are addressed.

=== Physical ===
[[File:Procash stolen 1.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Wincor Nixdorf]] Procash 2100xe Frontload that was opened with an [[angle grinder]].]]

Early ATM security focused on making the terminals invulnerable to physical attack; they were effectively safes with dispenser mechanisms. A number of attacks resulted, with thieves attempting to steal entire machines by [[ram-raiding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obstructedtechnology.org/tech-news/things-to-keep-in-mind-when-opting-for-free-atm-placements.html|title=Things to Keep in Mind when Opting for Free ATM Placements|date=|accessdate=2015-09-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121090102/http://www.obstructedtechnology.org/tech-news/things-to-keep-in-mind-when-opting-for-free-atm-placements.html|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, criminal groups operating in Japan improved ram-raiding by stealing and using a truck loaded with heavy construction machinery to effectively demolish or uproot an entire ATM and any housing to steal its cash.

Another attack method, ''plofkraak'', is to seal all openings of the ATM with [[silicone]] and fill the vault with a combustible gas or to place an explosive inside, attached, or near the machine. This gas or explosive is ignited and the vault is opened or distorted by the force of the resulting explosion and the criminals can break in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ATM-bombings-up-3000-20080712 |title=ATM bombings up 3000% |accessdate=2011-04-07 |date=2008-07-12 |publisher=News24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114174333/http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ATM-bombings-up-3000-20080712 |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theft has occurred in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/14/exploding_atm_attack/|title=Dutch blaggers explode ATMs|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810130621/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/14/exploding_atm_attack/|archivedate=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/attacks-on-banks-devised-in-europe/2008/11/25/1227491548435.html/ |title=Attacks on banks devised in Europe - National |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629151743/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/attacks-on-banks-devised-in-europe/2008/11/25/1227491548435.html/ |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of attacks can be prevented by a number of gas explosion prevention devices also known as gas suppression system. These systems use explosive gas detection sensor to detect explosive gas and to neutralise it by releasing a special explosion suppression chemical which changes the composition of the explosive gas and renders it ineffective.

Several attacks in the UK (at least one of which was successful) have involved digging a concealed tunnel under the ATM and cutting through the reinforced base to remove the money.&lt;ref name=tunnel&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16556547 |title=Thieves dig 100ft tunnel to steal cash in Levenshulme |accessdate=2012-01-02 |date=2012-01-14 |publisher=BBC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114052858/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-16556547 |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ATM physical security, per other modern money-handling security, concentrates on denying the use of the money inside the machine to a thief, by using different types of [[Intelligent banknote neutralisation system|Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems]].

A common method is to simply rob the staff filling the machine with money. To avoid this, the schedule for filling them is kept secret, varying and random. The money is often kept in cassettes, which will dye the money if incorrectly opened.

=== Transactional secrecy and integrity ===

The security of ATM transactions relies mostly on the integrity of the secure [[cryptoprocessor]]: the ATM often uses general commodity components that sometimes are not considered to be "[[trusted system]]s".

Encryption of personal information, required by law in many jurisdictions, is used to prevent fraud. Sensitive data in ATM transactions are usually [[encryption|encrypted]] with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], but transaction processors now usually require the use of [[Triple DES]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&amp;pavilion=126&amp;step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012175105/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=25059&amp;pavilion=126&amp;step=story|date=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote Key Loading techniques may be used to ensure the secrecy of the initialisation of the encryption keys in the ATM. [[Message Authentication Code]] (MAC) or [[Partial MAC]] may also be used to ensure messages have not been tampered with while in transit between the ATM and the financial network.

=== Customer identity integrity ===
[[File:Japanese ATM Palm Scanner.jpg|thumb|A [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ|BTMU]] ATM with a [[palm scanner]] (to the right of the screen)]]

There have also been a number of incidents of fraud by [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]s, where criminals have attached fake keypads or card readers to existing machines. These have then been used to record customers' PINs and bank card information in order to gain unauthorised access to their accounts. Various ATM manufacturers have put in place countermeasures to protect the equipment they manufacture from these threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=7000&amp;na=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718062007/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article.php?id=7000&amp;na=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-18 |title=The No. 1 ATM security concern |publisher=ATM Marketplace |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buy.cuna.org/download/diebold_fraudpaper.pdf |title=Diebold ATM Fraud |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930071206/http://buy.cuna.org/download/diebold_fraudpaper.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative methods to verify cardholder identities have been tested and deployed in some countries, such as finger and palm vein patterns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140906/http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=30|date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iris recognition|iris]], and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] technologies. Cheaper mass-produced equipment has been developed and is being installed in machines globally that detect the presence of foreign objects on the front of ATMs, current tests have shown 99% detection success for all types of [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=103] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175306/http://www.ibia.org/biometrics/industrynews_view.asp?id=103|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Device operation integrity ===
[[File:Worn ATM.jpg|thumb|upright|ATMs that are exposed to the outside must be vandal- and weather- resistant.]]

Openings on the customer side of ATMs are often covered by mechanical shutters to prevent tampering with the mechanisms when they are not in use. Alarm sensors are placed inside ATMs and their servicing areas to alert their operators when doors have been opened by unauthorised personnel.

To protect against hackers, ATMs have a built-in firewall. Once the firewall has detected malicious attempts to break into the machine remotely, the firewall locks down the machine.

Rules are usually set by the government or ATM operating body that dictate what happens when integrity systems fail. Depending on the jurisdiction, a bank may or may not be liable when an attempt is made to dispense a customer's money from an ATM and the money either gets outside of the ATM's vault, or was exposed in a non-secure fashion, or they are unable to determine the state of the money after a failed transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuluttajavirasto.fi/user_nf/default_mag.asp?id=12263&amp;lmf=11440&amp;mode=readdoc&amp;tmf=11440|title=Kilpailu- ja kuluttajavirasto|work=Kilpailu- ja kuluttajavirasto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers often commented that it is difficult to recover money lost in this way, but this is often complicated by the policies regarding suspicious activities typical of the criminal element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |title=Banking |publisher=Moneycentral.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417111312/http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/P57803.asp |archivedate=17 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, multiple [[security camera]]s and [[security guard]]s are a common feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |title=NYSBD - Text of the ATM Safety Act |publisher=Banking.state.ny.us |date=1997-06-01 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410044556/http://www.banking.state.ny.us/legal/atmsafe.htm |archivedate=10 April 2011 }}

Consultants of ATM operators assert that the issue of customer security should have more focus by the banking industry;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&amp;pavilion=4&amp;step=story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230352/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/research.htm?article_id=5171&amp;pavilion=4&amp;step=story|date=9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been suggested that efforts are now more concentrated on the preventive measure of deterrent legislation than on the problem of ongoing forced withdrawals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509230332/http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news_story.htm?i=20479|date=9 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least as far back as July 30, 1986, consultants of the industry have advised for the adoption of an emergency PIN system for ATMs, where the user is able to send a [[panic alarm|silent alarm]] in response to a threat.&lt;ref&gt;Representative Mario Biaggi, Congressional Record, July 30, 1986, Page 18232 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative efforts to require an emergency PIN system have appeared in [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |title=ATM Report |publisher=Obre.state.il.us |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104220104/http://www.obre.state.il.us/AGENCY/News/atmrpt.htm |archivedate=4 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kansas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm Credit Union tech-talk news and technology resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073753/https://www.cunews.com/newsletters/2004216.htm |date=16 October 2015 }}.

In 1998, three towns outside Cleveland, Ohio, in response to an ATM crime wave, adopted legislation requiring that an [[emergency telephone number]] switch be installed at all outdoor ATMs within their jurisdiction. In the wake of a homicide in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, the city council passed an ATM security bill as well.

In China and elsewhere, many efforts to promote security have been made. On-premises ATMs are often located inside the bank's lobby, which may be accessible 24 hours a day. These lobbies have extensive security camera coverage, a courtesy telephone for consulting with the bank staff, and a security guard on the premises. Bank lobbies that are not guarded 24 hours a day may also have secure doors that can only be opened from outside by swiping the bank card against a wall-mounted scanner, allowing the bank to identify which card enters the building. Most ATMs will also display on-screen safety warnings and may also be fitted with convex mirrors above the display allowing the user to see what is happening behind them.

As of 2013, the only claim available about the extent of ATM-connected homicides is that they range from 500 to 1,000 per year in the US, covering only cases where the victim had an ATM card and the card was used by the killer after the known time of death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html Could Reverse PIN Save Lives at ATM?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013150036/http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Could_Reverse_Pin_Save_Lives_at_ATM_152336195.html |date=13 October 2014 }}.

===Jackpotting===
The term {{em|jackpotting}} is used to describe one method criminals utilize to steal money from an ATM.  The thieves gain physical access through a small hole drilled in the machine. They disconnect the existing hard drive and connect an external drive using an industrial endoscope. They then depress an internal button that reboots the device so that it is now under the control of the external drive. They can then have the ATM dispense all of its cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=ATM makers warn of 'jackpotting' hacks on U.S. machines |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-atms-usa/atm-makers-warn-of-jackpotting-hacks-on-u-s-machines-idUSKBN1FG0WU |quote= |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=January 27, 2018 |accessdate=2018-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HDD Encryption===
In recent years, many ATMs also encrypt the hard disk. This means that actually creating the software for jackpotting is a lot more difficult to do.

ATMs were originally developed as cash dispensers, and have evolved to provide many other bank-related functions: 
* Paying routine bills, fees, and taxes (utilities, phone bills, social security, legal fees, income taxes, etc.)
* Printing or ordering [[bank statement]]s
* Updating [[passbook]]s
* [[Cash advance]]s
* Cheque Processing Module
* Paying (in full or partially) the credit balance on a card linked to a specific [[current account]].

In some countries, especially those which benefit from a fully integrated cross-bank network (e.g.: [[Multibanco]] in Portugal), ATMs include many functions that are not directly related to the management of one's own bank account, such as:
* Loading monetary value into [[stored value card]]s
* Adding pre-paid [[cell phone]] / [[mobile phone]] credit.
* Purchasing

Videoconferencing teller machines are currently referred to as Interactive Teller Machines. Benton Smith, in the Idaho Business Review writes "The software that allows interactive teller machines to function was created by a Salt Lake City-based company called uGenius, a producer of video banking software. NCR, a leading manufacturer of ATMs, acquired uGenius in 2013 and married its own ATM hardware with uGenius' video software." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://idahobusinessreview.com/2016/06/16/interactive-teller-machines-allow-tellers-to-work-remotely/|title=Interactive teller machines allow tellers to work remotely|last=Smith|first=Benton Alexander|date=June 16, 2016|work=The Idaho Business Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DeLaRue ATM Crash.jpg|thumb|left|An ATM running [[Microsoft Windows]] that has [[blue screen of death|crashed]] due to a peripheral component failure]]

Before an ATM is placed in a public place, it typically has undergone extensive testing with both [[Test Money|test money]] and the [[Front and back ends|backend]] computer systems that allow it to perform transactions. Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/marketing/article27-p5.htm |title=Barking Up the Wrong Tree – Factors Influencing Customer Satisfaction in Retail Banking in the UK - Page 5 |publisher=Managementjournals.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116061441/http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/marketing/article27-p5.htm |archivedate=16 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimise machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimise malfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Allison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,875749,00.html |title=ATM gives out free cash and lands family in court &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2003-01-16|accessdate=2011-02-11 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATMs and the supporting electronic financial networks are generally very reliable, with industry benchmarks typically producing 98.25% customer availability for ATMs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.com/en/self-service/services_v_1.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122012524/http://www.ncr.com/en/self-service/services_v_1.pdf|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 99.999% availability for host systems that manage the networks of ATMs. If ATM networks do go out of service, customers could be left without the ability to make transactions until the beginning of their bank's next time of opening hours.

This said, not all errors are to the detriment of customers; there have been cases of machines giving out money without debiting the account, or giving out higher value notes as a result of incorrect [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of [[banknote]] being loaded in the money cassettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3667279.stm | work=BBC News | title=Double money in cash point error | date=2004-04-28 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115111715/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/3667279.stm | archivedate=15 January 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of receiving too much money may be influenced by the card holder agreement in place between the customer and the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cards/documentation/ch_agreements/ch_agree_client.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628204818/http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/cards/documentation/ch_agreements/ch_agree_client.html |archivedate=28 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4552288.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Mad rush to faulty ATM in France |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115044752/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4552288.stm |archivedate=15 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors that can occur may be [[Machine|mechanical]] (such as card transport mechanisms; keypads; [[hard disk failure]]s; envelope deposit mechanisms); [[software]] (such as [[operating system]]; [[device driver]]; [[application software|application]]); [[information transfer|communications]]; or purely down to operator error.

To aid in reliability, some ATMs print each transaction to a roll-paper journal that is stored inside the ATM, which allows its users and the related financial institutions to settle things based on the records in the journal in case there is a dispute. In some cases, transactions are posted to an electronic journal to remove the cost of supplying journal paper to the ATM and for more convenient searching of data.

Improper money checking can cause the possibility of a customer receiving [[counterfeit]] banknotes from an ATM. While bank personnel are generally trained better at spotting and removing counterfeit cash,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/286598582617402.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910100650/http://www.ottawabusinessjournal.com/286598582617402.php|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/education/index.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080511084240/http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/education/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 May 2008 |title=Materials- Bank Notes- Bank of Canada |publisher=Bankofcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting ATM money supplies used by banks provide no guarantee for proper banknotes, as the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany]] has confirmed that there are regularly incidents of false banknotes having been dispensed through ATMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/geldanlage/:Falschgeld-Bl%FCten-Geldautomat/523625.html |title=Falschgeld: Blüten aus dem Geldautomat? - Wirtschaft |publisher=Stern.De |date=2004-05-05 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ATMs may be stocked and wholly owned by outside companies, which can further complicate this problem.
[[Bill validator|Bill validation]] technology can be used by ATM providers to help ensure the authenticity of the cash before it is stocked in the machine; those with cash recycling capabilities include this capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Products/CashSystems/CashRecycling/ProCash3100/index.html |title=Wincor Nixdorf Germany |language=de |publisher=Wincor-nixdorf.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225656/http://www.wincor-nixdorf.com/internet/com/Products/CashSystems/CashRecycling/ProCash3100/index.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, whenever a transaction fails with an ATM due to network or technical issue and if the amount does not get dispensed in spite of account being debited then the banks are supposed to return the debited amount to the customer within 7 working days from the day of receipt of complaint. Banks are also liable to pay the late fees in case of delay in repayment of funds post 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_RTI_Diclosure_Logs.aspx?fn=9&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any device containing objects of value, ATMs and the systems they depend on to function are the targets of fraud. Fraud against ATMs and people's attempts to use them takes several forms.

The first known instance of a fake ATM was installed at a shopping mall in [[Manchester, Connecticut]] in 1993. By modifying the inner workings of a [[Fujitsu]] model 7020 ATM, a criminal gang known as the Bucklands Boys stole information from cards inserted into the machine by customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |title=1.05: The Bucklands Boys and Other Tales of the ATM |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |first=Phil |last=Patton |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029073146/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/atm_pr.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WAVY-TV]] reported an incident in Virginia Beach in September 2006 where a hacker, who had probably obtained a factory-default administrator password for a filling station's white-label ATM, caused the unit to assume it was loaded with US$5 bills instead of $20s, enabling himself—and many subsequent customers—to walk away with four times the money withdrawn from their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=/video/tech/2006/09/14/owens.va.atm.scam.wavy |title=Video |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2005-06-06 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109222545/http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=%2Fvideo%2Ftech%2F2006%2F09%2F14%2Fowens.va.atm.scam.wavy |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of scam was featured on the TV series ''[[The Real Hustle]]''.

ATM behaviour can change during what is called "stand-in" time, where the bank's cash dispensing network is unable to access databases that contain account information (possibly for database maintenance). In order to give customers access to cash, customers may be allowed to withdraw cash up to a certain amount that may be less than their usual daily withdrawal limit, but may still exceed the amount of available money in their accounts, which could result in fraud if the customers intentionally withdraw more money than what they had in their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1986/4.html |title=Kennison v Daire [1986&amp;#93; HCA 4; (1986) 160 CLR 129 (20 February 1986) |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date=1986-02-20 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Card fraud ===
In an attempt to prevent criminals from [[shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]] the customer's [[personal identification number]] (PIN), some banks draw privacy areas on the floor.

For a low-tech form of fraud, the easiest is to simply steal a customer's card along with its PIN. A later variant of this approach is to trap the card inside of the ATM's card reader with a device often referred to as a [[Lebanese loop]]. When the customer gets frustrated by not getting the card back and walks away from the machine, the criminal is able to remove the card and withdraw cash from the customer's account, using the card and its PIN.

This type of fraud has spread globally. Although somewhat replaced in terms of volume by skimming incidents, a re-emergence of card trapping has been noticed in regions such as Europe, where EMV chip and PIN cards have increased in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |title=ATM Security Issues &amp; ATM Fraud Issues by Geography &amp;#124; ATMSecurity.com ATM Security news ATM Security issues ATM fraud info ATM |publisher=Atmsecurity.com |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024215333/http://www.atmsecurity.com/articles/atm-fraud/atm-security-issues-atm-fraud-issues-by-geography.html |archivedate=24 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another simple form of fraud involves attempting to get the customer's bank to issue a new card and its PIN and stealing them from their mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724213440/http://venus.soci.niu.edu/~cudigest/phracks/phrack-08 |archivedate=24 July 2008 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, a newer high-tech method of operating, sometimes called '''card skimming''' or '''card cloning''', involves the installation of a magnetic card reader over the real ATM's card slot and the use of a wireless surveillance camera or a modified digital camera or a false PIN keypad to observe the user's PIN. Card data is then cloned into a duplicate card and the criminal attempts a standard cash withdrawal. The availability of low-cost commodity wireless cameras, keypads, card readers, and card writers has made it a relatively simple form of fraud, with comparatively low risk to the fraudsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/atmcamera.asp|title=Skimming with ATM Cameras : snopes.com|author=snopes|date=29 March 2016|work=snopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to stop these practices, countermeasures against card cloning have been developed by the banking industry, in particular by the use of [[smart card]]s which cannot easily be copied or spoofed by unauthenticated devices, and by attempting to make the outside of their ATMs [[tamper-evident|tamper evident]]. Older chip-card security systems include the French [[Carte Bleue]], [[Visa Cash]], [[Mondex]], [[Blue from American Express]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/56/wth.html |title=What the Hell Do Smart Cards Do? |publisher=Fast Company |date=2002-02-28 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701223645/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/56/wth.html |archivedate=1 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[EMV 96|EMV '96 or EMV 3.11]]. The most actively developed form of smart card security in the industry today is known as [[EMV 2000|EMV 2000 or EMV 4.x]].

[[EMV]] is widely used in the UK ([[Chip and PIN]]) and other parts of Europe, but when it is not available in a specific area, ATMs must fall back to using the easy–to–copy magnetic stripe to perform transactions. This fallback behaviour can be exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/19/stories/2006051920380300.htm |title=Tamil Nadu / Chennai News : Four more held in fake credit card racket case |publisher=The Hindu |date=2006-05-19 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810232850/http://www.hindu.com/2006/05/19/stories/2006051920380300.htm |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fallback option has been removed on the ATMs of some UK banks, meaning if the chip is not read, the transaction will be declined.

Card cloning and [[Skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]] can be detected by the implementation of magnetic card reader heads and firmware that can read a signature embedded in all magnetic stripes during the card production process. This signature, known as a "MagnePrint" or "BluPrint", can be used in conjunction with common two-factor authentication schemes used in ATM, debit/retail point-of-sale and prepaid card applications.

The concept and various methods of copying the contents of an ATM card's magnetic stripe onto a duplicate card to access other people's financial information was well known in the hacking communities by late 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fredric L. Rice, Organised Crime Civilian Response |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/phrack32.htm |title=Phrack Classic Volume Three, Issue 32, File #1 of XX Phrack Classic Newsletter Issue XXXII |publisher=Skepticfiles.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121231232/http://www.skepticfiles.org/hacker/phrack32.htm |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Andrew Stone, a computer security consultant from Hampshire in the UK, was convicted of stealing more than £1&amp;nbsp;million by pointing high-definition video cameras at ATMs from a considerable distance and recording the card numbers, expiry dates, etc. from the embossed detail on the ATM cards along with video footage of the PINs being entered. After getting all the information from the videotapes, he was able to produce clone cards which not only allowed him to withdraw the full daily limit for each account, but also allowed him to sidestep withdrawal limits by using multiple copied cards. In court, it was shown that he could withdraw as much as £10,000 per hour by using this method. Stone was sentenced to five years and six months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Castell |url=http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/6/17 |title=Seeking after the truth in computer evidence: any proof of ATM fraud? — ITNOW |publisher=Itnow.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184756/http://itnow.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/6/17 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[talking ATM]] is a type of ATM that provides audible instructions so that people who cannot read a screen can independently use the machine, therefore effectively eliminating the need for assistance from an external, potentially malevolent source. All audible information is delivered privately through a standard [[headphone jack]] on the face of the machine. Alternatively, some banks such as the [[Nordea]] and [[Swedbank]] use a built-in external speaker which may be invoked by pressing the talk button on the keypad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=pepsi says: |url=http://zidbits.com/2011/01/25/why-is-there-braille-on-drive-up-atm-machines/ |title=Why is there braille on drive-up ATMs? |publisher=Zidbits |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129211251/http://zidbits.com/2011/01/25/why-is-there-braille-on-drive-up-atm-machines/ |archivedate=29 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information is delivered to the customer either through pre-recorded [[sound]] files or via text-to-speech [[speech synthesis]].

A postal [[interactive kiosk]] may share many components of an ATM (including a vault), but it only dispenses items related to postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2004/pr04_098.htm |title=Postal Service Mailing Kiosks Now In Every State |publisher=Usps.com |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103030043/http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2004/pr04_098.htm |archivedate=3 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunewsviews.com/apc.htm Automated Postal Centers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413211117/http://www.lunewsviews.com/apc.htm |date=13 April 2016 }}.

A [[scrip cash dispenser]] may have many components in common with an ATM, but it lacks the ability to dispense physical cash and consequently requires no vault. Instead, the customer requests a withdrawal transaction from the machine, which prints a receipt. The customer then takes this receipt to a nearby sales clerk, who then exchanges it for cash from the till.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmscrip.com/what_is_scrip.html |title=About Script ATMs: How Do Cashless ATMs Work? - What is Scrip, or Cashless ATMs? |publisher=Atmscrip.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324150807/http://www.atmscrip.com/what_is_scrip.html |archivedate=24 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[teller assist unit]] (TAU) is  distinct in that it is designed to be operated solely by trained personnel and not by the general public, does integrate directly into interbank networks, and usually is controlled by a computer that is not directly integrated into the overall construction of the unit.

A Web ATM is an online interface for ATM card banking that uses a [[Card reader#Smart card readers|smart card reader]]. All the usual ATM functions are available, except for withdrawing cash. Most banks in [[Taiwan]] provide these online services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netbank.megabank.com.tw/natm/ |title=Megabank WebATM |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319155928/https://netbank.megabank.com.tw/natm/ |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webatm.post.gov.tw/postatm/index1.jsp |title=Post Office Bank WebATM |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409144215/https://webatm.post.gov.tw/postatm/index1.jsp |archivedate=9 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bolshoi-Planck simulation''', with the same resolution as Bolshoi, was run in 2013 on the Pleiades supercomputer using the [[Planck satellite]] team's cosmological parameters released in March 2013. The Bolshoi-Planck simulation is currently being analyzed in preparation for publication and distribution of its results in 2014.&lt;ref name="Bolshoi-Planck"&gt;{{cite web|last=Primack|first=Joel|title=Computing the Universe|url=http://p25ext.lanl.gov/colloquium_files/primack_abstract.html|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]|accessdate=1 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Primack|first=Joel|title=Bolshoi-Planck Cosmological Simulation.

Bolshoi simulations continue to be developed as of 2018.

== Contributors ==

[[Joel R. Primack|Joel R. Primack’s]] team at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], partnered with Anatoly Klypin’s group at [[New Mexico State University]], in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]&lt;ref name="ApJ740-102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ApJ742-16"/&gt; to run and analyze the Bolshoi simulations. Further analysis and comparison with observations by Risa Wechsler’s group at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and others are reflected in the papers based on the Bolshoi simulations.&lt;ref name=BolshoiPublications&gt;{{cite web|last=High-Performance AstroComputing Center|first=University of California|title=Publications|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/Papers.html|work=Bolshoi Cosmic Simulation|publisher=UC-HiPACC|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

A successful large-scale simulation of the evolution of [[galaxies]], with results consistent with what is actually seen by astronomers in the night sky, provides evidence that the theoretical underpinnings of the models employed, i.e., the supercomputer implementations ΛCDM, are sound bases for understanding galactic dynamics and the history of the universe, and opens avenues to further research. The Bolshoi Simulation isn't the first large-scale simulation of the universe, but it’s the first to rival the extraordinary precision of modern astrophysical observations.&lt;ref name=IEEESpectrum/&gt;

The previous largest and most successful simulation of galactic evolution was the [[Millennium run|Millennium Simulation Project]], led by Volker Springel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boylan-Kolchin|first=Michael|author2=Volker Springel|author3=Simon D. M. White|author4=Adrian Jenkins|author5=Gerard Lemson|title=Resolving cosmic structure formation with the Millennium-II Simulation|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=5 Jun 2009|volume=398|issue=3|pages=1150–1164|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15191.x|arxiv=0903.3041|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/398/3/1150|accessdate=11 Jan 2014|bibcode = 2009MNRAS.398.1150B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the success of that project stimulated more than 400 research papers, the Millennium simulations used early WMAP cosmological parameters that have since become obsolete. As a result, they led to some predictions, for example about the distribution of galaxies, that don’t match very well with observations. The Bolshoi simulations use the latest cosmological parameters, are higher in resolution, and have been analyzed in greater detail.&lt;ref name=BolshoiPublications/&gt;

== Methods ==

The Bolshoi simulation follows the evolving distribution of a statistical ensemble of 8.6 billion particles of [[dark matter]], each of which represents about 200 million [[solar mass]]es, in a cube of 3-dimensional space about 1 billion light years on edge. Dark matter and [[dark energy]] dominate the evolution of the cosmos in this model. The dynamics are modeled with the ΛCDM theory and [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], with the model including [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and the Λ [[cosmological constant]] term simulating the [[cosmic acceleration]] referred to as dark energy.

The first 100 million years ([[Myr]]) or so of the [[Chronology of the universe|evolution of the universe]] after the [[Big Bang]] can be derived analytically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |year=2010 |title=How Did the First Stars and Galaxies Form? |series=Princeton Frontiers in Physics |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9373.html |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=9781400834068 |accessdate=3 Jan 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolshoi simulation was started at [[redshift]] z=80, corresponding to about 20 Myr after the Big Bang.  Initial parameters were calculated with linear theory as implemented by the CAMB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Antony |last2=Challinor |first2=Anthony |title=Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background|url=http://camb.info/|publisher=Antony Lewis|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAMB Web Interface|url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/toolbox/tb_camb_form.cfm|work=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the WMAP website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|first=Goddard Space Flight Center|title=Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=3 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tools provide the initial conditions, including a statistical distribution of positions and velocities of the particles in the ensemble, for the much more demanding Bolshoi simulation of the next approximately 13.8 billion years. The experimental volume thus represents a random region of the universe, so comparisons with observations must be statistical.
[[File:Key Cosmological Parameters σ8 and ΩM from Observations Compared with Simulations.jpg|thumb|350px|right|alt=Key Cosmological Parameters σ8 and ΩM from Observations Compared with Simulations|Two key cosmological parameters, σ8 and ΩM, with values and 1-σ uncertainties from observations and values used in three cosmological simulations. The parameter σ8 represents the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum on the scale of clusters of galaxies, and the parameter ΩM is the dark + ordinary matter fraction of the cosmic density. The observations represented by the shapes on the figure are from X-ray and gravitational lensing studies of clusters of galaxies. The observations with error bars are from cosmic microwave background data combined with other data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year (2009), seven-year (2011), and nine-year (2013) publications and the Planck (2013) data release. The simulations are the Millennium I, II, and XXL simulations (which all used the same cosmological parameters consistent with the WMAP first-year data release 2003), and the Bolshoi (2011) and Bolshoi-Planck (2014) simulations.]]
The Bolshoi simulation employs a version of an [[adaptive mesh refinement]] (AMR) algorithm called an adaptive refinement tree (ART), in which a cube in space with more than a predefined density of matter is recursively divided into a mesh of smaller cubes. The subdivision continues to a limiting level, chosen to avoid using too much supercomputer time.  Neighboring cubes are not permitted to vary by too many levels, in the case of Bolshoi by more than one level of subdivision, to avoid large discontinuities. The AMR/ART method is well suited to model the increasingly inhomogeneous distribution of matter that evolves as the simulation proceeds. “Once constructed, the mesh, rather than being destroyed at each time step, is promptly adjusted to the evolving particle distribution.”&lt;ref name="ApJS111-73"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/319000/files/9701195.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adaptive Refinement Tree − A New High-Resolution N-Body Code for Cosmological Simulations |first1=Andrey V.|last1=Kravtsov|first2=Anatoly A.|last2=Klypin|first3=Alexei M.|last3= Khokhlov|publisher=Astrophys.J.Supplement 111, 73, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the Bolshoi simulation ran, the position and velocity of each of the 8.6 billion particles representing dark matter was recorded in 180 snapshots roughly evenly spaced over the simulated 13.8-billion-year run on the Pleiades supercomputer.&lt;ref name="ApJ740-102"/&gt; Each snapshot was then analyzed to find all the dark matter halos and the properties of each (particle membership, location, density distribution, rotation, shape, etc.).  All this data was then used to determine the entire growth and merging history of every halo.  These results are used in turn to predict where galaxies will form and how they will evolve.  How well these predictions correspond to observations provides a measure of the success of the simulation. Other checks were also made.&lt;ref name="ApJ742-16"/&gt;

== Results ==

The Bolshoi simulation is considered to have produced the best approximation to reality so far obtained for so large a volume of space, about 1 billion light years across. 
“Bolshoi produces a model universe that bears a striking and uncanny resemblance to the real thing. Starting with initial conditions based on the known distribution of matter shortly after the Big Bang, and using Einstein’s general theory of relativity as the ‘rules’ of the simulation, Bolshoi predicts a modern-day universe with galaxies lining up into hundred-million-light-year-long filaments that surround immense voids, forming a cosmic foam-like structure that precisely matches the [[cosmic web]] as revealed by deep galaxy studies such as the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]. To achieve such a close match, Bolshoi is clearly giving cosmologists a fairly accurate picture of how the universe actually evolved.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/skytel/beyondthepage/Interview-with-Joel-Primack-152323655.html|title=Introduction to Interview with Joel Primack|publisher=Sky and Telescope|date=19 Mar 2012|accessdate=1 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support ==

This research was supported by grants from NASA and [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] to Joel Primack and Anatoly Klypin, including massive grants of supercomputer time on the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) supercomputer Pleiades at NASA Ames Research Center. Hosting of the Bolshoi outputs and analyses at [[Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam]] (AIP) is partially supported by the [[MultiDark]] grant from the Spanish MICINN Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What was the support for the Bolshoi simulation suite?|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/FAQ.html#Q12|work=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=UC-HiPACC|accessdate=12 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cell type''' is a classification used to  distinguish between [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] or [[Phenotype|phenotypically]] distinct [[cell (biology)|cell]] forms within a [[species]]. A [[multicellular organism]] may contain a number of widely differing and specialized cell types, such as [[muscle cell]]s and [[skin cell]]s in humans, that differ both in appearance and function yet are [[Genetics|genetically]] identical. Cells are able to be of the same [[genotype]], but different cell type due to the differential [[Regulation of gene expression|regulation]] of the [[gene]]s they contain. [[Cell fate determination#Cell fate|Classification]] of a specific cell type is often done through the use of [[microscopy]] (such as those from the [[cluster of differentiation]] family that are commonly used for this purpose in [[immunology]]). Recent developments in [[Single cell sequencing|single cell RNA sequencing]] facilitated classification of cell types based on shared gene expression patterns. This has led to the discovery of many new cell types in e.g. mouse [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], [[hippocampus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeisel|first=Amit|last2=Muñoz-Manchado|first2=Ana B.|last3=Codeluppi|first3=Simone|last4=Lönnerberg|first4=Peter|last5=Manno|first5=Gioele La|last6=Juréus|first6=Anna|last7=Marques|first7=Sueli|last8=Munguba|first8=Hermany|last9=He|first9=Liqun|date=2015-03-06|title=Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6226/1138|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6226|pages=1138–1142|doi=10.1126/science.aaa1934|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25700174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dorsal root ganglion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Usoskin|first=Dmitry|last2=Furlan|first2=Alessandro|last3=Islam|first3=Saiful|last4=Abdo|first4=Hind|last5=Lönnerberg|first5=Peter|last6=Lou|first6=Daohua|last7=Hjerling-Leffler|first7=Jens|last8=Haeggström|first8=Jesper|last9=Kharchenko|first9=Olga|date=2014-11-24|title=Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3881|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=18|issue=1|pages=145–153|doi=10.1038/nn.3881|issn=1097-6256}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Häring|first=Martin|last2=Zeisel|first2=Amit|last3=Hochgerner|first3=Hannah|last4=Rinwa|first4=Puneet|last5=Jakobsson|first5=Jon E.

Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a [[multicellular]] body (100–150 different cell types), compared
with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctists.&lt;ref&gt;Margulis, L. &amp; Chapman, M.J. (2009). Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth ([4th ed.]. ed.). Amsterdam: Academic Press/Elsevier. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multicellular organisms==
All higher [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[organism]]s contain cells specialised for different functions. Most distinct cell types arise from a single [[totipotent]] cell that [[Cellular differentiation|differentiates]] into hundreds of different cell types during the course of [[Development (biology)|development]]. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell–cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of [[molecule]]s during [[cell division|division]]). [[multicellular organisms|Multicellular]] organisms are composed of cells that fall into two fundamental types: [[germ cell]]s and [[somatic cell]]s. During development, somatic cells will become more specialized and form the three primary [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]. After formation of the three [[germ layer]]s, cells will continue to specialize until they reach a terminally differentiated state that is much more resistant to changes in cell type than its [[Progenitor cell|progenitors]].

==Humans==
A [[list of distinct cell types in the adult human body|list of cell types in the human body]] may include several hundred distinct types depending on the source.&lt;ref&gt;''Molecular Biology of the Cell'', Fourth Edition, Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, Peter Walter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=cell%20types ines.de/cope.cgi COPE database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DuPont Experimental Station''' is the largest research and development facility of [[E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[David A. Hounshell]] and John Kenly Smith, Jr., “Science and Corporate Strategy — DuPont R&amp;D 1902–1980,” Cambridge University Press, 1988, as a general historical reference about DuPont that includes much information about the Experimental Station.&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the banks of the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], it is home to some of the most important discoveries of the modern chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Kinnane, “DuPont: From the Banks of the Brandywine to Miracles of Science,” Johns Hopkins University Press, February 26, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8018-7059-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more early history and an early photograph of the Experimental Station, see {{cite web |url=http://www.plastiquarian.com/dupont.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402030324/http://www.plastiquarian.com/dupont.htm |archivedate=2007-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Experimental Station is a more recent part of the DuPont legacy and is located on the [[DuPont Historic Corridor]].

== Overview ==
The Experimental Station marked its 100th anniversary in 2003. It was founded as an effort to move the DuPont Company from [[gunpowder]] and [[explosives]] into the new age of [[chemistry]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The site overlooks the original powder mills upon which the company was founded - now [[Hagley Museum and Library]], a nonprofit educational institution documenting the history of DuPont business and technology. The Experimental Station is east from Hagley Museum and west-southwest from the [[Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children]].

As one of the first industrial research laboratories in the United States, the {{convert|150|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus-style Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, serves as the primary research and development facility for DuPont. It is home to DuPont's [[Central Research]] and most other business units of DuPont are also represented on site. The Experimental Station is the birthplace of many of the innovative materials and products developed by DuPont since 1903, including:

* [[Neoprene]] - the world's first [[synthetic rubber]];
* [[Nylon]] polyamide for [[fiber]]s and engineering polymers for machine parts, gears, electrical systems and even [[automobile]] air intake manifolds;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caimateriali.org/Eventi/Torino/historynylon.html History of Nylon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621045155/http://www.caimateriali.org/Eventi/Torino/historynylon.html |date=2008-06-21 }} US Patent 2,130,523 'Linear polyamides suitable for spinning into strong pliable fibers', U.S. Patent 2,130,947 'Diamine dicarboxylic acid salt' issued and U.S. Patent 2,130,948 'Synthetic fibers', all issued 20 September 1938&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tyvek]] nonwovens for [[housewrap]], [[envelopes]], medical packaging, environmental protection and [[currency]];
* [[Kevlar]] fiber for [[body armor]] and [[automobile]] [[tire]] reinforcement;&lt;ref&gt;D. Tanner, J. A. Fitzgerald, B. R. Phillips, "The Kevlar Story - an Advanced Materials Case Study," [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English]] 28(5), 649 - 654 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Magat, "Fibres from Extended Chain Aromatic Polyamides, New Fibres and Their Composites," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A, 294(1411)
463-472 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mylar]] [[polyester]] film for [[packaging material]] and [[balloons]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://heritage.dupont.com/touchpoints/tp_1952/overview.shtml 1952: Mylar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411132019/http://heritage.dupont.com/touchpoints/tp_1952/overview.shtml |date=April 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Corian]] solid surface materials for [[countertop]]s, [[flooring]] and art;&lt;ref&gt;For a more thorough description of Corian surfaces, see http://www2.dupont.com/Surfaces/en_US/products/corian/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Butacite [[polyvinyl butyral]], the safety interlayer in [[laminated glass]];&lt;ref&gt;For some unique applications of DuPont’s safety glass see http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6469941.stm for information about the [[Grand Canyon Skywalk]] and {{cite web|url=http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/glass_staircase.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202143144/http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/glass_staircase.html |archivedate=2015-02-02 |df= }} for a view of the glass stairway in the Apple store in New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* [[Nomex]] fiber for [[firefighting]] equipment and other thermal protection applications.
* Simple [[Crown ethers]] were invented by [[Charles J. Pedersen]] in 1967, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1987.  There is a plaque at the Experimental Station marking the location of the lab where his work took place.
For a more complete description of the inventions of the scientists and engineers of the Experimental Station, see the [[List of DuPont Experimental Station Inventions]].  

Today nearly 2,000 scientists and researchers - including roughly 600 with [[Ph.D.]]s - pursue new opportunities for a broad range of global markets including [[agriculture]] and [[nutrition]], [[electronics]], safety and protection, [[coatings]] and performance materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.dupont.com/Science/en_US/rd/station/index.html DuPont.com: Experimental Station&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 50 buildings encompassing 250,000 square meters of research space. This centralized facility allows collaborations to enhance scientific discovery. More recent successes include Suva [[refrigerants]], the BAX [[food safety]] systems and [[Sorona]] [[polyester]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bush at DuPont.jpg|thumb|right|DuPont scientist Armando Byrne discusses potential new directions in biofuels research with President George W. Bush as DuPont's then CEO, Chad Holliday, looks on.]] --&gt;

Research and development now under way includes [[nanotechnology]], emerging [[video display]] technologies, [[fuel cells]], and [[biomaterials]] produced from [[renewable resources]] such as [[maize|corn]]. These developments could lead to foods that help prevent diseases and brittle bones, "smart" materials that can adjust performance on their own, microorganisms that produce [[biodegradable]] products and innovative materials for personal protection.

On the morning of January 24, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] became the first president to visit the Experimental Station.&lt;ref&gt;For more about Bush's visit and his speech on energy, see https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-5.html&lt;/ref&gt; He saw examples of how DuPont is putting science to work to provide products for agricultural [[energy crop]]s, feedstock processing and advanced [[biofuels]] such as [[ethanol]] and bio-[[butanol]]. He also viewed other [[alternative energy]] sources and technologies dealing with [[energy conservation]]. These are all part of DuPont’s sustainable growth mission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12352">The '''European Route of Industrial Heritage''' ('''ERIH''') is a network ([[theme routes|theme route]]) of the most important [[industrial heritage]] sites in Europe. This is a tourism industry information initiative to present a network of industrial heritage sites across Europe. The aim of the project is to create interest for the common European Heritage of the Industrialisation and its remains. ERIH also wants to promote regions, towns and sites showing the industrial history and market them as visitor attractions in the leisure and tourism industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erih.net/welcome.html European Route of Industrial Heritage home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anchor points==
The – virtual – main route is built by the so-called Anchor Points. These are Industrial Heritage sites which are the historically most important and most attractive for visitors. The route leads through 13 countries thus far (in 2014): United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Poland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erih.net/anchor-points.html Anchor Points.

'''Fidelity''' when personified in Western art stands for the secular aspect of Faith, or the trust that exists between a master and servant, or in family relationships.  [[Fidelity]] is often represented as a woman, shown holding a golden seal and a key, but may also be represented by a dog. Fidelity may be shown alone, or may be accompanied by a dog, a symbol of not only faithfulness but also fidelity.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, James. Dictionary of Subjects &amp; Symbols in Art. Rev. ed. United States of America: Westview Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, [[Penelope]] or [[Griselda (folklore)|Griselda]] might also stand for fidelity. Fidelity is not in the usual lists of the [[seven virtues]], though it may sometimes be included in such groupings. The plant myrtle (''[[Myrtus]]'') has been associated with fidelity, and hence used in weddings, from Roman times to the present, and wreathed crowns of myrtle may be found in art.

== Fidelity in allegory ==
A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of fidelity personified.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; The deep origins of this can also be recognized in the generic name ''Fido'' given to dogs, which originated from the Latin word ''fidus,'' meaning "trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the faithful dog of Titus Labienus, that would not quit his master's corpse, recorded in [[Pliny's Natural History]] book viii, was briefly recounted in [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia'' (1593, etc.) in the explanation of the emblem of ''Fedeltà'' represented as a woman holding a ring and accompanied by a white dog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asim.it/iconologia/ICONOLOGIAview.asp?Id=97 Ripa, ''Iconologia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fidelity in portraiture ==
When in a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. When the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's "[[Arnolfini Portrait]]."

== Fidelity and Death ==
During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crusaders|crusader]] lying in full armor on his tomb-chest, with a dog beneath his feet is a familiar trope.

[[Image:LippewerkKraftwerk.JPG|thumb|300px|Oldest power station utilizing circular fluidised bed technology, in [[Lünen]], Germany]]  
A '''fluidised bed''' is a physical phenomenon occurring when a quantity of a [[solid]] particulate substance (usually present in a holding vessel) is placed under appropriate conditions to cause a solid/fluid mixture to behave as a [[fluid]]. This is usually achieved by the introduction of pressurized fluid through the particulate medium. This results in the medium then having many properties and characteristics of normal fluids, such as the ability to free-flow under gravity, or to be pumped using fluid type technologies.

The resulting phenomenon is called [[fluidisation]]. Fluidised beds are used for several purposes, such as [[fluidized bed reactor]]s (types of [[chemical reactor]]s), solids separation&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.15420  |title= A simple model for predicting solid concentration distribution in binary‐solid liquid fluidized beds |publisher=AIChE Journal |last1=Peng |first1= Z. |last2=Moghtaderi| first2= B. |last3=Doroodchi |first3= E. | year=2017 |page= 469:484 | doi= 10.1002/aic.15420}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[fluid catalytic cracking]], [[fluidized bed combustion]], heat or mass transfer or interface modification, such as applying a [[coating]] onto solid items. This technique is also becoming more common in [[aquaculture]] for the production of shellfish in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecaa.ntu.edu.tw/weifang/sysEng/microalgae-based%20recirculating%20oyster%20and%20shrimp%20system.pdf Wang, JK, 2003. Conceptual design of a microalgae-based recirculating oyster and shrimp system. Aquacultural Engineering 28, 37-46]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
A fluidised bed consists of fluid-solid mixture that exhibits fluid-like properties. As such, the upper surface of the bed is relatively horizontal, which is analogous to hydrostatic behavior. The bed can be considered to be a heterogeneous mixture of fluid and solid that can be represented by a single bulk density.

Furthermore, an object with a higher density than the bed will sink, whereas an object with a lower density than the bed will float, thus the bed can be considered to exhibit the fluid behavior expected of [[Archimedes' principle]]. As the "density", (actually the solid volume fraction of the suspension), of the bed can be altered by changing the fluid fraction, objects with different densities comparative to the bed can, by altering either the fluid or solid fraction, be caused to sink or float.

In fluidised beds, the contact of the solid particles with the fluidisation medium (a gas or a liquid) is greatly enhanced when compared to [[packed bed]]s. This behavior in fluidised combustion beds enables good thermal transport inside the system and good heat transfer between the bed and its container. Similarly to the good heat transfer, which enables thermal uniformity analogous to that of a well mixed gas, the bed can have a significant heat-capacity whilst maintaining a homogeneous temperature field.

== Application ==
Fluidised beds are used as a technical process which has the ability to promote high levels of contact between gases and solids. In a fluidised bed a characteristic set of basic properties can be utilised, indispensable to modern process and chemical engineering, these properties include:  

*Extremely high surface area contact between fluid and solid per unit bed volume
*High relative velocities between the fluid and the dispersed solid phase.
*High levels of intermixing of the particulate phase.
*Frequent particle-particle and particle-wall collisions.

Taking an example from the food processing industry: fluidised beds are used to accelerate freezing in some [[frozen food|individually quick frozen (IQF) tunnel freezers]]. These fluidised bed tunnels are typically used on small food products like peas, shrimp or sliced vegetables, and may use [[cryogenic]] or [[vapor-compression refrigeration]]. The fluid used in fluidised beds may also contain a fluid of catalytic type; that's why it is also used to catalyse the chemical reaction and also to improve the rate of reaction.

Fluidised beds are also used for efficient bulk drying of materials. Fluidised bed technology in dryers increases efficiency by allowing for the entire surface of the drying material to be suspended and therefore exposed to the air. This process can also be combined with heating or cooling, if necessary, according to the specifications of the application.

== History ==
In 1922, Fritz Winkler made the first industrial application of fluidisation in a reactor for a [[coal gasification]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FDbB7VjxkQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Fritz%20Winkler%22%20Coal%20Gasification&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=SA5-PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=Fritz%20winkler&amp;f=false  |title= Multiphase Flow Handbook |publisher=CRC Press | contribution= Fluidised Beds |last1=Grace |first1= John R. |last2=Leckner| first2= Bo |last3=Zhu |first3= Jesse |last4=Cheng |first4= Yi |editor=Clayton T.

In the 1960s VAW-Lippewerk in Lünen, Germany implemented the first industrial bed for the combustion of coal and later for the calcination of aluminium hydroxide.

== Fluidised bed types ==
Bed types can be coarsely classified by their flow behavior, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Fluidisation technology |url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:p6X8M3WlO2YJ:www.outotec.com/36280.epibrw+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh8iuKx7pBIfbDG7SAnJZ6O0IPTTDlXqjV4uDWfv4LuCwgIU71Dy8lNdFMdG29QREUpn80hMAhNybTn86_Me-LBOaOvoUdrZB45YyEoDxAKfnB3lpYaOVIQQFuRaNdyCckoRwRI&amp;sig=AHIEtbTtv04V2AHzno6Tj3TzVI-S2MzwJg | publisher = [[Outotec]] | date= May 2007 | accessdate= June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Stationary or bubbling fluidised bed is the classical approach where the gas at low velocities is used and fluidisation of the solids is relatively stationary, with some fine particles being entrained.
*[[Circulating fluidized bed]]s (CFB), where gases are at a higher velocity sufficient to suspend the particle bed, due to a larger kinetic energy of the fluid. As such the surface of the bed is less smooth and larger particles can be entrained from the bed than for stationary beds. Entrained particles are recirculated via an external loop back into the reactor bed.  Depending on the process, the particles may be classified by a cyclone separator and separated from or returned to the bed, based upon particle cut size.
*[[Vibratory fluidized bed]]s are similar to stationary beds, but add a mechanical vibration to further excite the particles for increased entrainment.
*[[Flash Reactor|Transport or flash reactor]] (FR).  At velocities higher than CFB, particles approach the velocity of the gas.  Slip velocity between gas and solid is significantly reduced at the cost of less homogeneous heat distribution.
*[[Annular fluidized bed]] (AFB).  A large nozzle at the center of a bubble bed introduces gas as high velocity achieving the rapid mixing zone above the surrounding bed comparable to that found in the external loop of a CFB.
* Mechanically Fluidised Reactor (MFR). A mechanical stirrer is used to mobilize particles and achieve properties similar to that a well-mixed fluidised bed. It does not require fluidisation gas.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhari, Mitesh C., "Effect of Liquid-Solid Contact on Thermal Cracking of Heavy Hydrocarbons in a Mechanically Fluidised Reactor" (2012).

==Bed design==
[[Image:FluidisedBed.svg|thumb|200px|right|A diagram of a fluidised bed]]

=== Basic model ===
When the packed bed has a fluid passed over it, the pressure drop of the fluid is approximately proportional to the fluid's [[superficial velocity]]. In order to transition from a packed bed to a fluidised condition, the gas velocity is continually raised. For a free-standing bed there will exist a point, known as the minimum or incipient fluidisation point, whereby the bed's mass is suspended directly by the flow of the fluid stream. The corresponding fluid velocity, known as the "minimum
fluidisation velocity", &lt;math&gt;u_{mf}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=holdich&gt;{{citation| title= Fundamentals of Particle Technology | chapter = Chapter 7: Fluidisation | first1= Richard Graham |last1 = Holdich | isbn = 978-0954388102 | url = http://www.particles.org.uk/particle_technology_book/chapter_7.pdf |format = pdf | accessdate = June 2012 | publisher = Midland Information Technology &amp; Publishing |date = November 1, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the minimum fluidisation velocity (&lt;math&gt; u \geq u_{mf} &lt;/math&gt;), the bed material will be suspended by the gas-stream and further increases in the velocity will have a reduced effect on the pressure, owing to sufficient [[percolation]] of the gas flow. Thus the pressure drop for &lt;math&gt;u &gt; u_{mf}&lt;/math&gt; is relatively constant.

At the base of the vessel the apparent pressure drop multiplied by the cross-section area of the bed can be equated to the force of the weight of the solid particles (less the buoyancy of the solid in the fluid).
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta p_{w} = H_{w} (1- \epsilon_{w}) (\rho_{s} - \rho_{f}) g = [M_{s} g / A] [(\rho_{s} - \rho_{f}) / \rho_{s}] &lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;/center&gt;
where:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta p_{w} &lt;/math&gt; is the bed pressure drop

&lt;math&gt;H_{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the bed height

&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the bed voidage, i.e. the fraction of the bed volume that is occupied by the voids (the fluid spaces between the particles)

&lt;math&gt;\rho_{s} &lt;/math&gt; is the apparent density of bed particles

&lt;math&gt;\rho_{f} &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the fluidising fluid

&lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; is the gravity acceleration

&lt;math&gt;M_{s} &lt;/math&gt; is the total mass of solids in the bed

&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the bed

=== Geldart Groupings ===

In 1973, Professor D. Geldart proposed the grouping of powders in to four so-called "Geldart Groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0032-5910(73)80037-3|last1=Geldart|first1=D.|title=Types of gas fluidisation|journal=Powder technology|volume=7|issue=5|pages=285–292|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups are defined by their locations on a diagram of solid-fluid density difference and particle size. Design methods for fluidised
beds can be tailored based upon the particle's Geldart grouping:&lt;ref name=holdich /&gt;

'''Group A''' For this group the particle size is between 20 and 100&amp;nbsp;µm, and the particle density is typically less than 1.4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Prior to the initiation of a bubbling bed phase, beds from these particles will expand by a factor of 2 to 3 at incipient fluidisation, due to a decreased bulk density. Most powder-catalyzed beds utilize this group.

'''Group B''' The particle size lies between 40 and 500&amp;nbsp;µm and the particle density between 1.4-4g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Bubbling typically forms directly at incipient fluidisation.

'''Group C''' This group contains extremely fine and consequently the most cohesive particles. With a size of 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;µm, these particles fluidise under very difficult to achieve conditions, and may require the application of an external force, such as mechanical agitation.

'''Group D''' The particles in this region are above 600&amp;nbsp;µm and typically have high particle densities. Fluidisation of this group requires very high fluid energies and is typically associated with high levels of abrasion. Drying grains and peas, roasting coffee beans, gasifying coals, and some roasting metal ores are such solids, and they are usually processed in shallow beds or in the spouting mode.

=== Distributor ===
Typically, pressurized gas or liquid enters the fluidised bed vessel through numerous holes via a plate known as a distributor plate, located at the bottom of the fluidised bed. The fluid flows upward through the bed, causing the solid particles to be suspended. If the inlet fluid is disabled, the bed may settle, pack onto the plate or trickle down through the plate.
Many industrial beds use a sparger distributor instead of a distributor plate.  The fluid is then distributed through a series of perforated tubes.

The '''Fraunhofer Society''' ({{lang-de|Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.{{nnbsp}}V.}},&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|aʊ|n|ˌ|h|oʊ|f|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfraʊnˌhoːfɐ|lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research") is a German research organization with 72{{nbsp}}institutes spread throughout [[Germany]], each focusing on different fields of applied science (as opposed to the [[Max Planck Society]], which works primarily on basic science). With over 25,000 employees, mainly [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s and with an annual research budget of about €2.3{{nbsp}}billion&lt;ref name = Facts&gt;[http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/about-fraunhofer/profile-structure/facts-and-figures.html Facts and Figures]&lt;/ref&gt; it is the biggest organisation for applied research and development services in Europe. 

Some basic funding for the Fraunhofer Society is provided by the state (the German public, through the federal government together with the states or ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'', "owns" the Fraunhofer Society), but more than 70% of the funding is earned through contract work, either for government-sponsored projects or from industry.&lt;ref name = Facts/&gt;

It is named after [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] who, as a scientist, an engineer, and an entrepreneur, is said to have superbly exemplified the goals of the society.

The organization has seven centers in the United States, under the name "Fraunhofer USA", and three in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== The Fraunhofer model ==
The so-called "Fraunhofer model" has been in existence since 1973 and has led to the society's continuing growth. Under the model, the Fraunhofer Society earns about 70% of its income through contracts with industry or specific government projects. The other 30% of the budget is sourced in the proportion 9:1 from federal and state (Land) government grants and is used to support preparatory research.

Thus the size of the society's budget depends largely on its success in maximizing revenue from commissions. This funding model applies not just to the central society itself but also to the individual institutes. This serves both to drive the realisation of the Fraunhofer Society's strategic direction of becoming a leader in applied research as well as encouraging a flexible, autonomous and entrepreneurial approach to the society's research priorities.

==Institutes==
The Fraunhofer Society currently operates 72 institutes and research units. These are '''Fraunhofer Institute'''s for:

==History==
[[Image:Stamp Germany 1999 MiNr2038 Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.jpg|thumb|right|A German stamp: 50 years of the Fraunhofer Society]]
The Fraunhofer Society was founded in [[Munich]] on March 26, 1949, by representatives of industry and academia, the government of [[Bavaria]], and the nascent [[Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Republic]].

In 1952, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs declared the Fraunhofer Society to be the third part of the non-university German research landscape (alongside the [[German Research Foundation]] (DFG) and the [[Max Planck Institute]]s). Whether the Fraunhofer Society should support applied research through its own facilities was, however, the subject of a long-running dispute.

From 1954, the Society's first institutes developed. By 1956, it was developing research facilities in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense. In 1959, the Fraunhofer Society comprised nine institutes with 135 coworkers and a budget of 3.6&amp;nbsp;million [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]].

In 1965, the Fraunhofer Society was identified as a sponsor organization for applied research.

In 1968, the Fraunhofer Society became the target of public criticism for its role in military research.

By 1969, Fraunhofer had more than 1,200 employees in 19 institutes. The budget stood at 33 million [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]]. At this time, a "commission for the promotion of the development of the Fraunhofer Society" planned the further development of the Fraunhofer Society (FhG). The commission developed a financing model that would make the Society dependent on its commercial success. This would later come to be known as the "Fraunhofer Model".

The Model was agreed to by the Federal Cabinet and the Bund-Länder-Kommission in 1973. In the same year, the executive committee and central administration moved into joint accommodation at Leonrodstraße 54 in [[Munich]].

The Fraunhofer program for the promotion of the consulting research for [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] was established, and has gained ever more significance in subsequent years.

In 1977, the political ownership of the society was shared by the Ministries of Defense and Research.

By 1984, the Fraunhofer Society had 3,500 employees in 33 institutes and a research budget of 360 million [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]].

By 1988, defense research represented only about 10% of the entire expenditure of the Fraunhofer Society.

By 1989, the Fraunhofer Society had nearly 6,400 employees in 37 institutes, with a total budget of 700 million [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]].

In 1991, the Fraunhofer Society faced the challenge of integrating numerous research establishments in former East Germany as branch offices of already-existing institutes in the Fraunhofer Society.

In 1993, the Fraunhofer Society's total budget exceeded 1&amp;nbsp;billion [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]].

In 1994, the Society founded a US-based subsidiary, Fraunhofer USA, Inc., to extend the outreach of Fraunhofer's R&amp;D network to American clients.

Its mission statement of 2000 committed the Fraunhofer Society to being a market and customer-oriented, nationally and internationally active sponsor organization for institutes of the applied research.

In 1999, Fraunhofer initiated Fraunhofer Venture, a [[University_technology_transfer_offices|technology transfer office]], to advance the transfer of its scientific research findings and meet the growing entrepreneurial spirit in the Fraunhofer institutes.

Between 2000 and 2001, the institutes and IT research centers of the GMD (Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung – Society for Mathematics and Information technology) were integrated into the Fraunhofer Society at the initiative of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research.

The year 2000 marked a noteworthy success at Fraunhofer-Institut for Integrated Circuits (IIS): [[MP3]], a [[Lossy compression|lossy]] audio format which they developed, is the most widely adopted method for compressing and decompressing digital audio.

In 2002, ownership of the Heinrich-Hertz-Institut for Communications Technology Berlin GmbH (HHI), which belonged to the Gottfried William Leibniz Society e. V. (GWL), was transferred to the Fraunhofer Society. With this integration the Fraunhofer Society budget exceeded €1&amp;nbsp;billion for the first time.

In 2003, the Fraunhofer Society headquarters moved to its own building in [[Munich]].

The Fraunhofer Society developed and formulated a firm specific mission statement summarizing fundamental targets and codifying the desired "values and guidelines" of the society's "culture". Amongst these, the society committed itself to improving the opportunities for female employees and coworkers to identify themselves with the enterprise and to develop their own creative potential.

In 2004, the former "Fraunhofer Working Group for Electronic Media Technology" at the Fraunhofer-Institut for Integrated Circuits (IIS) gained the status of an independent institute. It becomes Fraunhofer-Institut for Digital Media Technology IDMT.

New alliances and topic groups helped to strengthen the market operational readiness level of the institutes for Fraunhofer in certain jurisdictions.

In 2005, two new institutes, the Leipzig Fraunhofer-Institut for Cell Therapy and Immunology (IZI), and the Fraunhofer Center for Nano-electronic technologies CNT in [[Dresden]], were founded.

In 2006, the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS) was founded as a merger between the Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS), and the Institute for Media Communication (IMK).

In 2009, the former FGAN Institutes were converted into a Fraunhofer Institutes, amongst them the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics FKIE and the Fraunhofer Institute for Radar and High Frequency Technology FHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fkie.fraunhofer.de/de/Pressemeldungen/FKIE_staerkt_Bonn_als_nationales_Zentrum_fuer_Cybersicherheit.html |title=Fraunhofer-FKIE stärkt Bonn als nationales Zentrum für Cybersicherheit | access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ancient synagogue of Gaza''' was built in 508 AD during the [[Byzantine]] period and was discovered in 1965. It was located in the ancient port city of Gaza, then known as "[[Maiuma]]s", currently the [[Rimal]] district of [[Gaza City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQyxvmYV-50C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ancient synagogues''].

'''Health psychology''' is the study of psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M. (1994). Current trends in Health Psychology. ''The Psychologist, 7,'' 114-118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with understanding how [[psychological]], [[behavior]]al, and [[culture|cultural]] factors contribute to physical health and illness. Psychological factors can affect health directly&lt;ref name="Simandan"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. For example, chronically occurring environmental stressors affecting the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]], cumulatively, can harm health. Behavioral factors can also affect a person's health. For example, certain behaviors  can, over time, harm (smoking or consuming excessive amounts of alcohol) or enhance health (engaging in exercise).&lt;ref name="Ogden, J. 2012"&gt;Ogden, J. (2012). ''Health Psychology: A Textbook (5th ed.).'' Maidenhead, UK: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists take a [[Biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] approach. In other words, health psychologists understand health to be the product not only of biological processes (e.g., a virus, tumor, etc.) but also of psychological (e.g., thoughts and beliefs), behavioral (e.g., habits), and social processes (e.g., [[socioeconomic status]] and [[ethnicity]]).&lt;ref name="Ogden, J. 2012"/&gt;

By understanding psychological factors that influence health, and constructively applying that knowledge, health psychologists can improve health by working directly with individual patients or indirectly in large-scale public health programs. In addition, health psychologists can help train other healthcare professionals (e.g., physicians and nurses) to take advantage of the knowledge the discipline has generated, when treating patients. Health psychologists work in a variety of settings: alongside other medical professionals in hospitals and clinics, in [[public health]] departments working on large-scale behavior change and health promotion programs, and in universities and medical schools where they teach and conduct [[research]].

Although its early beginnings can be traced to the field of [[clinical psychology]],&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, R. W. (1983).

==Overview==
Recent advances in psychological, medical, and physiological research have led to a new way of thinking about health and illness. This conceptualization, which has been labeled the [[biopsychosocial model]], views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, [[social support]]).

[[Psychologists]] who strive to understand how biological, behavioral, and social factors influence health and illness are called health psychologists. Health psychologists use their knowledge of psychology and health to promote general well-being and understand physical illness.&lt;ref name='BPS'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). What is health psychology? A guide for the public.&lt;/ref&gt; They are specially trained to help people deal with the psychological and emotional aspects of health and illness. Health psychologists work with many different health care professionals (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, physician's assistants, dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and chaplains) to conduct research and provide clinical assessments and treatment services. Many health psychologists focus on prevention research and interventions designed to promote healthier lifestyles and try to find ways to encourage people to improve their health. For example, they may help people to lose weight or stop smoking.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Health psychologists also use their skills to try to improve the healthcare system. For example, they may advise doctors about better ways to communicate with their patients.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; 
Health psychologists work in many different settings including the UK's [[National Health Service]] (NHS), private practice, universities, communities, schools and organizations. While many health psychologists provide clinical services as part of their duties, others function in non-clinical roles, primarily involving teaching and research. Leading journals include ''[[Health Psychology (journal)|Health Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Health Psychology]]'', the ''British Journal of Health Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)2044-8287 The ''British Journal of Health Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1758-0846&amp;site=1 ''Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being'']&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists can work with people on a one-to-one basis, in groups, as a family, or at a larger population level.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

;Clinical health psychology (ClHP)
:ClHP is the application of scientific knowledge, derived from the field of health psychology, to clinical questions that may arise across the spectrum of health care.  ClHP is one of many specialty practice areas for clinical psychologists. It is also a major contributor to the prevention-focused field of [[behavioral health]] and the treatment-oriented field of [[behavioral medicine]]. Clinical practice includes education, the techniques of [[behavior modification|behavior change]], and psychotherapy. In some countries, a clinical health psychologist, with additional training, can become a [[medical psychologist]] and, thereby, obtain prescription privileges.

;Public health psychology (PHP)
:PHP is population oriented. A major aim of PHP is to investigate potential causal links between psychosocial factors and health at the population level. Public health psychologists present research results to educators, policy makers, and health care providers in order to promote better public health. PHP is allied to other public health disciplines including [[epidemiology]], [[nutrition]], [[genetics]] and [[biostatistics]]. Some PHP interventions are targeted toward at-risk population groups (e.g., undereducated, single pregnant women who smoke) and not the population as a whole (e.g., all pregnant women).

;Community health psychology (CoHP)
:CoHP investigates community factors that contribute to the health and well-being of individuals who live in communities. CoHP also develops community-level interventions that are designed to combat disease and promote physical and mental health. The community often serves as the level of analysis, and is frequently sought as a partner in health-related interventions.

;Critical health psychology (CrHP)
:CrHP is concerned with the distribution of power and the impact of power differentials on health experience and behavior, health care systems, and health policy. CrHP prioritizes social justice and the universal right to health for people of all races, genders, ages, and socioeconomic positions. A major concern is health inequalities. The critical health psychologist is an agent of change, not simply an analyst or cataloger. A leading organization in this area is the [[International Society of Critical Health Psychology]].

Health psychology, like other areas of applied psychology, is both a theoretical and applied field. Health psychologists employ diverse research methods. These methods include controlled randomized [[experiment]]s, [[quasi-experiments]], [[longitudinal studies]], [[time-series]] designs, [[cross-sectional studies]], [[case-control]] studies, qualitative research as well as [[action research]]. Health psychologists study a broad range of variables including [[heart disease|cardiovascular disease]], ([[cardiac psychology]]), [[smoking]] habits, the relation of [[religious beliefs]] to health, [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] use, social support, living conditions, emotional state, social class, and more. Some health psychologists treat individuals with sleep problems, headaches, alcohol problems, etc. Other health psychologists work to empower community members by helping community members gain control over their health and improve quality of life of entire communities.

==Origins and development==

Psychological factors in health had been studied since the early 20th century by disciplines such as [[psychosomatic medicine]] and later [[behavioral medicine]], but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology. Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine of the effect of behavior on health. For example, the [[Alameda County Study]], which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained a healthy weight, received adequate sleep, did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer.&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, N., &amp; Breslow, L. (1972). Relationship of physical health status and health practices. ''Preventive Medicine, 1''(3), 409-421.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones.&lt;ref name = "Sterling and Eyer"&gt;Sterling, P., &amp; Eyer, J. (1981). Biological basis of stress-related mortality. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine. Part E, Medical Psychology, 15''(1), 3-42.&lt;/ref&gt; These discoveries include a better understanding of the impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems,&lt;ref name = "Sterling and Eyer"/&gt; and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.&lt;ref&gt;Ader, R. &amp; Cohen, N. (1975). Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 37''(4), 333–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have been working in medical settings for many years (in the UK sometimes the field was termed [[medical psychology]]). Medical psychology, however, was a relatively small field, primarily aimed at helping patients adjust to illness. In 1969, William Schofield prepared a report for the APA entitled ''The Role of Psychology in the Delivery of Health Services''.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, W. (1969). The role of psychology in the delivery of health services. ''American Psychologist, 24(6),'' 565-584.&lt;/ref&gt; While there were exceptions, he found that the psychological research of the time frequently regarded mental health and physical health as separate, and devoted very little attention to psychology's impact upon physical health. One of the few psychologists working in this area at the time, Schofield proposed new forms of education and training for future psychologists. The APA, responding to his proposal, in 1973 established a task force to consider how psychologists could (a) help people to manage their health-related behaviors, (b) help patients manage their physical health problems, and (c) train healthcare staff to work more effectively with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M., Weinman, J. &amp; Chater, A. (2011). A healthy contribution. ''The Psychologist, 24''(12), 890-892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by [[Joseph Matarazzo]], in 1977, APA added a division devoted to health psychology. At the first divisional conference, Matarazzo delivered a speech that played an important role in defining health psychology. He defined the new field in this way, "Health psychology is the aggregate of the specific educational, scientific and professional contributions of the discipline of psychology to the promotion and maintenance of health, the prevention and treatment of illness, the identification of diagnostic and etiologic correlates of health, illness and related dysfunction, and the analysis and improvement of the healthcare system and health policy formation."&lt;ref&gt;Matarazzo, J. D.  (1980). Behavioral health and behavioral medicine:  Frontiers for a new health psychology. ''American Psychologist, 35,'' 807-818.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, similar organizations were established elsewhere. In 1986, the BPS established a Division of Health Psychology. The European Health Psychology Society was also established in 1986. Similar organizations were established in other countries, including Australia and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Belar, C. D., Mendonca McIntyre, T. &amp; Matarazzo, J. D. (2003). Health psychology. In D. K. Freedheim &amp; I. Weiner (Eds.), ''Handbook of Psychology. Vol.1: History of Psychology.'' New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Universities began to develop doctoral level training programs in health psychology. In the US, post-doctoral level health psychology training programs were established for individuals who completed a doctoral degree in clinical psychology.

A number of relevant trends coincided with the emergence of health psychology, including:
*Epidemiological evidence  linking behavior and health.&lt;ref name='BPS3'&gt;Johnson, M., Weinman, J., &amp; Chater, A. (2011) A healthy Contribution. Health Psychology, 24 (12) 890-902&lt;/ref&gt;
*The addition of behavioral science to medical school curricula, with courses often taught by psychologists.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*The training of health professionals in communication skills, with the aim of improving patient satisfaction and adherence to medical treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;
*Increasing numbers of interventions based on psychological theory (e.g., [[behavior modification]]).&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*An increased understanding of  the interaction between psychological and physiological factors leading to the emergence of [[psychophysiology]] and [[psychoneuroimmunology]] (PNI).&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; 
*The health domain having become a target of research by social psychologists interested in testing theoretical models linking beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M., &amp; Ajzen, I. (1975). ''Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research.'' Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergence of [[AIDS/HIV]], and the increase in funding for behavioral research the epidemic provoked.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;

In the UK, the BPS’s reconsideration of the role of the Medical Section prompted the emergence of health psychology as a distinct field. Marie Johnston and John Weinman argued in a letter to the ''BPS Bulletin'' that there was a great need for a Health Psychology Section. In December 1986 the section was established at the BPS London Conference, with Marie Johnston as chair.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt; At the Annual BPS Conference in 1993 a review of "Current Trends in Health Psychology" was organized, and a definition of health psychology as "the study of psychological and behavioural processes in health, illness and healthcare" was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, M. (1994). Health psychology:Current trends. The Psychologist, 7,114–118.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Health Psychology Section  became a Special Group in 1993 and was awarded divisional status within the UK  in 1997. The awarding of divisional status meant that the individual training needs and professional practice of health psychologists were recognized, and  members were able to obtain chartered status with the BPS. The BPS went on to regulate training and practice in health psychology until  the regulation of professional standards and qualifications was taken over by statutory registration with the [[Health Professions Council]] in 2010.&lt;ref name='BPS3' /&gt;

==Objectives==

===Understanding behavioral and contextual factors===
Health psychologists conduct research to identify behaviors and experiences that promote health, give rise to illness, and influence the effectiveness of health care. They also recommend ways to improve health care policy.&lt;ref&gt;Sharman, S.J.; Garry, M.; Jacobsen, J.A.; Loftus, E.F.; &amp; Ditto, P.H. (2008). False memories for end-of-life decisions. ''Health Psychology'', 27, 291–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists have worked on developing ways to reduce smoking&lt;ref&gt;Dusseldorp, E.; van Elderen, T.; &amp; Maes, S.; [[Jacqueline Meulman|Meulman, J.]] &amp; Kraaij, V. (1999). A meta-analysis of psychoeducational programs for coronary heart disease patients. ''Health Psychology'', 18, 506–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and improve daily nutrition&lt;ref&gt;Resnicow, K.; Jackson, A.; Blissett, D.; Wang, T.; McCarty, F.; Rahotep, S.; &amp; Periasamy, S. (2005). Results of the Healthy Body Healthy Spirit Trial. ''Health Psychology'', 24, 339–48.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote health and prevent illness. They have also studied the association between illness and individual characteristics. For example, health psychology has found a relation between the personality characteristics of thrill seeking, impulsiveness, hostility/anger, emotional instability, and depression, on one hand, and high-risk driving, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Beirness, D.J. (1993). Do we really drive as we live? The role of personality factors in road crashes. ''Alcohol, Drugs &amp; Driving'', 9, 129–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychology is also concerned with contextual factors, including economic, cultural, community, social, and lifestyle factors that influence health&lt;ref name = "Simandan"/&gt;. The [[biopsychosocial model]] can help in understanding the relation between contextual factors and biology in affecting health&lt;ref name = "Martire"&gt;Martire, L.M. and Franks, M.M., 2014. The role of social networks in adult health: Introduction to the special issue. Health Psychology, 33(6), pp.501-504.&lt;/ref&gt;. Physical addiction impedes smoking cessation. Some research suggests that seductive advertising also contributes to psychological dependency on tobacco,&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, J.P.; &amp; Gilpin, E.A. (1995). A historical analysis of tobacco marketing and the uptake of smoking by youth in the United States: 1890–1977. ''Health Psychology'', 14, 500–508.&lt;/ref&gt; although other research has found no relationship between media exposure and smoking in youth.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson C.J. &amp; Meehan, D.C. (2011). With friends like these...: Peer delinquency influences across age cohorts on smoking, alcohol and illegal substance use. ''European Psychiatry'', 26(1), 6–12.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP research indicates that people in jobs that combine little decision latitude with a high psychological workload are at increased risk for [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenström, T., Hintsanen, M., Jokela, M., Keltikangas-Järvinen, L., Kivimäki, M., Juonala, M., &amp; ... Viikari, J. S. (2011). Change in job strain and progression of atherosclerosis: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 16''(1), 139-150. {{doi|10.1037/a0021752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J.V., Stewart, W., Hall, E.M., Fredlund, P., &amp; Theorell, T. (1996). Long-term psychosocial work environment and cardiovascular mortality among Swedish men. ''American Journal of Public Health, 86''(3), 324–31. {{doi|10.2105/AJPH.86.3.324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other OHP research reveals a relation between unemployment and elevations in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Ilies, R., Dimotakis, N., &amp; Watson, D. (2010). Mood, blood pressure, and heart rate at work: An experience-sampling study. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 15''(2), 120-130. {{doi|10.1037/a0018350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasl, S.V. &amp; Cobb, S. (1970). Blood pressure changes in men undergoing job loss: A preliminary report. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 32''(1), 19–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiologic research documents a relation between social class and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;Marmot, M.G. &amp; Theorell, T. (1988). Social class and cardiovascular disease: The contribution of work. ''International Journal of Health Services, 18'', 659–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists also aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens (also see [[health action process approach]]). Health psychologists employ [[cognitive behavior therapy]] and [[applied behavior analysis]] (also see [[behavior modification]]) for that purpose.

===Preventing illness===
Health psychologists promote health through behavioral change, as mentioned above; however, they attempt to prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people to make changes in their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive [[emotional]] states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, C.K.; Jamner, L.D.; Henker, B. &amp; Delfino, R.J. (2001). Smoking and moods in adolescents with depressive and aggressive dispositions: Evidence from surveys and electronic diaries. ''Health Psychology'', 20, 99–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is [[anti-smoking campaign]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, J.C.; Niederdeppe, J. &amp; Evans, W.D. (2005). The theory of 'truth': How counterindustry campaigns affect smoking behavior among teens. ''Health Psychology'', 24, 22–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists help to promote health and well-being by preventing illness.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why some people do not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways to encourage people to have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt; Health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

Health psychologists also aim at educating health professionals, including physicians and nurses, in communicating effectively with patients in ways that overcome barriers to understanding, remembering, and implementing effective strategies for reducing exposures to risk factors and making health-enhancing behavior changes.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, J.; Bavalia, K.; Bull, M.; Frankum, S.; Goldie, C.; Gosslau, M.; et al. (2004) 'I want more time with my doctor': A quantitative study of time and the consultation. ''Family Practice'', 21, 479–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence from OHP that stress-reduction interventions at the workplace can be effective. For example, Kompier and his colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Kompier, M.A.J.; Aust, B.; van den Berg, A.-M. &amp; Siegrist, J. (2000). Stress prevention in bus drivers: Evaluation of 13 natural experiments. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology'', 5, 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that a number of interventions aimed at reducing stress in bus drivers has had beneficial effects for employees and bus companies.

===The effects of disease===
Health psychologists investigate how disease affects individuals' psychological well-being. An individual who becomes seriously ill or injured faces many different practical stressors. These stressors include problems meeting medical and other bills, problems obtaining proper care when home from the hospital, obstacles to caring for dependents, the experience of having one's sense of self-reliance compromised, gaining a new, unwanted identity as that of a sick person, and so on. These stressors can lead to depression, reduced self-esteem, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cassileth, B.R.; Lusk, E.J.; Strouse, T.B.; Miller, D.S.; Brown, L.L.; Cross, P.A. &amp; Tenaglia, A.N. (1984). Psychosocial status in chronic illness. ''New England Journal of Medicine, 311'', 506–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychology also concerns itself with bettering the lives of individuals with [[terminal illness]]. When there is little hope of recovery, health psychologist therapists can improve the quality of life of the patient by helping the patient recover at least some of his or her psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Lander, D.A. &amp; Graham-Pole, J.R. (2008). Love medicine for the dying and their caregivers: The body of evidence. ''Journal of Health Psychology, 13'', 201–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists are also concerned with providing therapeutic services for the bereaved.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J.M.; Forrest, L.M. &amp; Austin, A.E. (2002). Death of a partner: Perspectives of heterosexual and gay men. ''Journal of Health Psychology, 7'', 317–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical analysis of health policy===
Critical health psychologists explore how health policy can influence inequities, inequalities and social injustice &lt;ref name = "Martire"/&gt;. These avenues of research expand the scope of health psychology beyond the level of individual health to an examination of the social and economic determinants of health both within and between regions and nations. The individualism of mainstream health psychology has been critiqued and deconstructed by critical health psychologists using qualitative methods that zero in on the health experience.&lt;ref name="Marks, D.F. 2011"&gt;Marks, D.F., Murray, M., Evans, B., &amp; Estacio, E.V. (2011). [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233714?contribId=516262&amp; ''Health psychology. Theory-research-practice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006160053/http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book233714?contribId=516262&amp; |date=2011-10-06 }} (3rd Ed.) Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conducting research===
Like psychologists in the other main psychology disciplines, health psychologists have advanced knowledge of research methods. Health psychologists apply this knowledge to conduct research on a variety of questions.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; For example, health psychologists carry out research to answer questions such as: 
* What influences healthy eating?
* How is stress linked to heart disease? 
* What are the emotional effects of genetic testing?
* How can we change people’s health behavior to improve their health?&lt;ref name='BPS' /&gt;

===Teaching and communication===
{{main|Health communication}}

Health psychologists can also be responsible for training other health professionals on how to deliver interventions to help promote healthy eating, stopping smoking, weight loss, etc. Health psychologists also train other health professionals in communication skills such as how to break bad news or support behavior change for the purpose of improving adherence to treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;

==Applications==

===Improving doctor–patient communication===
Health psychologists aid the process of communication between physicians and patients during medical consultations. There are many problems in this process, with patients showing a considerable lack of understanding of many medical terms, particularly anatomical terms (e.g., intestines).&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, C.M. (1970). Difference between patients' and doctors' interpretation of some common medical terms. ''British Medical Journal, 2'', 286–89.&lt;/ref&gt; One area of research on this topic involves "doctor-centered" or "patient-centered" consultations. Doctor-centered consultations are generally directive, with the patient answering questions and playing less of a role in decision-making. Although this style is preferred by elderly people and others, many people dislike the sense of hierarchy or ignorance that it inspires. They prefer patient-centered consultations, which focus on the patient's needs, involve the doctor listening to the patient completely before making a decision, and involving the patient in the process of choosing treatment and finding a diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Dowsett, S.M., Saul, J.L., Butow, P.N., Dunn, S.M., Boyer, M.J., Findlow, R., &amp; Dunsmore, J. (2000). Communication styles in the cancer consultation: Preferences for a patient-centred approach. ''Psycho-Oncology, 9'', 147–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving adherence to medical advice===
Health psychologists engage in research and practice aimed at getting people to follow medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens. Patients often forget to take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects. Failing to take prescribed medication is costly and wastes millions of usable medicines that could otherwise help other people. Estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure (see below); there is, however, evidence that adherence could be improved by tailoring treatment programs to individuals' daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, M.; Hampson, S.E.; Avery, L. &amp; Simpson, R. (2004). Effects of a tailored lifestyle self-management intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes. ''British Journal of Health Psychology'', 9 (Pt 3), 365–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, traditional cognitive-behavioural therapies have been adapted for people suffering from chronic illnesses and comorbid psychological distress to include modules that encourage, support and reinforce adherence to medical advice as part of the larger treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;Safren, S., Gonzalez, J., Wexler, D., Psaros, C., Delahanty, L., Blashill, A., . . . Cagliero, E. (2014). A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adherence and Depression (CBT-AD) in Patients With Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes. Diabetes Care, 37 (3): 625-633. {{doi|10.2337/dc13-0816}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ways of measuring adherence====
Health psychologists have identified a number of ways of measuring patients' adherence to medical regimens:
* Counting the number of pills in the medicine bottle
* Using self-reports
* Using "Trackcap" bottles, which track the number of times the bottle is opened.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, P. (2002). ''Psychology in practice: Health''. London, England: Hodder &amp; Stoughton Educational.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing pain===
Health psychology attempts to find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic [[analgesia]], [[causalgia]], [[neuralgia]], and [[phantom limb pain]]. Although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, the development of the [[McGill Pain Questionnaire]]&lt;ref&gt;Melzack, R. (1975). The McGill Pain Questionnaire: Major properties and scoring methods. ''Pain, 1''(3), 277–299.&lt;/ref&gt; has helped make progress in this area. Treatments for pain involve patient-administered [[analgesia]], [[acupuncture]] (found to be effective in reducing pain for [[osteoarthritis]] of the knee&lt;ref&gt;Berman, B.; Singh B.B.; Lao, L.; Langenberg, P.; Li, H.; Hadhazy, V.; Bareta, J. &amp; Hochberg, M. (1999). A randomized trial of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy in osteoarthritis of the knee. ''Rheumatology, 38''(4), 346–54.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[biofeedback]], and [[cognitive behavior therapy]].

===Health psychologist roles===
Below are some examples of the types of positions held by health psychologists within applied settings such as the UK's NHS and private practice.
*'''Consultant health psychologist''': A consultant health psychologist will take a lead for health psychology within public health, including managing tobacco control and smoking cessation services and providing professional leadership in the management of health trainers.&lt;ref name='BPS1'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). Health psychology: A guide for employees.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Principal health psychologist''': A principal  health psychologist could, for example lead the health psychology service within one of the UK’s leading heart and lung hospitals, providing a clinical service to patients and advising all members of the multidisciplinary team.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Health psychologist''': An example of a health psychologist's role would be to provide health psychology input to a center for weight management. Psychological assessment of treatment, development and delivery of a tailored weight management program, and advising on approaches to improve adherence to health advice and medical treatment.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Research psychologist''': Research health psychologists carry out health psychology research, for example, exploring the psychological impact of receiving a diagnosis of dementia, or evaluating ways of providing psychological support for people with burn injuries. Research can also be in the area of health promotion, for example investigating the determinants of healthy eating or physical activity or understanding why people misuse substances.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
* '''Health psychologist in training/assistant health psychologist''': As an assistant/in training, a health psychologist will gain experience assessing patients, delivering psychological interventions to change health behaviors, and conducting research, whilst being supervised by a qualified health psychologist.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;

==Training==
{{See also|List of universities with health psychology programs}}

In the UK, health psychologists are registered by the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC) and have trained to a level to be eligible for full membership of the Division of Health Psychology within the BPS.&lt;ref name='BPS2'&gt;The British Psychological Society. (2011). ''Health Psychology in applied settings: A guide for employers''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Registered health psychologists who are chartered with the BPS will have undertaken a minimum of six years of training and will have specialized in health psychology for a minimum of three years.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; Health psychologists in training must have completed BPS stage 1 training and be registered with the BPS Stage 2 training route or with a BPS-accredited university doctoral health psychology program. Once qualified, health psychologists can work in a range of settings, for example the NHS, universities, schools, private healthcare, and research and charitable organizations.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; A health psychologist in training might be working within applied settings while working towards registration and chartered status.&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt; A health psychologist will have demonstrated competencies in all of the following areas:
* professional skills (including implementing ethical and legal standards, communication, and teamwork),
* research skills (including designing, conducting, and analyzing psychological research in numerous areas),
* consultancy skills (including planning and evaluation),
* teaching and training skills (including knowledge of designing, delivering, and evaluating large and small scale training program),
* intervention skills (including delivery and evaluation of behavior change interventions).&lt;ref name='BPS1' /&gt;
All qualified health psychologists must also engage in and record their [[continuing professional development]] (CPD) for psychology each year throughout their career.&lt;ref name= 'BPS2' /&gt;

The Bakhtiari settlement was named Bakhtiari region, after the rule of the Safavids, and the geography of the Lorestan name was limited to the present provinces of Lorestan and Ilam. The area was also divided into two parts: Poshtkuh and Pishkuh, in the Qajar dynasty. Today, Lorestan is the name of one of the western provinces of Iran.

== Origin ==
There are several disputes over the origin of the Lurs and they are believed to be from the Elamite and Kassite origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Medean or Persian tribe of Aryan origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/iran/lurs-iran |title=The Lurs of Iran |publisher=Cultural Survival |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nowadays they speak an Iranian language and consider themselves as pure Iranians.
=== Name ===
The first sighting of the word Lur is in the writings of some historians and geographers of the 10th century and later in the form of اللور, اللر and لور (Lur). [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] in [[Tarikh-i guzida|Tarikh-e gozida]] (1330 AD) referred to the settlement of Lurish tribes in Levant and then their mass migration towards the current Lurish-inhabited areas. There are several hypothesis that discuss the origin of the name Lur or Lor, prominent amongst them is its attribution to a person called Lur or Lohraseb and some believe that the name refers to the area of first settlement of this ethnic group. The word Ler or Lir (literally Forst or forest mountain) is a probable source for this word.&lt;ref&gt;H.Mostawfi. 2000. Tarikhe Gozide (in Persian). Amir Kabir Publications, Tehran&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early History ==
Luristan is mainly a mountainous juicy and lush area with prosperous  pasturages.  There are several dominant tree species like oak, elm, walnut and almond around Luristan.[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Cave painting]] in Doushe cave, Lorestan, Iran, 8th millennium BC]]
[[File:Disc-headed pin zoom (2) Bronze Beaker Luristan 1000 BC (Rietberg museum).JPG|thumb|right|200px|Zoom of a disc-headed pin (pin, female figure). Found in Lorestan, [[Rietberg Museum]], [[Zürich]]]]
The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the [[Ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The [[Kassites]], an ancient people who spoke neither an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] nor a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]], originated in Lorestān. They would control [[Babylonia]] after the fall of the [[Old Babylonian Empire]] ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC.
Iranian [[Medes]] invaded and settled in Luristan in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes absorbed the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the [[Kassites]] as well as the [[Gutians]], by the time the area was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the 1st millennium BC.
In February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the [[Achaemenid]] era were made in Lorestan for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82418319/ | title=Archeologist: First signs of Achaemenids discovered in Western Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Aryan settlement in Luristan, precedes more than 1000 years BC. From the Indo-European ethnic groups, first, the Medes settled in areas known as Lorestan. Between 625 and 700 BC, other tribes like the Scythians settled in Lorestan.
=== Elam ===
The first people who ruled areas of Lorestan were Elamites. The extent of the influence of the Elamites has been to the present Mamassani area. They were indigenous peoples of Iran, but there is no proper knowledge of how communities are formed and the beginning of their history. However, They were able to establish a state before the arrival of Aryan ethnic groups in parts of western Iran.&lt;ref name=loor1&gt;{{یادکرد وب| نشانی = http://loor.ir/News.asp?nid=2970&amp;ln=fa| عنوان = آیا لر آریاییست یا عیلامی و کاسی؟| تاریخ بازدید =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴| نویسنده =| تاریخ =۲۶ شهریور ۱۳۸۹| ناشر =نشریه اینترنتی مردم لر| زبان =فارسی| نشانی بایگانی = https://archive.today/Waga| تاریخ بایگانی =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elam government included Khuzestan, modern Lorestan, Poshtkuh (Ilam provice and some western Iraqi areas), Bakhtiari mountains and Southern Lurish settelment. Babylonians called the land of Elamites Elam or Elamto, meaning "the mountain" and perhaps "the land of sunrise".
Elamite is generally accepted to be a [[language isolate]] and thus unrelated to the much later arriving Persian and Iranic languages. In accordance to geographical and archaeological matching, historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto-[[Lurs]], whose language became [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] only in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite#v=onepage&amp;q=proto-lurs%20elamite&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grugni&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grugni | first1 = V | last2 = Battaglia | first2 = V | last3 = Hooshiar Kashani | first3 = B | last4 = Parolo | first4 = S | last5 = Al-Zahery | first5 = N ''et al.

==== Elamite cities ====
The major cities of the Elamites were Shush, Ahvaz, Madakto and Kheidalou. [[Walther Hinz]] believes that the current KhorramAbad in the era of the Elamites was the capital of a dynasty called Simashki.
In the course of several thousand years, the Elamites maintained their identity against strong tribes such as [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadians]], [[Babylonians]], and [[Assyrians]].
Eventually, they were defeated by their enemy of Assyria in 654 BC because of internal disputes and wars.
The rise of the Elamites and the formation of the Elamite government in the north of Khuzestan plain is the most important political event of Iran in the third millennium BC. Since then, before the arrival of the Medes and Persians, what we know from the history of the land of Iran is only the political history of Elamite.

=== Kassites ===
Kassites entered to the Iranian plateau from the highlands of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan before the Aryan migration and then settled  the southwest of Iran. Kassites along with Elam, dominated parts of Lorestan and had an extraordinary skill in making bronze artifacts. They were considered as the most important Zagros mountain tribes and were engaged to livestock breeding. They spoke in a language that was affiliated with Elamite.
They were brave and warrior riders and repeatedly entered into battle with their neighbors, including Elamites and Babylonians. They even managed to overthrow the government of Babylon and ruled theBabylon for six centuries. The rule of the Kassites in Babylonia ended as a result of their defeat from the Elamites. After the defeat from the Elamites, they returned to their mountainous land of Lorestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://pardis.150m.com/kassi572.pdf |عنوان =قوم کاسی | ناشر =مهدی رازانی |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۳ آذر ۱۳۹۱}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =گرانتوسگی |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از زمان باستان تا امروز| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۴۵}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =پیگولووسکایا |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از عهد باستان تا قرن ۱۸| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۵۳}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achaemenids to Sassanids ===
During the rule of Achaemenid, Lorestan was part of the rule of the Kassites and when the Achaemenids moved from Babylon to Hamadan, they had to cross the Lorestan area and pay ransom to the Kassites.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=4454 |عنوان =جبال (۱) (جمع جَبَل) یا کورة جَبَل یا قُهِستان یا قوهستان (معرّب کوهستان) یا بلاد جبال | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahle was the name of a vast land in west of Iran which was included many cities and areas in the current Zagros. The province of Pahla was named after the Sasanian times and the word Pahlavi refers to the people, the language, and the alphabet related to the this region. At the time of the Achaemenids, the current Lorestan, along with Ilam and Khuzestan, were the third state of this great empire. During the Parthian period, this land was one of the Satraps (states) of this dynasty anf finally, during the Sassanid period, the area was named "Pahla".&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2899 |عنوان =پَهلَوی | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of several resistance efforts, the Arab conquest of Iran, led to the end of the Sasanid Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran. Iran (including Lurish territory) was under the absolute sovereignty of Arabs for two centuries. Lur people, however, managed to maintain the language and many of their customs. Until the end of the third century AH, the district of Lorestan paid the taxes to Kufa and was directly governed by the Caliphs. Different free-seeking revolts led to gradual reestablishment of Iranian local dynasties in the beginning of the ninth century.
After the Arab dominance, Luristan was under control of [[Hasanwayhids]], [[Buyids]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqids]], respectively.

By the middle of the tenth century, the total Lurish-inhabited areas were known as Luristan. Along with the gradual weakening of Seljuks, several autonomous atabeg were formed across Iran. Luristan Atabegs or Hazaraspids established an autonomous state in the Lurish-inhabited areas. After that, the territory was divided into two parts: Lur-e-kuchek (Minor Luristan) and Lur-e-bozorg (Major Luristan). The former corresponded to modern Luristan and Ilam provinces and some areas in the current western Iraq while the latter included modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluye-Boir Ahmed, Mamasani and some coastal areas in Bushehr. In spite of all these invasions, the Lurs maintained their territorial integrity, absorbed the invaders, and eventually established two local dynasties known as Atabak or Atabeg during the twelfth century.
Hazaraspids (Atabaks of Luristan) is the name of Lur dynasty that ruled a large area of Iran for a long while (1148–1424). Their territory included almost all the current Lurish-inhabited regions. Luristan Atabeg then divided in two Atabegs; the Minor Luristan (Lore kučak) and the Major Luristan (Lore bozorg) with Khorram Abad and Idaj as their capitals, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazaraspids |عنوان =هزاراسپیان | ناشر =دانشنامه ایرانیکا |تاریخ  = |تاریخ بازدید =‎۶ آبان ۱۳۸۹|زبان=انگلیسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lor-e-Bozorg (Major Luristan) ===
A big  part of the Lurish areas came under the control of a local dynasty known as Lur-e bozorg Atabegs during the twelfth century. It was established in 1155 AD. The area under the control of major Luristan rulers (modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmed, Mamasani and parts of Khuzistan, Bushehr and Isfahan provinces) was included a vast territory extending from the Dez River in the north Khuzistan to the central areas of [[Fars province|Fars]] in the southern Iran. In spite of evidences indicating the economic and social proserity, the Atabak dynasty finally extinct by [[Ibrahim Sultan ibn Shahrukh]] invasion in 1423. As a result, the territorial unity and the economic prosperity of the Major Luristan was terminated. The territory was divided into tribal sectins without a centralized coherence. During the Safavid period (1501–1750), Major Luristan was divided into three parts: the northern part became known as [[Bkhtiari people|Bakhtiari]], the central part as [[Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad|Kuhgilu]], and the southern part as [[Mamasani County|Mamasani]].

=== Lor-e-Kuchek (Minor Luristan) ===
Traditionally the Minor Luristan corresponded to current provinces of Luristan and Ilam and some Feyli-inhabited areas in Iraq (belt of mountainous region stretching from the plains of the Tigris in the west to the Diz River in the east).Shojaeddin Khorshid establshed the dynasty as the Atabakan-i-Luristan, which lasted from 1184 to 1597. The rulers established their capital in Khorramabad (currently the provincial capital of [[Luristan province]].

==== Lurish Walies dynasty ====
The Atabak dynasty was replaced by the Wali dynasty (1596–1929). The founder of the new dynasty was Husain Khan, whose father had married the aunt of the last Atabak, and on the basis of this kinship tie Husain Khan later received the position of ruler of Lur-j-kuchek. The Walis played a significant role in the political affairs of Iran. They guarded southwestern Iran against the Ottomans, who constantly attacked the western and southwestern borders of the country. Ali Mardan Khan was appointed the commander-in-chief of the entire Iranian armed forces dur downfall of the Safavids, when the country was invaded by the Afghans in the early eighteenth century (De Bode 1845).

The reign of the Walis coincided with several dynasties of Iran including: Safavid (1501–1736), Afshar (1736–1750), Zand (1750–1794), Qajar (1796–1925) and the beginning of the Pahlavi(1924–1929). The last two dynasties, namely the Qajar and Pahlavi, are responsible for the political weakness of the Lurs and the decline of the Wali dynasty. Thus, the Lurs maintained their political integrity under the Safavids and Afshars, while they ruled over Iran during the Zand dynasty. However, when the Qajars came to power, they divided Lur-i-kuchek into two parts, Luristan and Posht-kuh. From this time on, the domain of the Walis was limited to Posht-kuh only, while Luristan came under the direct control of the central government. Thus, a governor-general, usually a member of the royal family, was appointed by the king and sent to Luristan. Yet during the Qajar dynasty, Luristan was continually in a state of anarchy. The Qajars were unable to subdue the tribes of Luristan and hence, except for some short periods, there was no peace in Luristan. As a matter of fact, the Qajar dynasty lost total control over Luristan after the assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1896. In short, the division of Lur-i-kuchek by the Qajar dynasty weakened the political strength of the Walis and reduced the Lurs' political influence. Furthermore, the inability of the Qajars to establish law and order in Luristan contributed to the expansion of pastoral nomadism and the destruction of settled communities. Consequently, Luristan suffered politically as well as economically under Qajar rule.

The Qajar dynasty was overthrown by Reza Khan, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, in 1925. The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) is best characterized as a dictatorial monarchy with absolute rule, that is, the concentration of power in the monarch's hands. The regime built an army whose strength was without precedent in the history of Iran. The army was used against Lurs and other groups who refused to give up their power to the new regime. Through bloody confrontations between the new monarch and the Lurs (as well as other peoples in Iran), the Pahlavi dynasty eventually crushed the powers of the Lurs. Thus, Reza Shah ended the Wali dynasty of Posht-kuh, executed or exiled many of the Lur leaders, forcefully sedentarized the nomadic pastoral tribes and changed the territorial integrity of Lur-i-kuchek.

== Modern history ==
=== The Lurs under the Pahlavi Regime ===

While the Qajar dynasty was responsible for the spread of anarchy among the Lurs, the Pahlavi-dynasty was responsible for their political disorganization, social disruption and the loss of political freedom and semi-independent status. For the first time in their long history, the Lurs were stripped of their traditional rights and political freedom by the Pahlavi dynasty. When Reza Shah took power, he established a centralized government, transferring power from the provincial communities to Tehran. He carried out his plan through the use of military operations against various provincial communities, including the Lurs. A key element to Reza Shah's success was that the Lurs were not unified so he could attack each group separately. Furthermore, Reza Shah used one tribe to fight against another. As the Lurs were defeated, Reza Shah took the following measures to keep them under control: 1) tribal leaders were removed from their positions of authority and were replaced by military officials, 2) many of the leaders, were executed, imprisoned or exiled to other parts of Iran, 3) some tribes were exiled to distant lands, 4) all pastoral nomadic tribes, which formed the majority of the Lur population, were forceably sedentarized without sufficient provisions, 5) all tribesmen were disarmed, 6) the use of the traditional black tent was outlawed, 7) tribesmen were ordered to abandon their traditional costume and were forced to wear Western clothes; however, this rule was not totally carried out, and 8) governmental offices were established in order to carry out the state policies.

The above policies were intended to subjugate the Lurs to the central government. Reza Shah altered the traditional sociopolitical organization of the Lurs without providing opportunities for their participation in local or national government. Undoubtedly the establishment of the central state demanded the integration of various regions and ethnic groups. However, that need not entail political deprivation and the lack of respect for members of the different tribal or ethnic groups. Under the Pahlavi regime, however, the establishment of the modern state came to mean precisely that – the expansion of state domination and disruption of the traditional political organization without the slightest opportunity for peoples to participate in local or national politics.

Reza Shah was deposed by the British and Russians in 1941, and was replaced by his son Mohammed Reza Shah, who ruled from 1941 to 1979. The reign of Mohammed Reza Shah witnessed further centralization of state power and the disintegration of traditional political organization among the Lurs. The enforcement of the land reform program and the nationalization of the forests and pastureland (1962–63 along with various forces of modernization including the expansion of capitalism, urbanism and modern schooling gradually changed many aspects of the Lurs' culture.

Under the Pahlavi regime, the Lurs lost their freedom and their semi-independent status, and the Lurs' territories were divided into several administrative units without any regard for traditional boundaries. For instance, Lur-i-kuchek has been limited to modern Luristan while Posht-kuh, formerly ruled by the Wali dynasty, was incorporated into Ilam province. The most dramatic change caused by the Pahlavi regime was the loss of freedom and the semi-independent status of the Lurs. Prior to the establishment of the Pahlavi Regime, basic decisions were made within the local communities. For instance, the Bakhtiari was ruled by a local dynasty who paid certain tributes to the central government, while internal affairs were taken care of by the members of that dynasty. In Luristan, each tribal group acted as a semi-independent unit. In Posht-kuh, the Walis were supreme, while the tribes of Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed and those of Mamasani also enjoyed the same internal freedom. The Pahlavi regime, however, sent high-ranking officials from Tehran to supervise the Lur territories. Just prior to the recent revolution, all governors-general were directly appointed by the Shah without taking into consideration the existence of the Lurs' communities. Lurs, like other Iranians, were prohibited from organizing political parties, forming associations or expressing themselves through mass media and public gatherings.

Second, Iranian oil is extracted from the mountain slopes of Luristan, Bakhtiari and Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed provinces, but the Lurs were deprived from their share of oil revenue, particularly during the reign of Mohammed Reza Shah. The money derived from oil went to the pockets of the Tehranis, creating regional economic inequalities.

Third, despite the fact that the Pahlavi regime provided elementary and, to some extent, secondary education for the Lurs, it failed to provide them with opportunities for higher education. Until a few years prior to the revolution, not a single institution of higher education was established among the Lurs, nor were they given scholarships or financial support. The Pahlavi regime was thus responsible for depriving the Lurs of access to higher and prestigious positions. High-ranking Lur families were the only exceptions; they could afford to send their children to universities either in Iran or outside the country.

Modern education was used during the Pahlavi rule as a way to undermine local cultural values. School curriculum was prepared in Tehran without taking the cultural diversity among the Iranian peoples into consideration. Not a single course in the entire elementary, high school or university curricula reflected the history, geography or sociocultural values of the Lurs.

In sum, the Lurs lost their sociopolitical integrity under the Pahlavi dynasty. They were integrated into the "modern" state without any opportunity for effective participation in the decision-making process that affected their lives.

=== The Lurs under the Islamic Regime ===

It is too early to evaluate the sociopolitical conditions of the Lurs under the present regime. So far, political parties, associations and local newspapers have not yet emerged. Administrative boundaries of the Lurs' territories remain unchanged from those of the Pahlavi regime. While it is difficult to speculate about the future of the Lurs under the current regime, considering the fact that the present regime is concerned more with an Islamic community rather than with a country of diverse ethnic groups, it seems unlikely that there will be considerable change in the near future.

The '''holonomic brain theory''', developed by neuroscientist [[Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram]] initially in collaboration with physicist [[David Bohm]], is a model of human [[cognition]] that describes the brain as a [[hologram|holographic]] storage network.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt; Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in the brain's fine-fibered dendritic webs, which are different from the more commonly known action potentials involving axons and synapses.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandervert/&gt; These oscillations are waves and create [[wave interference]] patterns in which memory is encoded naturally, and the waves may be analyzed by a [[Fourier transform]].&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vandervert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berger D.H., Pribram K.H. | year = 1992 | title = The Relationship between the Gabor elementary function and a stochastic model of the inter-spike interval distribution in the responses of the visual cortex neurons | url = | journal = Biological Cybernetics | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 191–194 | doi=10.1007/bf00201026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pribram2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K.H. | year = 2004 | title = Consciousness Reassessed | url = | journal = Mind and Matter | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 7–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabor, Pribram and others noted the similarities between these brain processes and the storage of information in a hologram, which can also be analyzed with a Fourier transform.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gabor1972/&gt; In a hologram, any part of the hologram with sufficient size contains the whole of the stored information. In this theory, a piece of a long-term memory is similarly distributed over a dendritic arbor so that each part of the dendritic network contains all the information stored over the entire network.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gabor1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=Borsellino/&gt; This model allows for important aspects of human consciousness, including the fast associative [[memory]] that allows for connections between different pieces of stored information and the [[Distributed representation|non-locality]] of memory storage (a specific memory is not stored in a specific location, i.e. a certain neuron).&lt;ref name=Forsdyke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokkon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gabor1968&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gabor D | year = 1968 | title = Holographic Model of Temporal Recall | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = | page = 584 | doi=10.1038/217584a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==
In 1946 [[Dennis Gabor]] invented the hologram mathematically, describing a system where an image can be reconstructed through information that is stored throughout the hologram.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K. H., Meade S. D. | year = 1999 | title = Conscious awareness: Processing in the synaptodendritic web | url = | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 205–214 | doi = 10.1016/S0732-118X(99)00024-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated that the information pattern of a three-dimensional object can be encoded in a beam of light, which is more-or-less two-dimensional. Gabor also developed a mathematical model for demonstrating a [[holographic associative memory]].&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kelly M. A. |author2=Blostein D. |author3=Mewhort D. J. K. | year = 2013 | title = Encoding structure in holographic reduced representations | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 79–93 | doi=10.1037/a0030301}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Gabor's colleagues, Pieter Jacobus Van Heerden, also developed a related holographic mathematical memory model in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1963 | title = A New Optical Method of Storing and Retrieving Information | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 387–392 | doi = 10.1364/AO.2.000387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1963 | title = Theory of Optical Information Storage in Solids | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 393–400 | doi = 10.1364/AO.2.000393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VanHeerden&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1970 | title = Models for the brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = 5228| pages = 177–178 | doi=10.1038/225177a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model contained the key aspect of non-locality, which became important years later when, in 1967, experiments by both [[Valentino Braitenberg|Braitenberg]] and Kirschfield showed that exact localization of memory in the brain was false.&lt;ref name=Borsellino&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borsellino A., Poggio T. | year = 1972 | title = Holographic aspects of temporal memory and optomotor responses | url = | journal = Kybernetik | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 58–60 | doi=10.1007/bf00288785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Pribram had worked with psychologist [[Karl Lashley]] on Lashley's [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] experiments, which used lesions to determine the exact location of specific memories in primate brains.&lt;ref name=Forsdyke&gt;{{cite journal | author = Forsdyke D. R. | year = 2009 | title = Samuel Butler and human long term memory: Is the cupboard bare? | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 258 | issue = | pages = 156–164 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.01.028 | pmid=19490862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lashley made small lesions in the brains and found that these had little effect on memory. On the other hand, Pribram removed large areas of cortex, leading to multiple serious deficits in memory and cognitive function. Memories were not stored in a single neuron or exact location, but were spread over the entirety of a neural network. Lashley suggested that brain interference patterns could play a role in perception, but was unsure how such patterns might be generated in the brain or how they would lead to brain function.&lt;ref name=Pribram2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram H.H. | year = 2011 | title = Recollections | url = | journal = Neuroquantology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 370–374 | doi=10.14704/nq.2011.9.3.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later an article by neurophysiologist [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] described how a wave could be generated at the branching ends of pre-synaptic axons. Multiple of these waves could create interference patterns. Soon after, [[Emmett Leith]] was successful in storing visual images through the interference patterns of laser beams, inspired by Gabor's previous use of Fourier transformations to store information within a hologram.&lt;ref&gt;Emmett N. Leith and Juris Upatnieks (1965). Photography by Laser. ''Scientific American'' Volume 212, Issue 6, June 1, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; After studying the work of Eccles and that of Leith,&lt;ref name=Pribram2011/&gt; Pribram put forward the hypothesis that memory might take the form of interference patterns that resemble laser-produced holograms.&lt;ref&gt;K. Pribram (1969). The Neurophysiology of Remembering. American Volume 220, Issue 1, January 1, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist David Bohm presented his ideas of holomovement and [[Implicate Order|implicate and explicate order]].&lt;ref name=Globus&gt;{{cite journal | author = Globus G. G., O'Carroll C.

Pribram, karlhpribram.com&lt;/ref&gt; and realized that, since a hologram could store information within patterns of interference and then recreate that information when activated, it could serve as a strong metaphor for brain function.&lt;ref name=Pribram2011/&gt; Pribram was further encouraged in this line of speculation by the fact that DeValois and DeValois&lt;ref&gt;DeValois and DeValois, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; established "the spatial frequency encoding displayed by cells of the visual cortex was best described as a [[Fourier transform]] of the input pattern."&lt;ref name=Pribram87&gt;"Pribram, 1987"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory overview==

===The hologram and holonomy===
[[File:Hologram optical setup.jpg|thumbnail|Diagram of one possible hologram setup.]]
A main characteristic of a [[Holography|hologram]] is that every part of the stored information is distributed over the entire hologram.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both processes of storage and retrieval are carried out in a way described by [[Fourier transform]]ation equations.&lt;ref name=Srivastava&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srivastava V., Edwards S. F. | year = 2004 | title = A mathematical model of capacious and efficient memory that survives trauma | url = | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 333 | issue = 1–4| pages = 465–477 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a part of the hologram is large enough to contain the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]], that part can recreate the entirety of the stored image, except with more unwanted changes, called [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]].&lt;ref name=Gabor1972&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gabor D | year = 1972 | title = Holography, 1948–1971 | url = | journal = Science | volume = 177 | issue = 4046| pages = 299–313 | doi=10.1126/science.177.4046.299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogy to this is the broadcasting region of a radio antenna. In each smaller individual location within the entire area it is possible to access every channel, similar to how the entirety of the information of a hologram is contained within a part.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Another analogy of a hologram is the way sunlight illuminates objects in the visual field of an observer. It doesn't matter how narrow the beam of sunlight is. The beam always contains all the information of the object, and when conjugated by a lens of a [[camera]] or the eyeball, produces the same full three-dimensional image. The Fourier transform formula converts spatial forms to spatial wave frequencies and vice versa, as all objects are in essence [[vibration|vibratory]] structures. Different types of lenses, acting similarly to [[Lens (optics)|optic lenses]], can alter the frequency nature of information that is transferred.

This non-locality of information storage within the hologram is crucial, because even if most parts are damaged, the entirety will be contained within even a single remaining part of sufficient size. [[Karl H. Pribram|Pribram]] and others noted the similarities between an optical hologram and [[memory]] storage in the human brain. According to the holonomic brain theory, memories are stored within certain general regions, but stored non-locally within those regions.&lt;ref name=Globus/&gt;&lt;ref name=LH&gt;{{cite journal | author = Longuet-Higgins H. C. | year = 1968 | title = Holographic model of temporal recall [50] | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5123| page = 104 | doi=10.1038/217104a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the brain to maintain function and memory even when it is damaged.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;&lt;ref name=Srivastava/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baev/&gt; It is only when there exist no parts big enough to contain the whole that the memory is lost.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; This can also explain why some children retain normal intelligence when large portions of their brain—in some cases, half—are removed. It can also explain why memory is not lost when the brain is sliced in different cross-sections.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[File:Holomouse2.jpg|thumbnail|A single hologram can store 3D information in a 2D way. Such properties may explain some of the brain's abilities, including the ability to recognize objects at different angles and sizes than in the original stored memory.]]

Pribram proposed that neural holograms were formed by the diffraction patterns of oscillating electric waves within the cortex.&lt;ref name=Baev&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baev K.V. | year = 2012 | title = Solution of the Problem of Central Pattern Generators and a New Concept of Brain Functions | url = | journal = Neurophysiology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 414–432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the difference between the idea of a holonomic brain and a holographic one. Pribram does not suggest that the brain functions as a single hologram. Rather, the waves within smaller neural networks create localized holograms within the larger workings of the brain.&lt;ref name=Vandervert&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vandervert L. R. | year = 1995 | title = Chaos theory and the evolution of consciousness and mind: A thermodynamic-holographic resolution to the mind-body problem | url = | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 107–127 | doi = 10.1016/0732-118X(94)00047-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This patch holography is called holonomy or windowed Fourier transformations.

A holographic model can also account for other features of memory that more traditional models cannot. [[Hopfield network|The Hopfield memory model]] has an early memory saturation point before which memory retrieval drastically slows and becomes unreliable.&lt;ref name=Srivastava&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srivastava V., Edwards S. F. | year = 2004 | title = A mathematical model of capacious and efficient memory that survives trauma | url = | journal = Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications | volume = 333 | issue = 1–4| pages = 465–477 | doi=10.1016/j.physa.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, holographic memory models have much larger theoretical storage capacities. Holographic models can also demonstrate associative memory, store complex connections between different concepts, and resemble forgetting through [[lossy compression|"lossy storage."]]&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kelly M. A. |author2=Blostein D. |author3=Mewhort D. J. K. | year = 2013 | title = Encoding structure in holographic reduced representations | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 79–93 | doi=10.1037/a0030301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The synaptodendritic web===
[[File:Blausen 0843 SynapseTypes.png|thumb|A Few of the Various Types of Synapses]]
In classic brain theory the summation of electrical inputs to the [[dendrite]]s and soma (cell body) of a [[neuron]] either inhibit the neuron or excite it and set off an [[action potential]] down the [[axon]] to where it [[synapse]]s with the next neuron. However, this fails to account for different varieties of synapses beyond the traditional axodendritic (axon to dendrite). There is evidence for the existence of other kinds of synapses, including serial synapses and those between dendrites and soma and between different dendrites.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Many synaptic locations are functionally bipolar, meaning they can both send and receive impulses from each neuron, distributing input and output over the entire group of dendrites.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pribram K. H. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum holography: Is it relevant to brain function? | url = | journal = Information Sciences | volume = 115 | issue = 1–4| pages = 97–102 | doi = 10.1016/S0020-0255(98)10082-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes in this dendritic arbor, the network of teledendrons and dendrites, occur due to the oscillations of polarizations in the membrane of the fine-fibered dendrites, not due to the propagated nerve impulses associated with action potentials.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Pribram posits that the length of the delay of an input signal in the dendritic arbor before it travels down the axon is related to mental awareness.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter the delay the more unconscious the action, while a longer delay indicates a longer period of awareness. A study by David Alkon showed that after unconscious [[Classical Conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]] there was a proportionally greater reduction in the volume of the dendritic arbor, akin to synaptic elimination when experience increases the automaticity of an action.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Pribram and others theorize that, while unconscious behavior is mediated by impulses through nerve circuits, conscious behavior arises from microprocesses in the dendritic arbor.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt;

At the same time, the dendritic network is extremely complex, able to receive 100,000 to 200,000 inputs in a single tree, due to the large amount of branching and the many dendritic spines protruding from the branches.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Furthermore, synaptic [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] and [[depolarization]] remains somewhat isolated due to the resistance from the narrow dendritic spine stalk, allowing a polarization to spread without much interruption to the other spines. This spread is further aided intracellularly by the [[microtubules]] and extracellularly by [[neuroglia|glial cells]]. These polarizations act as waves in the synaptodendritic network, and the existence of multiple waves at once gives rise to interference patterns.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt;

===Deep and surface structure of memory===
Pribram suggests that there are two layers of cortical processing: a surface structure of separated and localized neural circuits and a deep structure of the dendritic arborization that binds the surface structure together. The deep structure contains distributed memory, while the surface structure acts as the retrieval mechanism.&lt;ref name=Pribram1999/&gt; Binding occurs through the temporal synchronization of the oscillating polarizations in the synaptodendritic web. It had been thought that binding only occurred when there was no phase lead or lag present, but a study by Saul and Humphrey found that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus do in fact produce these.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; Here phase lead and lag act to enhance sensory discrimination, acting as a frame to capture important features.&lt;ref name=Pribram1998/&gt; These [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]] are also similar to the lenses necessary for holographic functioning.

==Recent studies==
While Pribram originally developed the holonomic brain theory as an analogy for certain brain processes, several papers (including some more recent ones by Pribram himself) have proposed that the similarity between hologram and certain brain functions is more than just metaphorical, but actually structural.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others still maintain that the relationship is only analogical.&lt;ref name=Velmans&gt;{{cite journal | author = Velmans M | year = 2003 | title = Is the world in the brain, or the brain in the world? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 427–429 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x03420098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown that the same series of operations used in holographic memory models are performed in certain processes concerning temporal memory and [[optomotor response]]s. This indicates at least the possibility of the existence of neurological structures with certain holonomic properties.&lt;ref name=Borsellino&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borsellino A., Poggio T. | year = 1972 | title = Holographic aspects of temporal memory and optomotor responses | url = | journal = Kybernetik | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 58–60 | doi=10.1007/bf00288785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have demonstrated the possibility that [[biophoton]] emission (biological electrical signals that are converted to weak electromagnetic waves in the visible range) may be a necessary condition for the electric activity in the brain to store holographic images.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These may play a role in cell communication and certain brain processes including sleep, but further studies are needed to strengthen current ones.&lt;ref name=Persinger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Persinger M.A., Lavallee C. | year = 2012 | title = The Σn=n Concept and the Quantitative Support for the Cerebral-Holographic and Electromagnetic Configuration of Consciousness | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 128–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown the correlation between more advanced cognitive function and [[homeothermy]]. Taking holographic brain models into account, this temperature regulation would reduce distortion of the signal waves, an important condition for holographic systems.&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and alternative models==
Pribram's holonomic model of brain function did not receive widespread attention at the time, but other quantum models developed since, including brain dynamics by Jibu &amp; Yasue and Vitiello's dissipative quantum brain dynamics. Though not directly related to the holonomic model, they continue to move beyond approaches based solely in classic brain theory.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bokkon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bókkon István | year = 2005 | title = Dreams and neuroholography: An interdisciplinary interpretation of development of homeotherm state in evolution | url = | journal = Sleep and Hypnosis | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Globus /&gt;

===Correlograph===
In 1969 scientists D. Wilshaw, O. P. Buneman and [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|H. Longuet-Higgins]] proposed an alternative, non-holographic model that fulfilled many of the same requirements as Gabor's original holographic model. The Gabor model did not explain how the brain could use Fourier analysis on incoming signals or how it would deal with the low signal-noise ratio in reconstructed memories. Longuet-Higgin's correlograph model built on the idea that any system could perform the same functions as a Fourier holograph if it could correlate pairs of patterns. It uses minute pinholes that do not produce diffraction patterns to create a similar reconstruction as that in Fourier holography.&lt;ref name=Andrew&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrew A. M. | year = 1997 | title = The decade of the brain - further thoughts | url = | journal = Kybernetes | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 255–264 | doi=10.1108/03684929710163155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like a hologram, a discrete correlograph can recognize displaced patterns and store information in a parallel and non-local way so it usually will not be destroyed by localized damage.&lt;ref name=Willshaw&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Willshaw D. J. |author2=Buneman O. P. |author3=Longuet-Higgins H. C. | year = 1969 | title = Non-holographic associative memory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 222 | issue = 5197| pages = 960–962 | doi=10.1038/222960a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then expanded the model beyond the correlograph to an associative net where the points become parallel lines arranged in a grid. Horizontal lines represent axons of input neurons while vertical lines represent output neurons. Each intersection represents a modifiable synapse. Though this cannot recognize displaced patterns, it has a greater potential storage capacity. This was not necessarily meant to show how the brain is organized, but instead to show the possibility of improving on Gabor's original model.&lt;ref name=Willshaw/&gt; P. Van Heerden countered this model by demonstrating mathematically that the signal-noise ratio of a hologram could reach 50% of ideal. He also used a model with a 2D neural hologram network for fast searching imposed upon a 3D network for large storage capacity. A key quality of this model was its flexibility to change the orientation and fix distortions of stored information, which is important for our ability to recognize an object as the same entity from different angles and positions, something the correlograph and association network models lack.&lt;ref name=VanHeerden&gt;{{cite journal | author = Van Heerden P. J. | year = 1970 | title = Models for the brain | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = 5228| pages = 177–178 | doi=10.1038/225177a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Holographic models of memory and consciousness may be related to several brain disorders involving disunity of sensory input within a unified consciousness, including [[Charles Bonnet Syndrome]], Disjunctive Agnosia, and [[Schizophrenia]]. Charles Bonnet Syndrome patients experience two vastly different worlds within one consciousness.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"&gt;G.G. Globus; C.P. O’Carroll, "Nonlocal neurology: Beyond localization to holonomy," Irvine, April 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They see the world that psychologically normal people perceive, but also a simplified world riddled with [[Pseudohallucination]]. These patients can differentiate these two worlds easily. Since dynamic core and global workspace theories insist that a distinct area of the brain is responsible for consciousness, the only way a patient would perceive two worlds was if this dynamic core and global workspace were split.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"/&gt; But such does not explain how different content can be perceived within one single consciousness since these theories assume that each dynamic core or global workspace creates a single coherent reality.&lt;ref name="G.G. Globus 2010"/&gt; The primary symptom of Disjunctive Agnosia is an inconsistency of sensory information within a unified consciousness. They may see one thing, but hear something entirely incompatible with that image. Schizophrenics often report experiencing thoughts that do not seem to originate from themselves, as if the idea was inserted exogenously. The individual feels no control over certain thoughts existing within their consciousness.

I'''ndochristian art''', or '''''arte indocristiano''''', is a type of Latin American art that combines European colonial influences with Indigenous artistic styles and traditions.

During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, [[Franciscans|Franciscan]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monks extensively converted indigenous peoples to Christianity, introducing them to European arts and aesthetics. The arts of this period reflect a fusion of European and indigenous religious beliefs, aesthetics, and artistic traditions.

The term Indochristian art was coined by [[Constantino Reyes-Valerio]], a scholar of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture and arts, in his book, ''Indochristian Art, Sculpture and Painting of 16th Century Mexico''. Reyes-Valerio's work focused on the painting and sculpture of churches and monasteries in [[New Spain]], but had broader implications for the analysis of art throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azulmaya.com/indocristiano/index.php|title=Arte Indocristiano: Pintura y Escultura en la Nueva España|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|date=2000|website=www.azulmaya.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the term ==

=== Coinage of term ''Indochristian Art'' ===
The term ''indochristian art'' was coined by Constantino Reyes-Valerio in his 1978 work, ''Arte indocristiano: escultura del siglo XVI en México''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arte indocristiano: escultura del siglo XVI en México|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Escuela Nacional de Conservación, Restauración y Museografía "Prof. Manuel del Castillo Negrete", SEP, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' This work was followed by an analysis of indochristian mural painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El pintor de conventos: los murales del siglo XVI en la Nueva España|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two books were re-published in combined form in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arte indocristiano|last=Reyes-Valerio|first=Constantino|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Reyes-Valerio defines indochristian art as art that is indigenous in its production but Christian in its themes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; using the term as a designation for artwork that blended symbolic elements of Christian and pre-Hispanic cultures. An expert in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican sculpture, Reyes-Valerio focuses his studies on art produced in monastic settings in New Spain, primarily examining sculptures and paintings that ornament monasteries and convents, and identifying iconographic connections to earlier indigenous works.

Reyes-Valerio's coinage of the term indochristian art was based on his 45 years of experience studying pre-Columbian and colonial monuments throughout Mexico.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosquillas Quiles|first=Hortensia|date=Spring 2008|title=Constantino Reyes-Valerio, Arte indocristiano, México, INAH (Obra diversa), 2000, 486 pp., epílogo, apéndice y bibliografía|url=|journal=BOLETÍN DE MONUMENTOS HISTÓRICOS|volume=12|pages=159–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tracing the indigenous influence on colonial art, Reyes-Valerio relies primarily on close analysis of artistic details and motifs, a process he calls “speaking to the art”, but supports this analysis with documentary sources such as the journals of Augustinian, Franciscan, and Dominican friars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reyes-Valerio not only discusses indigenous artistic production, but ties this art to the educational systems created by European monks. He argues that the use of traditional native religious imagery by Indian artists is a form of rebellion intended to keep their traditions alive. 

=== Criticisms of the term ===
Although the significance of Reyes-Valerio's contribution to the identification of indigenous iconography within colonial monastic art is widely recognized, a number of art historians have criticized the implications of the word "indochristian" as well as Reyes-Valerio's analysis of the cultural context in which the art was produced.

In the book, ''Mestizaje and Globalization : Transformations of Identity and Power,'' Stefanie Wickstrom argues against the use of the term "indochristian". Wickstrom claims that the term oversimplifies colonial monastic art and the intentions of the artists by categorizing each element as either Indian or Christian in symbolism, failing to account for the evolution of a mestizo art form as Christian symbolism made contact with new cultures and evolved.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mestizaje and Globalization : Transformations of Identity and Power|last=Wickstrom|first=Stefanie|last2=Young|first2=Philip D.|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Tucson|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have objected to Reyes-Valerio's discussion of colonization; in discussing the colonization of New Spain, Reyes-Valerio makes the controversial claim that the spiritual conquest of Europeans over indigenous people was more damaging than the armed conquest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further, in his descriptions of the interactions between monks and indigenous people, Reyes-Valerio focuses primarily on the psychological harm done to the indigenous people as they lost their ancestral religious beliefs, and tends to overlook the physical harm inflicted upon them by Christian leaders. 

=== Related discussion of Indigenous artistic influence ===
Throughout the twentieth century, there were a number of movements to re-evaluate the role of indigenous peoples in creation of Latin American national identities. In Mexico following the revolution, the [[Indigenismo in Mexico|Indigenismo]] movement placed increased value on indigenous culture and historical significance. This shift was reflected in a shift in art historian’s attitudes towards indigenous art and aesthetics. These influences on colonial art had largely been overlooked up until this point.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Recognition of indigenous artistic influences varied widely, with art historians only gradually recognizing the existence of an indigenous influence on Mexican colonial art. In 1939, Agustin Velazquez Chavez described the art of New Spain as the product of a mixing of Indian and Spanish cultures in conflict, placing special significance on the “Mexican” nature of this entwining of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tres siglos de pintura colonial mexicana|last=Velázquez Chávez|first=Agustín|publisher=Editiorial Polis|year=1939|isbn=|location=Mexico|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the Churrigueresque art of Mexico, Miguel Toussaint used the term “mestizo,” recognizing the participation of Indigenous people in the art of colonial Mexico.

The term “Tequitqui” was created by Jose Moreno Villa to categorize artistic works with a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous elements. With this term, which in Nahuatl means “tributary,” Moreno Villa drew a comparison between the art of colonial Mexico and the [[Mudéjar]] art of Muslims in Spain during the Reconquista.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La escultura colonial mexicana|last=Moreno Villa|first=Jose|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1942|isbn=|location=Mexico City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tequitqui was the first term used specifically to identify art combining colonial and indigenous influences, however, Moreno Villa limited its application to works in which the indigenous artist represents atavistic religious symbols. In later works Moreno Villa elaborates on his interpretation of Mexican colonial art, stating that the indigenous contribution to the genre was limited to the non-Christian deities represented, while claiming that the artistic style of colonial artworks was not tied to indigenous artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lo Mexicano en las artes plasticas|last=Moreno Villa|first=Jose|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1948|isbn=|location=Mexico City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of Indochristian Art ==
[[File:Malinalco Hallway.jpg|thumb|Murals at the mission church of San Salvador, Malinalco, Mexico use native flora and fauna and indigenous concepts of the afterlife to depict the Christian garden of paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frames for conversion: The assimilation of native motifs in the monastic decoration of New Spain (1540–1580)|last=Dominguez Torres|first=Monica|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2004|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although the term "indochristian art" was originally only used to describe Mexican monastic sculpture and murals, by definition, it applies to any art that is created by indigenous artists and contains Christian themes. It can be applied to a wide variety of artistic traditions from colonial Latin America. The term becomes increasingly difficult to apply to art in the late colonial and post-colonial periods, however, as it relies upon a clearly defined opposition between indigenous artist and Euro-Christian themes. The way that indochristian art is defined overlooks the entanglement of Native and European identities and the mixing of cultures that gradually developed throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Religious artworks from colonial Latin America often demonstrate indochristian influence in a variety of ways. Indochristian art often includes depictions of atavistic deities and religious symbols, hieroglyphs, figures with indigenous features and traditional indigenous dress, and native flora and fauna. In addition, it may use traditional artistic styles of representation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Monastic Art ===
In the early years of colonization, art was primarily commissioned by the church. As Augustinian, Dominican, and Franciscan missionaries attempted to convert the native populations of the Americas, their techniques varied widely, but frequently involved threats of violence. Missionaries generally attempted to eliminate indigenous culture, converting native people not only to Christianity, but also to European social practices.

Much Latin American monastic art of the colonial period could be designated as indochristian. Murals, paintings, architectural designs, sculptures, and ornamental objects all were frequently created by native craftspeople and incorporated indigenous iconography.

=== Cuzco School ===
The [[Cuzco School]] was an artistic tradition associated with Cusco, Peru. Following the Spanish conquest of the Incan empire, a group of Spanish religious artists were sent to Cusco to aid in the conversion of Inca people to Catholicism. This group of artists began a school, teaching Quechua and mestizo people to draw and use oil paints according to European styles.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Colonial Latin America|last=Bailey|first=Gauvin Alexander|publisher=Phaidon|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sor María Juana de Señor San Rafael y Martínez.jpg|thumb|An example of a crowned nun, combining traditional Mesoamerican flower art with Christian iconography]]Based on pre-columbian artistic traditions, Cusqueño painters created artworks anonymously and included native flora and fauna in their works. They also created a tradition of painting Inca monarchs – a departure from Christian religious themes and an expression of cultural pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America|last=Bethell|first=Leslie|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ángel Arcabucero (Arquebusier Angel) ===
[[Ángel arcabucero]] is a genre of painting tied to the Cuzco school. These paintings depict angels holding an arquebus, or early firearm, and dressed in clothing reminiscent of that worn by Andean nobility.

Monja Coronada (Crowned nun) is a genre of portrait paintings common among Mexican convents. These commemorative portraits of nuns wearing bridal clothes and floral crowns were common in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.virreinato.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=88|title=Monjas Coronadas. Vida conventual femenina|last=|first=|date=|website=Museo Nacional de Virreinato|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a Euro-Christian perspective, the nuns' bridal trappings allude to the Virgin Mary crowned, symbolizing mystical marriage to God and victory over sin. This Christian symbolism is, however, combined with Mesoamerican imagery; the paintings frequently replace the traditional European palm frond with a Mesoamerican flower staff, and ornament the crown with flowers according to traditional flower art practices. In addition, the bird and butterfly imagery that is frequently included in crowned nun portraits may symbolize indigenous beliefs regarding the soul and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cordova|first=James M.|date=2011-12-01|title=Clad in Flowers: Indigenous Arts and Knowledge in Colonial Mexican Convents|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00043079.2011.10786018|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=93|issue=4|pages=449–467|doi=10.1080/00043079.2011.10786018|issn=0004-3079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kids' Lit Quiz''' is an annual [[literature]] competition, in which teams of four students, aged 10 to 13, work together to answer wide-ranging literary questions.  The winning team from each region competes in the national final. The winner of the national final is then invited to the World Final held annually in July or August. Since its inception in 1991, thousands of students have participated each year throughout the world.

The quiz was created by Wayne Mills, a former educator at the [[University of Auckland]], who wears a purple and black hat while hosting this literary quiz. In 2008 Wayne Mills was given the [[Storylines Margaret Mahy Medal and Lecture Award]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storylines.org.nz/awards.asp?pid=56 Storylines: Margaret Mahy Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize his achievement in establishing the Kids' Lit Quiz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sla.org.uk/blg-margaret-mahy-medal.php School Library Association: "Margaret Mahy Medal for KLQ quizmaster" ]&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen's New Year's Honours in 2011 for meritorious services to education, specifically children's literature. In August 2018 he was granted Life Membership of Storyline’s Children’s Literature Trust and Foundation.

In 2003 the quiz was brought to the UK where over 400 schools currently participate in the heats leading to the world final.This pattern is repeated in different countries around the world.

The Kids' Lit Quiz motivates and inspires children to read a wide range of children's literature for pleasure from the classics to the contemporary, from nursery rhymes to comics, and from folk tales to myths. It offers children rewards they may not otherwise experience in the classroom setting. 

Currently the quiz takes place in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, United States of America, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. Singapore was the first country in Asia to have the quiz.

'''Medical jurisprudence''' or '''legal medicine''' is the branch of [[science]] and [[medicine]] involving the study and application of scientific and medical knowledge to legal problems, such as [[inquest]]s, and in the field of [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodric Romeyn Beck and William Dunloop. (1825.) ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'', 2 ed., Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[modern medicine]] is a legal creation, regulated by the state, and medicolegal cases involving [[death]], [[rape]], [[Parent|paternity]], etc. require a medical practitioner to produce evidence and appear as an [[expert witness]], these two fields have traditionally been interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Mohr. (1993.) ''Doctors and the Law: Medical Jurisprudence in Nineteenth-Century America'', Oxford University Press, New York City.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic medicine, which includes [[forensic pathology]], is a narrower field that involves collection and analysis of medical evidence (samples) to produce objective information for use in the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Swaine Taylor and Frederick John Smith (ed.). (1920.) ''Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence'', 7 ed., Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Paul Zacchias]] is one of the earliest figures of medical jurisprudence, with association with the [[Papal States]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnqI8uSeekwC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title='On the Beliefs of the Greeks': Leo Allatios and Popular Orthodoxy|last=Hartnup|first=Karen|date=2004-01-01|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004131809|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacchias was the personal physician to [[Pope Innocentius X]] and [[Pope Alexander VII]], as well as legal adviser to the [[Rota Romana]].&lt;ref name="medico"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7RXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA532&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=The Medico-legal journal, Volume 2|publisher=Medico-Legal Journal Association|year=1885|author=Medico-Legal Society of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most well known book, ''Quaestiones medico-legales'' (1621-1651) established [[legal medicine]] as a topic of study.&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFTlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1572&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=JAMA.: The Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 38|last=|first=|publisher=American Medical Association, HighWire Press|year=1902|isbn=|location=|pages=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacchias work contains [[Superstition|superstitious]] views on [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Witchcraft|witches]], and [[demon]]s which were widely held at the time.&lt;ref name="lancet"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxcTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=paul+zacchias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ULa2T6bIFIS42gX4otDOCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20zacchias&amp;f=false|title=Northwestern lancet, Volume 18|year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical jurisprudence had a chair founded at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1807, first occupied by [[Andrew Duncan, the younger]]. It was imposed on the university by the administration of [[Charles James Fox]], and in particular [[Henry Erskine (lawyer)|Henry Erskine]] working with [[Andrew Duncan, the elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=8213|title=Duncan, Andrew (1773–1832)|first=Brenda M.|last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Medical jurisprudence is concerned with a broad range of medical, legal, and ethical issues, as well as [[human right]]s and [[Individual and group rights|rights of individuals]].

Physicians have a duty to act in their patients best interest and can be charged in a court of law if they fail to do so. On the other hand, a physician may be required to act in the interest of third parties if his patient is a danger to others. Failure to do so may lead to legal action against the physician.

Medical jurisprudence includes:
*questions of the legal and [[medical ethics|ethical duties]] of physicians;
*questions affecting the civil

Under the second heading, there are many aspects, including:
*questions of [[competence (law)|competence]] or [[sanity]] in civil or criminal proceedings;
*questions of competence of [[Minor (law)|minors]] in matters affecting their own health; and,
*questions of lawful fitness or safety to drive a motor vehicle, pilot an aeroplane, use [[scuba gear]], play certain sports, or to join certain occupations.

Under the third heading, there are also many aspects, including:
*assessment of illness or injuries that may be work-related (see [[workers' compensation]] or [[occupational safety and health]]) or otherwise compensable;
*assessment of injuries of minors that may relate to [[Neglect (English law)|neglect]] or [[Child abuse|abuse]]; and,
*[[death certificate|certification of death]] or else the [[Coroner|assessment of possible causes of death]]. This, however, is the more commonly understood, albeit narrow, meaning of forensic medicine.

A '''Nativity play''' or '''Christmas pageant''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] which recounts the story of the [[Nativity of Jesus]].   It is usually performed at [[Christmas]], the [[Calendar of saints|feast]] of the Nativity.

==Liturgical==
The term "Nativity Drama" is used by Wellesz&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Wellesz |first=Egon |title=The Nativity Drama of the Byzantine Church |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=37 |year=1947 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.2307/298465 |publisher=Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |jstor=298465}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in his discussion of the ''[[troparion]]'' [[hymn]]s in the Christmas [[liturgy]] of [[Byzantine Rite]] Churches, from [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] in the seventh century.  Goldstein argues&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Origin of Medieval Drama |first=Leonard |last=Goldstein |year=2004 |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]  Press |isbn=0-8386-4004-4 |location= |pages=54–60}}
&lt;/ref&gt; that the label "drama" is misleading, that the ''troparia'' are more akin to an [[oratorio]] than a play, and that the form is not a precursor of later more decidedly dramatic forms.

Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] performed [[Midnight Mass]] in [[Greccio]] on Christmas Eve 1223 in front of a life-size [[nativity scene]] (crib or creche) built by Giovanni Velita, with live animals.  This is sometimes credited as the first nativity play. However, more formal Nativity plays have featured in [[Christian worship]] since medieval [[mystery play]]s.  The twelfth to nineteenth pageants of the 48-play [[York Mystery Cycle]] dealt with the Nativity story.  In [[Germany]], the [[Weihnachten]] services on [[Christmas Eve]] include a children's [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] called ''Weihnachtsgeschichte'', which features a ''Krippenspiel'' ("crib play").

==Popular==
In [[Latin America]] ''pastorelas'' ("shepherd's plays") are performed in many local communities.  These were imported during [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] but are no longer common in [[Spain]].  They recount the story of the [[adoration of the shepherds|shepherds travelling to worship the newborn Christ]] , augmenting the Biblical text with [[apocrypha]]l events, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] beliefs, regional features, [[anachronism]]s, [[satire]] and [[buffoonery]].  Each community's play evolves into a distinctive tradition.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://hemi.nyu.edu/archive/studentwork/nation/catharris/public_html/Pages/chindex.html |date=December 2001 |title=Los Pastores/Las Pastorelas: Public Theatre, Popular Devotion |first=Cathlyn A. |last=Harris |accessdate=2008-01-04 |publisher=[[Hemispheric Institute]], [[New York University|NYU]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128025901/http://hemi.nyu.edu/archive/studentwork/nation/catharris/public_html/Pages/chindex.html |archivedate=2007-11-28 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belgium]], [[puppet theatre]]s often put on variations on the Nativity play in the weeks before Christmas, with parents and their children in the audience.  The play often depicts the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] which occurred after the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name="belg"&gt;
{{cite journal |issn=1481-4374 |journal=Comparative Literature and Culture: A WWWeb Journal |title=Symbolism, Popular Drama, and Politics and Art in Belgium, 1886-1910 |issue=5.3 Comparative Cultural Studies and Popular Culture |editor=Benton Jay Komins |url=http://clcwebjournal.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb03-3/gross03.html |first=Joan |last=Gross  |date=September 2003 |volume=5 |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=[[Purdue University Press]] }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Joan Gross traces this augmentation back to cryptic protests in the late nineteenth century against the abuse of native peoples by colonists in the [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]'s [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref name="belg"/&gt;

In [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]] Australia, the [[Stable on the Strand]] is an annual nativity play held at the city's oceanfront park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/videos/2010/12/23/3100559.htm|title=Journey into Bethlehem|last=Fernbach|first=Nathalie|date=23 December 2010|newspaper=ABC (Australia)|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/stable-on-strand-first-baby-still-involved-event/7047752|title=Very first Stable on The Strand baby still supports Townsville event 17 years on|last=Fernbach|first=Nathalie|date=22 December 2015|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=10 October 2018|last2=Calderwood|first2=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In schools==
[[File:Childrens Nativity Play 2007.jpg|thumb|A children's nativity play.]]
Many, especially [[Christian school|Christian-oriented]], [[primary school]]s and [[Sunday School]]s put on a Nativity play before the [[Christmas break]] begins. Children in costume act as the human and [[angel]] characters, and often as the animals and props. The infant Jesus is sometimes represented by a [[doll]], but sometimes played by a real baby. [[Parent]]s, grandparents, stepparents and siblings, schoolteachers and sometimes the church community in general form the audience. The tradition of Nativity plays in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[State school|state]] [[primary school#United Kingdom|primary school]]s is declining in favour of secular plays, because of the need to include pupils of other faiths. However, a survey in 2012 found that 20% of schools were planning a traditional Nativity play and a further 50% were intending to stage an updated version of the Christmas story, sometimes with new music and extra characters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1571187/School-nativity-plays-under-threat.html The Daily Telegraph - 17 December 2012 - ''School nativity plays under threat'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary==
{{Main|Nativity of Jesus in later culture}}
Modern writers to have written Nativity plays include [[Laurence Housman]] (''Bethlehem'', 1902; musical accompaniment by [[Joseph Moorat]] c.1919&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Hunt |title=Moorat |journal=[[The Musical Times]] |date=March 1975 |issue=1585 |volume=116 |pages=228 |doi=10.2307/959098 |publisher=Musical Times Publications Ltd. |jstor=959098}}
&lt;/ref&gt;); [[Lucjan Rydel]] (''Polish Bethlehem'', 1904); [[Cicely Hamilton]] (''The Child in Flanders: A Nativity Play'', 1922); and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (''[[He That Should Come]]'', 1938).

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s first play was ''[[Bariona ou le fils du tonerre]]'', a nativity play performed on Christmas Eve 1940 while a [[prisoner of war]] in a German [[stalag]].  Sartre saw Christ as part of the [[Jewish-Roman wars|Jewish Resistance]] to the [[Iudaea Province|Roman Empire's occupation]], mirroring the [[French Resistance]] of [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany's occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;

A '''next-generation firewall''' ('''NGFW''') is a part of the third generation of firewall technology, combining a traditional [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] with other network device filtering functionalities, such as an [[application firewall]] using in-line [[deep packet inspection]] (DPI), an [[intrusion prevention system]] (IPS). Other techniques might also be employed, such as [[TLS/SSL]] encrypted traffic inspection, website filtering, QoS/[[bandwidth management]], [[antivirus software|antivirus inspection]] and third-party [[identity management]] integration (i.e. [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], [[RADIUS]], [[Active Directory]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esecurityplanet.com/security-buying-guides/intro-to-next-generation-firewalls.html Intro to Next Generation Firewalls] - By Eric Geier, 06 September, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

NGFWs include the typical functions of traditional firewalls such as packet filtering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnmeonline.com/features/next-gen-security/ Next gen security] - by Ben Rossi - 07 August, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; network- and port-address translation (NAT), stateful inspection, and [[virtual private network]] (VPN) support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niiconsulting.com/solutions/next-generation-firewalls.html Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)] - Network Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of next-generation firewalls is to include more layers of the [[OSI model]], improving filtering of network traffic that is dependent on the packet contents.

NGFWs perform deeper inspection compared to [[stateful inspection]] performed by the [[firewall (computing)|first- and second-generation firewalls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/next-generation-firewalls-security-without-compromising-performance/8545/ Next-generation firewalls: Security without compromising performance] - By Patrick Sweeney, 17 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; NGFWs use a more thorough inspection style, checking packet payloads and matching signatures for harmful activities such as exploitable attacks and malware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkcomputing.com/security/next-generation-firewalls-101/240149730 Next-Generation Firewalls 101] - By Frank J. Ohlhorst, 1 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of next-generation firewalls ==

Improved detection of encrypted applications and intrusion prevention service. Modern threats like web-based malware attacks, targeted attacks, application-layer attacks, and more have had a significantly negative effect on the threat landscape. In fact, more than 80% of all new malware and intrusion attempts are exploiting weaknesses in applications, as opposed to weaknesses in networking components and services.

Stateful firewalls with simple packet filtering capabilities were efficient blocking unwanted applications as most applications met the port-protocol expectations. Administrators could promptly prevent an unsafe application from being accessed by users by blocking the associated ports and protocols. But today, blocking a [[web application]] like [[Farmville]] that uses port 80 by closing the port would also mean complications with the entire [[HTTP]] protocol.

Protection based on ports, protocols, IP addresses is no more reliable and viable. This has led to the development of [[identity-based security]] approach, which takes organizations a step ahead of conventional security appliances which bind security to IP-addresses.

NGFWs offer administrators a deeper awareness of and control over individual applications, along with deeper inspection capabilities by the firewall. Administrators can create very granular "allow/deny" rules for controlling use of websites and applications in the network.

The '''Norwegian Institute for Social Research''' ({{lang-no|Institutt for samfunnsforskning}}, IFS) is a private [[social science]] [[research institute]] based in [[Oslo]], Norway.

It was founded in 1950 by [[Vilhelm Aubert]], [[Arne Næss]], [[Eirik Rinde]], and [[Stein Rokkan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.samfunnsforskning.no/page/About_ISF/Menu_About_ISF/7979/8038| title = History of the ISF| accessdate = 28 April 2007| last = Beer| first = Nicolai| date = | work = Institute for Social Research (official site)| publisher = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070803230017/http://www.samfunnsforskning.no/page/About_ISF/Menu_About_ISF/7979/8038 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes the journal ''[[Tidsskrift for samfunnsforskning]]''.

The institute is divided into five research fields, each with its own research director. They are [[Bernt Aardal]] (Political institutions, voting and public opinion), [[Erling Barth]] (Employment and working conditions), Mari Teigen (Gender and society), Bernard Enjolras (Civil society in transition) and Hilde Lidén (International migration, integration and ethnic relations). In total, the institute has 52 employees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9670">'''Nutrition psychology (NP)''' is the psychological study of how cognitive choices, such as meal decisions, influence nutrition, psychological health, and overall health{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.  Nutrition psychology seeks to understand the relationship between nutritional behavior and mental health/well-being.  NP is a sub-field of [[psychology]] and more specifically of [[health psychology]]. It may be applied to numerous different fields including: [[psychology]], [[dietetics]], [[nutrition]], and [[marketing]]. NP is a fairly new field with a brief history that has already started to contribute information and knowledge to psychology.  There are two main areas of controversy within nutrition psychology. The first area of controversy is that the topic can be viewed in two different ways.  It can be viewed as nutrition affecting psychological functions, or psychological choices and behavior influencing nutrition and health. The second controversy being the defining of what is "healthy" or "normal" as related to nutrition.

==Overview==
{{Synthesis|section|date=April 2018}}
Nutrition is defined as, "the act or process of nourishing or being nourished; ''specifically'':  the sum of the processes by which an animal or plant takes in and utilizes food substances"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nutrition|title = Definition of NUTRITION|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Psychology is defined as, "the study of mind and behavior in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychology|title = Definition of PSYCHOLOGY|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this case, the particular field is nutrition. Therefore, nutrition psychology is the study of mind and behavior in relation to the process of taking in and utilizing food.

=== Objectives ===
Today, over one third of American adults are considered "[[Obesity|obese]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html|title = Adult Obesity Facts Data Adult Obesity DNPAO CDC|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nutrition psychology aims to explain what psychological reasons may be behind this and other health trends. Nutrition psychology looks at the internal psychological effects of why people do what they do, and how they are shaped and influenced by outside stimuli.

== Origins and development ==
Nutrition psychology is a field that is still in its early stages of development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} With [[obesity]] being a continually growing problem in the [[United States]] and abroad, nutrition psychology is gaining importance and popularity in society today. As it has grown, nutrition psychology has directly and indirectly influenced research on [[dieting]], [[Nutrition facts label|food labels]], the way food is marketed, [[food technology]], obesity, and the attitude of the public towards food, among other topics.

Some research discusses the idea of "Food faddism," which is loosely defined as, "the idea that too much weight is put upon the influence of food and diet on overall health and that claims, whether good or bad, are often exaggerated."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=William T.|date=1983-01-01|title=Food Faddism, Cultism, and Quackery|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nu.03.070183.000343|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|volume=3|issue=1|pages=35–52|doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.03.070183.000343|pmid=6315036}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This idea of food choices having extreme consequences is thought to be deeply ingrained into culture, possibly stemming from the story of [[Adam and Eve]] eating the [[forbidden fruit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Food labels ===
In 1990, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) required that [[Nutrition facts label|nutrition labels]] be put on food products in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiesel|first=Kristin|last2=McCluskey|first2=Jill J.|last3=Villas-Boas|first3=Sofia B.|date=2011-01-01|title=Nutritional Labeling and Consumer Choices|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.resource.012809.103957|journal=Annual Review of Resource Economics|volume=3|issue=1|pages=141–158|doi=10.1146/annurev.resource.012809.103957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thought behind doing so was to provide consumers with the necessary information to make educated decisions about the foods that they purchased. Since that time, nutrition psychologists have done research on how influential these labels are on how consumers choose what foods to buy. These studies have shown mixed results concerning the effects of nutritional labeling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the research, the average consumer does tend to read the labels and take the information into consideration, in part because companies have begun producing foods with more health-conscious ingredients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, many of these potential health benefits are overshadowed by the continuing increase in obesity and deaths related to obesity in the United States over the last few decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Marketing ===
As with any industry, [[marketing]] plays an important role in the buying and selling of food products. Marketing campaigns for food and beverages are increasingly prevalent today and are larger in scope than ever before, given the resources that large corporations are able to use in the forms of social media and [[viral marketing]]. Some researchers claim that the dramatic rise in obesity rates are at least in part, due to an increase in the marketing of food over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Frederick J.|date=2011-01-01|title=Using Marketing Muscle to Sell Fat: The Rise of Obesity in the Modern Economy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090810-182502|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=32|issue=1|pages=285–306|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090810-182502|pmid=21219166}}&lt;/ref&gt; New marketing strategies have taken many forms, including changing the packaging of the food or beverage itself, product placement in media, advertisements in schools, increased focus on "value meals" with larger portions, and endorsements by athletes or celebrities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of these methods increase exposure to younger consumers, who studies show, tend to be more impressionable than adults and whose eating patterns as children can continue long into their adult lives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There are calls for junk food television advertisements to be banned before 9.00 pm to prevent children seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/top-paediatrician-says-its-time-to-give-parents-extra-votes-for-their-children Top paediatrician says it's time to give parents extra votes for their children] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food technology ===
Recently, food has been a source of technological development. Nutrition psychologists have studied the public's perception of food technology such as genetic modification or additives that may extend the shelf life of food, among other topics. In general, the findings show that the average consumer is more likely to avoid food that is affected by technology and will prefer organic, all-natural choices.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lusk|first=Jayson L.|last2=Roosen|first2=Jutta|last3=Bieberstein|first3=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=Consumer Acceptance of New Food Technologies: Causes and Roots of Controversies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012735|journal=Annual Review of Resource Economics|volume=6|issue=1|pages=381–405|doi=10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012735}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technological effects are often perceived by consumers to pose health risks, even if those claims are not founded in facts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Fad diets ===
Nutrition psychology has many applications not only related to how and what people eat on a day-to-day basis, but also the ways in which and why they [[Dieting|diet]] and [[Physical exercise|exercise]]. [[Fad diet]]s are popular in today's society and they usually play heavily on potential customers' ideals about what they should weigh or look like. These diets usually include an extreme condition or restriction on a person's food intake that supposedly will result in [[Weight Loss/Dieting|weight loss]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/home|title=Food Facts home|website=www.bda.uk.com|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; People become attracted to these weight loss claims because of the potential ease with which the weight loss can happen. However, these claims are not always founded in scientific research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The 2004 documentary film, ''[[Super Size Me]]'', directed by and starring [[Morgan Spurlock]] focuses on the ways in which the [[fast food]] industry in America is influencing how people and especially young children, view nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Spurlock|first = Morgan|title = Super Size Me|date = 2004-06-11|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/?ref_=nv_sr_1|accessdate = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5526">'''Osmoconformers''' are marine [[organisms]] that maintain an internal environment that is [[osmotic]] to their external environment.&lt;ref name=Marion&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClary|first1=Dr. Marion|title=Osmoconformer|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155074/|website=Encyclopedia of Earth|accessdate=March 13, 2015|date=August 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the osmotic pressure, or [[osmolarity]], of the organism’s cells is equal to the [[osmotic]] pressure of their surrounding environment.  By minimizing the osmotic gradient, this subsequently minimizes the net [[inflow (hydrology)|influx]] and [[Flux|efflux]] of water into and out of cells.  Even though osmoconformers have an internal environment that's isosmotic to their external environment the types of [[ions]] in the two environments differ greatly in order to allow critical biological functions to occur.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Neil A.|last2=Lawrence|first2=G. Mitchell|last3=Reece|first3=Jane B.|title=Biology Concepts &amp; Connections|date=2000|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|pages=506–507|chapter=Control of the Internal Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A benefit to osmoconformation is that organisms don’t need to expend as much energy as [[osmoregulator]]s in order to regulate ion gradients.  However, to ensure the correct types of ions are in their desired location, a small amount of energy is expended on ion transport.  A disadvantage to osmoconformation is that organisms are subject to changes in the osmolarity of their environment.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Timothy J.|title=Animal Osmoregulation|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University|pages=58–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Invertebrates ===

Most osmoconformers are [[marine invertebrates]] such as [[echinoderms]] (such as starfish), [[mussels]], marine crabs, [[lobsters]], [[jellyfish]], [[ascidians]] ([[sea squirts]] - primitive chordates), and [[scallops]].  Some [[insects]] are also osmoconformers.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;  Some osmoconformers, such as echinoderms, are [[stenohaline]], which means they can only survive in a limited range of external osmolarities.  The survival of such organisms is thus contingent on their external osmotic environment remaining relatively constant.  &lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; On the other hand, some osmoconformers are classified as [[euryhaline]], which means they can survive in a broad range of external osmolarities. Mussels are a prime example of a euryhaline osmoconformer.  Mussels have adapted to survive in a broad range of external salinities due to their ability to close their shells which allows them to seclude themselves from unfavorable external environments. &lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;

=== Craniates ===

There are a couple of examples of osmoconformers that are [[craniates]] such as [[hagfish]], skates and [[sharks]]. Their body fluid is isoosmotic with seawater, but their high osmolarity is maintained by making the concentration of organic solutes unnaturally high. Sharks concentrate urea in their body, and since urea denatures proteins at high concentrations, they also accumulate [[trimethylamine N-oxide]] (TMAO) to counter the effect. Sharks adjust their internal osmolarity according to the osmolarity of the sea water surrounding them. Rather than ingesting sea water in order to change their internal salinity, sharks are able to absorb sea water directly. This is due to the high concentration of urea kept inside their bodies. This high concentration of urea creates a [[diffusion]] gradient which permits the shark to absorb water in order to equalize the concentration difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Amelia|title=Sharks|url=http://www.sharksinfo.com/osmoregulation.html|website=Sharks Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crab-eating frog]], or Rana cancrivora, is an example of a vertebrate osmoconformer. The crab-eating frog also regulates its rates of urea retention and excretion, which allows them to survive and maintain their status as osmoconformers in a wide range of external salinities.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;  Hagfish maintain an internal ion composition plasma that differs from that of seawater.  The internal ionic environment of hagfish contains a lower concentration of [[divalent]] ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4 2-) and a slightly higher concentration of [[monovalent ion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vu1uzL0p7xsC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=osmoconformer+hagfish#v=onepage&amp;q=osmoconformer%20hagfish&amp;f=true | title = The Biology of Hagfishes | isbn = 9780412785306 | author1 = Jørgensen | first1 = Jørgen Mørup | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagfish therefore have to expend some energy for osmoregulation.

==Biochemistry==

[[Ion gradient]]s are crucial to many major biological functions on a cellular level.  Consequently, the ionic composition of an organism's internal environment is highly regulated with respect to its external environment.  Osmoconformers have adapted so that they utilize the ionic composition of their external environment, which is typically seawater, in order to support important biological functions.  For instance, seawater has a high concentration of [[sodium ion]]s, which helps support [[muscle contraction]] and [[neuronal]] signaling when paired with high internal concentrations of [[potassium ion]]s.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">[[File:Passive radiator enclosure.svg|thumb|right|100px|Passive radiator enclosure with front mounted passive radiator; back or side mounting is also used]]
A [[Loudspeaker enclosure|speaker enclosure]] using a '''[[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] radiator''' (PR) usually contains an "active  [[loudspeaker]]" (or main driver), and a passive radiator (also known as a "drone cone"). The active loudspeaker is a normal driver, and the passive radiator is of similar construction, but without a [[voice coil]] and [[Loudspeaker#Driver design|magnet assembly]]. It is not attached to a voice coil or wired to an electrical circuit or [[power amplifier]]. 
[[File:Logitech Z4 satellite 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A small Logitech computer speaker cabinet. The middle speaker is a real loudspeaker. The top and bottom cones are passive radiators.]]

In the same way as a ported loudspeaker, a passive radiator system uses the sound otherwise trapped in the enclosure to excite a resonance that makes it easier for the speaker system to create the deepest pitches (e.g., [[bassline]]s). The passive radiator resonates at a frequency determined by its mass and the springiness of the air in the enclosure. It is tuned to the specific enclosure by varying its [[mass]] (e.g., by adding weight to the cone). Internal air pressure produced by movements of the active driver cone moves the passive radiator cone.&lt;ref&gt;http://audiojudgement.com/passive-radiator-speaker-design/ &lt;/ref&gt; This resonance simultaneously reduces the amount that the woofer has to move.

==Design considerations==
Passive radiators (PR's) are used instead of a [[reflex port]] for several reasons. In small volume enclosures tuned to low frequencies, the length of the required port becomes very large.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.subwoofer-builder.com/passive.htm &lt;/ref&gt; They are also used to reduce or eliminate the objectionable noises of port turbulence and compressive flow caused by high velocity airflow in small ports. In addition, ports have pipe resonances that can produce undesired effects on frequency response.

Passive radiators are tuned by mass variations (M&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;), changing the way their compliance interacts with motion of the air in the box. The weight of the cone of the passive radiator should be approximately equivalent to the mass of the air that would have filled the port which might have been used for that design.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The frequency response of a passive radiator will be similar to that of a ported cabinet, but the system low frequency roll-off will be slightly steeper due to a [[Band-stop filter|notch]] (dip) in [[frequency response]] caused by the V&lt;sub&gt;ap&lt;/sub&gt; (compliance or stiffness) of the passive radiator.  This notch occurs at the PR's free-air resonant frequency and causes slightly poorer transient response.  Despite this, perhaps due to the lack of vent turbulence and vent pipe resonances, many prefer the sound of PRs to reflex ports. PR speakers are only slightly more complex to design and are generally more expensive as compared to standard bass reflex enclosures.

==Applications==
Passive radiators are used in [[Bluetooth]] Speakers ([[JBL]] uses the technology in their whole lineup excluding their voice-activated speakers and the Clip series), [[home stereo]] speakers, [[subwoofer]] cabinets and [[car audio]] speaker systems, particularly in cases where there is not enough space for a port or vent system. While most [[studio monitor speaker]]s are either ported bass reflex designs, or closed-back without a vent or passive radiator, [[Mackie]]'s HR824 and HR624 monitor speakers have a passive radiator installed on the rear of the cabinet. Focal also sells a studio monitor with a passive radiator called the SM9.

[[File:Peptide coupling.svg|thumb|right|Coupling of two [[amino acid]]s in solution. The unprotected amine of one reacts with the unprotected carboxylic acid group of the other to form a [[peptide bond]]. The second reactive group (amine/acid) in each of the starting materials bears a [[protecting group]].]]

In [[organic chemistry]], '''peptide synthesis''' is the production of [[peptide]]s, compounds where multiple [[amino acid]]s are linked via amide bonds, also known as [[peptide bond]]s. Peptides are chemically synthesized by  the condensation reaction of the [[carboxyl group]] of one amino acid to the [[amine group|amino group]] of another. [[Protecting group]] strategies are usually necessary to prevent undesirable side reactions with the various amino acid side chains.&lt;ref name="Isidro-Llobet09"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Isidro-Llobet A, Alvarez M, Albericio F | title = Amino acid-protecting groups | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 109 | issue = 6 | pages = 2455–504 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19364121 | doi = 10.1021/cr800323s | ref = Isidro-Llobet09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical peptide synthesis most commonly starts at the carboxyl end of the peptide (C-terminus), and proceeds toward the amino-terminus (N-terminus).&lt;ref name="chan00"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chan|first1=W.

The chemical synthesis of peptides can be carried out using classical solution-phase techniques, although these have been replaced in most research and development settings by solid-phase methods (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaradat|first=Da’san M. M.|date=2017-11-28|title=Thirteen decades of peptide synthesis: key developments in solid phase peptide synthesis and amide bond formation utilized in peptide ligation|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-017-2516-0|journal=Amino Acids|language=en|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–68|doi=10.1007/s00726-017-2516-0|issn=0939-4451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solution-phase synthesis retains its usefulness in large-scale production of peptides for industrial purposes however.

Chemical synthesis facilitates the production of peptides which are difficult to [[Protein production|express]] in bacteria, the incorporation of unnatural amino acids, peptide/protein backbone modification, and the synthesis of D-proteins, which consist of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|D-amino acids]].

==Solid-phase synthesis==
[[File:Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).svg|thumb|right|500px|upright=4.1|Solid-phase synthesis of a dipeptide using an ([[amine]]-functionalized) [[amide]] resin. The N-terminal protecting group (PG) can be [[Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Fmoc]] or [[tert-Butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Boc]], depending on the protecting group scheme used (see below). The amino acid side chains (R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; etc.) are [[protecting group#orthogonal protection|orthogonally protected]] (not shown).]]

The established method for the production of synthetic peptides in the lab is known as solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).&lt;ref name="chan00" /&gt; Pioneered by [[Robert Bruce Merrifield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merrifield RB | author-link = Robert Bruce Merrifield | title = Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. I. The Synthesis of a Tetrapeptide | year = 1963 | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | volume = 85 | issue = 14 | pages = 2149–2154 | doi = 10.1021/ja00897a025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell AR | title = Bruce Merrifield and solid-phase peptide synthesis: a historical assessment | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–84 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18213693 | doi = 10.1002/bip.20925 | ref = Mitchell08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SPPS allows the rapid assembly of a peptide chain through successive reactions of amino acid derivatives on an insoluble porous support.

The solid support consists of small, polymeric resin beads functionalized with reactive groups (such as amine or hydroxyl groups) that link to the nascent peptide chain.&lt;ref name="chan00" /&gt; Since the peptide remains covalently attached to the support throughout the synthesis, excess reagents and side products can be removed by washing and filtration. This approach circumvents the comparatively time-consuming isolation of the product peptide from solution after each reaction step, which would be required when using conventional solution-phase synthesis.

Each amino acid to be coupled to the peptide chain N-terminus must be [[protecting group|protected]] on its N-terminus and side chain using appropriate protecting groups such as [[tert-Butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Boc]] (acid-labile) or [[Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Fmoc]] (base-labile), depending on the side chain and the protection strategy used (see below).&lt;ref name="Isidro-Llobet09" /&gt; 

The general SPPS procedure is one of repeated cycles of alternate N-terminal deprotection and coupling reactions. The resin can be washed between each steps.&lt;ref name="chan00" /&gt; First an amino acid is coupled to the resin. Subsequently, the amine is deprotected, and then coupled with the free acid of the second amino acid. This cycle repeats until the desired sequence has been synthesized. SPPS cycles may also include capping steps which block the ends of unreacted amino acids from reacting. At the end of the synthesis, the crude peptide is cleaved from the solid support while simultaneously removing all protecting groups using a reagent strong acids like trifluoroacetic acid or a nucleophile.&lt;ref name="chan00" /&gt; The crude peptide can be precipitated from a non-polar solvent like diethyl ether in order to remove organic soluble by products. The crude peptide can be purified using [[High-performance liquid chromatography|reversed-phase HPLC]].&lt;ref name="Mant07"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mant|first1=Colin T.|last2=Chen|first2=Yuxin|last3=Yan|first3=Zhe|last4=Popa|first4=Traian V.|last5=Kovacs|first5=James M.|last6=Mills|first6=Janine B.|last7=Tripet|first7=Brian P.|last8=Hodges|first8=Robert S. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Peptide Characterization and Application Protocols|date=2007|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-59745-430-8|pages=3–55| doi = 10.1007/978-1-59745-430-8_1 |ref=Mant07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purification process, especially of longer peptides can be challenging, because small amounts of several byproducts, which are very similar to the product, have to be removed. For this reason so-called continuous chromatography processes such as [[Multicolumn countercurrent solvent gradient purification|MCSGP]] are increasingly being used in commercial settings to maximize the yield without sacrificing on purity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundemann-Hombourger|first=Olivier|date=May 2013|title=The ideal peptide plant|url=https://www.polypeptide.com/web/upload/medias/1401701074538c42d265d03.pdf|journal=Speciality Chemicals Magazine|volume=|pages=30–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPPS is limited by [[chemical yield|reaction yields]], and typically peptides and proteins in the range of 70 amino acids are pushing the limits of synthetic accessibility.&lt;ref name="chan00" /&gt; Synthetic difficulty also is sequence dependent; typically aggregation-prone sequences such as [[amyloid]]s&lt;ref name="Tickler04"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tickler|first1=A.

Longer lengths can be accessed by using ligation approaches such as [[native chemical ligation]], where two shorter fully deprotected synthetic peptides can be joined together in solution.

==Peptide coupling reagents==
An important feature that has enabled the broad application of SPPS is the generation of extremely high yields in the coupling step.&lt;ref name="chan00" /&gt; Highly efficient [[amide]] bond-formation conditions are required.&lt;ref&gt;To illustrate the impact of suboptimal coupling yields for a given synthesis, consider the case where each coupling step were to have at least 99% yield: this would result in a 77% overall crude yield for a 26-amino acid peptide (assuming 100% yield in each deprotection); if each coupling were 95% efficient, the overall yield would be 25%. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El-Faham11"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = El-Faham A, Albericio F | title = Peptide coupling reagents, more than a letter soup | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 111 | issue = 11 | pages = 6557–602 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21866984 | doi = 10.1021/cr100048w | ref = El-Faham11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montalbetti05"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montalbetti|first1=Christian A.

The minimization of amino acid [[racemization]] during coupling is also of vital importance to avoid [[epimer]]ization in the final peptide product.
 
Amide bond formation between an amine and carboxylic acid [[amide#amide synthesis|is slow]], and as such usually requires  'coupling reagents' or 'activators'. Activation of the carboxyl group generally involves the formation of an '[[active ester]]' ''in situ''. A selection of peptide coupling reagents are described below&lt;ref name="El-Faham11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Montalbetti05" /&gt;are .

===Carbodiimides===
[[File:DIC HOBt coupling.svg|thumb|[[Amide]] bond formation using DIC/HOBt.&lt;ref name="Montalbetti05" /&gt;]]
[[Carbodiimide]]s such as [[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]] (DCC) and [[diisopropylcarbodiimide]] (DIC) are frequently used for amide bond formation.&lt;ref name="Montalbetti05" /&gt; The reaction proceeds via the formation of a highly reactive ''O''-acyliso[[urea]]. This reactive intermediate is attacked by the peptide N-terminal amine, forming a peptide bond. Formation of the ''O''-acyliso[[urea]] proceeds fastest in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Sandeep|date=January 2018|title=CarboMAX - Enhanced Peptide Coupling at Elevated Temperatures|url=https://cem.com/media/contenttype/media/literature/ap0124v2-cem.pdf|journal=AP Note|volume= 0124|pages=1–5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIC is particularly useful for SPPS since as a liquid it is easily dispensed, and the [[urea]] byproduct ([[N,N'-Diisopropylcarbodiimide]] is easily washed away. Conversely, the related carbodiimide [[1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide]] (EDC) is often used for solution-phase peptide couplings as its urea byproduct can be removed by washing during aqueous [[Work-up (chemistry)|work-up]].&lt;ref name="Montalbetti05" /&gt;

[[File:HOBT.png|thumb|left|100px|HOBt]]
[[File:1-hydroxy-7-aza-benzotriazole.svg|thumb|100px|left|HOAt]]
[[File:HOAt neighbouring.gif|thumb|200px|right|Neighbouring group effect of HOAt]]

Carbodiimide activation opens the possibility for [[racemization]] of the activated amino acid.&lt;ref name="Montalbetti05" /&gt; Racemization can be circumvented with 'racemization suppressing' additives such as the [[triazole]]s [[hydroxybenzotriazole|1-hydroxy-benzotriazole]] (HOBt), and [[1-Hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole|1-hydroxy-7-aza-benzotriazole]] (HOAt). These reagents attack the ''O''-acylisourea intermediate to form an [[active ester]], which subsequently reacts with the peptide to form the desired peptide bond.&lt;ref name=Joullié&gt;{{cite journal|journal=ARKIVOC|year=2010|volume=viii|pages=189-250|title=Evolution of Amide Bond Formation|authors=Madeleine M. Joullié, Kenneth M. Lassen|url=http://www.arkat-usa.org/get-file/34631/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ethyl cyanohydroxyiminoacetate]] (Oxyma), an additive for carbodiimide coupling, acts as an alternative to HOAt.&lt;ref name="subiros09"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Subirós-Funosas R, Prohens R, Barbas R, El-Faham A, Albericio F | title = Oxyma: an efficient additive for peptide synthesis to replace the benzotriazole-based HOBt and HOAt with a lower risk of explosion | journal = Chemistry | volume = 15 | issue = 37 | pages = 9394–403 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19575348 | doi = 10.1002/chem.200900614 | ref = subiros09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aminium/uronium and phosphonium salts===
[[File:uronium peptide coupling reagents HATU HBTU HCTU COMU.svg|thumb|300px|right|Uronium-based peptide coupling reagents]]

Some coupling reagents omit the carbodiimide completely and incorporate the HOAt/HOBt moiety as an aminium/uronium or [[phosphonium]] salt of a non-[[nucleophilic]] anion ([[tetrafluoroborate]] or [[hexafluorophosphate]]).&lt;ref name="El-Faham11" /&gt; Examples of aminium/uronium reagents include [[HATU]] (HOAt), [[HBTU]]/[[TBTU]] (HOBt) and [[HCTU]] (6-ClHOBt). HBTU and TBTU differ only in the choice of anion. Phosphonium reagents include [[PyBOP]] (HOBt) and [[PyAOP]] (HOAt).

These reagents form the same active ester species as the carbodiimide activation conditions, but differ in the rate of the initial activation step, which is determined by nature of the  carbon skeleton of the coupling reagent.&lt;ref name="Albericio98"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albericio|first1=Fernando|last2=Bofill|first2=Josep M.|last3=El-Faham|first3=Ayman|last4=A.

Chem.|date=1998|volume=63|issue=26|pages=9678–9683|doi=10.1021/jo980807y|accessdate=|ref=Albericio98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, aminium/uronium reagents are capable of reacting with the peptide N-terminus to form an inactive [[guanidine|guanidino]] by-product, whereas as phosphonium reagents are not.

==Solid supports==
[[File:Poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene).png|thumb|right|288px|Cross-linked polystyrene is the most common solid support used in SPPS.]]
Solid supports for peptide synthesis are selected for physically stability, to permit the rapid filtration of liquids.  Suitable supports are inert to reagents and solvents used during SPPS, although they must swell in the solvents used to allow for penetration of the reagents, and  allow for the attachment of the first amino acid.&lt;ref name=AlbericioPractical00&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Albericio F | title = Solid-Phase Synthesis: A Practical Guide | year = 2000 | location = Boca Raton | edition = 1 | publisher = CRC Press | page = 848 | isbn = 978-0-8247-0359-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three primary types of solid supports are: gel-type supports, surface-type supports, and composites.&lt;ref name=AlbericioPractical00/&gt;  Improvements to solid supports used for peptide synthesis enhance their ability to withstand the repeated use of TFA during the deprotection step of SPPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feinberg RS, Merrifield RB | title = Zinc chloride-catalyzed chloromethylation of resins for solid phase peptide synthesis | year = 1974 | journal = Tetrahedron  | volume =  30| issue = 17 | pages = 3209–3212 | doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)97575-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two primary resins are used, based on whether a C-terminal carboxylic acid or amide is desired. The Wang resin was, {{as of|1996|lc=y}}, the most commonly used resin for peptides with C-terminal carboxylic acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4020(97)00279-2 | vauthors = Hermkens PH, Ottenheijm HC, Rees DC | title = Solid-phase organic reactions II: A review of the literature Nov 95 – Nov 96 | year = 1997 | journal = Tetrahedron  | volume = 53 | issue = 16 | pages = 5643–5678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=September 2018}}

==Protecting groups schemes==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

As described above, the use of N-terminal and side chain [[protecting groups]] is essential during peptide synthesis to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as self-coupling of the activated amino acid leading to ([[polymerization]]).&lt;ref name="Isidro-Llobet09" /&gt; This would compete with the intended peptide coupling reaction, resulting in low yield or even complete failure to synthesize the desired peptide.

Two principle [[protecting group#orthogonal protection|orthogonal]] protecting group schemes exist for use in solid-phase peptide synthesis: so-called Boc/Bzl and Fmoc/''t''Bu approaches.&lt;ref name="chan00" /&gt; The Boc/Bzl strategy utilizes [[trifluoroacetic acid|TFA]]-labile N-terminal [[tert-Butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Boc]] protection alongside side chain protection that is removed using anhydrous [[hydrogen fluoride]] during the final cleavage step (with simultaneous cleavage of the peptide from the solid support). Fmoc/tBu SPPS uses base-labile [[Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Fmoc]] N-terminal protection, with side chain protection and a resin linkage that are acid-labile (final acidic cleavage is carried out via TFA treatment).

Both approaches, including the advantages and disadvantages of each, are outlined in more detail below.

===Boc/Bzl SPPS===
{{Main|Tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group}}
[[File:Boc deprotection peptide.svg|thumb|500px|Cleavage of the Boc group]]
The original method for peptide synthesis relied on ''tert''-butyloxycarbonyl (or more simply 'Boc') as a temporary N-terminal α-amino protecting group. The Boc group is removed with acid, such as [[trifluoroacetic acid]] (TFA). This forms a positively charged amino group in the presence of excess TFA (note that the amino group is not protonated in the image on the right), which is neutralized and coupled to the incoming activated amino acid.&lt;ref name=KentBocNeutr07&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10989-006-9059-7 | vauthors = Schnolzer MA, Jones A, Alewood D, Kent SB | title = In Situ Neutralization in Boc-chemistry Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis | year = 2007 | journal = Int. J. Peptide Res. Therap. | volume = 13 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 31–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutralization can either occur prior to coupling or ''in situ'' during the basic coupling reaction.

The Boc/Bzl approach retains its usefulness in reducing peptide [[Particle aggregation|aggregation]] during synthesis..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0040-4039(92)80014-B | vauthors = Beyermann M, Bienert M | title = Synthesis of difficult peptide sequences: A comparison of Fmoc-and BOC-technique | year = 1992 | journal = Tetrahedron Letters  | volume = 33 | issue = 26 | pages = 3745–3748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Boc/Bzl SPPS may be preferred over the Fmoc/''t''Bu approach when synthesizing peptides containing base-sensitive moieties (such as [[depsipeptide]]s), as treatment with base is required during the Fmoc deprotection step (see below).

Permanent side-chain protecting groups used during Boc/Bzl SPPS are typically benzyl or benzyl-based groups.&lt;ref name="Isidro-Llobet09" /&gt; Final removal of the peptide from the solid support occurs simultaneously with side chain deprotection using anhydrous [[hydrogen fluoride]] via hydrolytic cleavage. The final product is a fluoride salt which is relatively easy to solubilize. Scavengers such as [[cresol]] must be added to the HF in order to prevent reactive ''t''-butyl cations from generating undesired products. A disadvantage of this approach is the potential for degradation of the peptide by hydrogen fluoride.

===Fmoc/''t''Bu SPPS===
{{See also|Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protecting group}}
[[File:Fmoc-PG_Cleavage.png|thumb|300px|right|'''Cleavage of the Fmoc group.''' Treatment of the Fmoc-protected amine with [[piperidine]] results in proton abstraction from the [[methine group]] of the [[fluorene|fluorenyl]] ring system. This leads to release of a [[carbamate]], which decomposes into carbon dioxide ([[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and the free amine. [[Dibenzofulvene]] is also generated. This reaction is able to occur due to the acidity of the  [[fluorene|fluorenyl]] proton, resulting from stabilization of the [[aromatic]] anion formed. The [[dibenzofulvene]] by-product can react with [[nucleophiles]] such as the piperidine (which is in large excess), or potentially the released amine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Jones J | date = 1992 | title = Amino Acid and Peptide Synthesis | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The use of N-terminal [[Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Fmoc]] protection allows for a milder deprotection scheme than used for Boc/Bzl SPPS, and this protection scheme is truly orthogonal under SPPS conditions. Fmoc deprotection utilizes a base, typically 20–50% [[piperidine]] in [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]].&lt;ref name=AlbericioPractical00/&gt; The exposed amine is therefore neutral, and consequently no neutralization of the peptide-resin is required, as in the case of the Boc/Bzl approach. The lack of electrostatic repulsion between the peptide chains can lead to increased risk of aggregation with Fmoc/''t''Bu SPPS however. Because the liberated fluorenyl group is a chromophore, Fmoc deprotection can be monitored by UV absorbance of the reaction mixture, a strategy which is employed in automated peptide synthesizers.

The ability of the Fmoc group to be cleaved under relatively mild basic conditions while being stable to acid allows the use of side chain protecting groups such as Boc and ''t''Bu that can be removed in milder acidic final cleavage conditions (TFA) than those used for final cleavage in Boc/Bzl SPPS (HF). Scavengers such as water and [[triisopropylsilane]] (TIPS) are added during the final cleavage in order to prevent side reactions with reactive cationic species released as a result of side chain deprotection. The resulting crude peptide is obtained as a TFA salt, which is potentially more difficult to solubilize than the fluoride salts generated in Boc SPPS.

Fmoc/''t''Bu SPPS is less [[Atom economy|atom-economical]], as the fluorenyl group is much larger than the Boc group. Accordingly, prices for Fmoc amino acids were high until the large-scale piloting of one of the first synthesized peptide drugs, [[enfuvirtide]], began in the 1990s, when market demand adjusted the relative prices of Fmoc- vs Boc- amino acids.

===Other protecting groups===

====Benzyloxy-carbonyl====
{{See also|Carboxybenzyl}}
The  (Z) group is another carbamate-type amine protecting group, first used by [[Max Bergmann]] in the synthesis of oligopeptides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =  Über ein allgemeines Verfahren der Peptid-Synthese | journal = [[Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft]] | volume = 65 | issue = 7 | pages = 1192–1201 | year =  1932 | doi = 10.1002/cber.19320650722 | last1 = Bergmann | first1 = Max | last2 = Zervas | first2 = Leonidas | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink1 = Max Bergmann }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is removed under harsh conditions using [[hydrogen bromide|HBr]] in [[acetic acid]], or milder conditions of catalytic [[hydrogenation]].  While it has been used periodically for α-amine protection in peptide synthesis, it is almost exclusively used for side chain protection.

====Alloc and miscellaneous groups====
The allyloxycarbonyl (alloc) protecting group is sometimes used to protect an amino group (or carboxylic acid or alcohol group) when an [[orthogonal deprotection]] scheme is required. It is also sometimes used when conducting on-resin cyclic peptide formation, where the peptide is linked to the resin by a side-chain functional group. The Alloc group can be removed using [[tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(97)01690-0| title = Use of Alloc-amino acids in solid-phase peptide synthesis.

For special applications like synthetic steps involving [[protein microarray]]s, protecting groups sometimes termed "lithographic" are used, which are amenable to [[photochemistry]] at a particular wavelength of light, and so which can be removed during [[lithography|lithographic]] types of operations.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

===Regioselective disulfide bond formation===
The formation of multiple native disulfides remains challenging of native peptide synthesis by solid-phase methods. Random chain combination typically results in several products with nonnative disulfide bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00017a044 | author = Zhang, J.-W. | last2 = Wu | year = 1991 | first2 = Cui Rong | last3 = Liu | first3 = Wen | last4 = Zhang | first4 = Jing Wen | name-list-format = vanc | title = Disulfide bond formation in peptides by dimethyl sulfoxide. Scope and applications | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 113 | pages = 6657–6662 | issue = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stepwise formation of disulfide bonds is typically the preferred method, and performed with thiol protecting groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sieber P, Kamber B, Hartmann A, Jöhl A, Riniker B, Rittel W | title = [Total synthesis of human insulin. IV. Description of the final steps (author's transl)] | journal = Helvetica Chimica Acta | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–37 | date = January 1977 | pmid = 838597 | doi = 10.1002/hlca.19770600105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different thiol protecting groups provide multiple dimensions of orthogonal protection. These orthogonally protected cysteines are incorporated during the solid-phase synthesis of the peptide. Successive removal of these groups, to allow for selective exposure of free thiol groups, leads to disulfide formation in a stepwise manner. The order of removal of the groups must be considered so that only one group is removed at a time.

Thiol protecting groups used in peptide synthesis requiring later regioselective disulfide bond formation must possess multiple characteristics.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{verification needed|date=November 2016}} First, they must be reversible with conditions that do not affect the unprotected side chains. Second, the protecting group must be able to withstand the conditions of solid-phase synthesis. Third, the removal of the thiol protecting group must be such that it leaves intact other thiol protecting groups, if orthogonal protection is desired. That is, the removal of PG A should not affect PG B. Some of the thiol protecting groups commonly used include the acetamidomethyl (Acm), tert-butyl (But), 3-nitro-2-pyridine sulfenyl (NPYS), 2-pyridine-sulfenyl (Pyr), and [[trityl]] (Trt) groups.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Importantly, the NPYS group can replace the Acm PG to yield an activated thiol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ottl J, Battistuta R, Pieper M, Tschesche H, Bode W, Kühn K, Moroder L | title = Design and synthesis of heterotrimeric collagen peptides with a built-in cystine-knot.

==Microwave-assisted peptide synthesis==
{{see also|microwave chemistry}}
Microwave-assisted peptide synthesis has been used to complete long peptide sequences with high degrees of yield and low degrees of racemization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Chem. Soc.

==Synthesizing long peptides==
Stepwise elongation, in which the amino acids are connected step-by-step in turn, is ideal for small peptides containing between 2 and 100 amino acid residues. Another method is [[fragment condensation]], in which peptide fragments are coupled. Although the former can elongate the peptide chain without [[racemization]], the yield drops if only it is used in the creation of long or highly polar peptides. Fragment condensation is better than stepwise elongation for synthesizing sophisticated long peptides, but its use must be restricted in order to protect against racemization. Fragment condensation is also undesirable since the coupled fragment must be in gross excess, which may be a limitation depending on the length of the fragment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

A new development for producing longer peptide chains is [[chemical ligation]]: unprotected peptide chains react chemoselectively in aqueous solution. A first kinetically controlled product rearranges to form the amide bond. The most common form of [[native chemical ligation]] uses a peptide thioester that reacts with a terminal cysteine residue.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Other methods applicable for covalently linking polypeptides in aqueous solution include the use of split [[intein]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aranko AS, Wlodawer A, Iwaï H | title = Nature's recipe for splitting inteins | journal = Protein Engineering, Design &amp; Selection | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 263–71 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25096198 | pmc = 4133565 | doi = 10.1093/protein/gzu028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; spontaneous isopeptide bond formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddington SC, Howarth M | title = Secrets of a covalent interaction for biomaterials and biotechnology: SpyTag and SpyCatcher | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 29 | pages = 94–9 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26517567 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sortase]] ligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haridas V, Sadanandan S, Dheepthi NU | title = Sortase-based bio-organic strategies for macromolecular synthesis | journal = Chembiochem | volume = 15 | issue = 13 | pages = 1857–67 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25111709 | doi = 10.1002/cbic.201402013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to optimize synthesis of long [[peptides]], a method was developed in [[Medicon Valley]] for converting [[peptide sequence]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  The simple pre-sequence (e.g. [[Lysine]] (Lysn); [[Glutamic Acid]] (Glun); (LysGlu)n) that is incorporated at the [[C-terminus]] of the peptide to induce an [[alpha-helix]]-like structure.

==Cyclic peptides==

===On resin cyclization===
Peptides can be [[Cyclic peptide|cyclized]] on a solid support. A variety of cylization reagents can be used such as HBTU/HOBt/DIEA, PyBop/DIEA, PyClock/DIEA.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Head-to-tail peptides can be made on the solid support. The deprotection of the C-terminus at some suitable point allows on-resin cyclization by amide bond formation with the deprotected N-terminus. Once cyclization has taken place, the peptide is cleaved from resin by acidolysis and purified.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

The strategy for the solid-phase synthesis of cyclic peptides in not limited to attachment through Asp, Glu or Lys side chains. Cysteine has a very reactive sulfhydryl group on its side chain. A disulfide bridge is created when a sulfur atom from one Cysteine forms a single covalent bond with another sulfur atom from a second cysteine in a different part of the protein. These bridges help to stabilize proteins, especially those secreted from cells. Some researchers use modified cysteines using S-acetomidomethyl (Acm) to block the formation of the disulfide bond but preserve the cysteine and the protein's original primary structure.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Off-resin cyclization===
Off-resin cyclization is a solid-phase synthesis of key intermediates, followed by the key cyclization in solution phase, the final deprotection of any masked side chains is also carried out in solution phase.  This has the disadvantages that the efficiencies of solid-phase synthesis are lost in the solution phase steps, that purification from by-products, reagents and unconverted material is required, and that undesired [[oligomer]]s can be formed if [[macrocycle]] formation is involved.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{Cite book| first = Peter | last = Scott | name-list-format = vanc | title = Linker Strategies in Solid-Phase Organic Synthesis|date=13 October 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-74905-0|pages=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1966">'''Physiological agonism''' describes the action of a substance which ultimately produces the same effects in the body as another substance—as if they were both [[Receptor agonist|agonists]] at the same [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]—without actually binding to the same receptor. '''Physiological antagonism''' describes the behavior of a substance that produces effects counteracting those of another substance (a result similar to that produced by an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] blocking the action of an agonist at the same receptor) using a mechanism that does not involve binding to the same receptor.

==Examples==

===Physiological agonists===
*[[Epinephrine]] induces [[platelet aggregation]], and so does [[hepatocyte growth factor]] (HGF).&lt;ref name="pmid 16083876"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietrapiana|first=D|author2=Sala, M |author3=Prat, M |author4= Sinigaglia, F |title=Met identification on human platelets: role of hepatocyte growth factor in the modulation of platelet activation.|journal=FEBS Letters|date=Aug 15, 2005|volume=579|issue=20|pages=4550–4|pmid=16083876|doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2005.06.072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they are physiological agonists to each other.

===Physiological antagonists===
*There are several substances that have [[Histamine antagonist|antihistaminergic]] action despite not being [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] for the [[histamine receptor]]. For instance, epinephrine raises arterial pressure through vasoconstriction mediated by A1-[[adrenergic receptor]] activation, in contrast to [[histamine]], which lowers arterial pressure. Thus, despite not being true antihistamines because they do not bind to and block the histamine receptor, epinephrine and other such substances are physiological antagonists to histamine.

==Discovery==
At the end of the 1990s with the European project "Picodiv" it would be clarified which [[organism]]s occur in [[picoplankton]]. In addition, for a period of two years, samples were taken in the Atlantic, in the Mediterranean, before the coast of Scotland, Alaska and Norway. Picobiliphyta were found particularly within the nutrient-poor ranges from cold coastal seas, where they can constitute up to 50 percent of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].

==Affinities to other organisms==
[[Research]]ers investigated gene sequences of the [[18S ribosomal RNA]] gene, common to all [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. The identity of new organisms can be deduced from a comparison of familiar and unfamiliar gene sequences. “The gene sequences found in these algae could not be associated with any previously known group of organisms”, explain Dr Klaus Valentin and Dr. Linda Medlin, co-authors of the study and [[Molecular biology|molecular biologists]] at the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]] in [[Bremerhaven]]. The algae in this study were found in plankton samples originating from various regions of the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The scientists have discovered a group of organisms which, despite being completely new to science, have a wide distribution. “This is a good indication for how much there is still to discover in the oceans, especially using molecular tools”, says Valentin.

Apart from the unfamiliar gene sequences, the researchers also detected [[phycobiliprotein]]s.&lt;ref name="urlBizarre New Form of Life Found in Arctic Ocean, Scientists Announce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/01/070111-new-lifeform.html |title=Bizarre New Form of Life Found in Arctic Ocean, Scientists Announce |website= |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[red algae]], for example, these proteins occur as pigments. But in this newly discovered group of algae, the phycobiliproteins appear to be contained inside the [[plastid]]s,&lt;ref name="isbn3-540-68692-4"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Henrik Aronsson |author2=Anna Stina Sandelius |title=The Chloroplast: Interactions with the Environment (Plant Cell Monographs) |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2008 |pages=9 |isbn=978-3-540-68692-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[photosynthesis]] occurs. Hence, it provides a clear indication that the researchers are dealing with previously unidentified group of algae. Referring to their small size and the presence of phycobiliproteins, the researchers named the new group "Picobiliphyta".

Two studies published in 2011 found the hypothesis that biliphytes, or picobiliphytes, were photosynthetic was likely to be false. A 2011 study by an international team from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Dalhousie University and the Natural History Museum London found that cells in the Pacific Ocean did not have fluorescence indicative of photosynthetic pigments, and concluded "...biliphytes are likely not obligate photoautotrophs but rather facultative mixotrophs or phagotrophs, whereby transient detection of orange fluorescence could represent ingested
prey items (e.g., the cyanobacterium Synechococcus)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Some sources group picobiliphytes within the [[cryptomonads-haptophytes assemblage]].&lt;ref name="urlEukaryotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Eukaryotes/3 |title=Eukaryotes |format= |website= |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, Dr. Seenivasan working in conjunction with Professors [[Michael Melkonian]] (University of Cologne) and Linda Medlin (Marine Biological Association of the UK) formally described the picobiliphytes as the heterotrophic nanoflagellate phylum, Picozoa, and published thin sections of the cells.  Several unique features in the cell, such as a feeding organelle, substantiate their unique phylogenetic position, an unusual movement, and heterotrophic mode of nutrition.  No traces of viral or bacterial particles were found inside these heterotrophic cells, which prompted these authors to suggest that they feed on organic particles. see link to Picozoa

*Picobiliphytes have been considered autotrophic algae; there is, however, a strong question mark over this fact. In a recent study there has been a thorough search for genes from plastid origin in three different picobiliphytes that has been unsuccessful. In this analysis several sequencing techniques have been applied and, with the help of comparative genomic tools, the authors have demonstrated that Picobilihytes have complex relationships with other microorganisms including virus, but they could not find any trace of plastid encoded genes.  These results strongly suggest that Picobiliphytes are most likely heterotrophic rather than autotrophic.  They have now been formally described as a heterotrophic nanoflagellate phylum, PIcozoa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26675">'''Reflectometry''' uses the [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] of [[wave]]s at [[interface (matter)|surfaces and interfaces]] to detect or characterize objects.

There are many different forms of reflectometry. They can be classified in several ways: by the used radiation (electromagnetic, ultrasound, particle beams), by the geometry of wave propagation (unguided versus wave guides or cables), by the involved length scales (wavelength and [[penetration depth]] versus size of the investigated object), by the method of measurement (continuous versus pulsed, polarization resolved, ...), and by the application domain.

== Used radiation ==

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] of widely varying wavelength is used in many different forms of reflectometry:
* [[Radar]] and [[Lidar]]: Reflections of electromagnetic pulses are used to detect the presence and to measure the location and speed of objects like aircraft, missiles, ships, cars.
* Characterization of Semiconductor and Dielectric Thin Films: Analysis of reflectance data utilizing the [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|Forouhi Bloomer dispersion equations]] can determine the thickness, [[refractive index]], and [[Complex index of refraction|extinction coefficient]] of thin films utilized in the [[semiconductor]] industry.
* [[X-ray reflectometry]]: is a surface-sensitive analytical technique used in chemistry, physics, and materials science to characterize surfaces, thin films and multilayers.
Propagation of electric pulses in [[electric cable|cable]]s is used to detect and localize defects in electric wiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1 =M.K. | last1=Smail |first2 =T. |last2=Hacib |first3=L. |last3=Pichon |first4=F. |last4=Loete |title =Detection and Location of Defects in Wiring Networks Using Time-Domain Reflectometry and Neural Networks  | journal =IEEE Transactions on magnetics|year = 2011 | volume = 47| issue = 5 | pages = 1502–1505 | doi = 10.1109/TMAG.2010.2089503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 =C.  |last1 =Furse |first2 = R. |last2 = Haupt |title = Down to the wire: The hidden hazard of aging aircraft wiring |journal = IEEE Spectrum | year = 2001 | volume = 38 | issue = 2 |pages = 35–39 |doi = 10.1109/6.898797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] reflectometry: A [[transducer]] generates [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] waves which propagates until it reaches the interface between the propagation medium and the sample. The wave is partially reflected at the interface and partially transmitted into the sample. The waves reflected at the interface travel back to the transducer, then the [[Acoustic impedance|impedance]] of a sample is determined by measuring the [[amplitude]] of the wave reflected from the propagation medium/sample interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = D.J. | last1 = McClements | first2 = P. | last2 =Fairley | title =Ultrasonic pulse echo reflectometer | journal = Ultrasonics | year = 1990| volume = 29 | issue = 1 |pages = 58–62 |doi = 10.1016/0041-624X(91)90174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the reflected wave, it is possible to determine some properties of the sample that is desired to characterize. Applications include [[medical ultrasonography]] and [[nondestructive testing]].

[[Neutron reflectometry]]: is a [[neutron diffraction]] technique for measuring the structure of [[thin film]]s, similar to the often complementary techniques of X-ray reflectivity and [[ellipsometry]]. The technique provides valuable information over a wide variety of scientific and technological applications including [[Particle aggregation|chemical aggregation]], [[polymer]] and [[surfactant]] [[adsorption]], structure of thin film [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] systems, biological membranes.

== Skin reflectance ==
In anthropology, reflectometry devices are often used to gauge [[human skin color]] through the measurement of skin reflectance. These devices are typically pointed at the upper arm or forehead, with the emitted waves then interpreted at various percentages. Lower frequencies represent lower skin reflectance and thus darker pigmentation, whereas higher frequencies represent greater skin reflectance and therefore lighter pigmentation.&lt;ref name="JablonskiChaplin2000"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Jablonski, N. G., and G. Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2000|volume=39|issue=1|page=57|url=http://anth.la.psu.edu/research/research-labs/jablonski-lab/research/JablonskiLabskin.pdf|accessdate=30 August 2017|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different reflectometry techniques ==
Many techniques are based on the principle of reflectometry and are distinguished by the type of waves used and the analysis of the reflected signal. Among all these techniques, we can classify the main but not limited to:
* In [[time-domain reflectometry]] (TDR), one emits a train of fast pulses, and analyzes the magnitude, duration and shape of the reflected pulses.
* Frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR):&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = B.J. | last1 = Soller | first2 = D.K. | last2 =Gifford |first3 = M.S. | last3 = Wolfe |first4 = M.E. |last4 = Froggatt  | title =High resolution optical frequency domain reflectometry for characterization of components and assemblies | journal = Optics Express | year = 2005| volume = 13 | issue = 2 |pages = 666–674 |doi = 10.1364/OPEX.13.000666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=C. |last1=Furse |first2=You |last2=C.C. |last3=Dangol |first3=R |last4=Nielsen |first4=M. |last5=Mabey |first5=G. |last6=Woodward \first6=R. |title=Frequency-Domain Reflectometery for on-Board Testing of Aging Aircraft Wiring |journal=IEEE Transactions on electromagnetic compatibility |volume=45 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=306–315 |doi=10.1109/TEMC.2003.811305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this technique is based on the transmission of a set of stepped-frequency sine waves from the sample. As for the TDR, these waves propagate until the sample and are reflected back to the source. Several types of FDR exist and are commonly used in radar applications or characterization of cables/wires. The signal analysis is focused rather on the changes in frequency between the incident signal and the reflected signal.
* [[Ellipsometry]] is the polarization-resolved measurement of light reflections from thin films.

'''Scientific misconceptions''' are commonly held [[beliefs]] about science that have no basis in actual [[scientific fact]]. Scientific misconceptions can also refer to preconceived notions based on religious and/or cultural influences. Many scientific misconceptions occur because of faulty teaching styles and the sometimes distancing nature of true scientific texts.

== Types ==
Misconceptions (a.k.a. alternative conceptions, alternative frameworks, etc.) are a key issue from [[constructivism in science education]], a major theoretical perspective informing science teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K. S. (2011). Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction. In J. Hassaskhah (Ed.), Educational Theory (pp. 39-61). New York: Nova. From https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, '''scientific misconceptions''' have their foundations in a few "[[intuitive]] knowledge domains, including [[folkmechanics]] (object boundaries and movements), [[folkbiology]] (biological species' configurations and relationships), and [[folkpsychology]] (interactive agents and goal-directed behavior)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Altran S |author2=Norenzayan A |title=Religion's evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=713–30 |year=2004 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X04000172 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=311512 |pmid=16035401|citeseerx=10.1.1.687.8586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that enable humans to interact effectively with the world in which they evolved. That these folksciences do not map accurately onto modern scientific theory is not unexpected. A second major source of scientific misconceptions are instruction-induced or [[didaskalogenic]] misconceptions.

There has been extensive research into students' informal ideas about science topics, and studies have suggested reported misconceptions vary considerably in terms of properties such as coherence, stability, context-dependence, range of application etc.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K. S. (2009). Progressing Science Education: Constructing the scientific research programme into the contingent nature of learning science. Dordrecht: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Misconceptions can be broken down into five basic categories,[https://www.academia.edu/626065/EFFECTS_OF_LEARNER_MISCONCEPTIONS_ON_LEARNING (Alkhalifa, 2006)] 1) preconceived notions; 2) nonscientific beliefs; 3) conceptual misunderstandings; 4) vernacular misconceptions; and 5) factual misconceptions (e.g., Committee on Undergraduate Science Education, 1997).  Preconceived notions are thinking about a concept in only one way.  Specially heat, gravity, and energy.  Once a person knows how something works it is difficult to imagine it working a different way. Nonscientific beliefs are beliefs learned outside of scientific evidence.  For example, one’s beliefs about the history of world based on the bible.  Conceptual misunderstandings are ideas about what one thinks they understand based on their personal experiences or what they may have heard.  One does not fully grasp the concept and understand it.  Vernacular misconceptions happen when one word has two completely different meanings, specially in regard to science and everyday life. Factual misconceptions are ideas or beliefs that are learned at a young age but are actually incorrect.

While most student misconceptions go unrecognized, there has been an informal effort to identify errors and misconceptions present in textbooks. The [http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/BadScience.html Bad Science] web page, maintained by Alistair Fraser, is a good resource. Another important resource is the [http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/stcse.html Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education] (STCSE) website maintained by Reinders Duit. Another useful resource related to chemistry has been compiled by [http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/learnnet/miscon.htm Vanessa Barker].

== Identifying student misconceptions ==
In the context of [[Socratic instruction]], student misconceptions are identified and addressed through a process of questioning and listening. A number of strategies have been employed to understand what students are [[Belief bias|thinking prior]], or in response, to instruction. These strategies include various forms of "real type" feedback, which can involve the use of colored cards or electronic survey systems (clickers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martyn M |title=Clickers in the classroom: an active learning approach |journal=Educause Quarterly |volume=30 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=http://connect.educause.edu/Library/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/ClickersintheClassroomAnA/40032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is typified by the strategy known as "[[Just in Time Teaching]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jittdl.physics.iupui.edu/jitt/|title=www.jitt.org|author=|date=|website=jittdl.physics.iupui.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rozycki W |title=Just-in-Time Teaching |journal=J Indiana University Research &amp; Creative Activity |volume=XXII |issue=1 |pages=8 |year=1999 |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v22n1/p08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here students are asked various questions prior to class, the instructor uses these responses to adapt his or her teaching to the students' prior knowledge and misconceptions.

Finally, there is a more research-intensive approach that involves interviewing students for the purpose of generating the items that will make up a [[concept inventory]] or other forms of diagnostic instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K. S. (2002) Chemical misconceptions - prevention, diagnosis and cure, London: Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt; Concept inventories require intensive validation efforts. Perhaps the most influential of these concept inventories to date has been the Force Concept Inventory (FCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hestenes D |author2=Wells M |author3=Swackhamer G |title=Force Concept Inventory |journal=The Physics Teacher |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=141–58 |year=1992 |doi=10.1119/1.2343497 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=PHTEAH000030000003000141000001&amp;idtype=cvips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hestenes D |title=Who needs physics education research |journal=Am J Phys |volume=66 |issue= 6|pages=465–7 |year=1998 |doi=10.1119/1.18898 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=AJPIAS000066000006000465000001&amp;idtype=cvips}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concept inventories can be particularly helpful in identifying difficult ideas that serve as a barrier to effective instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Garvin-Doxas K |author2=Klymkowsky MW |title=Understanding randomness and its impact on student learning: lessons learned from building the Biology Concept Inventory (BCI) |journal=CBE Life Sci Educ |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=227–33 |year=2008 |pmid=18519614 |pmc=2424310 |doi=10.1187/cbe.07-08-0063 |url=http://www.lifescied.org/cgi/content/full/7/2/227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concept Inventories in natural selection&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nehm R, Schonfeld IS | year = 2008 | title = Measuring knowledge of natural selection: A comparison of the C.I.N.S., an open-response instrument, and an oral interview | url = http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/prospective/socialsci/psychology/faculty/upload/Nehm-Schonfeld-2008-JRST.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Research in Science Teaching | volume = 45 | issue = 10| pages = 1131–1160 | doi = 10.1002/tea.20251 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110517013711/http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/prospective/socialsci/psychology/faculty/upload/Nehm-Schonfeld-2008-JRST.pdf | archivedate = 2011-05-17 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nehm R, Schonfeld IS | year = 2010 | title = The future of natural selection knowledge measurement: A reply to Anderson ''et al.''

While not all the published diagnostic instruments have been developed as carefully as some concept inventories, some two-tier diagnostic instruments (which offer multiple choice distractors informed by misconceptions research, and then ask learners to give reasons for their choices) have been through rigorous development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/diagnostic%20instrument%20to%20determine%20a-level%20students%E2%80%99%20understanding%20of%20ionisation%20energy.html|title=The ECLIPSE Project|website=camtools.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In identifying students' misconceptions, first you can identify their preconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, T.T., &amp; Arsenault, M. (2017). Using test data to find misconceptions in secondary science. School Science Review 364(98) 31-36.&lt;/ref&gt; "Teachers need to know students' initial and developing conceptions. Students need to have their initial ideas brought to a conscious level." &lt;ref&gt;Minstrell, J. &amp; Kruas, P (2005) Guided Inquiry in the Science Classroom. How Students Learn: History, Mathematics, and Science in the Classroom. (478)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Addressing student misconceptions ==
A number of lines of evidence suggest that the recognition and revision of student misconceptions involves active, rather than passive, involvement with the material. A common approach to instruction involves meta-cognition, that is to encourage students to think about their thinking about a particular problem. In part this approach requires students to verbalize, defend and reformulate their understanding. Recognizing the realities of the modern classroom, a number of variations have been introduced. These include [[Eric Mazur]]'s peer instruction, as well as various tutorials in physics developed groups at [http://www.phys.washington.edu/groups/peg/tut.html University of Washington] and the [http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/abp/ University of Maryland]. Scientific inquiry is another technique that provides an active engagement opportunity for students and incorporates metacognition and critical thinking.

Success with inquiry-based learning activities relies on a deep foundation of [[factual knowledge]]. Students then use observation, imagination, and [[reasoning]] about scientific phenomena they are studying to organize knowledge within a conceptual framework.&lt;ref name=Bransford&gt;Bransford , J. D., Brown, A. L., &amp; Cocking, R. R. (2000). ''[[How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School (expanded edition)|How people learn: Brain, mind, experience, and school]]''. (Expanded ed., [http://www.csun.edu/~SB4310/How%20People%20Learn.pdf PDF]). Washington D.C.: National Academy Press, {{ISBN|0309070368}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bransford2005"&gt;Bransford, J.D.&amp; Donovan, M.S. (Eds).(2005). "Scientific Inquiry and How People Learn". How Students Learn: History, Mathematics and Science in the Classroom. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher monitors the changing concepts of the students through formative assessment as the instruction proceeds. Beginning inquiry activities should develop from simple concrete examples to more abstract.&lt;ref name="Bransford2005" /&gt; As students progress through inquiry, opportunities should be included for students to generate, ask, and discuss challenging questions. According to Magnusson and Palincsan,&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, S.J. &amp; Palincsar, A.S. (Eds).(2005). "Teaching to Promote the Development of Scientific Knowledge and Reasoning About Light at the Elementary School Level". How Students Learn: History, Mathematics and Science in the Classroom. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers should allow multiple cycles of investigation where students can ask the same questions as their understanding of the concept matures. Through strategies that apply formative assessment of student learning and adjust accordingly, teachers can help redirect scientific misconceptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">A '''short-term exposure limit''' ('''STEL''') is the acceptable average exposure over a short period of time, usually 15 minutes as long as the time-weighted average is not exceeded.  

STEL is a term used in [[occupational health]], [[industrial hygiene]] and [[toxicology]].  The STEL may be a [[law|legal]] limit in the [[United States]] for exposure of an employee to a [[chemical substance]].  The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (U.S. OSHA) has set OSHA-STELs for [[1,3-Butadiene]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10087 29CFR1910.1051]&lt;/ref&gt; [[benzene]]   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10042 29CFR1910.1028]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ethylene oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10070 29CFR1910.1047]&lt;/ref&gt;  For chemicals, STEL assessments are usually done for 15 minutes and expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm), or sometimes in [[milligram]]s per cubic meter (mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] publishes a more extensive list of  STELs as [[threshold limit value]]s (TLV-STEL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgih.org/home.htm American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''software system''' is a [[system]] on intercommunicating [[software component|components]] based on [[software]] forming part of a [[computer system]] (a combination of [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and software). It "''consists of a number of separate [[Computer program|programs]], [[configuration file]]s, which are used to set up these programs, [[system documentation]], which describes the structure of the system, and [[user documentation]], which explains how to use the system''".&lt;ref name="sommerville" /&gt;

While a [[computer program]] is a set of instructions ([[source code|source]], or [[object code]]) a software system has many more components such as specification, test results, end-user documentation, maintenance records, etc.&lt;ref name=penny &gt;''Software Maintenance: Concepts and Practice'' by Penny Grubb and Armstrong A. Takang 2003 {{ISBN|981238426X}} pages 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term "software system" should be distinguished from the terms "[[computer program]]" and "[[software]]". The term computer program generally refers to a set of instructions ([[source code|source]], or [[object code]]) that perform a specific task. However, a software system generally refers to a more encompassing concept with many more components such as specification, test results, end-user documentation, maintenance records, etc.&lt;ref name="penny"/&gt;

The use of the term software system is at times related to the application of [[systems theory]] approaches in the context of [[software engineering]]. A software system consists of several separate computer programs and associated [[configuration file]]s, [[documentation]], etc., that operate together.&lt;ref name="sommerville"&gt;{{cite book | title=Software Engineering | publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] | author=Sommerville, Ian | year=2007 | pages=5–6 | section=1.1.1; What is software? | isbn=978-0-321-31379-9 | edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is used in the study of large and complex software, because it focuses on the major ''components'' of software and their ''interactions''. It is also related to the field of [[software architecture]].

Software systems are an active area of research for groups interested in [[software engineering]] in particular and [[systems engineering]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mpi-sws.org/ | title=The Max Planck Institute for Software Systems | accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic journals like the ''[[Journal of Systems and Software]]'' (published by [[Elsevier]]) are dedicated to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/journals/jss/index.html | title=Journal of Systems and Software (JSS) | publisher=[[University of Trier]], Germany | work=[[DBLP]] | accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACM ''[[Software System Award]]'' is an annual award that honors people or an organization ''"for developing a software system that has had a lasting influence, reflected in contributions to concepts, in commercial acceptance, or both"''.&lt;ref name="acmaward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awards.acm.org/software_system/ |work=ACM Awards |title=Software System Award | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] | accessdate=June 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been awarded by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) since 1983, with a cash prize sponsored by [[IBM]].

==Categories==
Major categories of software systems include those based on [[application software]], [[programming software]] and [[system software]], although the distinction can sometimes be difficult. Examples of software systems include [[operating system]]s, [[computer reservations system]]s, [[air traffic control]] systems, military command and control systems, [[telecommunication network]]s, [[content management system]]s, [[database management system]]s, [[expert system]]s, [[embedded system]]s etc.

[[File:Soreq Nuclear Reactor 1960.jpg|thumb|250px|Reactor building under construction in 1960.]]
The '''Soreq Nuclear Research Center''' ({{lang-he|המרכז למחקר גרעיני - שורק}}) is a research and development institute situated near the localities of [[Palmachim]] and [[Yavne]] in Israel. It operates under the auspices of the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] (IAEC). The center conducts research in various physical sciences, particularly the development of many kinds of sensors, [[laser]]s, atmospheric research, [[Nondestructive testing|non-destructive testing]] techniques, space environment, nuclear safety, medical diagnostics and [[nuclear medicine]]. It is also one of three facilities in Israel which produce various types of [[radiopharmacology|radiopharmacuticals]] for use by health care organizations throughout the country.

The institute houses a wide array of laboratories and research facilities including an [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] 5 [[megawatt|MW]] [[Pool-type reactor|pool-type]] light water [[nuclear reactor]] supplied in the late 1950s from the United States under the [[Atoms for Peace]] program,&lt;ref name=archdaily&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/398642/ad-classics-soreq-nuclear-research-center-philip-johnson/ Soreq Nuclear Research Center / Philip Johnson], Gili Merin, ArchDaily, 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a 10 [[MeV]] [[proton]] [[cyclotron]] accelerator, and a continuous wave, 5-40 MeV, 0.04-5 mA proton and deuteron superconducting [[Linear particle accelerator|linear accelerator]] – the first phase of which was commissioned in 2013 (''see also:'' [[SARAF – Soreq Applied Research Accelerator Facility]]).

Commissioned by the Israeli government in 1956, the reactor building was designed by American architect [[Philip Johnson]].&lt;ref name=archdaily/&gt; With its distinctive brutalist style, it has appeared on stamps and was one of Johnson's favorite buildings, though security precautions prevented him from visiting the completed structure while in Israel in 1966.&lt;ref name=archdaily/&gt;

The Center is named after the nearby stream of [[Brook of Sorek|Soreq]].

The Center operates under the [[IAEA safeguards|safeguards]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Research Center - Soreq|url=http://iaec.gov.il/English/Soreq/Pages/default.aspx|website=Israel Atomic Energy Commission website|publisher= [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]]|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7472">'''Spatial [[epidemiology]]''' is a [[Discipline (academia)|subfield]] of [[health geography]] focused on the study of the [[Space|spatial]] distribution of health outcomes.

Specifically, spatial epidemiology is concerned with the description and examination of disease and its geographic variations. This is done in consideration of “demographic, environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, genetic, and infections risk factors."&lt;ref name=pmid15198920&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Paul |last2=Wartenberg |first2=Daniel |title=Spatial epidemiology: current approaches and future challenges |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=112 |issue=9 |pages=998–1006 |year=2004 |pmid=15198920 |pmc=1247193 |jstor=3838101 |doi=10.1289/ehp.6735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of studies==
;Disease Mapping:
* Disease maps are visual representations of intricate geographic data that provide a quick overview of said information. Mainly used for explanatory purposes, disease maps can be presented to survey high-risk areas and to help policy and resource allocation in said areas.

;Geographic correlation studies
* Geographic correlation studies attempt to study the geographical factors and their effects on geographically differentiated health outcomes. Measured on an ecologic scale, these factors include environmental variables (quality of surrounding space), socioeconomic and demographic statistics (income and race), or even lifestyle choices (nutrition or diet) of the population groups under study. This approach has the convenience of being able to employ already available data from various surveying sources.

;Clustering, disease clusters, and surveillance.
* Disease clusters, or spatial groupings of proximity and characteristically related epidemics. While the term itself is relatively poorly defined, it generally “implies an excess of cases above some background rate bounded in time and space.”&lt;ref name=pmid15198920/&gt; Although clustering is not the most precise method for spatial analysis, it can and has proved useful for health-related surveillance and monitoring.

Because the statistical models used to draw up such research are complex, the data analysis and the interpretation of results should be carried out by qualified statisticians. Sometimes, the proliferation of errors in disease mapping has led to inefficient decision-making, implementation of inappropriate health policies and negative impact on the advancement of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ocaña-Riola R |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |year=2010 |pmid=20503184 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
;Data availability and quality
* Since spatial epidemiology is almost entirely based on the analysis of data and its various visual representations, data collection methods must be routine, accurate, and publicly available. With the advent of specialized and accurate health equipment and global information networks, these methods can be relatively and easily improved. Compiling and standardizing data can also be done efficiently and usefully given the right tools and processes.

;Data protection and confidentiality
* In our current time, legislation in the United States regarding individual human rights are gaining increasing support, especially in regards to the confidentiality of personal health data and consent over its use in medical investigations. Safe and secure data is a crucial aspect of successful epidemiologic research.

;Exposure assessment and mapping
* Typically always seen as an analytical weakness, the quality of exposure data, or reported accuracy of the spatial reach of epidemics, is especially important in spatial epidemiology. With the more mainstream use of geographic information systems, the capabilities of spatial interpolation and mapping have been tremendously improved, yet these still greatly depend on the precision and legitimacy of the source data commissioned.

In [[music theory]], the '''spiral array model''' is an extended type of [[pitch space]]. A mathematical model involving concentric [[helices]] (an "array of [[spiral]]s"), it represents human perceptions of [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es, [[chord (music)|chord]]s and [[key (music)|key]]s in the same [[space|geometric space]].

The spiral array model can be viewed as a generalized [[tonnetz]], which maps pitches into a two-dimensional lattice (array) structure. The spiral array wraps up the two-dimensional [[tonnetz]] into a three-dimensional lattice, and models higher order structures such as chords and keys in the interior of the lattice space. This allows the spiral array model to produce geometric interpretations of relationships between low- and high-level structures. For example, it is possible to model and measure geometrically the distance between a particular pitch and a particular key, both represented as points in the spiral array space. To preserve pitch spelling, because musically A# ≠ Bb in their function and usage, the spiral array does not assume [[enharmonic equivalence]], i.e. it does not fold into a torus. The spatial relationships between pitches, between chords, and between keys agree with those in other representations of tonal space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chew | first = Elaine | date = 2008 | title = Out of the Grid and Into the Spiral: Geometric Interpretations of and Comparisons with the Spiral-Array Model | url = http://www.ccarh.org/publications/cm/15/cm15-04-chew.pdf | journal = Computing in Musicology | publisher = CCARH: Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities at Stanford University | volume = 15 | pages = 51–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the Spiral Array==
[[File:Spiral Array Model—Nested Helices.png|thumb|Spiral Array Model. Pitch class, major/minor chord, and major/minor key helices.]]
The model as proposed covers basic pitches, major chords, minor chords, major keys and minor keys, represented on five concentric helices. Starting with a formulation of the pitch helix, inner helices are generated as [[convex combination]]s of points on outer ones. For example, the pitches C, E, and G are represented as the cartesian points ''P(0)'', ''P(1)'', and ''P(4)'' (see definitions in next section), which outline a triangle. The convex combination of these three points is a point inside the triangle, and represents their ''center of effect'' (''ce''). This interior point, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;''(0)'', represents the C major chord in the spiral array model. Similarly, keys may be constructed by the centers of effect of their I, IV, and V chords.

# The outer helix represents pitches classes. Neighboring pitch classes are a music interval of a [[perfect fifth]], and spatially a quarter rotation, apart. The order of the pitch classes can be determined by the line of fifths. For example, C would be followed by G (C and G are a perfect fifth apart), which would be followed D (G and D are a perfect fifth apart), etc. As a result of this structure, and one of the important properties leading to its selection, vertical neighbors are a music interval of a [[major third]] apart. Thus, a pitch class's nearest neighbors and itself form perfect fifth and major third intervals.
# By taking every consecutive triads along the helix, and connecting their centers of effect, a second helix is formed inside the pitch helix, representing the major chords.
# Similarly, by taking the proper minor triads and connecting their centers of effect, a third helix is formed, representing the minor chords.
# The major key helix is formed by the centers of effect of the centers of effect of the I, IV, and V chords
# The minor key helix is formed by connecting similar combinations of the i, iv/IV, and V/v chords.

==Equations for Pitch, Chord, and Key Representations==
[[File:Spiral Array Model–Major Key Representation.png|thumb|Part of the Spiral Array Model by Elaine Chew. Generating of a major key representation as the center of effect of its I, IV, and V chords, which are in turn generated as the center of effect of their defining pitches.]]
[[File:Spiral Array Model—Minor Key Representation.png|thumb|Part of the Spiral Array Model by Elaine Chew. Generating of a minor key representation as the center of effect of its i, iv/IV, and V/v chords, which are in turn generated as the center of effect of their defining pitches.]]

The '''pitch class helix, P''', is represented in parametric form by:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(k) = \begin{bmatrix}
x_{k} \\
y_{k} \\
z_{k} \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r sin (k \cdot \pi / 2)\\
r cos (k \cdot \pi / 2) \\
kh
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where k is an integer representing the pitch's distance from C along the line of fifths, r is the radius of the spiral, and h is the "rise" of the spiral.

The '''major chord helix, C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' is represented by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_M(k) = w_1 \cdot P(k) + w_2 \cdot P(k + 1) + w_3 \cdot P(k+4)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;w_{1} \ge w_{2} \ge w_{3} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 w_{i} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The weights "w" effect how close the center of effect are to the fundamental, major third, and perfect fifth of the chord. By changing the relative values of these weights, the spiral array model effects how "close" the resulting chord is to the three constituent pitches. Generally in western music, the fundamental is given the greatest weight in identifying the chord (w1), followed by the fifth (w2), followed by the third (w3).

The '''minor chord helix, C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' is represented by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_m(k) = u_1 \cdot P(k) + u_2 \cdot P(k + 1) + u_3 \cdot P(k-3)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u_1 \ge u_2 \ge u_3 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The weights "u" function similarly to the major chord.

The '''major key helix, T&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' is represented by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_M(k) = \omega_1 \cdot P(k) + \omega_2 \cdot P(k + 1) + \omega_3 \cdot P(k-1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 \ge \omega_2 \ge \omega_3 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 \omega_i = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to the weights controlling how close constituent pitches are to the center of effect of the chord they produce, the weights &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; control the relative effect of the I, IV, and V chord in determining how close they are to the resultant key.

The '''minor key helix, T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' is represented by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_m(k) = \nu_1 \cdot C_M(k) + \nu_2 \cdot (\alpha \cdot C_M(k+1) + (1-\alpha) \cdot C_m(k+1)) + \nu_3 \cdot (\beta * C_m(k-1) + (1 - \beta) \cdot C_M(k-1)).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \ge \nu_2 \ge \nu_3 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 + \nu_2 + \nu_3 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \ge \alpha \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

'''St. Petersburg Institute of Jewish Studies''' ({{lang-ru|Петербургский Институт Иудаики}}, also known as St. Petersburg Jewish University in 1991-1997 and Leningrad Jewish University in 1989-1991) is a private institution of higher education in the area of [[Jewish Studies]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]].

==History==
Leningrad Jewish University was established in 1989 as a continuation of the [[David Günzburg|Baron Günzburg]]'s Courses for Oriental Studies (1907-1917) and the Petrograd / Leningrad Jewish University (1919-1925). The latter was closed by the Soviet Authorities as "unnecessary" in 1925. The new Leningrad Jewish University was created in 1989 during the new Soviet policy of [[Perestroika]] by enthusiasts and Jewish Activists, Ilya Dvorkin (the first Rector of the university), Vaniamin Lukin, Khava Korzakova, and others. During its first year '89/90 only evening classes were offered of [[Hebrew]], history, [[Torah studies]], as well as seminars on [[Ethnography]], [[Linguistics]] and Local History, and several others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkovich-zametki.com/2008/Starina/Nomer1/MN83.htm] From the history of Jewish Higher Education in Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, morning and day classes were offered and a four-year educational program was established, aiming to prepare Bachelors of Arts in Hebrew, history, and education. The university was officially recognized and accredited. The first alumni graduated in 1996.

In 1997 the name of the university was changed to St. Petersburg Institute of Jewish Studies. Prof. Dmitri Elyashevich became the rector of the institute in 1997, and Prof. Alexander Kobrinsky is the vice-Rector / Provost.

The institute worked at various addresses, including the Jewish Community Center of St. Petersburg and became a prominent part of the Jewish community of St. Petersburg.

==Research==
The institute is a home of a largest Jewish library in the Former Soviet Union. Several scientific conferences on Jewish education, history and other aspects of Jewish Studies were organized by the university. The journal ''Evreyskaya Shkola'' ("Jewish School" in Russian) was published in 1992-1996. The series "Trudy po Iudaike" ("The works on Jewish Studies") are published since 1993. The Institute for the Studies of Jewish Diaspora organized numerous expeditions and field trips to [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Baltic States]], the [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. The materials are kept in the Archive of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pijs.ru/] St. Petersburg Institute of Jewish Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SDLC-Maintenance-Highlighted.png|thumb|Model of the systems development life cycle, highlighting the maintenance phase]]

The '''systems development life cycle''' ('''SDLC'''), also referred to as the '''application development life-cycle''', is a term used in [[systems engineering]], [[information system]]s and [[software engineering]] to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an [[information system]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/XLC/Downloads/SelectingDevelopmentApproach.pdf SELECTING A DEVELOPMENT APPROACH]. Retrieved 17 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The systems development lifecycle concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Parag C. Pendharkara |author2=James A. Rodgerb |author3=Girish H. Subramanian | date=November 2008 |title=An empirical study of the Cobb–Douglas production function properties of software development effort |journal=Information and Software Technology |volume=50 |issue=12 | pages= 1181–1188 | doi=10.1016/j.infsof.2007.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are usually six stages in this cycle: analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.

== Overview ==

A systems development life cycle is composed of a number of clearly defined and distinct work phases which are used by systems engineers and systems developers to plan for, design, build, test, and deliver [[information system]]s. Like anything that is manufactured on an assembly line, an SDLC aims to produce high-quality systems that meet or exceed customer expectations, based on customer requirements, by delivering systems which move through each clearly defined phase, within scheduled time frames and cost estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/Systems+Development+Life+Cycle |title=Systems Development Life Cycle from |publisher=FOLDOC |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Computer systems are complex and often (especially with the recent rise of [[service-oriented architecture]]) link multiple traditional systems potentially supplied by different software vendors. To manage this level of complexity, a number of SDLC models or methodologies have been created, such as [[Waterfall model|waterfall]], [[Spiral model|spiral]], [[Agile software development]], [[Software prototyping#Throwaway prototyping|rapid prototyping]], [[Incremental development|incremental]], and synchronize and stabilize.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bfhOl8jp1S8J:condor.depaul.edu/~jpetlick/extra/394/Session2.ppt+&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShCfW0_MLC4wRbczfUxrndHTkbwguF9fZuaUCe0RDyOCWyO2PTmaPhHnZ4jRhZZ75maVO_7gVAD2ex5-QIhrj1683hMefBNkak7FkQJCAwd-i0-_aQfEVEEKP177h4mmkvMMWJ7&amp;sig=AHIEtbRhMlZ-TUyioKEhLQQxXk1WoSJXWA Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)], PowerPoint – Powered by Google Docs&lt;/ref&gt;

SDLC can be described along a spectrum of agile to iterative to sequential methodologies. Agile methodologies, such as [[Extreme Programming|XP]] and [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]], focus on lightweight processes which allow for rapid changes (without necessarily following the pattern of SDLC approach) along the development cycle. [[Iterative and incremental development|Iterative]] methodologies, such as [[Rational Unified Process]] and [[dynamic systems development method]], focus on limited project scope and expanding or improving products by multiple iterations. Sequential or big-design-up-front (BDUF) models, such as waterfall, focus on complete and correct planning to guide large projects and risks to successful and predictable results.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Other models, such as [[anamorphic development]], tend to focus on a form of development that is guided by project scope and adaptive iterations of feature development.

In [[project management]] a project can be defined both with a [[project life cycle]] (PLC) and an SDLC, during which slightly different activities occur. According to Taylor (2004), "the project life cycle encompasses all the activities of the [[project]], while the systems development life cycle focuses on realizing the product [[requirement]]s".&lt;ref&gt;James Taylor (2004). ''Managing Information Technology Projects''. p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

SDLC is used during the development of an IT project, it describes the different stages involved in the project from the drawing board, through the completion of the project.

The SDLC is not a methodology per se, but rather a description of the phases in the life cycle of a software application. These phases (broadly speaking) are, investigation, analysis, design, build, test, implement, and maintenance and support. All software development methodologies (such as the more commonly known waterfall and scrum methodologies) follow the SDLC phases but the method of doing that varies vastly between methodologies. In the Scrum methodology, for example, one could say a single user story goes through all the phases of the SDLC within a single two-week sprint. Contrast this to the waterfall methodology, as another example, where every business requirement (recorded in the analysis phase of the SDLC in a document called the Business Requirements Specification) is translated into feature/functional descriptions (recorded in the design phase in a document called the Functional Specification) which are then all built in one go as a collection of solution features typically over a period of three to nine months, or more. These methodologies are obviously quite different approaches, yet they both contain the SDLC phases in which a requirement is born, then travels through the life cycle phases ending in the final phase of maintenance and support, after-which (typically) the whole life cycle starts again for a subsequent version of the software application.

== History and details ==

The [[Product life cycle (engineering)|product life cycle]] describes the process for building information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way, reiterating each stage of the product's life. The systems development life cycle, according to Elliott &amp; Strachan &amp; Radford (2004), "originated in the 1960s, to develop large scale functional [[business systems]] in an age of large scale [[business conglomerate]]s. Information systems activities revolved around heavy [[data processing]] and [[number crunching]] routines".&lt;ref name="Ell04"&gt;Geoffrey Elliott &amp; Josh Strachan (2004) ''Global Business Information Technology''. p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several systems development frameworks have been partly based on SDLC, such as the [[structured systems analysis and design method]] (SSADM) produced for the UK government [[Office of Government Commerce]] in the 1980s. Ever since, according to Elliott (2004), "the traditional life cycle approaches to systems development have been increasingly replaced with alternative approaches and frameworks, which attempted to overcome some of the inherent deficiencies of the traditional SDLC".&lt;ref name="Ell04"/&gt;

== Phases ==
The system development life cycle framework provides a sequence of activities for system designers and developers to follow. It consists of a set of steps or phases in which each phase of the SDLC uses the results of the previous one.&lt;ref name="US DJ03"&gt;US Department of Justice (2003). [http://www.justice.gov/archive/jmd/irm/lifecycle/table.htm INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT] Chapter 1. Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EverettSoftware07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z8UdPmvkBHEC&amp;pg=PA29 |chapter=Chapter 2: The Software Development Life Cycle |title=Software Testing: Testing Across the Entire Software Development Life Cycle |author=Everatt, G.D.; McLeod Jr., R. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=29–58 |year=2007 |isbn=9780470146347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDLC adheres to important phases that are essential for developers—such as [[planning]], [[analysis]], [[design]], and [[implementation]]—and are explained in the section below. This includes evaluation of the currently used system, information gathering, feasibility studies, and request approval. A number of SDLC models have been created, including waterfall, fountain, spiral, build and fix, rapid prototyping, incremental, synchronize, and stabilize.&lt;ref name="UnhelkarTheArt16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqnMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |title=The Art of Agile Practice: A Composite Approach for Projects and Organizations |author=Unhelkar, B. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=56–59 |year=2016 |isbn=9781439851197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LandPract12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsBF_lVbK_gC&amp;pg=PA341 |title=Practical Support for Lean Six Sigma Software Process Definition: Using IEEE Software Engineering Standards |author=Land, S.K.; Smith, D.B.; Walz, J.W. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=341–3 |year=2012 |isbn=9780470289952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these, and the best known, is the [[waterfall model]], a sequence of stages in which the output of each stage becomes the input for the next.&lt;ref name="EverettSoftware07" /&gt; These stages can be characterized and divided up in different ways, including the following:&lt;ref name="US DJ03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EverettSoftware07" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/71151/System_Development_Life_Cycle |title=QuickStudy: System Development Life Cycle |first=Russell |last=Kay |date=May 14, 2002 |work=ComputerWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TaylorIntro08"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqpZDNc5_Y4C&amp;pg=SA12-PA6 |title=Introduction to Logistics Engineering |author=Taylor, G.D. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=12.6-12.18 |year=2008 |isbn=9781420088571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Preliminary analysis''': Begin with a preliminary analysis, propose alternative solutions, describe costs and benefits, and submit a preliminary plan with recommendations.
:# Conduct the preliminary analysis: Discover the organization's objectives and the nature and scope of the problem under study. Even if a problem refers only to a small segment of the organization itself, find out what the objectives of the organization itself are. Then see how the problem being studied fits in with them.
:# Propose alternative solutions: After digging into the organization's objectives and specific problems, several solutions may have been discovered. However, alternate proposals may still come from interviewing employees, clients, suppliers, and/or consultants. Insight may also be gained by researching what competitors are doing.
:# Cost benefit analysis: Analyze and describe the costs and benefits of implementing the proposed changes. In the end, the ultimate decision on whether to leave the system as is, improve it, or develop a new system will be guided by this and the rest of the preliminary analysis data.
* '''Systems analysis, requirements definition''': Define project goals into defined functions and operations of the intended application. This involves the process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and recommending improvements to the system. Project goals will be further aided by analysis of end-user information needs and the removal of any inconsistencies and incompleteness in these requirements.
: A series of steps followed by the developer include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Control and Audit|first1=Information Systems|title=SDLC|publisher=Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|location=Chapter 5|page=5.28|edition=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:# Collection of facts: Obtain end user requirements through documentation, client interviews, observation, and questionnaires.
:# Scrutiny of the existing system: Identify pros and cons of the current system in-place, so as to carry forward the pros and avoid the cons in the new system.
:# Analysis of the proposed system: Find solutions to the shortcomings described in step two and prepare the specifications using any specific user proposals.
* '''Systems design''': At this step desired features and operations are described in detail, including screen layouts, [[business rule]]s, [[Process Diagram|process diagram]]s, [[pseudocode]], and other documentation.
* '''Development''': The real code is written here.
* '''Integration and testing''': All the pieces are brought together into a special testing environment, then checked for errors, bugs, and interoperability.
* '''Acceptance, installation, deployment''': This is the final stage of initial development, where the software is put into production and runs actual business.
* '''Maintenance''': During the maintenance stage of the SDLC, the system is assessed/evaluated to ensure it does not become obsolete. This is also where changes are made to initial software.
* '''Evaluation''': Some companies do not view this as an official stage of the SDLC, while others consider it to be an extension of the maintenance stage, and may be referred to in some circles as post-implementation review. This is where the system that was developed, as well as the entire process, is evaluated. Some of the questions that need to be answered include if the newly implemented system meets the initial business requirements and objectives, if the system is reliable and fault-tolerant, and if it functions according to the approved functional requirements. In addition to evaluating the software that was released, it is important to assess the effectiveness of the development process. If there are any aspects of the entire process (or certain stages) that management is not satisfied with, this is the time to improve.
* '''Disposal: '''In this phase, plans are developed for discontinuing the use of system information, hardware, and software and making the transition to a new system. The purpose here is to properly move, archive, discard, or destroy information, hardware, and software that is being replaced, in a manner that prevents any possibility of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. The disposal activities ensure proper migration to a new system. Particular emphasis is given to proper preservation and archiving of data processed by the previous system. All of this should be done in accordance with the organization's security requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Radack |first=S. |date=n.d. |title=The system development life cycle (SDLC) |url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/april2009_system-development-life-cycle.pdf |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following diagram, these stages of the systems development life cycle are divided in ten steps, from definition to creation and modification of IT work products:

[[File:Systems Development Life Cycle.jpg|thumb|720px|center| A ten-phase version of the systems development life cycle&lt;ref name="US DJ03" /&gt;]]

Not every project will require that the phases be sequentially executed. However, the phases are interdependent. Depending upon the size and complexity of the project, phases may be combined or may overlap.&lt;ref name = "US DJ03"/&gt;

=== System investigation ===

First the IT system proposal is investigated. During this step, consider all current priorities that would be affected and how they should be handled. Before any system planning is done, a [[feasibility study]] should be conducted to determine if creating a new or improved system is a viable solution. This will help to determine the costs, benefits, resource requirements, and specific user needs required for completion. The development process can only continue once management approves of the recommendations from the feasibility study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marakas|first=James A. O'Brien, George M.|title=Management information systems|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|location=New York|isbn=0073376817|pages=485–489|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following represent different components of the feasibility study:

* [[Feasibility study#Operational feasibility|Operational feasibility]]
* [[Feasibility study#Economic Feasibility|Economic feasibility]]
* [[Feasibility study#Technical Feasibility|Technical feasibility]]
* Human factors feasibility
* [[Feasibility study#Legal feasibility|Legal/Political feasibility]]

=== Analysis ===

The goal of [[analysis]] is to determine where the problem is, in an attempt to fix the system. This step involves [[Work breakdown structure|breaking down]] the system in different pieces to analyze the situation, analyzing project goals, breaking down what needs to be created, and attempting to engage users so that definite requirements can be defined.

=== Design ===

In [[systems design]], the design functions and operations are described in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, and other documentation. The output of this stage will describe the new system as a collection of modules or subsystems.

The design stage takes as its initial input the requirements identified in the approved requirements document. For each requirement, a set of one or more design elements will be produced as a result of interviews, workshops, and/or prototype efforts.

Design elements describe the desired system features in detail, and they generally include functional hierarchy diagrams, screen layout diagrams, tables of business rules, business process diagrams, pseudo-code, and a complete entity-relationship diagram with a full data dictionary. These design elements are intended to describe the system in sufficient detail, such that skilled developers and engineers may develop and deliver the system with minimal additional input design.

=== Environments ===

Environments are controlled areas where systems developers can build, distribute, install, configure, test, and execute systems that move through the SDLC. Each environment is aligned with different areas of the SDLC and is intended to have specific purposes. Examples of such environments include the:

* ''development environment'', where developers can work independently of each other before trying to merge their work with the work of others;
* ''common build environment'', where merged work can be built, together, as a combined system;
* ''systems integration testing environment'', where basic testing of a system's integration points to other upstream or downstream systems can be tested;
* ''user acceptance testing environment'', where business stakeholders can test against their original business requirements; and
* ''production environment'', where systems finally get deployed for final use by their intended end users.

=== Testing ===

The code is tested at various levels in [[software testing]]. Unit, system, and user acceptance testings are often performed. This is a grey area as many different opinions exist as to what the stages of testing are and how much, if any iteration occurs. Iteration is not generally part of the waterfall model, but the means to rectify defects and validate fixes prior to deployment is incorporated into this phase.

The following are types of testing that may be relevant, depending on the type of system under development:

* ''Defect testing'' the failed scenarios, including [[defect tracking]]
* [[Model-based testing|Path testing]]
* [[Test data|Data set testing]]
* [[Unit testing]]
* [[System testing]]
* [[Integration testing]]
* [[Black-box testing]]
* [[White-box testing]]
* [[Regression testing]]
* [[Automation testing]]
* [[User acceptance testing]]
* [[Software performance testing]]

=== Training and transition ===

Once a system has been stabilized through adequate testing, the SDLC ensures that proper training on the system is performed or documented before transitioning the system to its support staff and end users. Training usually covers operational training for those people who will be responsible for supporting the system as well as training for those end users who will be using the system after its delivery to a production operating environment.

After training has been successfully completed, systems engineers and developers transition the system to its final production environment, where it is intended to be used by its end users and supported by its support and operations staff.

=== Operations and maintenance ===

The [[Software deployment|deployment]] of the system includes changes and enhancements before the decommissioning or sunset of the system. [[Software maintenance|Maintaining]] the system is an important aspect of SDLC. As key personnel change positions in the organization, new changes will be implemented. There are two approaches to system development: the traditional approach (structured) and [[object oriented]]. Information engineering includes the traditional system approach, which is also called the structured analysis and design technique. The object oriented approach views information system as a collection of objects that are integrated with each other to make a full and complete information system.

=== Evaluation ===

The final phase of the SDLC is to measure the effectiveness of the system and evaluate potential enhancements.

== Systems analysis and design ==

The '''systems analysis and design (SAD)''' is the process of developing information systems (IS) that effectively use hardware, software, data, processes, and people to support the company's businesses objectives.  System analysis and design can be considered the meta-development activity, which serves to set the stage and bound the problem.  SAD can be leveraged to set the correct balance among competing high-level requirements in the functional and non-functional analysis domains.  System analysis and design interacts strongly with distributed enterprise architecture, enterprise I.T. Architecture, and business architecture, and relies heavily on concepts such as partitioning, interfaces, personae and roles, and deployment/operational modeling to arrive at a high-level system description.  This high level description is then further broken down into the components and modules which can be analyzed, designed, and constructed separately and integrated to accomplish the business goal.  SDLC and SAD are cornerstones of full life cycle product and system planning.

== Object-oriented analysis ==

Object-oriented analysis (OOA) is the process of analyzing a task (also known as a [[problem domain]]), to develop a conceptual model that can then be used to complete the task.  A typical OOA model would describe computer software that could be used to satisfy a set of customer-defined requirements.  During the analysis phase of problem-solving, a programmer might consider a written requirements statement, a formal vision document, or interviews with stakeholders or other interested parties.  The task to be addressed might be divided into several subtasks (or domains), each representing a different business, technological, or other areas of interest.  Each subtask would be analyzed separately.  Implementation constraints, (e.g., [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]], [[Distributed computing|distribution]], [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]], or how the system is to be built) are not considered during the analysis phase; rather, they are addressed during object-oriented design (OOD).

The conceptual model that results from OOA will typically consist of a set of [[use cases]], one or more [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[class diagram]]s, and a number of [[interaction diagram]]s. It may also include some kind of [[user interface]] mock-up.

The input for object-oriented design is provided by the output of [[object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented analysis]]. Realize that an output artifact does not need to be completely developed to serve as input of object-oriented design; analysis and design may occur in parallel, and in practice the results of one activity can feed the other in a short feedback cycle through an iterative process. Both analysis and design can be performed incrementally, and the artifacts can be continuously grown instead of completely developed in one shot.

Some typical (but common to all types of design analysis) input artifacts for object-oriented:

* [[Conceptual model (computer science)|Conceptual model]]: Conceptual model is the result of object-oriented analysis, it captures concepts in the problem domain. The conceptual model is explicitly chosen to be independent of implementation details, such as concurrency or data storage.
* [[Use case]]: Use case is a description of sequences of events that, taken together, lead to a system doing something useful. Each use case provides one or more [[Scenario (computing)|scenarios]] that convey how the system should interact with the users called actors to achieve a specific business goal or function. Use case actors may be end users or other systems. In many circumstances use cases are further elaborated into use case diagrams. Use case diagrams are used to identify the actor (users or other systems) and the processes they perform.
* [[System Sequence Diagram]]: System Sequence diagram (SSD) is a picture that shows, for a particular scenario of a use case, the events that external actors generate, their order, and possible inter-system events.
* User interface documentations (if applicable): Document that shows and describes the [[look and feel]] of the end product's user interface. It is not mandatory to have this, but it helps to visualize the end-product and therefore helps the designer.
* [[Relational data model]] (if applicable): A data model is an abstract model that describes how data is represented and used. If an [[object database]] is not used, the relational data model should usually be created before the design, since the strategy chosen for [[object-relational mapping]] is an output of the OO design process. However, it is possible to develop the relational data model and the object-oriented design artifacts in parallel, and the growth of an artifact can stimulate the refinement of other artifacts.

== Life cycle ==

=== Management and control ===

[[File:SDLC Phases Related to Management Controls.jpg|thumb|SPIU phases related to management controls&lt;ref name="USHR99"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives (1999). [http://www.house.gov/content/cao/procurement/ref-docs/SDLCPOL.pdf ''Systems Development Life-Cycle Policy'']. p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The SDLC phases serve as a programmatic guide to project activity and provide a flexible but consistent way to conduct projects to a depth matching the scope of the project. Each of the SDLC phase objectives are described in this section with key deliverables, a description of recommended tasks, and a summary of related control objectives for effective management. It is critical for the project manager to establish and monitor control objectives during each SDLC phase while executing projects. Control objectives help to provide a clear statement of the desired result or purpose and should be used throughout the entire SDLC process. Control objectives can be grouped into major categories (domains), and relate to the SDLC phases as shown in the figure.&lt;ref name="USHR99"/&gt;

To manage and control any SDLC initiative, each project will be required to establish some degree of a [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) to capture and schedule the work necessary to complete the project. The WBS and all programmatic material should be kept in the "project description" section of the project notebook. The WBS format is mostly left to the project manager to establish in a way that best describes the project work.

There are some key areas that must be defined in the WBS as part of the SDLC policy. The following diagram describes three key areas that will be addressed in the WBS in a manner established by the project manager.&lt;ref name="USHR99"/&gt; The diagram shows coverage spans numerous phases of the SDLC but the associated MCD has a subset of primary mappings to the SDLC phases. For example, Analysis and Design is primarily performed as part of the Acquisition and Implementation Domain and System Build and Prototype is primarily performed as part of delivery and support.

=== Work breakdown structured organization ===

[[File:SDLC Work Breakdown Structure.jpg|thumb|Work breakdown structure&lt;ref name="USHR99"/&gt;]]

The upper section of the work breakdown structure (WBS) should identify the major phases and milestones of the project in a summary fashion. In addition, the upper section should provide an overview of the full scope and timeline of the project and will be part of the initial project description effort leading to project approval. The middle section of the WBS is based on the seven systems development life cycle phases as a guide for WBS task development. The WBS elements should consist of milestones and "tasks" as opposed to "activities" and have a definitive period (usually two weeks or more). Each task must have a measurable output (e.x. document, decision, or analysis). A WBS task may rely on one or more activities (e.g. software engineering, systems engineering) and may require close coordination with other tasks, either internal or external to the project. Any part of the project needing support from contractors should have a [[statement of work]] (SOW) written to include the appropriate tasks from the SDLC phases. The development of a SOW does not occur during a specific phase of SDLC but is developed to include the work from the SDLC process that may be conducted by external resources such as contractors.&lt;ref name="USHR99"/&gt;

=== Baselines ===

Baselines are an important part of the systems development life cycle. These baselines are established after four of the five phases of the SDLC and are critical to the iterative nature of the model .&lt;ref&gt;[[Blanchard, B. S.]], &amp; [[Fabrycky, W. J.]](2006) ''Systems engineering and analysis'' (4th ed.) New Jersey: Prentice Hall. p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Each baseline is considered as a milestone in the SDLC.

* functional baseline: established after the conceptual design phase.
* allocated baseline: established after the preliminary design phase.
* product baseline: established after the detail design and development phase.
* updated product baseline: established after the production construction phase.

=== Complementary methodologies ===

Complementary [[software development process|software development methods]] to systems development life cycle are:

* [[Software prototyping]]
* [[Joint applications development]] (JAD)
* [[Rapid application development]] (RAD)
* [[Extreme programming]] (XP);
* [[Open-source software development|Open-source development]]
* [[End-user development]]
* [[Object-oriented programming]]

== Strengths and weaknesses ==

Few people in the modern computing world would use a strict waterfall model for their SDLC as many modern methodologies have superseded this thinking. Some will argue that the SDLC no longer applies to models like Agile computing, but it is still a term widely in use in technology circles. The SDLC practice has advantages in traditional models of systems development that lends itself more to a structured environment. The disadvantages to using the SDLC methodology is when there is need for iterative development or (i.e. web development or e-commerce) where stakeholders need to review on a regular basis the software being designed.

A comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of SDLC:

An alternative to the SDLC is rapid application development, which combines prototyping, joint application development and implementation of CASE tools. The advantages of RAD are speed, reduced development cost, and active user involvement in the development process.

==System lifecycle==
The system lifecycle in [[systems engineering]] is a view of a system or proposed system that addresses all phases of its existence to include system conception, design and development, production and/or construction, distribution, operation, maintenance and support, retirement, phase-out and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Systems Engineering and Analysis, Fourth Edition | page=19 | author=Blanchard and Fabrycky | publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual design===
The [[conceptual design]] stage is the stage where an identified need is examined, requirements for potential solutions are defined, potential solutions are evaluated and a system specification is developed.  The system specification represents the technical requirements that will provide overall guidance for system design. Because this document determines all future development, the stage cannot be completed until a conceptual [[design review]] has determined that the system specification properly addresses the motivating need.

Key steps within the conceptual design stage include:
*Need identification
*Feasibility analysis
*System requirements analysis
*System specification
*Conceptual design review

===Preliminary system design===
During this stage of the system lifecycle, subsystems that perform the desired system functions are designed and specified in compliance with the system specification. Interfaces between subsystems are defined, as well as overall test and evaluation requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Engineering, System Engineering | author=Dr. Joahn Gouws | publisher=Melikon Pty Ltd |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the completion of this stage, a development specification is produced that is sufficient to perform detailed design and development.

Key steps within the preliminary design stage include:
*Functional analysis
*Requirements allocation
*Detailed trade-off studies
*Synthesis of system options
*Preliminary design of engineering models
*Development specification
*Preliminary design review

For example, as the system analyst of Viti Bank, you have been tasked to examine the current information system. Viti Bank is a fast growing bank in Fiji. Customers in remote rural areas are finding difficulty to access the bank services. It takes them days or even weeks to travel to a location to access the bank services. With the vision of meeting the customers needs, the bank has requested your services to examine the current system and to come up with solutions or recommendations of how the current system can be provided to meet its needs.

===Detail design and development===
This stage includes the development of detailed designs that brings initial design work into a completed with form of specifications. This work includes the specification of interfaces between the system and its intended environment and a comprehensive evaluation of the systems logistical, maintenance and support requirements.  The detail design and development is responsible for producing the product, process and material specifications and may result in substantial changes to the development specification.

Key steps within the detail design and development stage include:
*Detailed design
*Detailed synthesis
*Development of engineering and prototype models
*Revision of development specification
*Product, process and material specification
*Critical design review

===Production and construction===
During the production and/or construction stage the product is built or assembled in accordance with the requirements specified in the product, process and material specifications and is deployed and tested within the operational target environment. System assessments are conducted in order to correct deficiencies and adapt the system for continued improvement.

Key steps within the product construction stage include:
*Production and/or construction of system components
*Acceptance testing
*System distribution and operation
*Operational testing and evaluation
*System assessment

===Utilization and support===
Once fully deployed, the system is used for its intended operational role and maintained within its operational environment.

Key steps within the utilization and support stage include:
*System operation in the user environment
*Change management
*System modifications for improvement
*System assessment

===Phase-out and disposal===
Effectiveness and efficiency of the system must be continuously evaluated to determine when the product has met its maximum effective lifecycle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=James|title=HERC Maintenance|journal=Fargo|volume=XXI|issue=North Avenue|page=49|url=https://www.hercbpm.com.au/|accessdate=13 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Considerations include: Continued existence of operational need, matching between operational requirements and system performance, feasibility of system phase-out versus maintenance, and availability of alternative systems.

==Differences from other fluorescent lamps==
{{See also|T5_fluorescent_lamp#Differences_with_other_fluorescent_lamps|l1=T5 fluorescent lamp}}

T5 lamps are approximately 40% smaller than [[T8 Lamp]]s. T5 lamps have a miniature bi-pin base while T8 lamps use a medium bi-pin base.&lt;ref name="lrc"&gt;{{Cite web|title=T5 Fluorescent Systems|url=http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightingAnswers/lat5/abstract.asp|publisher=Lighting Research Center|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion technology==
[[Conversion kits]] are available which will work in existing fittings containing switch start, mains frequency [[fluorescent lamp]] ballasts. The kits convert the fittings to use energy efficient, high frequency ballasts and accommodate the smaller diameter T5 lamp.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;

The magnetic ballast remains in place but it is bypassed, rendering it ineffective as a conductor. The new high-frequency ballast draws only 2&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]], rather than the 6-10&amp;nbsp;W of the old ballast, increasing the efficiency of the system.&lt;ref name="bsd"&gt;{{Cite web|title=New generation energy efficient fluorescent tubes: triphosphor|url=http://www.bsdlive.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3110142|publisher=Building Sustainable Design|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing to this type of lamp without taking the ballast out of operation (rather than simply bypassing it) results in an increased power factor for the fitting. This increase in power is a result of the separate coils used in an electric ballast, as opposed to the single coil in a magnetic ballast, because it allows the electricity to flow more consistently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrowlightdistrict.com/2015/08/t5-vs-t8/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are tree main types of conversion kits:
* '''Lamp-end type''' – Kits which include a replacement starter and two separate components to fit over each end of the T5 lamp. The lamp is then slotted into the existing fitting.
* '''Baton type''' – One piece kits which slot into the existing fitting and into which the T5 lamp is placed.&lt;ref name="ct" /&gt;
* '''IP65 types''' –  Waterproof [http://store.elam-lighting.eu/en/t5-retrofit-energy-save IP65 T5-module]

==Energy efficiency==
T5 retrofit conversion can maintain existing lighting levels at up to 65% reduction in energy use.&lt;ref name="sie" /&gt;

'''Ten Sing''' is a Christian youth program within the [[YWCA]] and [[YMCA]], engaging teenagers in creative performing arts.

==Activities, goals and values==

Ten Sing work is based on a common agreement between member countries of the European Ten Sing Group – The Ten Sing Idea:

'''Abstract'''

Ten Sing is an international Youth programme within the YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) and YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association), which focuses on getting young people to express themselves by using their own culture through creative performing arts.

'''The main aims'''

The underlying objectives are leadership training, democracy training and personal and social development of body, mind and spirit. Ten Sing invites young people to a creative work process that uses different cultural expressions in a Christian context.

'''The three C's'''

The three C's "Culture, Creativity and Christ" are equally important parts of the Ten Sing idea.

'''By young people, for young people.'''

Young people know best what young people think, dream of, feel and desire. Therefore, young people should be active in the management of Ten Sing and take responsibility for running programmes themselves.

'''Young responsibility, adult presence'''

Ten Sing is for young people, with young people and run by young people. Even though the young people are responsible for the programme, it is important to have adult presence. Adults should act as mentors for the youth leaders. The adults should be a resource for help, support and advice when needed.

'''The whole human being'''

Everybody has talents that can be used in Ten Sing, and everyone should get the chance to be creative and active with his or her own mind and body, thus stimulating their spirit. This happens through a great variety of performing arts, such as music, dance, drama, video and other creative expressions. The Ten Sing programme focuses on "the whole human being", with spirit, mind and body. The YMCA-logo – the triangle – illustrates that all parts are equally important.

'''Process before product'''

To reach the goal of developing young people, Ten Sing focuses on the process of making a creative performance. The process is the tool to make everybody contribute. Therefore, the young people should develop both social and creative skills.

This is why the process itself is the key: Letting the young people work together regularly in a safe environment, trying and failing, challenging each other, developing and growing, whilst creating a product that the young people can enjoy and be proud of. This enables them to reflect and value their achievements and skills gained through the process.

'''Open membership, Christian leadership'''

Ten Sing is open to everyone irrespective of gender, beliefs, abilities, talents, ethnic and social background. It is not necessary to be a Christian to be a member of Ten Sing. Nevertheless, to secure the Christian context of Ten Sing it's important that at least one of the key leaders is a Christian.

==Origin==
Ten Sing originated from [[Norway]] in 1968. The name "Ten Sing" is a combination of the Norwegian [[suffix]] "-ten" (en. "-teen") and the English word "sing" – a kind of language mixing that was quite common in Norway at the time.

The first Ten Sing group was started in [[Bergen]] by Kjell Grønner. It was inspired by Sing Out, which later became known as [[Up with People]]. The years that followed more groups were formed in Norway, and today there are over hundred groups all over Norway. The Norwegian [[YWCA]]–[[YMCA]]  wanted to implement Ten Sing in other European countries, and the starting point was Germany in 1986. This was the start of Ten Sing Norwegen, now Ten Sing Norway.

The first European Ten Sing Conference was held in 1987.

The '''tree of life''' is a widespread myth ([[mytheme]]) or [[archetype]] in the world's [[mythology|mythologies]], related to the concept of ''[[sacred tree]]'' more generally,&lt;ref name="GIOVINO-29"&gt;Giovino, Mariana (2007). ''The Assyrian Sacred Tree: A History of Interpretations'', page 129. Saint-Paul. {{ISBN|9783727816024}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence in [[religion|religious]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] tradition.

The [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge]], connecting to [[heaven]] and the [[underworld]], and the tree of life, connecting all forms of creation, are both forms of the [[world tree]] or cosmic tree,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648638/world-tree World tree] in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and are portrayed in various religions and philosophies as the same tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EW2Qdu0awZgC&amp;pg=PA5#v=snippet&amp;q=%22tree%20of%20life%22%20same&amp;f=false |author=Tryggve N.

==Religion and mythology==
{{Main article|Trees in mythology}}
Various trees of life are recounted in [[folklore]], [[culture]] and [[fiction]], often relating to [[immortality]] or [[fertility]]. They had their origin in religious symbolism.

===Ancient Iran===
[[File:Detail of a rhyton from Marlik, Iran, 1000 BC.jpg|thumb|Tree of life on a rhyton from [[Marlik]], Iran, currently at the [[National Museum of Iran]].]]

In the [[Avestan]] literature and [[Iranian mythology]], there are several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, like: [[Amesha Spenta]] [[Amordad]] (guardian of plants, goddess of trees and immortality), [[Gaokerena]] (or white [[Haoma]], a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe), Bas tokhmak (a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow), [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]] (parents of the human race in Iranian myths), [[Barsom]] (copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz or [[Haoma]] that Zoroastrians use in their rituals), [[Haoma]] (a plant, unknown today, that was source of sacred potable), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_36319.html |title = Plant of life, in Ancient Iran, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt |date = 2013|publisher = Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2, p. 15. |last = Taheri|first = Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaokerena]] is a large, sacred [[Haoma]] planted by [[Ahura Mazda]]. [[Ahriman]] (Ahreman, Angremainyu) created a frog to invade the tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, [[Ahura Mazda]] created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react to it. Because [[Ahriman]] is responsible for all evil including death, while [[Ahura Mazda]] is responsible for all good (including life).

[[haoma]] is another sacred plant due to the drink made from it. The preparation of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities—health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds.

Haoma is the Avestan form of the Sanskrit ''soma''. The near identity of the two in ritual significance is considered by scholars to point to a salient feature of an Indo-Iranian religion antedating Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254670/haoma |title=haoma (Zoroastrianism) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haoma-i |title=HAOMA i. BOTANY – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related issue in ancient mythology of [[Iran]] is the myth of [[Mashya and Mashyana|Mashyа and Mashyane]], two trees who were the ancestors of all living beings. This myth can be considered as a prototype for the [[creation myth]] where living beings are created by Gods (who have a human form).

The [[Assyria]]n tree of life was represented by a series of nodes and criss-crossing lines. It was apparently an important religious symbol, often attended to in [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] by human or eagle-headed [[winged genie]]s, or the King, and blessed or fertilized with [[bucket and cone]]. [[Assyriology|Assyriologists]] have not reached consensus as to the meaning of this symbol. The name "Tree of Life" has been attributed to it by modern scholarship; it is not used in the Assyrian sources. In fact, no textual evidence pertaining to the symbol is known to exist.
[[File:Urartu Helmet Fragment 2~.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Urartu|Urartian]] tree of life]]

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' is a similar quest for immortality. In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], Etana searches for a 'plant of birth' to provide him with a son. This has a solid provenance of antiquity, being found in [[cylinder seal]]s from [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] (2390–2249 [[Common Era|BCE]]).

In ancient [[Urartu]], the tree of life was a religious symbol and was drawn on walls of fortresses and carved on the armor of warriors. The branches of the tree were equally divided on the right and left sides of the stem, with each branch having one leaf, and one leaf on the apex of the tree. Servants stood on each side of the tree with one of their hands up as if they are taking care of the tree.

===Baha'i Faith===
{{see also|Sidrat al-Muntaha}}
The concept of the tree of life appears in the writings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], where it can refer to the [[Manifestation of God]], a great teacher who appears to humanity from age to age.  An example of this can be found in the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]:&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |last = Taherzadeh |first = Adib |authorlink = Adib Taherzadeh |year = 1976 |title = The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher = George Ronald |place = Oxford, UK |isbn = 0-85398-270-8 |url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V1/Cover.html |pages = 80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazemi, Farshid (2009).

A distinction has been made between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The latter represents the physical world with its opposites, such as good and evil and light and dark. In a different context from the one above, the tree of life represents the spiritual realm, where this duality does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Abdu'l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
The ''Bo'' tree, also called ''[[Bodhi]]'' tree,  according to Buddhist tradition, is the pipal ([[Ficus religiosa]]) under which the Buddha sat when he attained Enlightenment (Bodhi) at Bodh Gaya (near Gaya, west-central Bihar state, India). A living pipal at Anuradhapura, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), is said to have grown from a cutting from the Bo tree sent to that city by King Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70648/Bo-tree |title=Bo tree (tree) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tibetan tradition when Buddha went to the holy Lake Manasorovar along with 500 monks, he took with him the energy of Prayaga Raj. Upon his arrival, he installed the energy of Prayaga Raj near Lake Manasorovar, at a place now known as Prayang. Then he planted the seed of this eternal banyan tree next to Mt. Kailash on a mountain known as the "Palace of Medicine Buddha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kmt.himalayaninstitute.org/pointsarchive.asp?dt=1/12/2001 |title=The Kumbha Mela Times |publisher=Kmt.himalayaninstitute.org |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207041420/http://kmt.himalayaninstitute.org/pointsarchive.asp?dt=1%2F12%2F2001 |archivedate=December 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:Ⅰ号大型青铜神树.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze Tree with birds, flowers, and ornaments from [[Sanxingdui]]]]
{{see also|Fusang}}
In [[Chinese mythology]], a carving of a tree of life depicts a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] and a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]; the dragon often represents immortality.  A [[Taoism|Taoist]] story tells of a tree that produces a [[peaches of immortality|peach of immortality]] every three thousand years, and anyone who eats the fruit receives immortality.

An [[archaeological]] discovery in the 1990s was of a sacrificial pit at [[Sanxingdui]] in [[Sichuan]], [[China]]. Dating from about 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]], it contained three [[bronze]] trees, one of them 4 meters high.  At the base was a dragon, and fruit hanging from the lower branches.  At the top is a bird-like (Phoenix) creature with claws.  Also found in Sichuan, from the late [[Han dynasty]] (c 25 – 220 CE), is another tree of life. The [[ceramic]] base is guarded by a horned beast with wings.  The leaves of the tree represent coins and people.  At the apex is a bird with coins and the [[Sun]].

===Christianity===
{{See also|Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of the knowledge of good and evil#Christianity}}
The tree of life first appears in Genesis 2:9 and 3:22-24 as the source of [[Immortality|eternal life]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], from which access is revoked when man is driven from the garden. It then reappears in the last book of the Bible, the [[Book of Revelation]], and most predominantly in the last chapter of that book (Chapter 22) as a part of the new garden of paradise. Access is then no longer forbidden, for those who "wash their robes" (or as the textual variant in the King James Version has it, "they that do his commandments") "have right to the tree of life" (v.14). A similar statement appears in Rev 2:7, where the tree of life is promised as a reward to those who overcome. Revelation 22 begins with a reference to the "pure river of water of life" which proceeds "out of the throne of God". The river seems to feed two trees of life, one "on either side of the river" which "bear twelve manner of fruits" "and the leaves of the tree were for healing of the nations" (v.1-2).&lt;ref&gt;The Bible (King James version), The Revelation of St. John, chapter &amp; verses as noted.&lt;/ref&gt; Or this may indicate that the tree of life is a vine that grows on both sides of the river, as John 15:1 would hint at.

{{quote|All these things stood for something other than what they were, but all the same they were themselves bodily realities. And when the narrator mentioned them he was not employing figurative language, but giving an explicit account of things which had a forward reference that was figurative. So then the tree of life also was Christ... and indeed God did not wish the man to live in Paradise without the mysteries of spiritual things being presented to him in bodily form. So then in the other trees he was provided with nourishment, in this one with a sacrament... He is rightly called whatever came before him in order to signify him.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, The Literal Meaning of Genesis, VIII, 4, 8 (On Genesis, New City Press, p. 351-353)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Eastern Christianity the tree of life is the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Isaac the Syrian says that "Paradise is the love of God, in which the bliss of all the beatitudes is contained," and that "the tree of life is the love of God" (Homily 72).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{main article|Tree of life vision}}
The tree of life vision is a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] described and discussed in the [[Book of Mormon]]. According to the Book of Mormon, the vision was received in a [[dream]] by the prophet [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], and later in vision by his son [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], who wrote about it in the [[First Book of Nephi]]. The vision includes a path leading to a tree symbolizing [[salvation]], with an iron rod along the path whereby followers of [[Jesus]] may hold to the rod and avoid wandering off the path into pits or waters symbolizing the ways of sin. The vision also includes a large building wherein the wicked look down at the righteous and mock them.

The vision is said to symbolize the spiritual plight of humanity and is a well known and cited story within [[Mormonism]]. A Mormon commentator reflected a common Mormon belief that the vision is "one of the richest, most flexible, and far-reaching pieces of symbolic prophecy contained in the standard works [scriptures]."&lt;ref&gt;Corbin T. Volluz, "Lehi's Dream of the Tree of Life: Springboard to Prophecy," JBMS 2/2 (1993): 38. - as quoted in  Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life: Understanding the Dream as Visionary Literature, Charles Swift, Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute, 2005.

===Europe===
[[File:Husaby Church 2013 11th century Tree of Life sculpture.jpg|thumb|upright|11th century tree of life sculpture at an ancient [[Sweden|Swedish]] church]]
In ''Dictionnaire Mytho-Hermetique'' (Paris, 1737), [[Antoine-Joseph Pernety]], a famous [[alchemy|alchemist]], identified the tree of life with the [[Elixir of life]] and the [[Philosopher's Stone]].

In ''[[Stephen Oppenheimer#Eden in the East|Eden in the East]]'' (1998), [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] suggests that a tree-worshipping culture arose in [[Indonesia]] and was diffused by the so-called "Younger Dryas" event of c. 10,900 BCE or 12,900 BP, after which the sea level rose. This culture reached China (Szechuan), then [[India]] and the [[Middle East]]. Finally the Finno-Ugric strand of this diffusion spread through [[Russia]] to [[Finland]] where the Norse myth of [[Yggdrasil]] took root.

===Georgia===
The [[Borjgali]] ({{lang-ka|ბორჯღალი}}) is an ancient [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] tree of life symbol.

===Germanic paganism and Norse mythology===
In [[Germanic paganism]], trees played (and, in the form of reconstructive Heathenry and [[Germanic Neopaganism]], continue to play) a prominent role, appearing in various aspects of surviving texts and possibly in the name of gods.

The tree of life appears in [[Norse mythology|Norse religion]] as ''[[Yggdrasil]]'', the world tree, a massive tree (sometimes considered a [[European yew|yew]] or [[ash tree]]) with extensive lore surrounding it.  Perhaps related to Yggdrasil, accounts have survived of [[Germanic people|Germanic Tribes]]' honouring sacred trees within their societies.  Examples include [[Thor's Oak]], [[sacred grove]]s, the [[Sacred tree at Uppsala]], and the wooden [[Irminsul]] pillar. In [[Norse Mythology]], the apples from [[Iðunn]]'s ash box provide immortality for the gods.

The "Tree of Immortality" (Arabic: شجرة الخلود) is the tree of life motif as it appears in the [[Quran]]. It is also alluded to in hadiths and tafsir. Unlike the [[Tree of life (biblical)|biblical account]], the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, also called the tree of immortality, which Allah specifically forbade to Adam and Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheeler |first=Brannon |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo9jAavEHdIC&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tree+in+the+shade%22&amp;f=false |title=Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis |edition=annotated |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0826449566 |page=24 |quote=''Abu Hurayrah'': The Prophet Muhammad said: "In Paradise is a tree in the shade of which the stars course 100 years without cutting it: the Tree of Immortality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Oliver Leaman |year=2006 |editor-link=Oliver Leaman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=%22special%20tree%20in%20Eden%22&amp;f=false |title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780415326391 |page=11 |quote=Unlike the biblical account of Eden, the Qur'an mentions only one special tree in Eden, the Tree of Immortality, from which Adam and Eve were prohibited.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satan repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, thus disobeying Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Three Translations of the Koran (Al-Qur'an) Side by Side {{cite quran|20|120|s=ns}}, "Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away?

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the Indian [[Ahmadiyya]] movement founded in 1889, Quranic reference to the tree is symbolic; eating of the forbidden tree signifies that Adam disobeyed God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/original_sin.html | title=Quran, Adam and Original Sin | publisher=Al Islam | author=Bilal Khalid | accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=87&amp;region=E1&amp;CR=EN,E2 | title=The Holy Quran with English Translation and Commentary Volume 1 | page=86 | publisher=Islam International Publications | accessdate=June 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish sources===
{{main article|Etz Chaim|Tree of life (biblical)|l2=Biblical tree of life}}
''[[Etz Chaim]]'', Hebrew for "tree of life," is a common term used in Judaism. The expression, found in the [[Book of Proverbs]], is figuratively applied to the [[Torah]] itself.  ''Etz Chaim'' is also a common name for [[yeshiva]]s and [[synagogue]]s as well as for works of [[Rabbinic literature]]. It is also used to describe each of the wooden poles to which the parchment of a [[Sefer Torah]] is attached.

The tree of life is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]]; it is distinct from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. After [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] disobeyed God by eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were driven out of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Remaining in the garden, however, was the tree of life. To prevent their access to this tree in the future, [[cherubs|Cherubim]] with a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22-24|9}})

In the Book of Proverbs, the tree of life is associated with [[wisdom]]: "[Wisdom] is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy ''[is every one]'' that retaineth her." ({{bibleverse||Proverbs|3:13-18|9}}) In {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|15:4|HE}} the tree of life is associated with calmness: "A soothing tongue is a tree of life; but perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;For other direct references to the tree of life in the Jewish biblical canon, see also {{bibleverse||Proverbs|11:30|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|13:12|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Enoch]], generally considered [[biblical canon|non-canonical]], states that in the time of the great judgment God will give all those whose names are in the [[Book of Life]] fruit to eat from the tree of life.&lt;!-- where in Enoch? --&gt;

Jewish [[mysticism]] depicts the tree of life in the form of ten interconnected nodes, as the central symbol of the [[Kabbalah]]. It comprises the ten ''[[Sefirot]]'' powers in the divine realm. The [[panentheistic]] and [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|anthropomorphic]] emphasis of this [[Emanationism|emanationist]] theology interpreted the Torah, Jewish observance, and the purpose of Creation as the symbolic esoteric drama of unification in the ''Sefirot'', restoring harmony to Creation. From the time of the [[Renaissance]] onwards, Jewish Kabbalah became incorporated as an important tradition in non-Jewish Western culture, first through its adoption by [[Christian Kabbalah]], and continuing in [[Western esotericism]] occult [[Hermetic Qabalah]]. These adapted the Judaic Kabbalah tree of life [[Syncretism|syncretically]] by associating it with other religious traditions, esoteric theologies, and magical practices.

===Mesoamerica===
{{Main article|Mesoamerican world tree}}
The concept of world trees is a prevalent motif in [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Religious cosmology|cosmologies]] and [[iconography]]. World trees embodied the four [[cardinal directions]], which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic ''[[axis mundi]]'' connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.&lt;ref name="MiTa186"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Mary |authorlink=Mary Miller (art historian) |author2=[[Karl Taube]] |year=1993 |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=978-0-500-05068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and mythological traditions of cultures such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Izapa]]n, [[Mixtec]], [[Olmec]], and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a ''[[ceiba]]'' tree, and is known variously as a ''wacah chan'' or ''yax imix che'', depending on the [[Mayan language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finley |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=Raising the sky: The Maya creation myth and the Milky Way|work=The Real Maya Prophecies: Astronomy in the Inscriptions and Codices |url=http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/creation.html |publisher=Maya Astronomy |accessdate=9 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106021734/http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/creation.html |archivedate=6 January 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright [[caiman]], whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.&lt;ref name="MiTa186"/&gt;

Directional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in [[Mesoamerican calendars]], and the directional colors and deities. [[Mesoamerican codices]] which have this association outlined include the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Codex Borgia|Borgia]] and [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer]] [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref name="MiTa186"/&gt; It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.

World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a "water-monster," symbolic of the underworld). The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freidel, David A. |author2=[[Linda Schele]] |author3=Joy Parker |year=1993 |title=Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path |publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-688-10081-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In a myth passed down among the [[Iroquois]], ''The World on the Turtle's Back'', explains the origin of the land in which a tree of life is described. According to the myth, it is found in the heavens, where the first humans lived, until a pregnant woman fell and landed in an endless sea. Saved by a giant turtle from drowning, she formed the world on its back by planting bark taken from the tree.

The tree of life motif is present in the traditional [[Ojibway]] cosmology and traditions. It is sometimes described as Grandmother Cedar, or ''Nookomis Giizhig'' in [[Anishinaabemowin]].

In the book [[Black Elk Speaks]], [[Black Elk]], an Oglala [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Sioux) ''wičháša wakȟáŋ'' ([[medicine man]] and holy man), describes his vision in which after dancing around a dying tree that has never bloomed he is transported to the other world (spirit world) where he meets wise elders, 12 men and 12 women.  The elders tell Black Elk that they will bring him to meet "Our Father, the two-legged chief" and bring him to the [[Axis mundi|center of a hoop]] where he sees the tree in full leaf and bloom and the "chief" standing against the tree. Coming out of his trance he hopes to see that the earthly tree has bloomed, but it is dead.&lt;ref name="First People"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/Black-Elk-Speaks/Black-Elk-Speaks-Visions-of-the-Other-World.html | title=Black Elk Speaks | publisher=First People of America and Canada - Turtle Island. | work=Visions of the Other World | accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serer religion ===
In [[Serer religion]], the tree of life as a religious concept forms the basis of [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]]. Trees were the first things created on Earth by the supreme being [[Roog]] (or [[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]). In the competing versions of the [[Serer people|Serer]] creation myth, the ''Somb'' (''[[Prosopis africana]]'') and the ''Saas'' tree ([[Faidherbia albida|acacia albida]]) are both viewed as trees of life.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt; However, the prevailing view is that, the ''Somb'' was the first tree on Earth and the progenitor of [[plant species|plant life]].&lt;ref name="Serer"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La Civilisation [[Serer people|Sereer]] - ''Pangool''", vol. 2., Les Nouvelles Editions [[Africa]]ines du [[Senegal]] (1990), pp 125–6, 199–200, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} &amp; {{en icon}} Niangoran-Bouah, Georges, "L'univers Akan des poids à peser l'or : les poids dans la société", Les nouvelles éditions africaines - MLB, (1987), p 25, {{ISBN|2723614034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Somb'' was also used in the [[Serer ancient history|Serer tumuli and burial chambers]], many of which had survived for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt; Thus, ''Somb'' is not only the tree of life in Serer society, but the symbol of immortality.&lt;ref name="Serer"/&gt;

===Hinduism===

In the sacred books of Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma), Puranas mention divine tree Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). This divine tree is guarded by Gandharvas in the garden of Amaravati, city under the control of Indra, King of gods. Popular story goes like this, for a very long time, gods and demi-gods who are believed to be fathered by Kashyapa Prajapati and have different mothers. After a long time frequent battles between the two half-brother clans, both groups decided to churn the milky ocean to obtain Amrutam (అమృతం, अमृत ) and share equally. During the churning, along with many other mythical items emerged the Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). It is gold in colour. It has mesmerizing aura. It can be pleased with chanting and offers. When it is pleased, it grants every wish. 

==Popular culture==
Austrian [[symbolist]] artist [[Gustav Klimt]] portrayed his version of the tree of life in his painting, ''[[The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze]]''.  This iconic painting later inspired the external facade of the "New Residence Hall" (also called the "Tree House"), a colorful 21-story student residence hall at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Masco&gt;{{cite web|title=MassArt Residence Story: This is the house that collaboration built|url=http://www.masco.org/news/sp-house-collaboration-built|work=MASCO: Medical Academic and Scientific Community Organization|publisher=MASCO, Inc.|accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Herbert]]'s poem ''[[s:The Sacrifice|The Sacrifice]]'' (part of ''[[George Herbert#Works|The Temple]]'', 1633), the tree of life is the [[rood]] on which Jesus Christ was crucified. In [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', the tree of life plays a role, especially in the sixth published book (the first in the in-world chronology) ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]''.

[[Alex Proyas]]' 2009 film ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' ends with the two young protagonists directed towards the tree of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.tvguide.com/knowing/review/296881 | title=''Knowing'': Review | first=Cammila | last=Albertson | newspaper=[[TV Guide]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | year=2009| accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Supernatural (season 13)|season 13]] of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', fruit from the tree of life is an important ingredient in a spell to open a portal to an alternate reality. The angel [[Castiel (Supernatural)|Castiel]] is able to find the tree in [[Syria]] and returns from a mission with the fruit in ''[[Scoobynatural]]''. The fruit is used in subsequent episodes as part of the spell to open the portal between the worlds.

The '''University of North Carolina School of the Arts''' ('''UNCSA''') is a public coeducational arts conservatory in [[Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]] that grants high school, undergraduate and graduate degrees. Founded in 1963 as the North Carolina School of the Arts by then-Governor [[Terry Sanford]], it was the first public arts conservatory in the [[United States]]. Programs offered by the conservatory, including but not limited to dance, drama and film, are widely recognized as some of the best programs across the world and consistently rank amongst the top. The school owns and operates the [[Stevens Center]] in Downtown Winston-Salem and is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].

==About the school==

==History==
===Founding===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Terry Sanford2.jpg|thumb|left|Terry Sanford {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;The idea of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts was initiated in 1962 by [[Vittorio Giannini]], a leading American Composer and teacher of Composition at [[Juilliard]], Curtis and Manhattan, who approached then-governor [[Terry Sanford]] and enlisted the help of author [[John Ehle]], William Sprott Greene, Jr.&lt;ref name=Staff&gt;Staff Reporter. [https://www.charlotteobserver.com/ "Course Stresses Originality, Blends Ballet, Geometry."] Charlotte Observer. Feb, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and Martha Dulin Muilenburg of Charlotte, North Carolina, to support his dream of an arts conservatory. State funds were appropriated, and a North Carolina Conservatory Committee was established. The School of the Arts became a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banner|first1=Leslie|title=A Passionate Preference|date=1992|publisher=Down Home Press|isbn=1878086014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name change===
On April 9, 2008, the school's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the school from the North Carolina School of the Arts to the "University of North Carolina School of the Arts" in order to raise its profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncarts.edu/pressreleases/Releases2008/May2008/FAQs.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the proposed name change: NCSA to UNCSA|publisher=University of North Carolina School of the Arts|accessdate=2008-06-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517002540/http://www.ncarts.edu/pressreleases/Releases2008/May2008/FAQs.htm|archivedate=2008-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change was approved by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors on May 9, 2008, the [[North Carolina Senate]] on June 24, 2008, and the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]] on July 11, 2008. The law was signed into law by Governor [[Mike Easley]] and took effect in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intranet.northcarolina.edu/docs/bog/minutes/2008/May/Revised_061808_post_GAC_May_9,_2008_Open_Minutes.pdf|title=May 9, 2008, Board of Governors Meeting Minutes|publisher=University of North Carolina Board of Governors|pages=6–7|accessdate=2008-06-26|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720013814/http://intranet.northcarolina.edu/docs/bog/minutes/2008/May/Revised_061808_post_GAC_May_9,_2008_Open_Minutes.pdf|archivedate=July 20, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robertson, Gary D. |author2=Woodward, Whitney |author3=Robinson |author4=Natasha |url=http://sandspuronline.com/article_ap?id=124981|title=June 25, 2008, at the North Carolina General Assembly|date=2008-06-25|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-06-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaders===
Vittorio Giannini was the School's founder and first President. His vision of arts education shaped UNCSA at its beginning and continues to influence it today. Giannini served as President of the fledgling institution until his death in November 1966. A resolution dated December 3, 1966 by the Board of Trustees and the Governor pays tribute to Giannini as the founder of the School, noting that 'When it was a dream, he sought a home for it and helped bring it into being. When it was an infant institution, he gave it structure and design.' The Pulitzer Prize-winning composer [[Robert Ward (composer)|Robert Ward]] became UNCSA's second president following Giannini's death.

In 1974 [[Robert Suderburg]] became UNCSA's third chancellor following Martin Sokoloff, the administrative director, who served as interim chancellor from 1973 to 1974. During his time at UNCSA the Workplace building, containing the Semans Library, was opened on the UNCSA campus, as well as the [[Stevens Center]], previously the Carolina Theatre, in downtown Winston-Salem. The gala opening of the Stevens Center featured the school's symphony orchestra conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]], with [[Isaac Stern]] as soloist and [[Gregory Peck]] as the Master of Ceremonies. Attendees included [[Agnes de Mille]], [[Cliff Robertson]], [[Jim Hunt|Governor James Hunt]], President and Mrs. [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Lady Bird Johnson]]. The Stevens Center remains UNCSA's largest performance facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/apr/27/focus-on-arts-having-survived-early-missteps-today/ |title=Having survived early missteps, today's Stevens Center thrives 25 Entertaining Years |publisher=The Winston-Salem Journal |accessdate=2008-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5YyhoxIrW?url=http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/apr/27/focus-on-arts-having-survived-early-missteps-today/ |archivedate=July 1, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Jane E. Milley became Chancellor at the School of the Arts in September 1984. In the spring of 1990, Alex C. Ewing was appointed Chancellor. He assumed the position in July 1990, following Philip R. Nelson, former Dean of music at Yale University, who served as Interim Chancellor during the 1989-90 school year. Ewing had been associated with the School since 1985, when he became chairman of the Board of Visitors. In 1988 he established the Lucia Chase Endowed Fellowship for Dance at the School, in memory of his mother, a co-founder and principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre. A man of diverse talents, Ewing almost single-handedly revitalized the Joffrey Ballet during his tenure as general director in the 1960s. As Chancellor, Ewing oversaw the success of the School's $25 million campaign for endowment and scholarships. He also orchestrated a combination of local, state and national support to secure the establishment of NCSA's fifth arts school, the School of Filmmaking, in 1993. Ewing took a special interest in NCSA's campus plan. Other capital projects he spearheaded included a new Sculpture Studio, a new Fitness Center, and the start of the Student Commons renovation. Wade Hobgood, Dean of the College of the Arts at California State University at Long Beach since 1993, was named Chancellor in February 2000, assuming the position on July 1, 2000. A native of Wilson, NC, Hobgood attended East Carolina University, where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts in Communication Arts.

[[John Mauceri]] was UNCSA's seventh chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncarts.edu/chancellor/ |title=NCArts.edu: Chancellor Home Page |publisher=University of North Carolina School of the Arts |accessdate=2008-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5YygQtb91?url=http://ncarts.edu/chancellor/ |archivedate=July 1, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He assumed the position following Dr. Gretchen M. Bataille, former Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs of the 16-campus University of North Carolina, who served as Interim Chancellor during the 2005-2006 academic year. Mr. Mauceri earned Bachelor of Science and Master of Philosophy in music theory degrees from Yale University, where he was also a member of the faculty for fifteen years. He is internationally known as a conductor, arranger and music director; he was the first American to hold the post of music director in both British and Italian opera houses. For the last fifteen years he had been the Director of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra in Los Angeles, California. A distinguished recording artist, he has won Grammy, Tony, Emmy and Drama Desk awards. In addition, he frequently writes articles on opera, musical theater and music for the American cinema. Chancellor Mauceri announced in the Fall of 2012 that he would retire at the conclusion of the 2012-2013 academic year.

[[M. Lindsay Bierman]]  is the current chancellor of UNCSA, succeeding [[James Moeser]] who served as interim chancellor from 2013 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/04/11/3776977_southern-living-editor-elected.html|title=Southern Living editor elected chancellor at UNC School of the Arts|accessdate=2014-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225145416/http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/04/11/3776977_southern-living-editor-elected.html|archivedate=2014-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:Ncsa5.jpg|thumb|right|The façade of Watson Hall]]The school's campus consists of {{convert|77|acre|m2}} in [[Winston-Salem]], near Old Salem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncarts.edu/visitorscenter/factsheet.htm |title=Visitor's Center: Fact Sheet |publisher=University of North Carolina School of the Arts |accessdate=2008-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5YydulFMb?url=http://ncarts.edu/visitorscenter/factsheet.htm |archivedate=July 1, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are eight residence halls &amp;ndash; six for college students, two for high school students, an on-campus student apartment complex and an off-campus student apartment complex within walking distance. The school has eleven performance and screening spaces; the ACE Exhibition Complex with three movie theaters, Crawford Recital Hall (with a Fisk Organ), deMille Theatre for dance, Hood Recital Hall, Performance Place with three theatrical spaces, the [[Stevens Center]] in downtown Winston-Salem, and Watson Chamber Music Hall. Performance Place is the home of the drama department, the ACE Theatre is the home of the filmmaking department, deMille theatre is the home of the dance department and Watson, Hood and Crawford halls are used by the music department. The Stevens Center is shared.

The school also has a fitness center with an interior basketball court, the Semans Library, the Hanes Student Commons, Workplace (adjacent to the library) which holds Visual Arts Studios as well as Offices and Studios for the School of Dance, Gray Building, which holds high school academics on the third floor and music offices and practice rooms on the first and second floors, a building holding two dance studios, a visual arts sculpting studio, a large design and production complex, a costume, wig and makeup studio, a welcome center, and several buildings for administrative offices and college academics. A new library is in the planning stages.

==Performance opportunities==
UNCSA offers many performance opportunities throughout the course of a school year. Dance students have three seasonal performances: Fall dance, Winter dance, and Spring dance. They also perform the Nutcracker every Christmas, and have many other minor performances throughout the school year. Music students have the chance to perform in front of their peers every Wednesday at performance hour, and students are usually in a large ensemble, such as jazz band, orchestra, opera, or wind ensemble. These ensembles each perform several times a year.

The School of Design and Production is responsible for the scenery, costumes, wigs, makeup, lighting, sound, and stage management for all shows produced by the School of Drama, two operas that UNCSA produces each year through the Fletcher Opera Institute, as well as dance performances, although dance costumes are provided partly by the Costume department and also by the School of Dance's own professional costume shop.

The Film-making school is host to the ACE Exhibition Complex, where students can display their work and watch others. This complex, along with the [[Stevens Center]], is host to the [[RiverRun International Film Festival]] every spring.

===All school musicals===
Once every four years, UNCSA produces an all school musical – a massive, extensive, Broadway-style production involving all five arts schools of the conservatory. All students have the opportunity to audition. Past all-school musicals have included ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Kiss Me, Kate|Kiss Me Kate]]'', and ''Canterbury Tales'',&lt;ref name="Broadwayworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=16399|title=50th Anniversary West Side Story Coming to NCSA and Ravina|publisher=Broadwayworld.com|accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the most recent one being ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''. The purpose of the all-school musicals are not only to provide the students with a professional experience, but also to raise money and awareness for the school. For example, for ''West Side Story'' the lead roles and Chancellor [[John Mauceri]] traveled to New York to promote the school and the school's revival of the musical.&lt;ref name="Kudzugazette.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kudzugazette.com/search.php?misc=search&amp;subaction=showfull&amp;id=1173660059&amp;archive=1191535528&amp;cnshow=news&amp;ucat=4&amp;start_from=&amp;|title=West Side Story Visits New York City|publisher=The Kudzu Gazette|accessdate=2007-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024154707/http://kudzugazette.com/search.php?misc=search&amp;subaction=showfull&amp;id=1173660059&amp;archive=1191535528&amp;cnshow=news&amp;ucat=4&amp;start_from=&amp;|archive-date=2007-10-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''West Side Story'' was performed at UNCSA's Stevens Center from May 3–13, 2007, and then went on tour to [[Chicago]]'s [[Ravinia Festival]]&lt;ref name="ncarts.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncarts.edu/pressreleases/Releases2007/March07/wssannouncement.htm|title=North Carolina School of the Arts Presents New Production To Celebrate 50th Anniversary of West Side Story|publisher=The North Carolina School of the Arts|accessdate=2007-03-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070616195044/http://www.ncarts.edu/pressreleases/Releases2007/March07/wssannouncement.htm|archivedate=2007-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on June 8, 2007. The production was directed by Dean of Drama [[Gerald Freedman]], the assistant director of the original production, and conducted by UNCSA Chancellor and world renown conductor [[John Mauceri]]. It has also been reported that [[Arthur Laurents]] changed portions of the dialogue for the UNCSA production.&lt;ref name="Kudzugazette.com" /&gt; In May 2011, UNCSA presented "Oklahoma!" as an all-school musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsa.edu/pressreleases/Releases2011/Apr11/OKpostopen.htm |title=News Article |publisher=Uncsa.edu |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; All school musicals are no longer a part of the UNCSA curriculum.

==Student life==
===Mascot===
[[File:UNCSAFightingPickleMascot.jpg|thumb|UNCSAFightingPickleMascot]]

Although UNCSA has no officially sanctioned athletic teams, students are very proud of their mascot: The Fighting Pickle. The premiere athletic event from the early 1970s was an annual touch-football game between a UNCSA team versus one from a Wake Forest University fraternity.

The question of "How The Pickles got their name" has come up with the passage of time since 1972 when the football team first took to the field as "The NCSA Pickles." The answer is very simple: a contest was held to name the football team. The winning entry was submitted jointly by three undergraduates. In 1972 it was simply "The Pickles," along with a slogan, "Sling 'Em By The Warts!" Eventually they became "The Fighting Pickles." This account of how the Pickles got their name is corroborated by large numbers of those who were at the school at that time. As of September 12, 2012, the official [https://web.archive.org/web/20151117052854/http://library.uncsa.edu/home/archives/the-true-story-of-how-the-pickles-got-their-name UNCSA Archive] has accepted this explanation of the mascot's origin.

In the spring of 2010, UNCSA hosted a competition to choose the new, official "Fighting Pickle" mascot.  Design entries and voting was opened to students, alumni, faculty, staff and former faculty and staff.  The winner was unveiled on May 21, 2010 in the Student Union's cafe, "The Pickle Jar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsa.edu/visitorscenter/PickleMascot.htm|title=2010 Pickle Mascot Winner|publisher=The University of North Carolina School of the Arts|accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, 2012, Cheetos Brand named The UNCSA Fighting Pickle [http://www.pepsico.com/live/pressrelease/Cheetos-Brand-Celebrates-College-Sports-With-Inaugural-Top-25-Cheesiest-Mascots-08202012 the nation's No. 1 Cheesiest Mascot].

*Pride (UNCSA's Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender support organization)
*United States Institute for Theatre Technology (USITT) Student Chapter
