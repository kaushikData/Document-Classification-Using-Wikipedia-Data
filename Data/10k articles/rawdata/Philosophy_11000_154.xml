{{Hegelianism}}
'''Absolute idealism''' is an [[ontology|ontologically]] [[monistic]] [[philosophy]] "chiefly associated with [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[G. W. F. Hegel]], both [[German idealist]] philosophers of the 19th century, [[Josiah Royce]], an American philosopher, and others, but, in its essentials, the product of Hegel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Absolute-Idealism Absolute Idealism – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term ''{{lang|de|absoluter Idealismus}}'' occurs for the first time in Schelling's ''Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur als Einleitung in das Studium dieser Wissenschaft'' (''Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature: as Introduction to the Study of this Science''), Vol. 1, P. Krüll, 1803 [1797], p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; It is Hegel's account of how [[being]] is ultimately comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole (''[[Absolute (philosophy)|das Absolute]]''). Hegel asserted that in order for the thinking [[self (psychology)|subject]] (human reason or consciousness) to be able to know its [[object (philosophy)|object]] (the world) at all, there must be in some sense an [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] of thought and being. Otherwise, the subject would never have access to the object and we would have no certainty about any of our knowledge of the world. To account for the differences between thought and being, however, as well as the richness and diversity of each, the unity of thought and being cannot be expressed as the abstract identity "[[Law of identity|A=A]]". Absolute idealism is the attempt to demonstrate this unity using a new "speculative" philosophical method, which requires new concepts and rules of logic. According to Hegel, the absolute ground of being is essentially a dynamic, historical process of necessity that unfolds by itself in the form of increasingly complex forms of being and of consciousness, ultimately giving rise to all the diversity in the world and in the [[concept]]s with which we think and make sense of the world.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The absolute idealist position dominated philosophy in nineteenth-century England and Germany, while exerting significantly less influence in the United States. The absolute idealist position should be distinguished from the [[subjective idealism]] of [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], the [[transcendental idealism]] of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], or the [[post-Kantian]] transcendental idealism (also known as '''critical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781-1801'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[J. G. Fichte|Fichte]] and of the early Schelling.&lt;ref&gt;Nectarios G. Limnatis, ''German Idealism and the Problem of Knowledge: Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel'', Springer, 2008, pp. 138, 166, 177.&lt;!--the term 'post-Kantian transcendental idealism' is used on page 177 as constrasting to 'absolute idealism'--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
For Hegel, the interaction of opposites generates in [[dialectic]]al fashion all concepts we use in order to understand the world. Moreover, this development occurs not only in the individual mind, but also through history. In ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', for example, Hegel presents a history of human consciousness as a journey through stages of explanations of the world. Each successive explanation created problems and oppositions within itself, leading to tensions which could only be overcome by adopting a view that could accommodate these oppositions in a higher unity. At the base of spirit lies a rational development. This means that [[the absolute]] itself is exactly that rational development. The [[Logical assertion|assertion]] that "All reality is spirit" means that all of reality rationally orders itself and while doing so creates the oppositions we find in it. Even [[nature]] is not different from the spirit since it itself is ordered by the determinations given to us by spirit. Nature, as that which is not spirit is so determined by spirit, therefore it follows that nature is not absolutely other, but understood as other and therefore not essentially alien. 

The aim of Hegel was to show that we do not relate to the world as if it is other from us, but that we continue to find ourselves back into that world. With the realisation that both the mind and the world are ordered according to the same rational principles, our access to the world has been made secure, a security which was lost after Kant proclaimed the 'Ding an sich' to be ultimately inaccessible.

==Neo-Hegelianism&lt;!--'Neo-Hegelianism', 'Neo-hegelianism', 'Neo-Hegelian', and 'Neo-hegelian' redirect here--&gt;==
{{also|Post-Hegelianism}}
'''Neo-Hegelianism''' is a school (or schools) of thought associated and inspired by the works of Hegel.

It refers mainly to the doctrines of an idealist school of philosophers that were prominent in Great Britain and in the United States between 1870 and 1920. The name is also sometimes applied to cover other philosophies of the period that were Hegelian in inspiration—for instance, those of [[Benedetto Croce]] and of [[Giovanni Gentile]].

===Hegelianism after Hegel===
Although Hegel died in 1831, his philosophy lived on. In politics, there was a developing schism, even before his death,  between [[right Hegelians]] and [[left Hegelians]].

In the [[philosophy of religion]], Hegel's influence soon became very powerful in the English-speaking world. The British school, called [[British idealism]] and partly Hegelian in inspiration, included [[Thomas Hill Green]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], [[F.H. Bradley]], [[William Wallace (Scottish philosopher)|William Wallace]],  and [[Edward Caird]]. It was importantly directed towards [[political philosophy]] and political and social policy, but also towards [[metaphysics]] and logic, as well as [[aesthetics]].

America saw the development of a school of Hegelian thought move toward [[pragmatism]].

===German twentieth-century neo-Hegelians===
In Germany there was a neo-Hegelianism (''Neuhegelianismus'') of the early twentieth century, partly developing out of the [[Neo-Kantian]]s. [[Richard Kroner]] wrote one of its leading works, a history of German idealism from a Hegelian point of view.

===Other notable neo-Hegelians===
*[[Francis Herbert Bradley]] (1846–1924), a British absolute idealist who adapted Hegel's Metaphysics.
*[[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] (1848–1923), a British idealist / speculative philosopher, who had an important influence in political philosophy and public and social policy. 
*[[Josiah Royce]] (1855–1916), an American defender of absolute idealism.
*[[Benedetto Croce]] (1866–1952), an Italian philosopher who defended Hegel's account on how we understand history.  Croce wrote primarily on topics of [[Aesthetics]], such as artistic inspiration/intuition and personal expression.
*[[Giovanni Gentile]] (1875–1944), important philosopher within the [[fascist]] movement. Ghost-wrote "[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]".
*[[Alexandre Kojève]] (1902–1968), gave rise to a new understanding of Hegel in France during the 1930s. His lectures were attended by a small but influential group of intellectuals including [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Georges Bataille]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[André Breton]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Roger Caillois]], [[Michel Leiris]], [[Henry Corbin]], and [[Jean Hyppolite]], and influenced [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

==Criticisms==
Exponents of [[analytic philosophy]], which has been the dominant form of Anglo-American philosophy for most of the last century, have criticised Hegel's work as hopelessly obscure. [[Existentialism|Existentialists]] also criticise Hegel for ultimately choosing an essentialistic whole over the particularity of existence. [[Epistemological]]ly, one of the main problems plaguing Hegel's system is how these thought determinations have bearing on reality as such. A perennial problem of his metaphysics seems to be the question of how spirit externalises itself and how the concepts it generates can say anything true about nature. At the same time, they will have to, because otherwise Hegel's system concepts would say nothing about something that is not itself a concept and the system would come down to being only an intricate game involving vacuous concepts.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

===Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] noted that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] created his absolute idealism after Kant had discredited all proofs of [[God]]'s existence. The Absolute is a non-personal substitute for the concept of God. It is the one subject that perceives the [[universe]] as one object. Individuals share in parts of this [[perception]]. Since the [[universe]] exists as an [[idea]] in the [[mind]] of the Absolute, absolute idealism copies [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s [[pantheism]] in which everything is in God or [[Nature]].

===Moore and Russell===
Famously, [[G. E. Moore]]’s rebellion against absolutism found expression in his defense of common sense against the radically counter-intuitive conclusions of absolutism (e.g. time is unreal, change is unreal, separateness is unreal, imperfection is unreal, etc.). G. E. Moore also pioneered the use of logical analysis against the absolutists, which Bertrand Russell promulgated and began the entire tradition of analytic philosophy with its use against the philosophies of his direct predecessors. In recounting his own mental development Russell reports, "For some years after throwing over [absolutism] I had an optimistic riot of opposite beliefs. I thought that whatever Hegel had denied must be true." (Russell in Barrett and Adkins 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;477) Also:
{{Quotation|G.E. Moore took the lead in the rebellion, and I followed, with a sense of emancipation. [Absolutism] argued that everything common sense believes in is mere appearance. We reverted to the opposite extreme, and thought that everything is real that common sense, uninfluenced by philosophy or theology, supposes real.|[[Bertrand Russell]]; as quoted in Klemke 2000, p.28}}

===Pragmatism===
Particularly the works of [[William James]] and [[F. C. S. Schiller]], both founding members of pragmatism, made lifelong assaults on Absolute Idealism. James was particularly concerned with the monism that Absolute Idealism engenders, and the consequences this has for the problem of evil, free will, and moral action. Schiller, on the other hand, attacked Absolute Idealism for being too disconnected with our practical lives, and argued that its proponents failed to realize that thought is merely a tool for action rather than for making discoveries about an abstract world that fails to have any impact on us.

Absolute idealism has greatly altered the philosophical landscape. Paradoxically, (though, from a Hegelian point of view, maybe not paradoxically at all) this influence is mostly felt in the strong opposition it engendered. Both [[logical positivism]] and [[Analytic philosophy]] grew out of a rebellion against Hegelianism prevalent in England during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Searle03P1"&gt;
"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, [[existentialism]], or [[Marxism]]—feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy." [[John Searle]] (2003) ''Contemporary Philosophy in the United States'' in N. Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Continental [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]] and [[post-modernism]] also seek to 'free themselves from Hegel's thought'. [[Martin Heidegger]], one of the leading figures of [[Continental philosophy]] in the 20th century, sought to distance himself from Hegel's work. One of Heidegger's philosophical themes was "overcoming metaphysics".

'''Alex Battler''' (Russian name – Aliev, Rafik Shagi-Akzamovich, born on December 10, 1946), known in [[Russia]] under the pen name Oleg Arin, is a Soviet-born Russian-Canadian scholar and political writer. He is a member of the organizations «[[Freedom From Religion Foundation]]» and «Defend Science» (US).

==Life and career==
Alex Battler was born in [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan]]. In 1966 he entered the Faculty of Oriental studies of the A. Zhdanov Leningrad State University. After graduating in 1971, he enrolled in the post-graduate school at the Institute of the Far Eastern Studies in Moscow. In 1975 he was conferred the Degree of Candidate of Science (= PhD), and in 1988 his Doctor of Science dissertation in the specialty "history of foreign policy and international relations".

In 1993 he immigrated to Canada where he acquired Canadian citizenship. In 1997 he returned to Russia and worked at several institutions of higher learning in Moscow. In 2001 he moved to the United Kingdom; later he lived for several years in France. Currently he has permanent residence in New York.

Through the years he held various positions at different research institutions: the Institute of the Far Eastern Studies; the [[Institute of World Economy and International Relations]]; the Institute of Social Sciences of the CPSU Central Committee; [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]] of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Institute of Philosophy. He served as Director of the Institute of Economic and International Studies of the Pacific Region ([[Vladivostok]]).

He also taught as a professor of [[political science]], economics, and [[international relations]] at several universities and institutes in Russia ([[Moscow State University]]; the Institute of Philosophy; the International Independent University of Ecology &amp; Political Science); in Japan ([[Nagoya University]]); in Canada (the [[University of British Columbia]]).

==Work==
The result of Battler's scientific work is a number of laws and regularities in the areas of philosophy, [[sociology]] and the theory of international relations; he discovered these laws based on re-interpreting key terms and turning into concepts and categories. The single most important among them is the category of ''force'' which in the book ''Dialectics of Force'' turned into ontóbia (ontological force) – one of the attributes of being, along with the categories of matter, motion, time and space. This attribute status of ontóbia enabled Battler to advance his own version of the [[Big Bang]] conception and of the Universe's expansion process. In the organic world ontóbia turns into orgábia (the organic force). From the perspective of Battler's theory, life begins with man. The ontóbia theory also makes its possible to resolve the problems of [[consciousness]] and [[thought]], of their qualitative differences and manifestations.

In another book titled ''Society: Progress and Force (Criteria and First Principles)'' Battler formulated new definitions of the concept ''Progress'' and the forms of social forces' manifestation through the laws of force (principles): The First Principle of [[social development]], or the law of social force; and the Second Principle of social development, or the law of social knowledge. In the book ''On Love, Family, and the State'' he presented the laws of ''love'' and ''family'', which are tied to the functioning of the law of [[entropy]] growth.

Within the framework of the international relations theory Battler formulated (in his monograph ''The 21st Century: the World without Russia'') two laws: the law of [[geoeconomics]] (poles) and the law of [[geostrategy]] (center of power). He also introduced a new concept: ''the foreign policy potential'' of a state – and methods for calculating it, as well as the optimal proportions of expenditures on [[foreign policy]] in accordance with the state's foreign policy goals.

Battler describes himself as a follower of the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] teaching.

Battler also authored the 13 commandments of the roslyane, which he promotes as a replacement for the well-known [[Ten Commandments|Biblical commandments]]. In Battler's theory the roslyane are the people who should emerge in Russia after the current system is replaced.

'''Anders Vilhelm Lundstedt''' (11 September 1882 – 20 August 1955) was a Swedish jurist and legislator, particularly known as a proponent of [[Scandinavia]]n [[Legal Realism]], having been strongly influenced by his compatriot, the charismatic philosopher [[Axel Hägerström]]. He studied Law at [[Lund University]] and was a professor of law at the [[University of Uppsala]] from 1914 to 1947. Like Hägerström, [[Karl Olivecrona]] and [[Alf Ross]], he resists the exposition of rights as [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] entities, arguing that realistic legal analysis should dispense with them. Lundstedt's main focus in his theoretical work became a sustained attack on what he called the method of justice. He considered that there was no objective way to define the requirements of justice and that invocations of justice cloaked purely subjective preferences or unacceptable metaphysical claims. Instead, law and legislation should be guided by a method of social welfare centred on objective study of social conditions and of the practical effects and capabilities of law in improving society for all its members. Lundstedt was a member of the Swedish parliament for many years and promoted within it changes to the penal system and a range of other liberal reforms.

[[Image:Aristosseno.jpg|thumb|200px|A modern imagining of the appearance of Aristoxenus.]]
'''Aristoxenus of Tarentum''' ({{lang-el|Ἀριστόξενος ὁ Ταραντῖνος}}; born [[circa|c.]] 375, [[fl.]] 335 BCE) was a Greek [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher, and a pupil of [[Aristotle]]. Most of his writings, which dealt with [[philosophy]], [[ethics]] and [[music]], have been lost, but one musical treatise, ''Elements of Harmony'' (Greek: Ἁρμονικὰ στοιχεῖα;&lt;!--genitive in original is followed by the ordinal number of each book that make up the whole work and should not be used in isolation--&gt; [[Latin]]: ''[[Elementa harmonica]]''), survives incomplete, as well as some fragments concerning rhythm and meter. The ''Elements'' is the chief source of our knowledge of ancient Greek music.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Aristoxenus of Tarentum" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Aristoxenus was born at [[Taranto|Tarentum]], and was the son of a learned musician named Spintharus (otherwise Mnesias).&lt;ref&gt;Suda, ''Aristoxenos''; Aelian, ''H. A.'' ii. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He learned music from his father, and having then been instructed by [[Lamprus of Erythrae]] and [[Xenophilus]] the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]], he finally became a pupil of [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, iv. 11; Cicero, ''Tusc. Disp.'' i. 18&lt;/ref&gt; whom he appears to have rivaled in the variety of his studies. According to the [[Suda]],&lt;ref name="suda"&gt;Suda, ''Aristoxenos''&lt;/ref&gt; he heaped insults on Aristotle after his death, because Aristotle had designated [[Theophrastus]] as the next [[scholarch|head]] of the [[Peripatetic school]], a position which Aristoxenus himself had coveted having achieved great distinction as a pupil of Aristotle. This story is, however, contradicted by [[Aristocles of Messene|Aristocles]], who asserts that he never mentioned Aristotle but with the greatest respect. Nothing is known of his life after the time of Aristotle's departure, apart from a comment in ''Elementa Harmonica'' concerning his works.&lt;ref&gt;Aristocles ap. Eusebius, ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' xv. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A. Barker"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xRM9WLpswiEC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Elementa+Harmonica&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mm9GVaSBOdHjaJ7wgfgG&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Elementa%20Harmonica&amp;f=false|author= A. Barker|title=The Science of Harmonics in Classical Greece|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= 2007 |ISBN=1139468626| accessdate=2015-05-03}}(ed. "No more of his life-history is known....")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of his works==
His writings, said to have consisted of four hundred and fifty-three books,&lt;ref name="suda"/&gt; and dealt with [[philosophy]], [[ethics]] and music.  
Although his final years were in the Peripatetic School, and he hoped to succeed Aristotle on his death, Aristonexus was strongly influenced by Pythagoreanism, and was only a follower of Aristotle in so far as Aristotle was a follower of Plato and Pythagoras. Thus, as Sophie Gibson tells us,&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Gibson, ''Aristoxenus of Tarentum and the Birth of Musicology''{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Place, publisher, year, a page citation, and ISBN are needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; “the various philosophical influences” on Aristoxenus included growing up in the profoundly Pythagorean city of Taras (Tarentum), home also of the two Pythagoreans Archytas and Philolaus, and his father's (Pythagorean) musical background, which he inculcated into his son. Gibson tells us that, after the influence of his father:

{{quote|The second important influence on Aristoxenos’ development was Pythagoreanism. Born in Tarentum, the city in which both Archytas and Philolaos had lived, it can be seen that the extended period of time that Aristoxenus spent in a Pythagorean environment made an indelible impact on the subject matter of his writings. Such titles as "Pythagorou bios", "Peri Pythaorou kai ton guorimon autou" and "Peri tou Pythagorikou biou" indicate Aristoxenus’ interest in the society. Furthermore, his works on education show evidence of Pythagorean influence, particularly in their tendency towards conservatism. Most importantly, speculation on the structure of music had its origin in a Pythagorean environment. Its focus was on the numerical relationship between notes and, at its furthest stretch, developed into a comparison between musical, mathematical and cosmological structures.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Gibson, ''Aristoxenus of Tarentum and the Birth of Musicology'', pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Aristoxenus disagreed with earlier Pythagorean musical theory in several respects, building on their work with ideas of his own. The only work of his that has come down to us is the three books of the ''Elements of Harmony'', an incomplete musical treatise.  Aristoxenus' theory had an empirical tendency; in music he held that the notes of the scale are to be judged, not as earlier Pythagoreans had believed, by mathematical ratio, but by the ear.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Vitruvius]] in his ''[[De architectura]]''&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/29239-h.htm#Page_139 Book V Chapter IV]&lt;/ref&gt; paraphrases the writings of Aristoxenus on music.  His ideas were responded to and developed by some later theorists such as [[Archestratus (music theorist)|Archestratus]], and his place in the methodological debate between rationalists and empiricists was commented upon by such writers as [[Ptolemais of Cyrene]].

The Pythagorean theory that the soul is a 'harmony' of the [[classical elements|four elements]] composing the body, and therefore mortal ("nothing at all," in the words of [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]] '' 1.22.51, cf. 1.11.24&lt;/ref&gt;), was ascribed to Aristoxenus (fr. 118-121 Wehrli) and [[Dicaearchus]]. This theory is comparable to the one offered by [[Simmias of Thebes#Character in Plato.27s Phaedo|Simmias in Plato's ''Phaedo'']].

==''Elementa harmonica''==
In his ''[[Elementa harmonica|Elements of Harmony]]'' (also ''Harmonics''), Aristoxenus attempted a complete and systematic exposition of [[Music of ancient Greece|music]]. The first book contains an explanation of the [[Tetrachord|genera]] of Greek music, and also of their [[Octave species|species]]; this is followed by some general definitions of terms, particularly those of [[sound]], [[Interval (music)|interval]], and [[Musical system of ancient greece|system]].&lt;ref name="hawkins66"&gt;Sir John Hawkins, (1868), ''A General History of the Science and Practice of Music'', Volume 1, pp. 66-7&lt;/ref&gt; In the second book Aristoxenus divides music into seven parts, which he takes to be: the genera, intervals, sounds, systems, tones or modes, mutations, and ''melopoeia''.&lt;ref name="hawkins66"/&gt; The remainder of the work is taken up with a discussion of the many parts of music according to the order which he had himself prescribed.&lt;ref name="hawkins66"/&gt;

While it is often held among modern scholars that Aristoxenus rejected the opinion of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] that arithmetic rules were the ultimate judge of intervals and that in every system there must be found a mathematical coincidence before such a system can be said to be harmonic,&lt;ref name="hawkins66"/&gt; it must be noted that Aristoxenus made extensive use of arithmetic terminology, notably to define varieties of semitones, and dieses in his descriptions of the various genera.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=142-144}}

In his second book he asserted that "by the hearing we judge of the magnitude of an interval, and by the understanding we consider its many powers."&lt;ref name="hawkins66"/&gt; And further he wrote, "that the nature of melody is best discovered by the perception of sense, and is retained by memory; and that there is no other way of arriving at the knowledge of music;" and though, he wrote, "others affirm that it is by the study of instruments that we attain this knowledge;" this, he wrote, is talking wildly, "for just as it is not necessary for him who writes an Iambic to attend to the arithmetical proportions of the feet of which it is composed, so it is not necessary for him who writes a Phrygian song to attend to the ratios of the sounds proper thereto."&lt;ref name="hawkins66"/&gt; However, this should not be construed as meaning that he postulated a simplistic system of harmony resembling that of modern twelve tone theory, and especially not an equally tempered system. As he urges us to consider, "(a)fter all, with which of the people who argue about the shades of the genera should one agree? Not everyone looks to the same division when tuning the chromatic or the enharmonic, so why should the note a ditone from mesé be called lichanos rather than a small amount higher?"{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=163}}

It is sometimes claimed that the nature of Aristoxenus' scales and genera deviated sharply from his predecessors. That Aristoxenus used a model for creating scales based upon the notion of a topos, or range of pitch location,{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=140}} is fact, however there is no reason to believe that he alone set this precedent, as he himself does not make this claim. Indeed, the idea of unfixed pitch locations that cover certain ranges, the limits of which may be defined by fixed points, is a notion that was popular until the modern fixation upon fixed pitch systems, as is indicated by baroque theoretical systems of pitch and intonation.  Another way of stating this, however perhaps less accurate, is that instead of using discrete ratios to place intervals, he used continuously variable quantities.

The postulation that this resulted in the structuring of his tetrachords and the resulting scales having 'other' qualities of consonance&lt;ref&gt;John Chalmers, (1993) ''Divisions of the Tetrachord'', Chapter 3, pp. 17–22. Frog Peak Music. {{ISBN|0-945996-04-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is one that can only be accounted for by the recourse to often repeated inconsistencies amongst his interpreters and modern confirmation bias in favour of simplified twelve tone theories. Aristoxenus himself held that "(...) two things must not be overlooked: first, that many people have mistakenly supposed us to be saying that a tone can be divided into three equal parts in a melody. They made this mistake because they did not realise that it is one thing to employ the third part of a tone, and another to divide a tone into three parts and sing all three. Secondly we accept that from a purely abstract point of view there is no least interval."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=160}}

In book three Aristoxenus goes on to describe twenty eight laws of melodic succession, which are of great interest to those concerned with classical Greek melodic structure.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=170-183}}

==On rhythmics and metrics==
Part of the second book of a work on rhythmics and metrics, ''Elementa rhythmica'', is preserved in medieval manuscript tradition.

Aristoxenus was also the author of a work ''On the Primary Duration'' (''chronos'').

A five-column fragment of a treatise on meter ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 9|P. Oxy. 9]]/[http://163.1.169.40/cgi-bin/library?e=q-000-00---0POxy--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4------0-1l--1-en-50---20-about-2687--00031-001-0-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=POxy&amp;cl=search&amp;d=HASH0145fcb68270ba24d867ccd9 2687]) was published in [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell|Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Surridge Hunt|Hunt]]'s ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'', vol. 1 (1898) and is probably by Aristoxenus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1790">In the [[philosophy of mind]], the '''Brainstorm machine''' is a [[thought experiment]] described by [[Daniel Dennett]], to show that it is not possible to intersubjectively compare any two individuals' personal experiences, or [[qualia]], even with perfect technology. It is based on a device described in the film ''[[Brainstorm (1983 film)|Brainstorm]]'', in which the visual experience of one individual is fed into the brain of another. According to Dennett in ''Quining Qualia'':

{{"
|text=Suppose [that] there were some neuroscientific apparatus that fits on your head and feeds your visual experience into my brain. With eyes closed I accurately report everything you are looking at, except that I marvel at how the sky is yellow, the grass red, and so forth. Would this not confirm, empirically, that our qualia were different? But suppose the technician then pulls the plug on the connecting cable, inverts it 180 degrees and reinserts it in the socket. Now I report the sky is blue, the grass green, and so forth. Which is the "right" orientation of the plug? Designing and building such a device would require that its "fidelity" be tuned or calibrated by the normalization of the two subjects' reports--so we would be right back at our evidential starting point. The moral of this [[intuition pump]] is that no intersubjective comparison of qualia is possible, even with perfect technology.

[[Prayer]] is an important activity in [[Christianity]], and there are several different forms of ''Christian prayer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prayer: A History|author= Philip Zaleski, Carol Zaleski|year= 2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books|isbn=0-618-15288-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Christian prayers'' are diverse: they can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The most common prayer among Christians is the "[[Lord's Prayer]]", which according to the [[gospel]] accounts (e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#6:9|Matthew 6:9-13]]) is how [[Jesus]] taught his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 &gt;{{cite book|title=Examining Religions: Christianity Foundation Edition |first=Anne |last=Geldart |year=1999 |isbn=0-435-30324-4 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Lord's Prayer" is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 /&gt;

A broad, three stage characterization of prayer begins with vocal prayer, then moves on to a more structured form in terms of [[Christian meditation|meditation]], then reaches the multiple layers of [[Christian contemplation|contemplation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Simple Ways to Pray |first=Emilie |last=Griffin |year=2005 |isbn=0-7425-5084-2 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Christian tradition comprises three major expressions of the life of prayer: vocal prayer, meditation, and contemplative prayer. They have in common the recollection of the heart" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P9N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2721).]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[intercession]].

There are two basic settings for Christian prayer: corporate (or public)  and private.  Corporate prayer includes prayer shared within the worship setting or other public places.  These prayers can be formal written prayers or informal extemporaneous prayers. Private prayer occurs with the individual praying either silently or aloud within a private setting. 
Prayer exists within multiple different worship contexts and may be structured differently. These types of contexts may include:

'''Liturgical:'''
Often seen within the Catholic Church. This is a very orthodox service, according to Catholics. Within a Catholic Mass, which is an example of a liturgical form of worship, there are bible readings and a sermon is read.

Often seen within the Holy Orthodox Church. The Holy Bible is read and a sermon is read.

'''Non- Liturgical:'''
Often seen within Evangelical church, this prayer is often not scripted and would be more informal in structure. Most of these prayers would be extemporaneous.

'''Charismatic:'''
Often seen within gospel churches. It is the main form of worship in Pentecostal churches. It usually includes song and dance, and may include other artistic expressions. There may be no apparent structure, but the worshippers will be "led by the [[Holy Spirit]]".

== Background ==
{{further|Prayer in the New Testament}}
[[File:Dürer, Albrecht - Hand Study with Bible - 1506.jpg|thumb|130 px|Hands on the Bible, [[Albrecht Dürer]], 16th century.]]
Prayer in the [[New Testament]] is presented as a positive command ({{bibleverse||Colossians|4:2|KJV}}; {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:17|KJV}}). The people of God are challenged to include prayer in their everyday life, even in the busy struggles of marriage ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:5|KJV}}) as it is thought to bring the faithful closer to God.

Throughout the New Testament, prayer is shown to be God's appointed method by which the faithful obtain what he has to bestow ({{bibleverse||Matthew|7:7-11|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:24-29|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|11:13|KJV}}).

Prayer, according to the Book of Acts, can be seen at the first moments of the church ({{bibleverse||Acts|3:1|KJV}}). The [[apostles]] regarded prayer as an essential part of their lives ({{bibleverse||Acts|6:4|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Romans|1:9|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Colossians|1:9|KJV}}). As such, the apostles frequently incorporated verses from [[Psalms]] into their writings. {{bibleverse||Romans|3:10-18|KJV}} for example is borrowed from {{bibleverse||Psalm|14:1-3|KJV}} and other psalms.

Thus, due to this emphasis on prayer in the [[early church]]. lengthy passages of the New Testament are prayers or [[canticle]]s (see also the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]]), such as the Prayer for forgiveness ({{bibleverse||Mark|11:25-26|KJV}}), the [[Lord's Prayer]], the [[Magnificat]] ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:46-55|KJV}}), the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] ({{bibleverse||Luke|1:68-79|KJV}}), Jesus' prayer to the one true God ({{bibleverse||John|17|KJV}}), exclamations such as, "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:3-14|KJV}}), the Believers' Prayer ({{bibleverse||Acts|4:23-31|KJV}}), "may this cup be taken from me" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:36-44|KJV}}), "Pray that you will not fall into temptation" ({{bibleverse||Luke|22:39-46|KJV}}), [[Saint Stephen]]'s Prayer ({{bibleverse||Acts|7:59-60|KJV}}), [[Simon Magus]]' Prayer ({{bibleverse||Acts|8:24|KJV}}), "pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men" ({{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|3:1-2|KJV}}), and [[Maranatha]] ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|16:22|KJV}}).

=== Liturgical prayers ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
Elements of the oldest Christian prayers may be found in [[liturgy|liturgies]]  such as the Roman Catholic [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]], the Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]], the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]], and the [[Lutheran Book of Worship]].

====Seasonal prayers====
Many denominations that adhere to a liturgical tradition use specific prayers geared to the season of the [[Liturgical Year]], such as  [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], [[Lent]] and [[Easter]].  Some of these prayers are found in the [[Roman Breviary]], the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], the Orthodox [[Book of Needs]] and the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]].

===Prayer to saints===
{{main|Communion of saints|Intercession of saints}}
The ancient church, in both [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Western Christianity]], developed a tradition of asking for the [[intercession of saints|intercession of (deceased) saints]], and this remains the practice of most [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and some [[Anglican]] churches.  Churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] however rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Ferguson, S. B. |author2=Packer, J. |year=1988 |title =Saints |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Theology|publisher= Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Gray, ''The Protestant Reformation'', (Sussex Academic Press, 2003), page 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation and contemplative prayer===
{{Main|Christian meditation|Christian contemplation}}
{{see also|Aspects of Christian meditation}}
[[File:OCD Zelle.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Discalced Carmelites|Carmelite nun]] meditating on the Bible]]
Christian meditation is a structured attempt to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Meditation for Beginners |first1=Thomas |last1=Zanzig |first2=Marilyn |last2=Kielbasa |year=2000 |isbn=0-88489-361-8 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word [[meditation]] comes from the Latin word ''meditārī'', which has a range of meanings including to reflect on, to study and to practice. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (such as a bible passage) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to Christian spirituality |first=F. |last=Antonisamy |year=2000 |isbn=81-7109-429-5 |pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion.&lt;ref name="Christian Meditation' pages 12-13"&gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity, Volume 3 page 488"&gt;{{cite book |title= The encyclopedia of Christianity |volume= Volume 3 |first1=Erwin |last1= Fahlbusch |first2= Geoffrey William |last2=Bromiley |year=2003 |isbn=90-04-12654-6 |page= 488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times there may be no clear-cut boundary between Christian meditation and Christian contemplation, and they overlap. Meditation serves as a foundation on which the contemplative life stands, the practice by which someone begins the state of contemplation.&lt;ref name=Matta56&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FqbA6aguSR0C&amp;pg=PA56 |first=Mattá |last= al-Miskīn, |title= Orthodox Prayer Life: The Interior Way |publisher= St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-88141-250-3 |page= 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemplative prayer, this activity is curtailed, so that [[contemplation]] has been described as "a gaze of faith", "a silent love".&lt;ref&gt;"Contemplative prayer is the simple expression of the mystery of prayer. It is a gaze of faith fixed on Jesus, an attentiveness to the Word of God, a silent love. It achieves real union with the prayer of Christ to the extent that it makes us share in his mystery" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P9N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2724).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation and contemplation are components of the [[Rosary]], encouraged by the Magisterium.&lt;ref&gt;https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercessory prayer===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
This kind of prayer involves the believer taking the role of an intercessor, praying on behalf of another individual, group or community, or even a nation.

===Ejaculatory prayer===
{{Further|Ejaculatory prayer}}
Ejaculatory prayer is the use of very brief exclamations. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] remarked that the Egyptian Christians who withdrew to a solitary life "are said to say frequent prayers, but very brief ones that are tossed off as in a rush, so that a vigilant and keen intention, which is very necessary for one who prays, may not fade away and grow dull over longer periods".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5nPYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=augustine+short+prayers+egypt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigwpWN7fHeAhXC66QKHVbLC-IQ6AEIQzAF#v=snippet&amp;q=%22short%20prayers%22&amp;f=false Augustine, Letter 130, To Proba, paragraph 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of such prayers are given in the old ''[[Raccolta]]'' under the numbers 19, 20, 38, 57, 59, 63, 77, 82, 83, 133, 154, 166, 181.&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.liturgialatina.org/raccolta/index.htm The Raccolta: Index of prayers and pious works contained in this collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also known as aspirations, invocations or exclamations and include the [[Jesus Prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://catholicexchange.com/deepen-prayer-life-exclamations Stephen Beale, "Deepen Your Prayer Life Through Exclamations"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johnson's Dictionary]] defined "ejaculation" as "a short prayer darted out occasionally, without solemn retirement".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''A Dictionary of the English Language'', vol. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Such pious ejaculations are part also of the [[liturgy]] of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O_8TAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=%22pious+ejaculation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbyfDv-fHeAhXOsqQKHY6fCUU4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pious%20ejaculation%22&amp;f=false Matthew Hole, ''Practical discourses on the liturgy of the Church of England'' (London. William Pickering. 1837), p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Listening prayer===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
Listening prayer is a type of [[Christian]]  [[prayer]].  As compared with the traditional Christian prayer, the listening prayer method demands "hearing and discerning God's voice through prayer and scripture; then obeying the Lord's direction in personal ministry."{{Cite quote|date=October 2016}}

Traditional Christian prayer requested people to thank  God, as well as tell God their own request.  When their prayers seemed unanswered, some would feel that God did not hear them or did not respond to them.  Listening prayer asks: "Was it that God did not respond to you, or was it that you did not hear from God"?  Listening prayer requires those praying to calm their minds down and read the Scripture.  During the reading, some sentences may pop into mind, as if in answer to their prayers but listening prayers are also of two types one is normally listening to church father and second is prayer with music nowadays prayer with music is considered as payer music or prayer song.

==Prayer books and tools==
Prayer books as well as tools such as prayer beads such as [[Chaplet (prayer)|chaplet]]s are used by Christians. Images and icons are also associated with prayers in some Christian denominations.

There is no one prayerbook containing a set liturgy used by all Christians; however many Christian denominations have their own local prayerbooks, for example:

*[[Book of Common Prayer]] ''(the traditional [[Anglican]] prayer book, still in use or modified by the constituent churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], and one of the most influential prayerbooks in the [[English language]])''
*[[Agenda (book for divine service)|Agenda]], name for book for [[Liturgy|liturgies]], especially in [[Lutheran Church]].
*The Roman [[Breviary]] ''(Traditional [[Roman Catholic]] Monastic Hours)''
*[[The Book of Psalms]]
* [[The Raccolta]] book of indulgenced prayers for Catholics

'''Conceptual art''', sometimes simply called '''conceptualism''', is [[art]] in which the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called [[Installation art|installations]], may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302213039/http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|title=Wall Drawing 811 – Sol LeWitt|archivedate=2 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was fundamental to American artist [[Sol LeWitt]]'s definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

{{quotation|In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sol LeWitt]] "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art", ''Artforum'', June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Godfrey, author of ''Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)'' (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas) |author=Godrey, Tony |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-7148-3388-0 |publisher=London: Phaidon Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that [[Joseph Kosuth]] elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, ''Art after Philosophy'' (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the american editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969). Reprinted in Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and Movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Language, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]: Introduction (1969). Reprinted in Osborne (2002) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden: "Notes On Analysis" (1970). Reprinted in Osborne (2003), p. 237. E.g. "The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "conceptual art" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm ''Turner prize history: Conceptual art'' Tate gallery] tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that one of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".

==History==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art &amp; Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]
The French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym "R.Mutt", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).&lt;ref&gt;
Tony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28
&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future "conceptualists" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: "All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually".

In 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthapériste'' (or "infinite-aesthetics"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1961 the term "concept art", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this "dematerialization" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,&lt;ref&gt;
Lucy Lippard &amp; John Chandler, "The Dematerialization of Art", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218
&lt;/ref&gt;
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Conceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the "art" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's "written instructions" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |author= |date=March 1 – June 1, 2008 |work= |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art &amp; Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, "The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"&gt;Rorimer, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] "reinforced and legitimized" the direction the conceptual artists took.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2002), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who "powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories." Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, "The Construction of Change" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).

==Conceptual art and artistic skill==
[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art &amp; Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important difference between conceptual art and more "traditional" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramović]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Contemporary influence==
The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled "second- or third-generation" conceptualists, or "[[post-conceptual]]" artists.

Many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Art – The Art Story|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website=theartstory.org|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1917 : ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], described in an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' as the invention of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |title=The loo that shook the world: Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabi |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/the-loo-that-shook-the-world-duchamp-man-ray-picabi-784384.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (''Extra'') |date=2008-02-20 |pages=2–5 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1953 : [[Robert Rauschenberg]] creates ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]'', a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning]] which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist's work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only "art" because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series ''pièces de complices'', combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Demelas: Des mythes et des réalitées de l'avant-garde française. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1956 : [[Isidore Isou]] introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
* 1957: [[Yves Klein]], ''Aerostatic Sculpture (Paris)''. This was composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from [[Galerie Iris Clert]] to promote his ''Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch'' exhibition. Klein also exhibited 'One Minute Fire Painting' which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set. For his next major exhibition, ''The Void'' in 1958, Klein declared that his paintings were now invisible and to prove it he exhibited an empty room.
* 1958: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Das Theater ist auf der Straße''/''The theater is on the street''. The first [[Happening]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-morsbroich.de/index.php?id=vorschau&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_mbausstellungen_pi1%5Bexhibition%5D=40&amp;ftu=17c0865f7589ebcedf2cba1501860715|title=Vorschau – Museum Morsbroich|author=ChewingTheSun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1960: [[Yves Klein]]'s action called ''A Leap Into The Void'', in which he attempts to fly by leaping out of a window. He stated: "The painter has only to create one masterpiece, himself, constantly."
* 1960: The artist Stanley Brouwn declares that all the shoe shops in Amsterdam constitute an exhibition of his work.
* 1961: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Cityrama'', in Cologne was the first Happening in Germany.
* 1961: [[Robert Rauschenberg]] sent a telegram to the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] which said: 'This is a portrait of [[Iris Clert]] if I say so.' as his contribution to an exhibition of portraits.
* 1961: [[Piero Manzoni]] exhibited ''[[Artist's Shit]]'', tins purportedly containing his own [[feces]] (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as ''[[Corpo d'aria|Bodies of Air]]'', and signed people's bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Primo Levi]] are amongst the designated 'artworks'.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as [[Billy Apple]], erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.&lt;ref name="Byrt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' work. This consists of a barricade of oil barrels in a narrow Paris street which caused a large traffic jam. The artwork was not the barricade itself but the resulting traffic jam.
* 1962: [[Yves Klein]] presents ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle|Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity]]'' in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own 'pictorial sensitivity' (whatever that was, he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein's sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: [[Piero Manzoni]] created ''The Base of the World'', thereby exhibiting the entire planet as his artwork.
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1963: [[George Brecht]]'s collection of Event-Scores, ''[[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]]'', is published as the first ''Fluxkit'' by [[George Maciunas]]. 
* 1963: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.
* 1963: [[Henry Flynt]]s article ''Concept Art'' is published in ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''; a collection of artworks and concepts by artists and musicians that was published by [[Jackson Mac Low]] and [[La Monte Young]] (ed.). ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's "concept art" devolved from his idea of "cognitive nihilism" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.
* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: [[Art &amp; Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''Mirror Piece''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art &amp; Language – Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.
* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.
* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word "chair". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art &amp; Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966–67|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: [[N.E. Thing Co.]] Ltd. (Iain and Ingrid Baxter of Vancouver) exhibited ''Bagged Place'' the contents of a four-room apartment wrapped in plastic bags. The same year they registered as a corporation and subsequently organized their practice along corporate models, one of the first international examples of the "aesthetic of administration".
* 1967: [[Mel Ramsden]] first ''100% Abstract Paintings''. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitute the substance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-art-language-uncompleted/1/exhibitions/expo|title=ART &amp; LANGUAGE UNCOMPLETED|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: [[Sol LeWitt]]'s ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' were published by the American art journal ''[[Artforum]]''. The ''Paragraphs'' mark the progression from Minimal to Conceptual Art.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, [[Terry Atkinson]], [[David Bainbridge]] and [[Harold Hurrell]] found [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml|title=BBC – Coventry and Warwickshire Culture – Art and Language|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1968: [[Lawrence Weiner]] relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his "Declaration of Intent", one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt's "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice reads: "1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership."
* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.
* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.&lt;ref name="Byrt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.
* 1969: The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art &amp; Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the american editor.
* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.
* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]´s article "Art after Philosophy" in three parts (October–December). It became the most discussed article on "Conceptual Art".
* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like "Camptown Races" and "Some Enchanted Evening".
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.
* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted "an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.
* 1972: [[Art &amp; Language|The Art &amp; Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art &amp; Language]] and text-works from [[Art &amp; Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. 
* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.
* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.
* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.
* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.
* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.
* 1975–76: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art &amp; Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.
* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art &amp; Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art &amp; Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.
* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters. Despite its size, therefore, this work exists mostly in the viewer's mind.
* 1977: [[John Fekner]] creates hundreds of environmental and conceptual outdoor works consisting of stenciled words, symbols, dates and icons spray painted in New York, Sweden, Canada, England and Germany.
* 1986: [[Art &amp; Language]] are nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].

* 1990: [[Ashley Bickerton]] and [[Ronald Jones (Interdisciplinarian)|Ronald Jones]] included in "Mind Over Matter: Concept and Object" exhibition of ”third generation Conceptual artists” at the Whitney Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA113CF93AA25753C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Brenson | title=Review/Art; In the Arena of the Mind, at the Whitney | date=19 October 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1993: [[Matthieu Laurette]] established his artistic birth certificate by taking part in a French TV game called ''Tournez manège'' (The Dating Game) where the female presenter asked him who he was, to which he replied: 'A multimedia artist'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their home, turning his staging of the artist into a performed reality.
* 1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using models to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

'''Constance Vella''' (1687–1759) was a major Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in physics, logic, cosmology, and metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Vella’s speciality is that, despite being a Scholastic, he was not an Aristotelic-Thomist one (as most of the well-known mediaeval philosophers are), but rather an Aristotelic-Scotist philosopher, that is more in the line of [[John Duns Scotus]].

==Life==
Vella was born at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], and joined the [[Franciscan Order]], probably as a teenager. He was one of the best professors of philosophy whom the Franciscan ever had at their College of Philosophy and Literature at [[Rabat, Malta]]. He lectured there between 1712 and 1715. Amongst his most talented students there was [[John Constance Parnis]]. In fact, Vella was a kind of master with a school of disciples who not only followed his intellectual endeavours but also continued to teach his doctrines after his death. Vella even lectured successfully in [[Sicily]], where he was also renowned as an endowed preacher.

In 1729, Vella was chosen as Provincial Minister of the Franciscan Province of [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]]. In Malta, he was also signed up as Sinodal Examiner, and worked under bishops Paul Alpheran de Bussan, and Bartolomeo Rull. In 1744, the former bishop further appointed Vella as Co-Visitor for the diocese of [[Malta]]. He was held in very high esteem both as an administrator as well as a philosopher. He died on November 1, 1759.

==Extant work==
Vella’s most representative work in philosophy is a three-volume ''opus'' called '''''Scoticæ Philosophiæ''''' (''Scotist Philosophy''), composed between 1712 and 1715.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 160f.&lt;/ref&gt; Two identical copies of the manuscript exist, which for such a mediaeval document is a unique rather than a rare occurrence. One copy is held at the archives of the [[Franciscan]] friars in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], and the other at the archives of the Archbishop’s Seminary at [[Rabat, Malta]] (here marked as MS. 19). Together the three volumes have a staggering 1,926 back to back folios. 

Volume I, containing 580 back to back folios, has just one ''Tractatus'' (or studies), entitled ''De Logica'' (''On Logic''), which is of course about Aristotelian logic. Volume II, made up of 615 back to back folios, includes two ''Tractatus'' (or studies), one, ''In Octo Aristotelis Libros De Physico Auditu'' (''On the Eight Books of Aristotle on Physics''), and the other, ''De Cælo et Mundo'' (''On the Heavens and the Earth''). The former deals with [[Aristotle]]’s physics, of course, and the latter with Aristotelian cosmology. Volume III comprises 731 back to back folios. It contains five ''Tractatus'' (or studies), which are the following: ''De Generatione et Corrupione'' (''On Coming-To-Be and Passing Away''), ''De Meteoris'' (''On Meteors''), ''De Anima'' (''On the Soul''), ''Compendiaria Notitia eorum quæ Mirabilem Humani Corporis Structuram Componunt'' (''A Compendium of Information concerning Parts which Form the Marvellous Structure of the Human Body''), and ''Tractatus in XII Aristotelis Stagirite Libros Metaphysicorum'' (''Study on the 12th Book of Aristotle the Stagirite’s ‘Metaphysics’'').

Other extant works of Vella are of a theological nature. They include ''Tractatus in Tertium Librum Sententiarum'' (''A Study on the Third Book of [[Peter Lombard]]’s ‘Sentences’''; 1715), ''Selva Morale'' (''An Assorted Study of Morals''; undated), and ''Selva Santorale'' (''An Assorted Study of Liturgical Rites''; undated).

===Appreciation===
All of Vella’s works contain a lattice of subtle philosophical arguments which make them masterworks of a first class philosopher. He spares no effort to be consistent, thorough, perfectly clear, and illuminating.

Apart from the ''Compendium'', all the other works of Vella are basically commentaries on the respective works of [[Aristotle]] from the point of view of a Scotist Scholastic. Throughout he makes his position clear while demonstrating his disagreement with the prevailing Thomist interpretation.

In terms of novelty and originality, on the other hand, the ''Compendium'' is the most interesting. As its title suggests, Vella deals with the physical constitution of the human body. He takes each physical organ on its own, explains their nature and function, and examines their relationship to other organs and to the body as a whole. He particularly demonstrates an acute appreciation of things physical in general, and also of their organisational structure.

Unfortunately, Vella is not very known amongst philosophy academics and intellectuals. Like almost all the other mediaeval Maltese philosophers, his philosophy is still wholly inaccessible. The reason being that his works have never been transliterated from their original manuscript form, and neither have they been translated, in whole or in part, into any modern language. Thus, as yet they remain unread and unstudied by contemporary scholars. 

This is indeed a great pity. For Vella surely merits attentive study and much larger appreciation, not only in a historical sort of way, but academically and philosophically. Together with [[John Matthew Rispoli]], he might well be a long neglected gem of fascinating intellectual stimulation.

'''Constantin Brunner''' (1862–1937) was the [[pen-name]] of the [[Germany|German]] [[Jew]]ish philosopher '''Arjeh Yehuda Wertheimer''' (called Leo). He was born in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (near [[Hamburg]]) on 27 August 1862. He came from a prominent Jewish family that had lived in the vicinity of Hamburg for generations; his grandfather, [[Akiba Israel Wertheimer|Akiba Wertheimer]], was chief [[Rabbi]] of Altona and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Brunner studied philosophy under a number of prominent scholars, but never completed his doctorate. He established himself as a literary critic, and enjoyed a wide celebrity. In the 1890s, he withdrew from public life to devote himself to writing.  He lived in Germany until 1933, when, with the rise to power of the [[Nazi party]], he moved to [[The Hague]], where he died on 27 August 1937.

==Doctrine==

Central to Brunner’s theory is the characterization of three different modes of mental activity:

&lt;div style="float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; text-align:center;"&gt;[[File:Brunner Doctrine schema.jpg|Schema of Brunner's doctrine]]&lt;/div&gt;

# '''Practical reason''', which every human possesses, and which serves one’s normal needs
# '''Spiritual/intellectual (''geistig'') thought''', which rises above the relative truth residing in experience and in science, and strives toward a perception of the one eternal and absolute essence.
# '''"Superstition"'''—pseudo-contemplation, which is the mode of contemplation of most ordinary men. Unfounded belief is a distortion of the spiritual faculty. While practical reason recognizes that the "relative" is only "relative," superstition elevates what is relative to the status of the absolute.

Each of the three modes of thought consists of three specificates. In the practical understanding, the specificates are feeling, knowing and willing. In spiritual life, these  are modified to become, respectively, art, philosophy and mysticism (love). Superstition distorts the specificates of spiritual life, transforming them into religion, metaphysics and moralism.

Brunner's intention is to contrast popular thought with spiritual/intellectual thought. His work ''Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volke''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Brunner, Constantin|year=1908|title=Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volke|language=German|location=Berlin|publisher=Karl Schnabel Verlag|oclc=769898291|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/38926502.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a survey of the whole of human intellectual history seen from the point of view of this doctrine.

Brunner's ultimate objective was to prepare the way for the establishment of a community centered on the life of the mind, which would in turn open the way to the expansion of democracy.

==Brunner and Judaism==

The opposition between the spiritual and the religious is a major theme in Brunner's work. He contends that [[Judaism]] is essentially anti-religious, stating in ''Our Christ'' that "Judaism as a spiritual doctrine is the opposite of religion and a protest against it", and culminates his argument with his own translation of the [[Shema Yisrael|Shema]]: "Hear O Israel, Being is our god, Being is one". He juxtaposes priestly/pharisaic/rabbinic to prophetic Judaism, stating that the latter represents the true mystical essence in opposition to the former which distorts that essence.

==Brunner and Christianity==

For Brunner, [[Jesus]] was both a [[mysticism|mystic]] and a [[genius]], whereas Christian religion is largely a distortion of his thought. {{Why?|date=May 2011}}

==Brunner and Israel==

Throughout his life, Brunner was [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]]. However, there is evidence that, toward the end of his life in light of events in Europe, he was reconsidering his opposition to the founding of the state of Israel (see ''Assimilation und Nationalismus: ein Briefwechsel mit Constantin Brunner'' / Willy Aron).

==Brunner and the history of philosophy==

According to Brunner, the authentic philosophy presented by [[Spinoza]] has its antithesis in [[scholasticism]] which reaches its highest expression in [[Immanuel Kant]]. Thus Spinoza and Kant represent opposite poles in the dialectical idealism by which Brunner organizes the whole of intellectual history.

==Brunner and science==

Brunner maintains that the foundation of all science is the doctrine of universal all-motion{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}. His elaboration of this doctrine has had a decisive effect on a number of medical practitioners{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and researchers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Brunner and evolution==

Brunner's position is that the fixity of the genus is a scientific principle that needs to be preserved if meaningful work is to be undertaken with biological systems. He argued that because the theory of evolution undermined the notion of genus, it would be detrimental to practical scientific endeavor.

==Influence and relevance==

In ''Confessions of a European Intellectual'', [[Franz Schoenberner]] describes Brunner as "one of the more important figures" in Europe.  Brunner corresponded with [[Walther Rathenau]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]]. [[Albert Einstein]] read Brunner but, while appreciating his critical insight and sharing his devotion to [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], rejected his philosophy, particularly where it stood opposed to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Einstein]] to W. Aron, 14 January 1943. Einstein Archive, reel 33-296 Einstein-Aron correspondence, Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew University, Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunner attracted a large and devoted following among the Jewish youth in Czernowitz. The best known of his disciples in this group is the poet, [[Rose Ausländer]].

With the Second World War, Brunner's books were burned and his devotees scattered. His German disciple Magdalena Kasch managed to save the bulk of Brunner's writing from destruction by the Nazis. In 1948, she, with the help of some of Brunner's other surviving friends, founded the "Internationaal Constantin Brunner Institut" (ICBI) in the Hague.  However, there has been no major revival of interest in his work, despite the efforts of such luminaries as [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[André Breton]].

==Brunner in English==

Brunner's works available in English include

*''Science, Spirit, Superstition'', which is a compilation of material from his other books. There are extracts from many of Brunner's works, including large sections from ''Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volk'', covering the doctrine and history of science. There are also important sections from ''Materialismus und Idealismus'', a dialogue presentation of Brunner's understanding of philosophy and its history. It includes his writing on a variety of subjects.
*''Our Christ''. A translation, with an introduction and editorial notes.
*''The Tyranny of Hate: The Roots of Antisemitism'', an abridgement of one of Brunner's works on antisemitism.

There is relatively abundant secondary literature available in English, notably ''To live is to think : the thought of twentieth-century German philosopher Constantin Brunner'' by Hans Goetz (1995).

==Brunner in French==

Several works by Brunner are available in French. ''L'amour'' is the first part of Brunner's work on sexual relationships. ''Spinoza contre Kant'' contains Brunner's sketch of the history of modern philosophy. ''Le malheur de notre peuple allemand et nos « Völkisch »'' (orig. 1924) warns against the dangers of Nazism. The Sorbonne has an archive of several French translations of Brunner's work by Henri Lurié. There is abundant secondary material in French as well, notably a recent work by Martin Rodan entitled ''Notre culture européenne, cette inconnue'' (Peter Lang, 2009).

'''Critical rationalism''' is an [[epistemological]] [[philosophy]] advanced by [[Karl Popper]].  Popper wrote about critical rationalism in his works: ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery |origyear=1959 |edition=2nd English |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge Classics |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-27844-9 |oclc=59377149}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K.,

==Criticism, not support==
Critical rationalists hold that scientific [[theories]] and any other claims to [[knowledge]] can and should be rationally criticized, and (if they have [[empirical]] content) can and should be subjected to tests which may falsify them. Thus claims to knowledge may be contrastingly and normatively evaluated. They are either falsifiable and thus empirical (in a very broad sense), or not falsifiable and thus non-empirical. Those claims to knowledge that are potentially falsifiable can then be admitted to the body of empirical science, and then further differentiated according to whether they are retained or are later actually falsified. If retained, further differentiation may be made on the basis of how much subjection to criticism they have received, how severe such criticism has been, and how probable the theory is, with the least&lt;ref name=lscd43&gt;{{Cite book|last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |title=[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]] |origyear=1959 |edition=2nd English |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge Classics |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-27844-9 |oclc=59377149}}, section 43, especially footnote *1 and *2&lt;/ref&gt; probable theory that still withstands attempts to falsify it being the one to be preferred. That it is the ''least''&lt;ref name=lscd43/&gt; probable theory that is to be preferred is one of the contrasting differences between critical rationalism and classical views on science, such as positivism, who hold that one should instead accept the ''most'' probable theory. (The least probable theory is the one with the highest information content and most open to future falsification.)
Critical Rationalism as a discourse positioned itself against what its proponents took to be epistemologically [[relativist]] philosophies, particularly [[post-modernist]] or [[sociological]] approaches to knowledge. Critical rationalism has it that knowledge is objective (in the sense of being embodied in various substrates and in the sense of not being reducible to what humans individually "''know''"), and also that truth is objective (exists independently of social mediation or individual perception, but is "really real").

However, this contrastive, critical approach to objective knowledge is quite different from more traditional views that also hold knowledge to be objective. (These include the [[Rationalism|classical rationalism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the [[verificationism]] of the [[logical positivists]], or approaches to science based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], a supposed form of logical inference which critical rationalists reject, in line with [[David Hume]].) For criticism is all that can be done when attempting to differentiate claims to knowledge, according to the critical rationalist. Reason is the [[wikt:organon|organon]] of criticism, not of support; of tentative refutation, not of proof.

Supposed positive evidence (such as the provision of "good reasons" for a claim, or its having been "corroborated" by making successful predictions) actually does nothing to bolster, support, or prove a claim, belief, or theory.

In this sense, critical rationalism turns the normal understanding of a traditional rationalist, and a realist, on its head. Especially the view that a theory is better if it is less likely to be true is in direct opposition to the traditional positivistic view, which holds that one should seek for theories that have a high probability.&lt;ref name=lscd43/&gt; Popper notes that this "may illustrate Schopenhauer's remark that the solution of a problem often first looks like a paradox and later like a truism". Even a highly unlikely theory that conflicts current observation (and is thus false, like "all swans are white") must be considered to be better than one which fits observations perfectly, but is highly probable (like "all swans have a color"). This insight is the crucial difference between naive falsificationism and critical rationalism. The lower probability theory is favoured by critical rationalism because the higher the informative content of a theory the lower will be its probability, for the more information a statement contains, the greater will be the number of ways in which it may turn out to be false. The rationale behind this is simply to make it as easy as possible to find out whether the theory is false so that it can be replaced by one that is closer to the truth. It is not meant as a concession to justificatory epistemology, like assuming a theory to be "justifiable" by asserting that it is highly unlikely and yet fits observation.

Critical rationalism rejects the classical position that knowledge is [[justified true belief]]; it instead holds the exact opposite:{{CN|date=November 2018}} That, in general, knowledge is unjustified untrue unbelief. It is unjustified because of the non-existence of good reasons. It is untrue, because it usually contains errors that sometimes remain unnoticed for hundreds of years. And it is not belief either, because scientific knowledge, or the knowledge needed to build a plane, is contained in no single person's mind. It is only available as the content of books.

==Non-justificationism==
{{also|Theory of justification#Criticisms}}
[[William Warren Bartley]] compared critical rationalism to the very general philosophical approach to knowledge which he called '''justificationism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, the view that scientific theories can be justified. Most justificationists do not know that they are justificationists. Justificationism is what Popper called a "subjectivist" view of truth, in which the question of whether some statement is true, is confused with the question of whether it can be justified (established, proven, verified, warranted, made well-founded, made reliable, grounded, supported, legitimated, based on evidence) in some way.

According to Bartley, some justificationists are positive about this mistake. They are naïve rationalists, and thinking that their knowledge can indeed be founded, in principle, it may be deemed certain to some degree, and rational.

Other justificationists are negative about these mistakes. They are epistemological relativists, and think (rightly, according to the critical rationalist) that you cannot ''find'' knowledge, that there is no source of epistemological absolutism. But they conclude (wrongly, according to the critical rationalist) that there is therefore no rationality, and no objective distinction to be made between the true and the false.

By dissolving justificationism itself, the critical rationalist (a proponent of '''non-justificationism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IEP |url-id=cr-ratio |title=Karl Popper and Critical Rationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; regards knowledge and rationality, reason and science, as neither foundational nor infallible, but nevertheless does not think we must therefore all be relativists. Knowledge and truth still exist, just not in the way we thought.

==The pitfalls of justificationism and positivism==
[[File:Black Swans.jpg|thumb|300px|Are all swans white? The classical view of the philosophy of science is that it is the goal of science to “prove” such [[hypotheses]] or [[inductive reasoning|induce]] them from observational data. This seems hardly possible, since it would require us to infer a general rule from a number of individual cases, which is logically inadmissible. However, if we find one single black swan, logic allows us to conclude that the statement that all swans are white is false. Falsificationism thus strives for questioning, for falsification, of hypotheses instead of proving them.]]

The rejection of "positivist" approaches to knowledge occurs due to various pitfalls that positivism falls into.

1. The naïve [[empiricism]] of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] was shown to be illogical by Hume. A thousand observations of some event A coinciding with some event B does not allow one to logically infer that all A events coincide with B events. According to the critical rationalist, if there is a sense in which humans accrue knowledge positively by experience, it is only by pivoting observations off existing conjectural theories pertinent to the observations, or off underlying cognitive schemas which unconsciously handle perceptions and use them to generate new theories. But these new theories advanced in response to perceived particulars are not ''logically'' "induced" from them. These new theories may be wrong. The myth that we ''induce'' theories from particulars is persistent because ''when'' we do this we are often successful, but this is due to the advanced state of our evolved tendencies. If we were really "inducting" theories from particulars, it would be inductively logical to claim that the sun sets ''because'' I get up in the morning, or that all buses must have drivers in them (if you've never seen an empty bus).

2. [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] showed in 1983&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 302, April 21, "A Proof of the Impossibility of Inductive Probability"&lt;/ref&gt; that evidence supposed to partly support a hypothesis can, in fact, only be neutral to, or even be counter-supportive of the hypothesis.

3. Related to the point above, [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;In his ''[[Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence]]'', Chapter 3 "A Critique of Good Reasons"&lt;/ref&gt; attacks the use of "good reasons" in general (including evidence supposed to support the excess content of a hypothesis). He argues that good reasons are neither attainable, nor even desirable. Basically, Miller asserts that all arguments purporting to give valid support for a claim are either circular or question-begging. That is, if one provides a valid deductive argument (an inference from premises to a conclusion) for a given claim, then the content of the claim must already be contained within the premises of the argument (if it is not, then the argument is [[ampliative]] and so is invalid). Therefore, the claim is already presupposed by the premises, and is no more "supported" than are the assumptions upon which the claim rests, i.e. begging the question.

{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}

'''Social degeneration''' was a widely influential concept at the interface of the social and biological sciences in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur (1997) ''The Idea of Decline in Western History'' New York, London etc.: The Free Press. In Chapters 2 and 4, Herman provides a detailed description of the cultural context of degeneration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Pick|Pick, Daniel]] (1989) ''Faces of Degeneration: A European Disorder, c.1848 - c.1918'' Cambridge University Press. The definitive account of degeneration theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowbiggin, Ian (1985) Degeneration and hereditarianism in French mental medicine 1840-1890: psychiatric theory as ideological adaptation (in) ''The Anatomy of Madness, Vol. One: People and Ideas'' edited by Bynum William F., Porter, Roy and Shepherd, Michael, London and New York: Tavistock Publications, pp 188-232. Scholarly overview of the psychiatric aspects of degeneration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, Janet (1991) ''"Shattered Nerves": Doctors, Patients and Depression in Victorian England'' New York, Oxford: OUP, see especially Chapter 8, pp 265-292, "Nervous Degeneration".&lt;/ref&gt; Degenerationists feared that civilization might be in decline and that the causes of decline lay in biological change. These ideas derived from pre-scientific concepts of [[heredity]] ("hereditary taint") with [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] emphasis on biological development through purpose and habit. Degeneration concepts were often associated with authoritarian political attitudes, including [[militarism]] and [[racist science]], as well as with fears of national decline. The theory originated in racial concepts of [[ethnicity]], recorded in the writings of such medical scientists as [[Johann Blumenbach]] and [[Robert Knox]]. From the 1850s, it became influential in [[psychiatry]] through the writings of [[Bénédict Morel]], and in  [[criminology]] with [[Cesare Lombroso]].&lt;ref&gt;Horn, David G. (2003) ''The Criminal Body: Lombroso and the Anatomy of Deviance'' London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, in the work of [[Max Nordau]] and others, degeneration became a more general concept in [[social commentary]].

The meaning of ''degeneration'' was poorly defined, but can be described as an organism's change from a more complex to a simpler, less differentiated form, and is associated with 19th century conceptions of [[Devolution (biology)|biological devolution]]. Although rejected by [[Charles Darwin]], the theory's application to the social sciences was supported by some evolutionary biologists, most notably [[Ernst Haeckel]] and [[Ray Lankester]]. As the 19th century wore on, the increasing emphasis on degeneration reflected an anxious [[pessimism]] about the [[wikt:resilient|resilience]] of European civilization and its possible decline and collapse.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==History==

The concept of degeneration arose during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the [[industrial revolution]] - a period of profound [[social change]] and a rapidly shifting sense of [[personal identity]]. Several influences were involved.

The first related to the extreme demographic upheavals, including [[urbanization]], in the early years of the 19th century. The disturbing experience of [[social change]] and urban [[Crowd psychology|crowds]], largely unknown in the agrarian 18th century, was recorded in the journalism of [[William Cobbett]], the novels of [[Charles Dickens]] and in the paintings of [[J M W Turner]]. These changes were also explored by early writers on social psychology, including [[Gustav Le Bon]] and [[Georg Simmel]]. The psychological impact of industrialisation is comprehensively described in [[Humphrey Jennings]]' masterly anthology [[Pandaemonium (history book)|''Pandaemonium 1660 - 1886'']]. Victorian social reformers including [[Edwin Chadwick]], [[Henry Mayhew]] and [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] voiced realistic concerns about the decline of [[public health]] in the urban life of the British working class ([[urban squalor]]), arguing for improved housing and sanitation, access to parks and recreational facilities, an improved diet and a reduction in alcohol intake. These contributions from the public health perspective were discussed by the Scottish physician Sir [[James Cantlie]] in his 1885 lectures ''Degeneration Amongst Londoners''. The novel experience of everyday contact with the urban working classes gave rise to a kind of horrified fascination with their perceived reproductive energies which appeared to threaten [[middle class|middle-class]] culture.

Secondly, the [[proto-evolutionary biologist|proto-evolutionary biology]] and transformatist speculations of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and other natural historians—taken together with the [[Georges Cuvier|Baron von Cuvier]]'s theory of extinctions—played an important part in establishing a sense of the unsettled aspects of the natural world. The [[Polygenism|polygenic]] theories of multiple human origins, supported by [[Robert Knox]] in his book ''The Races of Men'' (1850),&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Robert (1850) ''The Races of Men: A Fragment'' London: Renshaw.&lt;/ref&gt; were firmly rejected by [[Charles Darwin]] who, following [[James Cowles Prichard]],&lt;ref&gt;Prichard, J.C. (1813) ''Researches into the Physical History of Man'' London: John and Arthur Arch. On page 238, Prichard writes: "...the primitive stock of men were probably Negroes, and I know of no argument to be set on the other side."&lt;/ref&gt; generally agreed a single African origin for the entire human species.

Thirdly, the development of world trade and [[colonialism]], the early European experience of [[globalization]], resulted in an awareness of the vulnerabilities of western civilization.

Finally, the growth of historical scholarship in the 18th century, exemplified by [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire]]'' (1776–1789), excited a renewed interest in the narratives of historical decline. This resonated uncomfortably with the difficulties of French political life in the post-revolutionary nineteenth century.
 
Degeneration theory achieved a detailed articulation in [[Bénédict Morel]]'s ''Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species'' (1857), a complicated work of clinical commentary from an asylum in Normandy (Saint Yon in [[Rouen]]) which, in the popular imagination at least, coalesced with de [[Gobineau]]'s ''Essay on The Inequality of the Human Races'' (1855). Morel's concept of ''mental degeneration'' - in which he believed that intoxication and addiction in one generation of a family would lead to hysteria, epilepsy, sexual perversions, insanity, learning disability and sterility in subsequent generations - is an example of Lamarckian biological thinking and Morel's medical discussions are reminiscent of the clinical literature surrounding [[syphilis|syphilitic infection]] (''syphilography''). Morel's psychiatric theories were taken up and advocated by his friend [[Philippe Buchez]], and through his political influence became an  official doctrine in French legal and administrative medicine.

[[Arthur de Gobineau]] came from an impoverished family (with a domineering and adulterous mother) which claimed an aristocratic ancestry; he was a failed author of historical romances and his wife was widely rumored to be a Créole from [[Martinique]]. de Gobineau nevertheless argued that the course of history and civilization was largely determined by ethnic factors, and that [[interracial marriage]] ("[[miscegenation]]") resulted in social chaos. de Gobineau built a successful career in the French diplomatic service, living for extended periods in Iran and Brazil, and spent his later years travelling through Europe, lamenting his mistreatment at the hands of his wife and daughters. He died of a heart attack in 1882 while boarding a train in Turin. His work was well received in German translation—not least by the composer [[Richard Wagner]]—and the leading German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] later wrote extensively on the dangers posed by degeneration to the German people. de Gobineau's writings exerted an enormous influence on the thinkers antecedent to the [[Third Reich]] - although they are curiously free of anti-Semitic prejudice. Quite different historical factors inspired the Italian [[Cesare Lombroso]] in his work on criminal anthropology and the notion of ''atavistic retrogression'', probably shaped by his experiences as a young army doctor in [[Calabria]] during the  ''risorgimento''.

In England, degeneration received a scientific formulation from [[Ray Lankester]] whose detailed discussions of the biology of [[parasitism]] were hugely influential; and the poor physical condition of many recruits for the second [[Boer War|South African war]] (1899-1902) caused alarm in British government circles. The psychiatrist [[Henry Maudsley]] initially argued that degenerate family lines would die out with little social consequence, but later became more pessimistic about the effects of degeneration on the British population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tMTJG0E4PPMC&amp;dq Keeping America Sane: Psychiatry and Eugenics in the United States and Canada, 1880-1940] Pg 81&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[fin-de-siècle]]'' period, [[Max Nordau]] scored an unexpected success with his bestselling ''[[Degeneration (Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892). [[Sigmund Freud]] met Nordau in 1885 while he was studying in Paris and was notably unimpressed by him and hostile to the degeneration concept. Degeneration fell from popular and fashionable favor around the time of the First World War, although some of its preoccupations persisted in the writings of the [[eugenicists]] and [[social Darwinists]]. [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1919) captured something of the degenerationist spirit in the aftermath of the war.

==Selected quotes==
{{quotation|   "The word ''degenerate'', when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins, continual adulterations having gradually affected the quality of that blood....in fact, the man of a decadent time, the ''degenerate man'' properly so-called, is a different being from the racial point of view, from the heroes of the great ages....I think I am right in concluding that the human race in all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood...." [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1855) ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races.''|}} {{quotation| "When under any kind of noxious influence an organism becomes debilitated, its successors will not resemble the healthy, normal type of the species, with capacities for development, but will form a new sub-species, which, like all others, possesses the capacity of transmitting to its offspring, in a continuously increasing degree, its peculiarities, these being morbid deviations from the normal form - gaps in development, malformations and infirmities..."

==Development of the degeneration concept==

The earliest uses of the term ''degeneration'' can be found in the writings of [[Blumenbach]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] at the end of the 18th century, when these early writers on natural history considered scientific approaches to the human species. With the taxonomic mind-set of natural historians, they drew attention to the different ethnic groupings of mankind, and raised general enquiries about their relationships, with the idea that racial groupings could be explained by environmental effects on a common ancestral stock. This pre-Darwinian belief in the heritability of acquired characteristics does not accord with modern genetics. An alternative view of the multiple origins of different racial groups, called "polygenic theories", was also rejected by [[Charles Darwin]], who favored explanations in terms of differential geographic migrations from a single, probably African, population.
    
The theory of degeneration found its first detailed presentation in the writings of [[Bénédict Morel]] (1809–1873), especially in his ''Traité des dégénérescences physiques, intellectuelles et morales de l'espèce humaine'' (''Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species'') (1857). This book was published two years ''before'' Darwin's ''Origin of Species''. Morel was a highly regarded psychiatrist, the very successful superintendent of the Rouen asylum for almost twenty years and a fastidious recorder of the family histories of his variously disabled patients. Through the details of these family histories, Morel discerned an hereditary line of defective parents infected by pollutants and stimulants; a second generation liable to epilepsy, neurasthenia, sexual deviations and hysteria; a third generation prone to insanity; and a final generation doomed to congenital idiocy and sterility. In 1857, Morel proposed a theory of ''hereditary degeneracy'', bringing together environmental and hereditary elements in an uncompromisingly pre-Darwinian mix. Morel's contribution was further developed by [[Valentin Magnan]] (1835–1916), who stressed the role of alcohol—particularly ''[[absinthe]]''—in the generation of psychiatric disorders.

Morel's ideas were greatly extended by the Italian medical scientist [[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835–1909) whose work was defended and translated into English by [[Havelock Ellis]]. In his ''L'uomo delinquente'' (1876), Lombroso outlined a comprehensive natural history of the socially deviant person and detailed the ''stigmata'' of the person who was born to be ''criminally insane''. These included a low, sloping forehead, hard and shifty eyes, large, handle-shaped ears, a flattened or upturned nose, a forward projection of the jaw, irregular teeth, prehensile toes and feet, long simian arms and a scanty beard and baldness. Lombroso also listed the features of the degenerate mentality, supposedly released by the disinhibition of the primitive neurological centres. These included apathy, the loss of moral sense, a tendency to impulsiveness or self-doubt, an unevenness of mental qualities such as unusual memory or aesthetic abilities, a tendency to mutism or to verbosity, excessive originality, preoccupation with the self, mystical interpretations placed on simple facts or perceptions, the abuse of symbolic meanings and the magical use of words, or ''mantras''. Lombroso, with his concept of ''atavistic retrogression'', suggested an evolutionary reversion, complementing ''hereditary degeneracy'', and his work in the medical examination of criminals in Turin resulted in his theory of [[criminal anthropology]]—a constitutional notion of abnormal personality that was not actually supported by his own scientific investigations. In his later life, Lombroso developed an obsession with [[spiritualism]], engaging with the spirit of his long dead mother.

In 1892, [[Max Nordau]], an expatriate Hungarian living in Paris, published his extraordinary bestseller ''Degeneration'', which greatly extended the concepts of Bénédict Morel and Cesare Lombroso (to whom he dedicated the book) to the entire civilization of western Europe, and transformed the medical connotations of degeneration into a generalized ''cultural criticism''. Adopting some of [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]]'s neurological vocabulary, Nordau identified a number of weaknesses in contemporary [[Western culture]] which he characterized in terms of ''ego-mania'', i.e., [[narcissism]] and [[hysteria]]. He also emphasized the importance of ''fatigue'', ''enervation'' and ''ennui''. Nordau, appalled by the anti-Semitism surrounding the [[Dreyfus affair]], devoted his later years to [[Zionism|Zionist politics]]. Degeneration theory fell from favour around the time of the First World War because of an improved understanding of the mechanisms of genetics as well as the increasing vogue for psychoanalytic thinking. However, some of its preoccupations lived on in the world of [[eugenics]] and [[social Darwinism]]. It is notable that the [[Nazi]] attack on western liberal society was largely couched in terms of [[degenerate art]] with its associations of racial [[miscegenation]] and fantasies of [[racial purity]]—and included as its target almost all modernist cultural experiment.

Towards the close of the 19th century, in the [[Fin de siècle|fin-de-siècle]] period, something of an obsession with decline, descent and degeneration invaded the European creative imagination, partly fuelled by widespread misconceptions of Darwinian evolutionary theory. Among the main examples are the symbolist literary work of [[Charles Baudelaire]], the Rougon-Macquart novels of [[Émile Zola]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''—published in the same year (1886) as [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''Psychopathia Sexualis''—and, subsequently, [[Oscar Wilde]]'s only novel (containing his aesthetic manifesto) ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891). In ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles'' (1891), [[Thomas Hardy]] explores the destructive consequences of a family myth of noble ancestry. Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]] showed a sensitivity to degenerationist thinking in his theatrical presentations of Scandinavian domestic crises. [[Arthur Machen]]'s ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' (1890/1894), with its emphasis on the horrors of psychosurgery, is frequently cited as an essay on degeneration.  A scientific twist was added by [[H.G. Wells]] in ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) in which Wells prophesied the splitting of the human race into differently degenerate forms, and again, a little later, in his ''The Island of Doctor Moreau'' (1896). [[Joseph Conrad]] alludes to degeneration theory in his treatment of political radicalism in the 1907 novel ''The Secret Agent''.

In her influential study ''The Gothic Body'',&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Kelly (1996) ''The Gothic Body: Sexuality, Materialism and Degeneration at the Fin-de-siècle'' Cambridge and London: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly Hurley draws attention to the literary device of the ''[[abhuman]]'' as a representation of damaged personal identity, and to lesser-known authors in the field, including [[Richard Marsh (author)|Richard Marsh]] (1857-1915), author of ''[[The Beetle (novel)|The Beetle]]'' (1897), and [[William Hope Hodgson]] (1877–1918), author of ''[[The Boats of the Glen Carrig]]'', ''[[The House on the Borderland]]'' and ''[[The Night Land]]''. In 1897, [[Bram Stoker]] published ''[[Dracula]]'', an enormously influential Gothic novel featuring the parasitic vampire Count Dracula in an extended exercise of reversed imperialism. Unusually, Stoker makes explicit reference to the writings of Lombroso and Nordau in the course of the novel. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s Sherlock Holmes stories include a host of degenerationist [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], perhaps best illustrated (drawing on the ideas of [[Serge Voronoff]]) in ''The Adventure of the Creeping Man''.

An '''honor system''' or '''honesty system'''  is a philosophical way of running a variety of endeavors based on [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[Honour|honor]], and [[honesty]]. Something that operates under the rule of the "honor system" is usually something that does not have strictly enforced rules governing its principles. In [[British English]], it would more often be called a '''"trust system"''' and should not be confused with the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British honours system]].

The '''honor system''' is also a system granting freedom from customary surveillance (as to students or prisoners) with the understanding that those who are so freed will be bound by their [[honor]] to observe regulations (e.g. prison farms are operated under the '''''honor system'''''),&lt;ref&gt;"honor system." Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (24 Feb. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and will therefore not abuse the trust placed in them.

A person engaged in an honor system has a strong negative concept of breaking or going against it. The negatives may include community shame, loss of status, loss of a personal sense of integrity and pride or in extreme situations, banishment from one's community.

==Types of honor systems==
There are various types of honor systems that may be employed. A total honor system makes no checks on its users to verify their honesty, thereby easily allowing the system to be cheated. Though the system may face occasional audits, there would be no way thereafter of learning the identity of the violator. Some are simply contingent upon the truthfulness presumed of users; others are present when the losses caused by those who may cheat the system are less costly than a higher security system.

Other honor systems employ random checks of selected users to ensure they are in compliance. A minority of users will undergo this check, while the remainder will be given a chance to get away with a violation. In these cases, the management of the system hopes that the fear of getting checked will coerce users into compliance.

== Examples ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Honor bar]] --&gt;

=== Transport ===
In some places, [[public transport]] such as [[train]]s, [[tram]]s and/or buses operate on an honor system called [[proof-of-payment]].  The local government authorities may find it impractical or overly expensive to install ticket-checking [[turnstile]]s at every [[railway station|station]], and instead rely on casual human surveillance to check if all riders possess tickets.  In such a system one could thus ride the train or bus without paying, and simply hope to be lucky enough to avoid a random ticket check during the trip.  Such behavior is impossible for an honor system by itself to prevent. High penalties tend to be used to offset the financial cost of non-paying riders.

Some toll roads, including the [[Sawgrass Expressway]] near [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], have unstaffed [[Toll house|toll booth]]s in which motorists are expected to pay their tolls. When a violation occurs, an alarm may sound, and the vehicle may be photographed, but {{cnspan|text=no officers will pursue the violator|date=November 2015}}.


At many Western airports, arriving international passengers are instructed by signs either to walk through one door (usually green) if they have nothing to declare, or a different door (usually red) if they have something to declare. Forcible screening is rare, though customs officers generally have authority to check persons suspected of falsely using the green channel. Items that must be declared commonly include cash, food, alcohol, luxury items, publications, weapons, tobacco, etc. Most other items, including personal belongings such as regular clothing, need not be declared. However, X-ray scans can reveal what items must be declared. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

=== Tourism ===
[[File:The Honor System.jpg|thumb|right|The honor system is used at [[Benicia State Recreation Area]].]]
Some hotels, mostly in [[continental Europe]], operate an [[honesty bar]], allowing guests to serve and record their own drinks and saving the cost of a night bartender. Patrons could theoretically lie about their drink consumption, and the hotel would have only limited powers to verify their claims. The concept of hotel "[[mini-bar]]s" in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] is similar, although the stock is quantified more carefully, making it difficult to lie. As well, most hotel minibars are now equipped with sensors which connect directly with the billing authority, making the honor system unnecessary.

In the [[Southern California]]n recreational [[sport fishing]] industry, the honor system is widely used, particularly on open party fishing boats. When the cook is occupied or in his bunk, passengers are permitted to get drinks and snacks on their own, providing they mark their own galley [[Bill (payment)|tab]].

Many publicly funded [[museum]]s and [[art galleries]] around the world ask for a certain "suggested donation" in exchange for admission. Patrons are almost never supervised during their donations, so there is no way of making sure the suggested minimum is being paid.  Strictly speaking this is not an honor system, as no payment obligation actually exists (merely a suggested donation); a true honor system is one in which there is an obligation, but it is not enforced.  However, these "suggested donation" schemes are often regarded as similar to an honor system, because they rely on the goodwill of patrons rather than the force of law.

[[National Park|National]] and [[State park]]s and some private parks often use an honor system to collect their admission fees. Rather than having a manned booth, they have a drop box known as an [[honesty box]] where money can be inserted, either directly, or in an envelope. Sometimes, the envelope contains a stub that is removed and placed on the guest's vehicle.

A lot of land [[International border]]s do not thoroughly check all persons passing the [[border checkpoint|checkpoint]]s for [[passport|required documents]] or [[contraband]]. When the security threat at the crossing is perceived by the nation's government to be low, checks may be conducted only on random persons or vehicles.

=== Education ===
{{main article|Academic honor code}}
The first honor system in America was penned by [[Thomas Jefferson]] at the [[College of William and Mary]], Jefferson's ''alma mater''.  In some colleges, the honor system is used to administer tests unsupervised. Students are generally asked to sign an [[honor code]] statement that says they will not cheat or use unauthorized resources when taking the test.  As an example, at [[Vanderbilt University]] students taking examinations are required to sign and include the following pledge: "On my honor as a student I have neither given nor received aid on this examination". Any student caught in violation of the Honor Code is referred to the Honor Council which investigates and determines the appropriate action, which can range from failing the course to expulsion from the University. At the [[University of Virginia]] a student taking an examination is also required to sign a pledge not to give or receive aid and there is but one penalty for transgression of the honor code, and that is dismissal from the University. Texas A&amp;M also has an Honor System which states, Aggies do not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do. This is listed at the beginning of all tests. Any student that does not follow the code is remanded to the Honor council so they can determine the severity of the case and how the student should be punished or if expulsion is necessary.  The students at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] also maintain a student-run honor system.  Students maintain the integrity of the university by pledging not to cheat, steal or lie.  Unlike the University of Virginia, the honor system at Chapel Hill allows for different sanctions, ranging from probation to expulsion. A single-sanction Honor Code exists at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], where a "drum out" ceremony is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal.

[[Washington and Lee University]] maintains an Honor System that was introduced by General [[Robert E. Lee]], who stated "We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman." The Washington &amp; Lee Honor System is entirely administered through the student body. It is one of the few universities in the [[United States]] to have a non-codified system. As a result, students decide what constitutes a breach of honor. These breaches are commonly named as lying, cheating, or stealing, but what constitutes an honor violation is open to the interpretation of the current student body. A single sanction of dismissal is enforced when a student is found guilty of an honor violation.

The [[California Institute of Technology]] implements an honor code that states "No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community."  Applications of this code range from professors trusting the students not to cheat with unsupervised take-home exams, laptops and bikes left unsecured in the dormitory lounges and courtyards (though the lounges and courtyards are secured against people who are not members of the Caltech community), and the food service trusting the students not to conduct food-hoarding raids during open kitchen hours.  The primary enforcement of the Caltech Honor Code is through student-run councils, but a few members of the Caltech faculty are involved.

=== Crime and justice ===

Some lower security [[Incarceration|inmate]]s at [[prison]]s are granted [[furlough]]s and allowed to temporarily leave the boundaries of the penitentiary for various reasons with the expectation they will return voluntarily when due without absconding. The reasons for departure may be for employment, education, recreation, or attending family events (such as [[wedding]]s or [[funeral]]s).

=== Non-profit ===
Another example can be seen in fundraising drives. Many [[charities]] distribute boxes of [[confectionery]] to businesses, which are placed in waiting rooms or similar for people to purchase items from. The confectionery is free to be removed by anyone who wishes to take it, and there is no enforcing of payment other than through the expectation of [[honesty]]. Indeed, most such boxes of confectionery bear the comment ''Your honesty is appreciated'' near where money is deposited.

In many places of [[worship]], those partaking in events with compulsory fees are expected to pay their dues, though most institutions such as these do not enforce payment. There is a general assumption of trust in most religious settings.

=== Retail ===
[[File:Martin's EasyShop system.jpg|right|thumb|200px|These handheld scanning devices at [[Giant-Carlisle#Martin's|Martin's]] allow customers to scan their own groceries while shopping. Such activity is not closely monitored by employees, and is therefore an honor system. Martin's has not reported an increase in shoplifting since introducing the system.]]
[[File:Gandhigiri Shop.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Example of the honor system at an unmanned Gandhigiri Shop in Mumbai, India]]

Some [[supermarket]] chains allow customers to scan their own groceries with handheld [[barcode reader]]s while placing them in their own carts (see [[self-checkout]]). While the system gives customers the ability to place groceries in their bags without paying, and customers can be randomly audited, participating supermarkets have reported that this experimental system has not increased the amount of [[shoplifting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19276534/ Wait in self-check line? That’s so last month - U.S. business - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hardware superstores, including [[Home Depot]], allow customers to place small items, such as [[screw]]s, into bags, then label the bags along with the exact price and quantity of the item they are purchasing. The system, which can be easily cheated, is contingent upon the honesty of customers, and is labeled in many stores as an "honor system."

In some countries, farmers leave bags of produce beside the road outside their houses with prices affixed. Passers-by pay by leaving cash in a container. In [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]] this is called the [[honesty box]] system. In other countries, small unmanned stores are run, where customers are able to enter, obtain what they need, and pay the bill in a secure container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basu|first=Mihika|title=Unmanned Shop|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/unmanned-shop/913972|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=28 October 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
In the sport of [[airsoft]], players rely on an honor system to tell whether or not an opponent is hit, because unlike [[paintballs]], airsoft pellets leave no visible markings on clothing.

Two combat sports practiced by the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], [[SCA Armored Combat|Armored Combat]] and [[SCA fencing|Rapier Combat]], use an honor system to judge valid strikes.  The individual who is hit is responsible for acknowledging if the impact was valid.

[[Ultimate (sport)|Disc ultimate]] has historically relied on the honor system and encodes it as part of the “Spirit of the Game,” to the point where very few competitions use referees and players are allowed to call fouls on their opponents.

Sports that deliberately incorporate alternative sexualities, by necessity, rely on the honor system for enforcement. The [[National Gay Flag Football League]] limits heterosexual competition to 20% of a team's roster. [[Muggle quidditch]] requires a minimum number of players to be of a second gender, while allowing players to identify as any number of [[gender identity|gender identities]] to qualify under the rule.

==Advantages==
In many places where an honor system is used, it has been found to be cost-effective. Many businesses and organizations using an honor system have determined that the cost of maintaining staff to enforce proper payment outweighs the losses caused by the percentage of the population who are willing to cheat the system. In addition, efficiency is high when an honor system is used. For example, buses/trains do not have to wait to sell or check passenger tickets when boarding and can instead leave immediately, and customs green channels allow for much faster exits than if every passenger is routinely checked.

For the remainder of the population, the honor system gives a more welcoming feeling to customers. Those who are treated with trust may be more likely to return to the location, and thereby increase the amount of business.

==Criticism of the concept==
Deciding whether or not to obey an honor system can be a [[dilemma]], especially if one places his/her personal financial [[self-interest]] above the interest of the institution they are patronizing. This can lead to a future negative impact towards their personal financial self-interest. Honor systems are often criticized for promoting laziness and bad behavior. Some have suggested it is [[paradox]]ical to ask people to obey a law if there is no apparent law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8052">'''Humanitarian engineering''' is research and design to directly improve the well-being of poor, [[marginalized]], or under-served communities, which often lack the means to address pressing problems.

==Definition==
The Humanitarian Engineering Center at the [[Ohio State University]] states that “Humanitarian engineering is the creation of technologies that help people” while the [[University of Warwick]] states that “Humanitarian Engineering is defined as the use of science and engineering to invent, create, design, develop, or improve technologies which promote the well-being of communities which are facing grand humanitarian challenges (fast growing populations, poor, disaster-hit, marginalised, or under-served communities)”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanitarian Engineering (with Management) - MSc|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses-2018/humengman/|website=University of Warwick|publisher=University of Wawick|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Humanitarian engineering is also called charity engineering, relief engineering and poor people engineering.

==Training and Education in Humanitarian Engineering==
Training for one who participates in humanitarian engineering incorporates history, politics, economics, sociology, language, as well as rigorous engineering basics.  Several universities in the [[United States]] focus efforts on Humanitarian Engineering: [[Penn State University]] integrates engineering design and research with a strong [[social entrepreneurship]] thrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.psu.edu/hese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620043432/http://www.engr.psu.edu/hese/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-20 |title=Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship @ Penn State University |publisher=Engr.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colorado School of Mines]] as well as the [[Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology]] offer Humanitarian Engineering as a minor. [[The Ohio State University]], which also offers a minor in the field, has many local and international service projects, courses, and research in Humanitarian Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;https://osuhe.engineering.osu.edu Humanitarian Engineering Center&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arizona State University]] offers a 3-course humanitarian engineering/entrepreneurship capstone as a part of the [[GlobalResolve]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

The '''Inchagiri Sampradaya''', also known as '''Nimbargi Sampradaya''', is a lineage of [[Hindu]] [[Navnath]] c.q. [[Lingayat]] [[Guru|teachers]] from [[Maharashtra]] which was started by [[Bhausaheb Maharaj|Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj]].&lt;ref group=web name="ShantiKuteer"&gt;[http://www.shantikuteer.org/page.php?pi=21 ShantiKuteer Ashram, ''Bhausaheb Maharaj'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is inspired by [[Deshastha Brahmin]] [[Sant Mat]] teachers as [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Eknath]] and [[Samarth Ramdas]]. The Inchagiri Sampradaya has become well-known throughout the western world due to the popularity of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj]].

==History==

====Dattatreya====
The mythological origins of the Inchagiri Sampradaya are ascribed to [[Dattatreya|Adiguru Shri Dattatreya]]. He initiated the [[Navnath|Navanaths]], the Holy Nine Gurus,{{sfn|Frydman|1987}} and the [[Navnath|Navanath Sampraday]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nisargadatta.net/lineage.html Navnath Sampradaya]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Frydman|1987}}

One of those Navnaths was Revanath, the 7th{{sfn|Frydman|1987}} or 8th{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}} Navnath. Revanath settled on the Siddhgiri hill for ascetic practice, living on whatever the jungle, gave him.

===Dnyaneshwar===
{{See also|Sant (religion)|Varkari}}

Revanath initiated [[Sant (religion)|Sant]] [[Dnyaneshwar]].&lt;ref group=web name="AdvaitOrg"&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/teachers/navnath_sampradaya.htm Advaita Vision, ''Navnath Sampradaya. Disciples of Nisargadatta Maharaj'']&lt;/ref&gt; (1275–1296), also known as Sant Jñāneshwar or Jñanadeva&lt;ref group=web name="AdvaitOrg" /&gt; and as Kadasiddha{{sfn|Frydman|1987}} or Kad-Siddheshwar Maharaj.{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}}

Dnyaneshwar was a 13th-century [[Maharashtra|Maharashtria]]n [[Hindu]] [[saint]] (''[[Sant (religion)|Sant]]'' - a title by which he is often referred), poet, philosopher and [[yogi]] of the [[Nath]] tradition whose works ''Bhavartha Deepika'' (a commentary on [[Bhagavad Gita]], popularly known as "[[Dnyaneshwari]]"), and [[Amrutanubhav]] are considered to be milestones in [[Marathi literature]].

According to Shirvaikar, Dnyaneshwar was initiated into the Nath by his older brother Nivrutti, who was born in 1273.&lt;ref group=web name="Shirvaikar"&gt;[http://www.dj6qo.de/dnye/Dnbiography.htm V. V. Shirvaikar, ''A brief biography of saint Dnyaneshwar (Jnanadeva)'']&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|In a state of extreme distress Vithalpant went to Triambakeshwar (near Nasik) with his family for performing worship at the Shiva temple. Triambakeshwar is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas or luminary lingas of Lord [[Shiva]]. While they had gone for performing pradakshina (circumambulation) of the temple one night they encountered a ferocious tiger (in thirteenth century the area was a deep forest) The members of the family ran helter skelter and were dispersed. Nivrutti wandered into a cave in the Anjani mountain where Gahininath, one of the nine Naths was staying for some time. He was attracted towards Nivrutti and in spite of his young age initiated him into Nath sect by initiation of nath panthi 'soham sadhana' which is combination of yoga,bhakti and also dnyana,instructing him to propagate devotion to Shri Krishna. That is how Nivrutti became [[Nivruttinath]]. The matter of excommunication did not affect this because the Nath sect does not bother about caste system and though socially it may be observed it is ignored in spiritual matters.&lt;ref group=web name="Shirvaikar" /&gt;}}

In 1287 Nivrutti initiated his younger brother:

===Nimbargi Maharaj (Gurulingajangam Maharaj) – Nimbargi Sampradaya===
Different accounts of the founding of the Nimbargi Sampradaya by Nimbargi Maharaj, the alternate name of the Inchegeri Sampradaya, are to be found.
* According to several accounts, in 1820&lt;ref group=web name="RanjitHistory"&gt;[http://www.sadguru.com/timeline.php Sadguru Shri Ranjit Maharaj, ''History'']&lt;/ref&gt; Kadasiddha,{{sfn|Frydman|1987}} or ''"Almighty "Kadsiddeshwar"'',&lt;ref group=web name="RanjitHistory" /&gt; appeared as a vision to Sri Gurulingajangam Maharaj"&lt;ref group=web name="RanjitHistory" /&gt; (1789-1875),&lt;ref group=web name="AdvaitOrg" /&gt; also known as "Nimbargi Maharaj".&lt;ref group=web name="AdvaitOrg" /&gt;

* According to Frydman, Kadasiddha initiated both Lingajangam Maharaj and Bhausahib Maharaj, and "entrusted to their care his Ashram".{{sfn|Frydman|1987}}{{refn|group=note|How Gurulingajangam Maharaj and Bhausahib Maharaj were initiated is not being narrated, but given the span of time between the 13th century and the 19th century and the early dismiss of Dnyaneshwar, a physical initiation seems unlikely.}}{{refn|group=note|Bhausahib Maharaj was born in 1843.&lt;ref group=web name="RanjitHistory" /&gt;}}
* Accordong to Cathy Boucher, Nimbargi Maharaj's guru was called "Guru Juangam Maharaj". She also mentions "a yogi [at Siddhagiri] who gave [Nimabargi Maharaj] a mantra and told him to meditate regularly on it".{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}}

Nimbargi belonged to a Nellawai sub-caste of the [[Lingayat]] caste.{{sfn|Dabade|1998|p=49}}{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}} According to Boucher,
{{quote|It is significant that some of the founders of the Navnath Sampradaya are Lingayat or Virasaiva because this was a revolutionary movement, allowing people of all walks of life, and both sexes to find [[Shiva]] immanent within themselves. Part of this democratizing movement, I believe, is a reaction of Western India's contact with Islam, which embraces people of all class, creed and gender. The iconoclasm, which is at the heart of Virasaivism actually comes down to us in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as something we can easily relate to. The breaking down of taboos, of certain parts of India's spiritual structure makes it possible for us as modern people to partake of these teachings. We do not even have to be practicing Hindus, in the traditional sense, in order to hear it. This attitude was most evident in the Satsang room of Sri Nisargaddatta Maharaj.{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}}}}

Nimbargi practiced for 36 years, meanwhile living as a householder, and was finally awakened when he was 67. Until his death, at the age of 95, he "initiated people and lived the life of a Jivanmukta".{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}}

===Bhausaheb Maharaj – Inchagiri Sampradaya===
{{Main|Bhausaheb Maharaj}}

According to Kotnis, Bhausaheb Maharj was looked upon as the reincarnation of [[Tukaram|Sant Tukaram]]{{sfn|Kotnis|1963|p=17}} (1577–1650), a prominent [[Varkari]] [[Sant (religion)|Sant]] and spiritual poet of the [[Bhakti]], who had taken birth again in the Neelwani Lingayat community to finish his work of spreading the knowledge of Self-realization.{{sfn|Kotnis|1963|p=17}} Bhausaheb Maharaj belonged to the [[Deshastha Brahmin]] caste.{{sfn|Boucher|year unknown}} the same caste to which the thirteenth century [[Varkari]] saint and philosopher [[Dnyaneshwar]] belonged, the 16th century sant [[Eknath]], and the 17th century saint and spiritual poet [[Samarth Ramdas]].{{sfn|Bokil|1979|p=18}}

==Lineage and succession==
{{Navnath Sampradaya - Inchegiri Sampradaya}}

Nisargadatta narrates the following about the succession of teachers of the Inchagiri Sampradaya:
{{quote|I sit here every day answering your questions, but this is not the way that the teachers of my lineage used to do their work. A few hundred years ago there were no questions and answers at all. Ours is a householder lineage, which means everyone had to go out and earn his living. There were no meetings like this where disciples met in large numbers with the Guru and asked him questions. Travel was difficult. There were no buses, trains and planes. In the old days the Guru did the traveling on foot, while the disciples stayed at home and looked after their families. The Guru walked from village to village to meet the disciples. If he met someone he thought was ready to be included in the sampradaya, he would initiate him with mantra of the lineage. That was the only teaching given out. The disciple would repeat the mantra and periodically the Guru would come to the village to see what progress was being made. When the Guru knew that he was about to pass away, he would appoint one of the householder-devotees to be the new Guru, and that new Guru would then take on the teaching duties: walking from village to village, initiating new devotees and supervising the progress of the old ones.&lt;ref group=web name="Remembering"&gt;[http://davidgodman.org/interviews/nis1.shtml David Godman, ''Remembering Nisargadatta Maharaj pt.1'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nisargadatta also told:
{{quote|There is a succession of Gurus and their disciples, who in turn train more disciples and thus the line is maintained. But the continuity of tradition is informal and voluntary. It is like a family name, but here the family is spiritual.{{sfn|Nisargadatta|1973|p=chapter 97}}}}

Nisargadatta also explained:
{{quote|Q:How does one become a Navnath? By initiation or by succession?&lt;br /&gt;
M:Neither. The ‘Nine Masters' tradition, Navnath Parampara, is like a river -- it flows into the ocean of reality and whoever enters it is carried along.&lt;br /&gt;
Q:Does it imply acceptance by a living master belonging to the same tradition?&lt;br /&gt;
M:Those who practice the sadhana of focusing their minds on ‘I am' may feel related to others who have followed the same sadhana succeeded. They may decide to verbalise their sense of kinship by calling themselves Navnaths. It gives them the pleasure of belonging to an established 
tradition.{{sfn|Nisargadatta|1973|p=chapter 97}}}}

Nisargadatta further explains:
{{quote|Q:Do you have to realise to join the Sampradaya?&lt;br /&gt;
M:The Navnath Sampradayais is only a tradition, a way of teaching and practice. It does not denote a level of consciousness. If you accept a Navnath Sampradayateacher as your Guru, you join his Sampradaya. Usually you receive a token of his grace – a look, a touch, or a word, sometimes a vivid dream or a strong remembrance. Sometimes the only sign of grace is a significant and rapid change in character and behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
Q:I know you now for some years and I meet you regularly. The thought of you is never far from my mind. Does it make me belong to your Sampradaya?&lt;br /&gt;
M:Your belonging is a matter of your own feeling and conviction. After all, it is all verbal and formal. In reality there is neither Guru nor disciple, neither theory nor practice, neither ignorance nor realization. It all depends on what you take yourself to be. Know yourself correctly. There is no substitute to self-knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
Q:What proof will I have that I know myself correctly?&lt;br /&gt;
M:You need no proofs. The experience is unique and unmistakable. It will dawn on you suddenly, when the obstacles are removed to some extent. It is like a frayed rope snapping.{{sfn|Nisargadatta|1973|p=chapter 97}}}}

Nisargadatta started to give initiations in 1951, after a "personal revelation" from his guru, Siddharameshwar Maharaj,&lt;ref group=web name=NisargadattaMaharajBiography /&gt; while Ranjit Maharaj started to give initiations in 1983, almost half a century after his awakening, on request of Siddharameshwar Maharaj granddaughter-in-law:&lt;ref group=web name ="Ranjit interview" /&gt;
{{quote|In 1936, when he passed away, I was living my simple life because I never wanted to become a Master [laughs].

'''James Hutchison Stirling''' (22 June 1820 – 19 March 1909) was a Scottish idealist [[philosopher]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/stirling James Hutchison Stirling (1820-1909), in Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; and physician. His work ''[[The Secret of Hegel]]'' (1st edition, 1865, in 2 vols.; revised edition, 1898, in 1 vol.) gave great impetus to the study of [[Hegelian]] philosophy both in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and in the [[United States]], and it was also accepted as an authoritative work on Hegel's philosophy in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]].{{sfn|Cousin|1910}}

==Biography==
[[File:3,4 Laverockbank Road, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|4 Laverockbank Road, Edinburgh (left)]]
[[File:The grave of James Hutchison Stirling, Warriston Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The grave of James Hutchison Stirling, Warriston Cemetery]]
James Hutchison Stirling was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, the 5th son (and the youngest of 6 children) of William Stirling (died 14 March 1851)&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t3708n81r;view=1up;seq=111;size=75 ''James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work'' (1912), by Amelia Hutchison Stirling, p. 103]&lt;/ref&gt; and Elizabeth Christie (d. 1828).&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100533383 Oxford Index - James Hutchison Stirling (1820-1909)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t3708n81r;view=1up;seq=25;size=75 ''James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work'' (1912), pp. 17-18]&lt;/ref&gt; William was a wealthy textile manufacturer who was a partner in the Glasgow firm of James Hutchison &amp; Co., which manufactured muslin (lightweight cotton cloth in a plain weave, used for making sheets and for a variety of other purposes).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5aVDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA622&amp;dq=William+Stirling+-+James+Hutchison+%26+Co.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VxAWGBe6me&amp;sig= Article on "Stirling, James Hutchison, LL.D" in ''Who's Who 1897 - First Year of New Issue'' (London: Adam &amp; Charles Black, Soho Square, 1897) (ed. by Douglas Sladen), p. 622]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/slatersdirectory1855scot ''Slater's Directory of Glasgow and its Vicinity'' (1855) (Hutchison, James &amp; Co. is listed under "Manufacturers of Muslins" on p. 46)]&lt;/ref&gt; William was known for his deeply-held religious views, many of which strongly influenced his son James.

Stirling studied at Young's Academy in Glasgow, followed by 9 years of education (1833-1842) at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he studied medicine, history, and classics. He became a Licentiate (1842, medical diploma) and Fellow (1860) of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]].

Stirling married Jane Hunter Mair (died 5 July 1903), an old family friend, on 28 April 1847 in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]]. The couple had seven children (5 daughters and 2 sons), as follows:  Jessie Jane Stirling (born 26 June 1850) (who married Rev. Robert Armstrong of Glasgow), Elizabeth Margaret Stirling (11 February 1852 - 1871), Amelia Hutchison Stirling, Florence Hutchison Stirling (1858 - 6 May 1948), Lucy Stirling, William Stirling, and David Stirling. Stirling's daughter Amelia wrote many books on historical subjects, and she was the joint-translator - with William Hale White (1831-1913) - of Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (1883). She also wrote a biography of her father James titled ''James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work'' (London and Leipzig: T. Fisher Unwin, 1912). Stirling's daughter Florence won the Scottish Ladies' Championship (a chess championship) 5 times (in 1905, 1906, 1907, 1912, and 1913).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chessscotland.com/documents/history/biographies/stirling.htm Chess Scotland - Florence Hutchison Stirling]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chessscotland.com/documents/archiveresults/champwoman.htm Chess Scotland - Women Champions]&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving a large inheritance from his father's estate in 1851, Stirling left his medical practice.{{sfn|Cousin|1910}} He then set out to learn French and German, for the purpose of being able to better understand continental philosophical trends. In pursuit of this goal, he moved his family briefly to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], France (located in the current [[Pas-de-Calais]] department of the [[Hauts-de-France]] region), then to Paris for 18 months, then to [[St. Servan]] (located 2 miles from the ferry port of [[St. Malo]] in the [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] department of the [[Brittany]] region of France) for four and a half years, and then finally to Heidelberg, Germany. In November 1857, Stirling and his family took up residence in London (at 3 Wilton Terrace, Kensington), where they lived for about 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo1.ark:/13960/t3708n81r;view=1up;seq=146;size=75 ''James Hutchison Stirling: His Life and Work'' (1912), p. 136]&lt;/ref&gt; After this, in 1860 Stirling returned to Edinburgh - his address there was 4 Laverock Bank Road, Trinity, Edinburgh&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1908-9&lt;/ref&gt; - which then became his permanent residence until the end of his life, and where he wrote on the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770-1831) and many other subjects. The primary result of his comprehensive Hegel studies was his influential work ''The Secret of Hegel'' (2 vols., 1865).

One of Stirling's other major philosophical works - ''Philosophy and Theology'' (1890) (consisting of his 20 [[Gifford Lectures]], delivered at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1889-1890) - focuses not on Hegelian philosophical topics, but on [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary theories.

[[Frederick Copleston]] (''A History of Philosophy'' vol. VII, p.&amp;nbsp;12) wrote "...we may be inclined to smile at J. H. Stirling's picture of Hegel as the great champion of Christianity."

In his final years he lived at 4 Laverockbank Road in [[Trinity, Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1909-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirling died in Edinburgh. He is buried in [[Warriston Cemetery]] on the north side of the city. His grave lies in the centre of the long, upper section north of the vaults, facing south onto an east-west path.

'''Jean-Louis de Lolme''' or '''Delolme'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB9|wstitle=Delolme|volume=7|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1740{{snd}}16 July 1806) was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] and British [[political philosophy|political theorist]] and writer on constitutional matters, born in the then independent Republic of [[Geneva]]. As an adult he moved to England, and became a British subject. His most famous work was ''[[:File:Jean-Louis de Lolme, Constitution de l'Angleterre (1st ed, 1771).pdf|Constitution de l'Angleterre]]'' (''The Constitution of England'', 1771), which was subsequently published in English as well. In it, de Lolme advocated a constitutional form of government enshrining the principle that monarchy, [[aristocracy]] and democracy should be balanced against each other. He also praised the element of [[representative democracy]] in the constitution, and urged an extension of [[suffrage]]. The work influenced many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|framers]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

==Early life==
De Lolme was born in the then independent Republic of [[Geneva]] in 1740. He studied for the bar, and had begun to practise law when he was obliged to emigrate on account of a pamphlet he wrote entitled ''Examen de trois parts de droit'' (''Examination of Three Parts of Rights''), which gave offence to the authorities of the town. He took refuge in England, where he lived for several years on the meagre and precarious income derived from occasional contributions to various journals.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=970}}

==Writing career==
[[File:Title page of Constitution de l'Angleterre (1789).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[title page]] of a 1789 edition of de Lolme's ''[[:File:Jean-Louis de Lolme, Constitution de l'Angleterre (1789).pdf|Constitution de l'Angleterre]]'' (''The Constitution of England'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jean-Louis de Lolme|title=[[:File:Jean-Louis de Lolme, Constitution de l'Angleterre (1789).pdf|Constitution de l'Angleterre, ou, État du gouvernement anglais, comparé avec la forme républicaine et avec les autres monarchies de l'Europe &amp;#91;The Constitution of England, or, The State of the English Government, Compared with the Republican Form and with the Other Monarchies of Europe&amp;#93;]]|location=Geneva|publisher=Chez Barde, Manget &amp; Compagnie, Imprimeurs-Libraires. &amp; se trouve à Paris, Chez Buisson, Libraire, Rue Haute-feuille, hôtel Coëtlosquet, No. 22|year=1789|oclc=27983401}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During his protracted exile in England, De Lolme made a careful study of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|English constitution]], the results of which he published in his ''[[:File:Jean-Louis de Lolme, Constitution de l'Angleterre (1st ed, 1771).pdf|Constitution de l'Angleterre]]'' (''The Constitution of England'', Amsterdam, 1771),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=970}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jean-Louis de Lolme|title=[[:File:Jean-Louis de Lolme, Constitution de l'Angleterre (1st ed, 1771).pdf|Constitution de l'Angleterre]]|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Chez E. van Harrevelt|year=1771|oclc=65353904}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of which an enlarged and improved edition in English appeared in 1775,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=970}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jean-Louis de Lolme|title=The Constitution of England: Or, An Account of the English Government; in which it is Compared, both with the Republican Form of Government, and Occasionally with the Other Monarchies in Europe|location=London|publisher=Printed by T. Spilsbury, and sold by G. Kearsley|year=1775|oclc=265591647}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was several times reprinted. The work excited much interest as containing many acute observations on the causes of the excellence of the English constitution as compared with those of other countries.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=970}} However, it was termed by the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] (1911) as "wanting in breadth of view, being written before the period when constitutional questions were treated in a scientific manner".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=970}}

In the book, de Lolme advocated a constitutional form of government enshrining the principle of balanced government, balancing the one, the few, and the many, or the ideas of monarchy, [[aristocracy]], and democracy. He criticised the power of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] and made a grotesque expression which became proverbial: "parliament can do everything but make a woman a man and a man a woman". Nonetheless, de Lolme extolled the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] because, in his view, which was influenced by his own observations and study as well as by the previous writings of [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]], the [[uncodified constitution|unwritten constitution]] of the United Kingdom embodied the ideal of balanced government better than any other government of the time. In particular, he praised the element of [[representative democracy]] in the constitution, and urged an extension of [[suffrage]]. De Lolme developed and refined his political thinking to a large extent in opposition to the more radical theory of [[direct democracy]] advocated by his compatriot, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], whom he accused of being unrealistic. De Lolme is sometimes identified as a probable candidate for being the person behind the pseudonymous political commentator [[Junius]].

De Lolme also wrote in English ''A Parallel between the English Government and the Former Government of Sweden'' (1772);{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=970}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jean-Louis de Lolme|title=A Parallel between the English Constitution and the Former Government of Sweden; Containing Some Observations on the Late Revolution in that Kingdom; and an Examination of the Causes that Secure Us against both Aristocracy, and Absolute Monarchy|location=London|publisher=Sold by [J.] Almon, Bookseller, in [[Piccadilly]]|year=1772|oclc=642244901}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The History of the Flagellants'' (c. 1776),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jean-Louis de Lolme|title=The History of the Flagellants or the Advantages of Discipline; Being a Paraphrase and Commentary on the Historia flagellantium of the Abbé Boileau ...

==Later life==
In 1775, de Lolme found himself compelled to accept aid from a charitable society to enable him to return home. He died at Seewen, a village in the [[Canton of Schwyz]], on 16 July 1806.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=970}}

==Legacy==
De Lolme's ''Constitution de l'Angleterre'', along with a translation of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[The History of England (Hume)|History of England]]'' (1754–1761), supplied philosophers of the time with most of their ideas about the English constitution. It was therefore used somewhat as a political pamphlet.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=970}} The work influenced many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|framers]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. One Founding Father who was not present in Philadelphia, but whose ''Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States'' (1787)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=John Adams|authorlink=John Adams|title=A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America.

Some have argued that De Lolme's work also influenced the [[Constitution of Norway]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that the [[Bible]] prohibits ingesting [[blood]] and that Christians should not accept [[blood transfusion]]s or donate or store their own blood for transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;''Keep Yourself in God's Love'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 2008, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief is based on an interpretation of scripture that differs from that of other Christian denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-09/news/ct-met-jehovahs-witness-patients-bloodless-treatme-20121009_1_hospital-liaison-committee-blood-transfusions-dewald|first=Manya A.|last=Brachear|date=9 October 2012|title=More doctors honor religious objections to blood transfusions|website=Chicago Tribune|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094136/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-09/news/ct-met-jehovahs-witness-patients-bloodless-treatme-20121009_1_hospital-liaison-committee-blood-transfusions-dewald|archivedate=3 November 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the doctrines for which Jehovah's Witnesses are best known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Evans| first = Allan S.|author2=Riley E.

Jehovah's Witnesses' literature teaches that their refusal of transfusions of whole blood or its four primary components—red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma—is a non-negotiable religious stand and that those who respect life as a gift from [[God in Christianity|God]] do not try to sustain life by taking in blood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?|publisher=Watch Tower Society|pages=3&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;"Be Guided by the Living God", ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2004, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; even in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;"Godly Respect for Blood", ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1986, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses are taught that the use of fractions such as [[albumin]], [[antibody|immunoglobulin]]s and [[hemophilia]]c preparations are "not absolutely prohibited", and are instead a matter of personal choice.&lt;ref name="Guide" /&gt;

The doctrine was introduced in 1945, and has undergone some changes since then.

The Watch Tower Society has established Hospital Information Services to provide education and facilitate [[bloodless surgery]]. This service also maintains Hospital Liaison Committees, whose function is to provide support to adherents.

==Doctrine==
On the basis of various biblical texts, including {{Bibleref|Genesis|9:4}}, {{Bibleref|Leviticus|17:10}}, and {{Bibleref|Acts|15:28-15:29}}, Jehovah's Witnesses believe:
* Blood represents life&lt;ref&gt;''How Can Blood Save Your Life'', published by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 1990 p. 24, "God told all mankind that they must not eat blood. Why? Because blood represents life."&lt;/ref&gt; and is sacred to God.&lt;ref name=Awake06&gt;''Awake!'', August 2006 p. 11, "He also gave them his reason, equating blood with the soul, or life, of the creature. He later said: 'The soul [or life] is in the blood.' In the eyes of the Creator, blood is sacred. It represents the precious gift of life that each living soul possesses."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2004 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; After it has been removed from a creature, the only use of blood that God has authorized is for the atonement of sins.&lt;ref name=WT97&gt;''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1997 p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; When a Christian abstains from blood, they are in effect expressing faith that only the shed blood of Jesus Christ can truly redeem them and save their life.&lt;ref name=Awake06 /&gt;
* Blood must not be eaten or transfused,&lt;ref name="JWpress2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 1, 1969 pp. 326, 327&lt;/ref&gt; even in the case of a medical emergency.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1986 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood leaving the body of a human or animal must be disposed of.&lt;ref name=WT97 /&gt;
* Certain medical procedures involving blood fractions or that use a patient's own blood during the course of a medical procedure, such as hemodilution or cell salvage, are a matter of personal choice, according to what a person's conscience permits.&lt;ref&gt;October 15, 2000 Watchtower, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
* A baptized Witness who unrepentantly accepts a blood transfusion is deemed to have disassociated himself from the group by abandoning its doctrines and is subsequently subject to organized shunning by other members.&lt;ref name="BMJOM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JWpress2000" /&gt;

Certain medical procedures involving blood are specifically prohibited by Jehovah's Witnesses' blood doctrine. This includes the use of [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], [[platelets]] and [[blood plasma]]. Other fractions derived from blood are not prohibited. [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower]] publications state that some products derived from one of the four primary components may be so similar to the function of the whole component and carry on such a life-sustaining role in the body that "most Christians would find them objectionable".&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2004 P.24 par. 16&lt;/ref&gt; For procedures where there is no specific doctrinal prohibition, individuals are to obtain details from medical personnel and then make a personal decision.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1989, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibited procedures===

The following medical procedures are prohibited:
* Transfusion of [[allogeneic]] whole blood, or of its constituents of red cells, white cells, platelets or plasma.&lt;ref name=WT2000-06-15p29-31&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 15, 2000 pp. 29-31&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transfusions of pre-operative self-donated ([[Autotransplantation#Autologous blood donation|autologous]]) blood.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31&gt;''The Watchtower'', October 15, 2000 pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permitted procedures and products===

The following procedures and products are not prohibited, and are left to the decision of individual members:&lt;ref&gt;Our Kingdom Ministry, November 2006 pages 3,4 para.1-6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood donation strictly for purpose of further fractionation of red cells, white cells, platelets or plasma for either allogeneic or autologous transfusion.&lt;ref name=WT2000-06-15p29-31 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jehovah's Witness letter to Cliff Roche, July 30, 2001 (Published in the book ''Three Dissertations on the Teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses'', by Greg Stafford, 2002 {{ISBN|0-9659814-2-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transfusions of autologous blood part of a "current therapy".&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* Hemodilution, a modified technique in which equipment is arranged in a circuit that is constantly linked to the patient's circulatory system.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Intraoperative blood salvage]] (autologous) or ''cell-saver scavenging'', a method of picking up blood that has spilled from the circulatory system into an open wound, cleaning and re-infusing it.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Life support|Heart-Lung Machine]], a method in which blood is diverted to an artificial heart-lung machine and directed back into the patient.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Dialysis]], wherein blood circulates through a machine, is filtered and cleaned, then returned to the patient.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Epidural blood patch|Epidural Blood Patch]], consisting of a small amount of the patient's blood injected into the membrane surrounding the spinal cord.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* [[Plasmapheresis]], wherein blood is withdrawn and filtered, having the plasma removed and substituted, and returned to the patient.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;
* Labeling or Tagging, blood is withdrawn, mixed with medicine, and then returned to the patient by transfusion.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Instructions for Filling in The Advance Decision Document'', published by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 2005 p.1. This document specifically applies the term "transfusion" to a Jehovah's Witness patient having blood returned to their cardiovascular system after it was completely removed from their body.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Platelet]] Gel, blood is withdrawn and put into a solution rich in platelets and white blood cells.&lt;ref name=WT2000-10-15p30-31 /&gt;

==Bloodless surgery==
{{Main|Bloodless surgery}}
A variety of bloodless surgical techniques have been developed for use on patients who refuse blood transfusions for reasons that include concern about [[AIDS]], [[hepatitis]], and other blood-borne infections, or [[immune system#Disorders of human immunity|immune system reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer S, Webb D, Your Body Your Choice: The Layman's Complete Guide to Bloodless Medicine and Surgery, 2000; pages 11, 14, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Many physicians have expressed a willingness to respect patients' preferences and provide bloodless treatment&lt;ref name=Ariga2003&gt;Ariga et al., Legal Medicine, 5 (2003) S72-S75&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=April 2010}} and about 200 hospitals offer bloodless medicine and surgery programs for patients who wish to avoid or limit blood transfusions.&lt;ref name=Ariga2003 /&gt; Bloodless surgery has been successfully performed in significant procedures including [[cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]] and total [[hip replacement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rwjuh.edu/medserv/bloodless.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828200449/http://www.rwjuh.edu/medserv/bloodless.html |archivedate=2005-08-28 |df= }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/bloodless/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406155101/http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/bloodless/ |archivedate=2006-04-06 |df= }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/bloodless/html/aboutthecenter/casestudies.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502063014/http://www.theuniversityhospital.com/bloodless/html/aboutthecenter/casestudies.htm |archivedate=2006-05-02 |df= }}, and [http://www.noblood.org/forum/index.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405230240/http://www.noblood.org/forum/index.php |date=2004-04-05 }} - successful cases of bloodless surgery&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study in ''[[JAMA Internal Medicine]]'' concluded that "Witnesses do not appear to be at increased risk for surgical complications or long-term mortality when comparisons are properly made by transfusion status. Thus, current extreme blood management strategies do not appear to place patients at heightened risk for reduced long-term survival." The study also stated that "Survival estimates of Witnesses were 86%, 69%, 51%, and 34% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after surgery, respectively, vs 74%, 53%, 35%, and 23% among non-Witnesses who received transfusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2012.2449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a child is aged 15 to 17, a doctor will not perform a transfusion if the parents and the child refuse the transfusion. If a child aged from 15 to 17 objects to a transfusion but the parents demand the transfusion, then a doctor can override the child's wish.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In the [[United States]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends that in cases of "an imminent threat to a child's life", physicians in some cases may "intervene over parental objections".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics | year = 1997 | title = Religious objections to medical care | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 99 | issue = 2| pages = 279–281 | doi=10.1542/peds.99.2.279 | pmid=9024462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospital Liaison Committees===

In 1988, the Watch Tower Society formed ''Hospital Information Services'', a department to help locate doctors or surgical teams who are willing to perform medical procedures on Witnesses without blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 1988, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The department was given oversight of each branch office's ''Hospital Information Desk'',&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses—1998 Yearbook Report", ''1998 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', ©1997 Watch Tower, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses—1996 Yearbook Report", ''1996 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', ©1997 Watch Tower, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Bridging the Gap Between Doctors and Witness Patients", ''Awake!'', November 22, 1990, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; and of one hundred ''Hospital Liaison Committees'' established throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Are You Ready to Face a Faith-Challenging Medical Situation?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 1990, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recognition&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2002|title=Certificate of Recognition issued by Society for the Advancement of Blood Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013045/http://www.jw-media.org/gbl/20021118.htm|archive-date=March 6, 2012|url=http://www.jw-media.org/gbl/20021118.htm|publisher=Watch Tower Society|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, about 200 hospitals worldwide provide bloodless medical programs.&lt;ref name=Ariga2003 /&gt; As of 2006, there are 1,535 Hospital Liaison Committees worldwide coordinating communication between 110,000 physicians.&lt;ref name=recognition /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;January 3, 2006 Letter from Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses; To all Congregations&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient Visitation Groups===
Annually since 2004, Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States have been informed that "with your consent, the law allows for the [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]] to learn of your admission [to hospital] and provide spiritual encouragement",&lt;ref&gt;"Announcements", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 2005, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; but that "elders serving on a ''Patient Visitation Group'' [could] have access to your name" only if patients made their wishes known according to the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).&lt;ref&gt;"Announcements", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', October 2004, page 7, emphasis added to quote&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses' branch offices communicate directly with congregations regarding "ways to benefit from the activities of the Hospital Liaison Committee (HLC) and the Patient Visitation Group (PVG)."&lt;ref&gt;"Service Meeting Schedule", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', January 2006, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; A Jehovah's Witnesses publication in 2000 reported that Argentina had fewer than a hundred HLC committeemen "giving vital information to the medical community", adding that "their work is complemented by hundreds of other self-sacrificing elders who make up Patient Visitation Groups that call on Witness patients to help and encourage them".&lt;ref&gt;"Argentina", ''2001 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', ©2000 Watch Tower, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; Each branch office appoints PVG committeemen, who serve as volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;""Follow Me Continually"", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', May 2006, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"No One Has Love Greater Than This", ''Come Be My Follower'', ©2007 Watch Tower, pages 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance among Jehovah's Witnesses==
Since the elaboration of the blood doctrine to the point of prohibiting transfusion, the majority of Jehovah's Witnesses have adopted the organization's position.&lt;ref name=Findley82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaaron Benson, [[H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute]] Cancer Control Journal, Vol. 2, No. 4, November/December 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gyamfi04/&gt; Those Jehovah's Witnesses who accept the blood doctrine typically hold strongly to their conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knuti KA, Amrein PC, Chabner BA, Lynch TJ, Penson RT |title=Faith, identity, and leukemia: when blood products are not an option |journal=Oncologist |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=371–80 |year=2002 |pmid=12185299 |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12185299 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.7-4-371}}&lt;br/&gt;"Ms. LF stated that she was a Jehovah's Witness and asserted with an advanced [sic] directive that she did not want blood product support…. The risks and benefits of continuing therapy were discussed with Ms. LF. She remained adamant in her refusal of blood products and repeated that she wanted to continue treatment and to 'die fighting' her disease."&lt;/ref&gt; In the August 1998 issue of ''Academic Emergency Medicine'', Donald Ridley, a Jehovah's Witness and organization staff attorney, argued that carrying an up-to-date Medical Directive card issued by the organization indicates that an individual personally agrees with the established religious position of Jehovah's Witness.&lt;ref name=Ridley98&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.1998.tb02510.x |vauthors=Migden DR, Braen GR |title=The Jehovah's Witness blood refusal card: ethical and medicolegal considerations for emergency physicians |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=815–24 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9715245 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.1998.tb02511.x |author=Ridley DT |title=Honoring Jehovah's Witnesses' advance directives in emergencies: a response to Drs. Migden and Braen |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=824–35 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9715246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, ''[[The Watchtower]]'' reported on a particular member of Jehovah's Witnesses who voluntarily accepted blood transfusion, contrary to Watchtower doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower August 1, 1958 p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; The organization confirms that members have accepted blood transfusions, despite the imposition in 1961 of a communal shunning policy for willful acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower January 15, 1961 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower October 15, 1987 p. 14, "Three areas for attention were mentioned: secretly accepting a blood transfusion, masturbation, and alcohol abuse. After considering that material, quite a number of readers wrote letters of appreciation; they admitted that they had had those faults, but they had been moved to repent and change."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, a peer-reviewed case study of a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses was undertaken by Drs. Larry J. Findley and Paul M. Redstone to evaluate individual belief in respect to blood among Jehovah's Witnesses. The study showed that 12% were willing to accept transfusion therapy forbidden by Jehovah's Witness doctrine.&lt;ref name=Findley82&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Findley LJ, Redstone PM |title=Blood transfusion in adult Jehovah's Witnesses. A case study of one congregation |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=606–7 |date=March 1982 |pmid=7065795 |doi=10.1001/archinte.142.3.606 }}&lt;br/&gt;This article presents a consensual survey of one congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses where the congregation elders provided the names and addresses of members, and the elders knew precisely the nature of the survey. 59 responses were received. Of the 59, 7 stipulated they would accept plasma transfusion (Table 1 on page 607). This result compelled Findley and Redstone to comment, "there is either some lack of understanding or refusal to follow doctrine among some members". Whether from misunderstanding or refusal to follow doctrine, at no point did Findley and Redstone question whether these responders had honestly expressed their personal conviction. Findley and Redstone also stipulated their methodology may have skewed the results towards official Jehovah's Witness doctrine. (Local elders provided the names to be surveyed, and those surveyed knew local elders would see the results of the study.) The authors also admit that this study may not describe the beliefs of "less religious Jehovah's Witnesses".&lt;/ref&gt; One peer-reviewed study examining medical records indicated a similar percentage of Jehovah's Witnesses willing to accept blood transfusions for their children. Young adults also showed a willingness to accept blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;Kaaron Benson, [[H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute]] Cancer Control Journal, Vol. 2, No. 4, November/December 1995, "''Therefore, while most adult Jehovah's Witness patients were unwilling to accept blood for themselves, most Jehovah's Witness parents permitted transfusions for their minor children, and many of the young adult patients also were willing to accept transfusions for themselves''." Available online at http://www.moffitt.org/moffittapps/ccj/v2n6/article13.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313192746/http://www.moffitt.org/moffittapps/ccj/v2n6/article13.html |date=2007-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, Jehovah's Witness patients presented for labor and delivery showed a willingness to accept some form of blood or blood products. Of these patients, 10 percent accepted whole blood transfusion.&lt;ref name=Gyamfi04&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gyamfi C, Berkowitz RL |title=Responses by pregnant Jehovah's Witnesses on health care proxies |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=541–4 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15339766 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000135276.25886.8e |quote=This review refutes the commonly held belief that all Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to accept blood or any of its products.

Watch Tower publications have noted that within religions, the personal beliefs of members often differ from official doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;"Where Are the Faithful?", ''Awake!'', April 8, 1996, p. 4, "Nowadays official church dogma may bear scant resemblance to the personal beliefs of those who profess that particular religion."&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Jehovah's Witnesses acceptance of the organization's official position on blood, Drs Cynthia Gyamfi and Richard Berkowitz state, "It is naïve to assume that all people in any religious group share the exact same beliefs, regardless of doctrine. It is well known that Muslims, Jews and Christians have significant individual variations in their beliefs. Why should that not also be true of Jehovah's Witnesses?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas JM |title=Responses by pregnant Jehovah's Witnesses on health care proxies |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=441; author reply 442–3 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15684182 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000149842.31312.e4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambivalence and rejection of the blood doctrine dates back to at least the 1940s. After the Watch Tower Society established the doctrine, teaching that blood should not be eaten (circa 1927-31), Margaret Buber, who was never a member of the denomination, offered a firsthand eyewitness account of Jehovah's Witnesses in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]]. She relates that an overwhelming majority were willing to eat [[blood sausage]] despite having alternate food to choose from, and specifically after considering biblical statements regarding blood.&lt;ref&gt;Buber, M., Under Two Dictators, 1949 pp. 222, 235-237. Buber states the Jehovah's Witness prisoners all ate blood sausage, until around 1943. At that time she relates that 25 of the 275 Jehovah's Witness prisoners refused to eat blood sausage. She underlines the fact that this occurred in the presence of knowledge of Biblical statements regarding blood.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of doctrine ==
From 1931, when the name "Jehovah's witnesses" was adopted, Watch Tower Society publications maintained the view of Society founder [[Charles Taze Russell]] that the reference to abstaining from the eating of blood in the [[Council of Jerusalem|Apostolic Decree]] of Acts 15:19–29 was a "suggestion" to be given to [[Gentile]] converts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watch Tower'', November 15, 1892 p. 351, "It will be noticed that nothing is said about keeping the ten commandments, nor any part of the Jewish law. It was evidently taken for granted that having received the spirit of Christ the new law of love would be a general regulation for them. The things mentioned were merely to guard against stumbling themselves or becoming stumbling blocks to others."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watch Tower'', April 15, 1909 pp. 116-117, "These prohibitions had never come to the Gentiles, because they had never been under the Law Covenant; but so deeply rooted were the Jewish ideas on this subject that it was necessary to the peace of the Church that the Gentiles should observe this matter also ... these items thus superadded to the Law of Love should be observed by all spiritual Israelites as representing the Divine will."&lt;/ref&gt; Watch Tower publications during the presidency of [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] commended the commercial and emergency uses of blood.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age'', October 15, 1919 p. 47, "A serious difficulty which has been overcome in the use of plywood for airplanes construction was the making from blood of a glue that will stand any quantity of moisture without letting go…. In this plywood, stronger than steel, we have an illustration of how the Lord can take characters, weak in themselves, and surround them with such influence and so fortify them by his promises as to make them "mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds" of error and sin.—2 Cor. 10:4"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age'', December 17, 1924 p. 163, "Remarkable Tale of Womanly Heroism…. Fearing the death of the child, the woman deliberately cut her arms and breast with glass from the windshield to provide blood to keep the child alive during the cold nights. The child will recover, but the heroine is expected to die."&lt;/ref&gt; A 1925 issue of ''The Golden Age'' commended a man for donating blood 45 times without payment.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, July 29, 1925 p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, ''The Watchtower'' noted, without elaboration, that in Genesis 9, God decreed that [[Noah]] and his offspring "must not eat the blood, because the life is in the blood".&lt;ref&gt;"One Reason for God's Vengeance", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1927, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 ''Consolation'' magazine reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Consolation|date=December 25, 1940|page=19|quote=one of the attending physicians in the great emergency gave a quart of his own blood for transfusion, and today the woman lives and smiles gaily over what happened to her in the busiest 23 minutes of her life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, with the Watch Tower Society under the administration of president [[Nathan Homer Knorr]], ''The Watchtower'' asserted that the decrees contained in Genesis 9:4 and Leviticus 17:10–14 forbade the eating or drinking of blood in biblical times "whether by transfusion or by the mouth" and that this applied "in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as '[[Jehonadab|Jonadabs]]' of the Lord's 'other sheep'."&lt;ref&gt;"The Stranger's Right Maintained", ''The Watchtower'', December 1, 1944, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1945, representatives of the Watch Tower Society in the [[Netherlands]] commented on blood transfusion in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] edition of ''[[Awake!|Consolation]]''. A translation of their comments into English reads: {{quote|When we lose our life because we refuse inoculations, that does not bear witness as a justification of Jehovah's name. God never issued regulations which prohibit the use of drugs, inoculations or blood transfusions. It is an invention of people, who, like the Pharisees, leave Jehovah's mercy and love aside.&lt;ref&gt;''Vertroosting'' (''Consolation''), September 1945 p. 29, "Wanneer wij ons leven verliezen, doordat wij weigeren, inspuitingen te laten maken, dient zulks niet tot een getuigenis ter rechtvaardiging van Jehova's Naam. God heeft nooit bepalingen uitgevaardigd die het gebruik van medicijnen, inspuitingen of bloedtransfusie verbiedt. Het is een ultvinding van menschen, die gelijk de Farizeën Jehova's barmhartigheid laten."&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to sociologist Richard Singelenbreg, the statement appearing in the Dutch edition of ''Consolation'' may have been published without knowledge of the doctrinal position published in the English July 1945 issue of ''Consolation'' by the Watch Tower Society's headquarters in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''The Blood Transfusion Taboo of Jehovah's Witnesses: Origin, Development and Function of a Controversial Doctrine'', Social Science Medicine, Singelenbreg, R., 1990, Vol. 31, No. 4, p. 516.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, July 1, 1945, p. 198-201&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition did not specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, but by January 1961&amp;mdash;in what was later described as an application of "increased strictness"&lt;ref&gt;"Assume Your Christian Obligations", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1966, p. 142, "In the counsel from the pages of this magazine there has been a note of increased strictness with regard to pure worship, the placing of additional obligations on each one individually, strict counsel on morals, honesty, neutrality and such requirements as showing respect for the sanctity of blood."&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;it was ruled that it was a disfellowshipping offense to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', January 15, 1961, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Watch Tower publications warned that accepting a blood transfusion could prevent Witnesses from living eternally in God's new world, the hope held by members: "It may result in the immediate and very temporary prolongation of life, but that at the cost of eternal life for a dedicated Christian."&lt;ref&gt;''Blood, Medicine, and the Law of God'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 1961, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1956, ''Awake!'' stated, "certain blood fractions ... also come under the Scriptural ban".&lt;ref&gt;Awake!, September 8, 1956 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; A position against "the various blood fractions" was reiterated in September 1961.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, September 15, 1961, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; In November of the same year, the doctrine was modified to allow individual members to decide whether they could conscientiously accept fractions used from blood for purposes such as vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, November 1, 1961, p. 670&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been expanded on since; the pre-formatted Durable Power of Attorney form provided by the Watch Tower Society includes an option for Jehovah's Witnesses to "accept all fractions derived from any primary component of blood."&lt;ref&gt;Durable Power of Attorney form, published by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, January 2001 p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Jehovah's Witnesses were prohibited from obtaining transfusions for [[pet]]s, from using fertilizer containing blood, and were even advised (if their conscience troubled them) to write to dog food manufacturers to verify that their products were blood-free.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, February 15, 1964, p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, it was stated that doctors or nurses who are Jehovah's Witness would not administer blood transfusions to fellow dedicated members. As to administering transfusions to non-members, ''The Watchtower'' stated that such a decision is "left to the Christian doctor's own conscience."&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, November 15, 1964, p. 680-683&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, a ''Watchtower'' article declared that it would be wrong for a Witness to allow a leech to feed on his/her blood as part of a medical procedure, due to the sacredness of blood.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, June 15, 1982, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 ''The Watchtower'' stated, "Each individual must decide" whether to accept hemodilution and autologous blood salvage (cell saver) procedures.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, March 1, 1989 p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, a brochure entitled ''How Can Blood Save Your Life?'' was released, outlining Jehovah's Witnesses' general doctrine on blood.

In 2000, the Watch Tower Society's stand on blood fractions was clearly stated.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, June 15, 2000, p. 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; Members were instructed to personally decide if accepting a fraction would violate the doctrine on blood. In a later article, members were reminded that Jehovah's Witnesses do not donate blood or store their own blood prior to surgery.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, October 15, 2000, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, the Watch Tower Society revised its medical directives and identity cards addressing its doctrinal position on blood; the revised materials were distributed from May 3, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to All Presiding Overseers and Secretaries in the United States, Watchtower May 3, 2001, and Enclosure&lt;/ref&gt; These revised documents specified that "allogeneic blood transfusions" were unacceptable whereas the former document (dated 1999) stated that "blood transfusions" were unacceptable. The revised 2001 documents were active until December 20, 2001. The Watch Tower Society then rescinded the revised document, stating, "After further review, it has been determined that the cards dated "md-E 6/01" and "ic-E 6/01" should not be used. Please destroy these items and make sure that they are not distributed to the publishers." Elders were instructed to revert to the older 1999 edition of the medical directives and identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to All Presiding Overseers and Secretaries in the United States, Watchtower December 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Watch Tower Society publications frequently claim negative consequences of blood transfusions:
*A 1951 ''Watchtower'' declared: "And let the transfusion enthusiasts with a savior-complex ponder the fact that on many occasions transfusions do harm, spread disease, and frequently cause deaths, which, of course, are not publicized."&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, July 1, 1951, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1961 ''Watchtower'' quoted Brazilian surgeon Dr Américo Valério as saying transfusions were often followed by "moral insanity, sexual perversions, repression, inferiority complexes, petty crimes" and Dr Alonzo Jay Shadman claiming that a person's blood "contains all the peculiarities of the individual ... [including] hereditary taints, disease susceptibilities, poisons due to personal living, eating and drinking habits ... The poisons that produce the impulse to commit suicide, murder, or steal are in the blood."&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, September 15, 1961, p. 563-564&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1969 ''Awake!'' reported on a man named Robert Khoury, who, after receiving a blood transfusion said, "When I recovered I found I had a terrible desire to steal."&lt;ref&gt;Awake!, July 8, 1969, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1974 ''Awake!'' cited a [[Centers for Disease Control]] report that as many as 35,000 deaths and 500,000 illnesses a year might be due to the presence of serum hepatitis in blood for transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', May 22, 1974, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2006 ''Awake!'' highlighted dangers from transfusion-related acute lung injury ([[TRALI]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical views ==

Opposition to the Watch Tower doctrines on blood transfusions has come from both members and non-members. A group of dissident Witnesses known as Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood (AJWRB) states that there is no biblical basis for the prohibition of blood transfusions and seeks to have some policies changed.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Elder, "Why some Jehovah's Witnesses accept blood and conscientiously reject official Watchtower Society blood policy", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 2000, Vol.26, pages 375-380.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of articles in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'' US neurologist Osamu Muramoto, who is a medical adviser to the AJWRB, has raised issues including what he claims is coercion to refuse transfusions, doctrinal inconsistency, selective use of information by the Watch Tower Society to exaggerate the dangers of transfusions and the use of outdated medical beliefs.

===Coercion===

Osamu Muramoto has argued that the refusal by Jehovah's Witnesses of "life-saving" blood treatment&lt;ref name="Bio3"&gt;{{cite journal |pages= 463–8 | pmc=479294 | pmid=10635499 | volume=25 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 3. A proposal for a don't-ask-don't-tell policy | year=1999 | journal=J Med Ethics | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.25.6.463}}&lt;/ref&gt; creates serious bio-medical ethical issues. He has criticized the "controlling intervention" of the Watch Tower Society by means of what he claims is information control and its policy of penalising members who accept blood transfusions or advocate freedom to choose blood-based treatment.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio3" /&gt; He says the threat of being classified as a disassociated Witness and subsequently shunned by friends and relatives who are members coerces Jehovah's Witnesses to accept and obey the prohibition on blood transfusions.&lt;ref name="BMJOM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2. A novel approach based on rational non-interventional paternalism | journal=J Med Ethics | page=296 | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.24.5.295 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one particular case involving a Russian district court decision, however, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) found nothing in the judgments to suggest that any form of improper pressure or undue influence was applied. It noted: "On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation." The court said: "The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=869647&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=ECHR Point number 136, 139 |access-date=2010-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526123653/http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=869647&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |archive-date=2011-05-26 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muramoto has claimed the intervention of Hospital Liaison Committees can add to "organisational pressure" applied by family members, friends and congregation members on Witness patients to refuse blood-based treatment. He notes that while HLC members, who are church elders, "may give the patient 'moral support', the influence of their presence on the patient is known to be tremendous. Case reports reveal JW patients have changed their earlier decision to accept blood treatment after a visit from the elders." He claims such organizational pressure compromises the autonomy of Witness patients and interferes with their privacy and confidentiality. He has advocated a policy in which the Watch Tower organization and congregation elders would not question patients on the details of their medical care and patients would not disclose such information. He says the Society adopted such a policy in 1983 regarding details of sexual activity between married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 479294 | pmid=10635499 | volume=25 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 3.

Watch Tower spokesman Donald T. Ridley says neither elders nor HLC members are instructed or encouraged to probe into the health care decisions of Witness patients and do not involve themselves in patient hospitalisations unless patients request their assistance. Yet Watchtower HLC representative David Malyon says he would respond to "sin" of Witnesses he is privy to by effectively saying "Are you going to tell them or shall I!"&lt;ref name="Malyon2"&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=479136 | pmid=9873976 | volume=24 | title=Transfusion-free treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses: respecting the autonomous patient's motives | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=376–81 | last1 = Malyon | first1 = D | doi=10.1136/jme.24.6.376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless Ridley says Muramoto's suggestion that Witnesses should be free to disregard Watch Tower scriptural teachings and standards is preposterous. He says loving God means obeying commandments, not disobeying them and hiding one's disobedience from others.&lt;ref name="irish" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1388640 Donald T. Ridley, "Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal of blood: obedience to scripture and religious conscience", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 1999, Vol. 25, page 471.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716113512/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1388640 |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muramoto recommends doctors have a private meeting with patients to discuss their wishes, and that church elders and family members not be present, enabling patients to feel free of church pressure. He suggests doctors question patients on (a) whether they have considered that the Watch Tower Society might soon approve some medical practices they currently find objectionable, in the same manner that it has previously abandoned its opposition to vaccination and organ transplants; (b) whether Witness patients know which blood components are allowed and which are prohibited, and whether they acknowledge that those rulings are organizational policy rather than biblical teachings; and (c) whether they realize that although some Bible scriptures proscribe the eating of blood, eating and transfusing blood have entirely different effects on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2. A novel approach based on rational non-interventional paternalism | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=298–9 | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.24.5.295 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; English HLC representative David Malyon has responded that Muramoto's suggested questions are an affront to coerce Jehovah's Witnesses with "complicated philosophical inquisition" and, if used by doctors, would be "an abusive transformation of the medical role of succour and care into that of devil's advocate and trickster".&lt;ref name="Malyon2" /&gt;

===Selective use of information===

Muramoto has claimed many Watch Tower Society publications employ exaggeration and emotionalism to emphasize the dangers of transfusions and the advantages of alternative treatments, but present a distorted picture by failing to report any benefits of blood-based treatment. Nor do its publications acknowledge that in some situations, including rapid and massive [[haemorrhage]], there are no alternatives to blood transfusions.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | page= 301 | pmc=1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2. A novel approach based on rational non-interventional paternalism | journal=J Med Ethics | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.24.5.295 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims Watch Tower Society publications often discuss the risk of death as a result of refusing blood transfusions, but give little consideration to the prolonged suffering and disability, producing an added burden on family and society, that can result from refusal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2. A novel approach based on rational non-interventional paternalism | journal=J Med Ethics | page=298 | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.24.5.295 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney and former Witness Kerry Louderback-Wood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://marshall-attorneys.com/Press/2006_01_26_NYT.htm |title="Religion Today", ''New York Times'', January 6, 2006 |access-date=2010-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427200056/http://www.marshall-attorneys.com/Press/2006_01_26_NYT.htm |archive-date=2010-04-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also claims that Witness publications exaggerate the medical risks of taking blood and the efficiency of non-blood medical therapies in critical situations.&lt;ref name="Kerry"&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses, Blood Transfusions and the Tort of Misrepresentation", ''Journal of Church and State'', Autumn 2005, Volume 47, Number 4, p. 808: "[The Watchtower Society] builds a case that other doctors wish all surgeons would become bloodless surgeons, when in fact those doctors recognize the benefits of blood transfusions for those who are in desperate need."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas E. Cowan]], an academic in the sociology of religion, has claimed that members of the [[Christian countercult movement]] who criticize the Watch Tower Society, make selective use of information themselves. For example, [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] Richard Abanes wrote that their ban on blood transfusions, "has led to countless Witness deaths over the years, including many children."&lt;ref&gt;''Cults, New Religious Movements, and Your Family: A Guide to Ten Non-Christian Groups Out to Convert Your Loved Ones'' p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Cowan wrote: "When the careful reader checks [Abanes' footnote], however, looking perhaps for some statistical substantiation, he or she finds only a statistical conjecture based on 1980 Red Cross blood use figures."&lt;!--"the careful reader"? Do we have a less weaselly example??--&gt; Cowan also says Abanes omits "critical issues" in an attempt to "present the most negative face possible." Cowan wrote that "the reader is left with the impression that the Watchtower Society knowingly presides over a substantial number of preventable deaths each year."&lt;!--Does Cowan go on to say that is not actually the case? Otherwise, what is the point of including the statement?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bearing False Witness? An Introduction to the Christian Countercult'' p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdated medical beliefs===

Osamu Muramoto says the Watch Tower Society relies on discarded, centuries-old medical beliefs to support its assertion that blood transfusions are the same as eating blood.&lt;ref name="eatblood"&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures,'' Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1990 Watch Tower brochure on blood quoted a 17th-century anatomist to support its view.&lt;ref&gt;''How Can Blood Save Your Life?'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1990, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Muramoto says the view that blood is nourishment—still espoused in Watch Tower publications&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, page 70.&lt;/ref&gt;—was abandoned by modern medicine many decades ago.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He has criticized an analogy commonly used by the Society&lt;ref&gt;The analogy is used in ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 1969, page 326, ''The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life'', (1981, pg 167), ''Reasoning From the Scriptures'' (1989, pg 73), ''You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth'' (1989, pg 216), ''Yearbook'' (1989, pg 57), ''What Does the Bible Teach'' (2005, pg 130) and ''Awake!'', August 2006, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; in which it states: "Consider a man who is told by the doctor that he must abstain from alcohol. Would he be obedient if he quit drinking alcohol but had it put directly into his veins?"&lt;ref name="eatblood" /&gt; Muramoto says the analogy is false, explaining: "Orally ingested alcohol is absorbed as alcohol and circulated as such in the blood, whereas orally eaten blood is digested and does not enter the circulation as blood. Blood introduced directly into the veins circulates and functions as blood, not as nutrition. Hence, blood transfusion is a form of cellular organ transplantation. And ... organ transplants are now permitted by the WTS."&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He says the objection to blood transfusions on the basis of biblical proscriptions against eating blood is similar to the refusal of a heart transplant on the basis that a doctor warned a patient to abstain from eating meat because of his high cholesterol level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2. A novel approach based on rational non-interventional paternalism | journal=J Med Ethics | page=299 | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.24.5.295 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Malyon, chairman of the English Hospital Liaison Committee in [[Luton]], [[England]], has claimed that Muramoto's discussion of the differences between consuming blood and alcohol is pedantic and says blood laws in the Bible are based upon the reverence for life and its association with blood, and that laws should be kept in the spirit as much as in the letter.&lt;ref name="Malyon2"/&gt;

===Inconsistency===
{{See also|Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses#Blood}}

Muramoto has described as peculiar and inconsistent the Watch Tower policy of acceptance of all the individual components of blood plasma as long as they are not taken at the same time.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He says the Society offers no biblical explanation for differentiating between prohibited treatments and those considered a "matter of conscience", explaining the distinction is based entirely on arbitrary decisions of the [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]], to which Witnesses must adhere strictly on the premise of them being Bible-based "truth".&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He has questioned why white blood cells (1 per cent of blood volume) and platelets (0.17 per cent) are forbidden, yet albumin (2.2 per cent of blood volume) is permitted.&lt;ref name="Muramoto1" /&gt; He has questioned why donating blood and storing blood for autologous transfusion is deemed wrong, but the Watch Tower Society permits the use of blood components that must be donated and stored before Witnesses use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377601 | pmid=9800583 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 2. A novel approach based on rational non-interventional paternalism | journal=J Med Ethics | page=300 | vauthors=Muramoto O | doi=10.1136/jme.24.5.295 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has questioned why Witnesses, although viewing blood as sacred and symbolizing life, are prepared to let a person die by placing more importance on the symbol than the reality it symbolizes.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Kerry Louderback-Wood alleges that by labeling the currently acceptable blood fractions as "minute" in relation to whole blood, the Watch Tower organization causes followers to misunderstand the scope and extent of allowed fractions.&lt;ref name="Kerry" /&gt;

Witnesses respond that the real issue is not of the fluid ''per se'', but of respect and obedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' November 1, 1961 p. 669 Questions From Readers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'' 2005 P.128&lt;/ref&gt; They say their principle of abstaining from blood as a display of respect is demonstrated by the fact that members are allowed to eat [[meat]] that still contains some blood. As soon as blood is drained from an animal, the ''respect'' has been shown to God, and then a person can eat the meat even though it may contain a small amount of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=1 November 1961|page=669|title=Questions From Readers|quote=The important thing is that respect has been shown for the sanctity of blood, regard has been shown for the principle of the sacredness of life. What God's law requires is that the blood be drained from the animal when it is killed, not that the meat be soaked in some special preparation to draw out every trace of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses' view of meat and blood is different from that of kosher Jewish adherents, who go to great lengths to remove minor traces of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=122 |title=OK Kosher Certification — Salting of Meat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520171638/http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=122 |archive-date=2007-05-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/Kashrut/Overview_Kosher_Food/Kosher_Meat/Making_Meat_Kosher.htm My Jewish Learning: Making Meat Kosher&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225165156/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/Kashrut/Overview_Kosher_Food/Kosher_Meat/Making_Meat_Kosher.htm |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johan Vilhelm Snellman''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈjuːhan ˈvɪlːhɛlm ˈsnɛlːman|-|Sv-Johan_Vilhelm_Snellman.ogg|pronunciation}}; 12 May 1806, [[Stockholm]] – 4 July 1881, [[Kirkkonummi]]) was an influential [[Fennoman]] philosopher and [[Finland|Finnish]] [[wikt:statesman|statesman]], [[ennoble]]d in 1866.

Snellman was born in Stockholm, [[Sweden]], the son of Kristian Henrik Snellman, a ship's captain. After the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] conquest of  [[Finland]] in 1808–09, and the promising establishment of the semi-autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], his family moved there in 1813, to the [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnian]] coastal town of [[Kokkola]], where his mother Maria Magdalena Snellman died only a year later.

In 1835, after academic work amongst followers of [[Hegel]], Snellman was appointed lecturer at the [[University of Helsinki]], where he belonged to the famous circle of [[Fredrik Cygnaeus|Cygnaeus]], [[Elias Lönnrot|Lönnrot]], &lt;!-- Nordström, Nervander, --&gt; and [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg|Runeberg]] comprising the brightest of their generation. Snellman's lectures quickly became popular with the students, but in November 1838 his lectureship was temporarily recalled after a judicial proceeding that ultimately aimed to establish firm governmental control of new and oppositional thought among the academics.

As a consequence Snellman exiled himself to Sweden and Germany, more or less voluntarily, from 1839 to 1842. By the time he returned to Helsinki, his popularity had increased further, but the political juncture did not allow the university to employ him. Instead, he took up the position as headmaster for [[Kuopion Lyseon lukio|a school]] in distant [[Kuopio]] and published starkly polemical periodicals, including the paper ''Saima'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], which advocated the duty of the educated classes to take up the language of the then circa 85% majority of Finns, and develop [[Finnish language|Finnish]] into a language of the civilized world,{{attribution needed|date=January 2013}} useful for academic works, fine arts, state craft, and [[nation building]].

''Saima'' was suppressed by the government in 1846. In 1848–49, Snellman was again rebuffed when applying for the position of professor at Finland's University in Helsinki. After having contemplated a renewed exile in Sweden, this time possibly definitive, Snellman in 1850 gave up the position in Kuopio and moved to Helsinki, where he and his family lived under economically awkward conditions until the death of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor Nicholas]] in 1855, when it again became possible for Snellman to publish periodical papers on political issues.

In 1856, Snellman was finally appointed professor, which was met with great satisfaction among politically interested Finns. However, Snellman's unparalleled popularity could not remain. He was a generation older than the most active political opposition, and now a man of the government who had the brightest expectations for Finland under the rule of [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]]. The [[language strife in Finland]], which he was the chief initiator of, contributed also to substantial opposition against him and his views, and finally not the least his stance against the [[Poland|Polish]] rebels of the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 was seen by many as the ultimate sign of unprincipled ingratiation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1863 Snellman was called to a cabinet post in the [[Senate of Finland]], in effect as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he became an energetic and valued senator, accomplishing a ''language decree'' from the Emperor that would gradually give Finnish a position equal to that of Swedish within the Finnish government, and thereby practically in Finland at large, the re-establishment of the Parliament, which had remained inhibited since the Russian conquest. 

Separate Finnish [[currency]], the [[Finnish markka|Markka]], was introduced in 1860, and Snellman managed to tie it to silver instead of to the [[Russian ruble|ruble]].&lt;ref name="snellmanbiografia"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/3639 |title= Snellman, Johan Vilhelm (1806 - 1881) |last1=Klinge |first1= Matti|date= |website= The National Biography of Finland |publisher= |access-date=24 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Markka came to be of the utmost value for Finland. Snellman's tenure as Finance Minister would be tainted by the [[Finnish famine of 1866–1868]], aggravated by the government's strict [[fiscal policy]], but Snellman worked to get aid while trying to protect the new currency.&lt;ref name="snellmanbiografia" /&gt;

Snellman's inflexibility and high prolific position in the political debate would however, together with his old reputation as radical agitator of the 1830s–1840s, accumulate too much resistance and aversion to his person and his policies. In 1868 he was forced to resign from the senate.

For the remainder of his life, he continued to participate in the political debate, and now ennobled he belonged to the Nobles' Chamber of the parliament. Snellman never lost in popularity among his Fennoman followers, but he had become a highly divisive symbol in Finland's political landscape.

Johan Vilhelm Snellman first appeared on a 1960 coin, commemorating the introduction of the [[markka]] denomination in 1860. He was recently selected as the main motif for another commemorative coin, the €10 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2006 coinage|Johan Vilhelm Snellman commemorative coin]], minted in 2006 celebrating the 200th anniversary of his birth. The obverse depicts J.V. Snellman. It also depicts the logo of the Europe Coins Programme. The reverse design features represent the dawn of Finnish culture.

== Works ==
In 1842 Snellman published his foremost work ''Läran om staten'' (''Study of the State'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3497">The '''John Stuart Mill Institute''' is a non-governmental, Heidelberg-based research institute founded in 2009 and named after [[John Stuart Mill]], an influential 19th-century English philosopher and politician.
His main work “On Liberty”, published in 1859, forms the basis for the institutes aim and mission:

“The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it.”

Accordingly, the institute performs research into and promotes the concept of individual freedom and liberalism as an independent [[think tank]] and general advisor to all levels of society. As such, it is unique and the only one of its kind in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/die-welt/debatte/article6034934/Freiheit-ist-der-Motor-unserer-Zivilisation.html/ article “DIE WELT”; 30.01.2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key aspects of activity==

*	research and advocacy on political, academic and private freedom
*	studies/research projects into declining civil rights and liberty in developed societies, particularly Germany in comparison to other countries
*	serve as mediator/facilitator for freedom research in Germany and abroad
*	engage in national and international cooperation with public and private partners, scientific institutes and any interested research/educational facilities
*	advisory role for political and economic institutes including management training, teaching at universities etc.

==Governance==

The institute is integrated into one of the biggest and oldest private universities of applied sciences in Germany, the SRH in Heidelberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hochschule-heidelberg.de/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016032615/http://www.hochschule-heidelberg.de/en/ |archivedate=2014-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The head of the John Stuart Mill Institute is Prof. Ulrike Ackermann. All members of the scientific advisory board are renowned individuals, such as: Detmar Doering (philosopher and historian, currently head of the [[Friedrich Naumann Foundation]]); Karen Horn (economist, head of the [[Institute of German Economy]], Berlin); Robert Nef (head of the [[Liberales Institut|Institute of Liberalism, Zürich]]); Prof. Gerhard Schulze (sociologist, [[University of Bamberg]]); Prof. Edgar Wolfrum (historian, [[University of Heidelberg]]); Prof. Michael Zöller (political scientist, [[University of Bayreuth]]/ member of the Council on public policies).

==Funding==

The John Stuart Mill Institute is an independent research and teaching organization that engages and advises to all levels of modern society. It is non-partisan and its views are not aligned with any political party. As such, the institute does not perform contract research nor does it accept government funding. Initially founded by generous support from the SRH Heidelberg, its future revenues will largely dependent on private contributions.

'''''{{lang|fr|Jurisprudence constante}}''''' ([[French language|French]] for "stable jurisprudence", or literally, "constant jurisprudence") is a [[legal doctrine]] according to which a long series of previous decisions applying a particular legal principle or [[rule of law|rule]] is highly [[Precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive]] but not controlling in subsequent [[legal case|cases]] dealing with similar or identical issues of law&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in the case of French administrative law, see CE, July 13th 2016, ''[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/Decisions-Avis-Publications/Decisions/Selection-des-decisions-faisant-l-objet-d-une-communication-particuliere/CE-13-juillet-2016-departement-de-la-Seine-Saint-Denis Département de la Seine-Saint-Denis]'',
N° 388317, §5 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;.  This doctrine is recognized in most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s as well as in certain mixed jurisdictions, e.g., [[law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].

The rule of law applied in the ''{{lang|fr|jurisprudence constante}}'' directly compares with ''{{lang|la|[[stare decisis]]}}''. But the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] notes the principal difference between the two legal doctrines: a single [[legal opinion|court decision]] can provide sufficient foundation for ''{{lang|la|stare decisis}}'', however, "a
series of [[case law|adjudicated cases]], all in accord, form the basis for ''{{lang|fr|jurisprudence constante}}''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants = Willis-Knighton Med. Ctr. v.

'''Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlaxman|lang}}; 4 March 1793 – 13 March 1851) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philologist]] and [[critic]]. He is particularly noted for his foundational contributions to the field of [[textual criticism]].

==Biography==

Lachmann was born in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], in present-day [[Lower Saxony]]. He studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], devoting himself mainly to philological studies. In [[Göttingen]], he founded a critical and philological society in 1811, in conjunction with [[Georg Ludolf Dissen|Dissen]], [[Ernst Schulze (poet)|Schulze]], and [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen|Bunsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ADB|17|471|481|Lachmann, Karl|Wilhelm Scherer|ADB:Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, he joined the [[Prussian army]] as a volunteer ''[[chasseur]]'' and accompanied his detachment to [[Paris]], but did not see active service. In 1816, he became an assistant master in the Friedrichswerder [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at Berlin, and a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the university. The same summer he became one of the principal masters in the Friedrichs-Gymnasium of [[Königsberg]], where he assisted his colleague, the Germanist [[Friedrich Karl Köpke]], with his edition of [[Rudolf von Ems]]' ''[[Barlaam und Josaphat]]'' (1818), and also assisted his friend in a contemplated edition of the works of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

In January 1818, he became professor extraordinarius of classical philology in the [[University of Königsberg]], and at the same time began to lecture on [[Old German]] [[grammar]] and the [[Middle High German]] poets. He devoted himself during the following seven years to an extraordinarily detailed study of those subjects, and in 1824, obtained a leave of absence in order to search the libraries of middle and south Germany for further materials.

In 1825, Lachmann was nominated extraordinary professor of classical and German philology at the [[Humboldt University]], Berlin (ordinary professor 1827); in 1830, he was admitted a member of the [[Academy of Sciences]]. He died in [[Berlin]].

==Importance in scholarship==

Lachmann is a figure of considerable importance in the history of German philology.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rudolf von Raumer]], ''Geschichte der germanischen Philologie'', 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, Lachmann translated the first volume of P.E. Müller's ''Sagabibliothek des skandinavischen Altertums'' (1816). In his ''"Habilitationsschrift" über die ursprungliche Gestalt des Gedichts von der Nibelungen Noth'' (1816), and in his review of [[Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen|Hagen]]'s ''Nibelungen'' and [[Georg Friedrich Benecke|Benecke]]'s ''Bonerius'', contributed in 1817 to the ''Jenaische Literaturzeitung'', he had already laid down the rules of [[textual criticism]] and elucidated the phonetic and metrical principles of Middle High German in a manner which marked a distinct advance in that branch of investigation.

The rigidly scientific character of his method becomes increasingly apparent in the ''Auswahl aus den hochdeutschen Dichtern des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts'' (1820); in the edition of [[Hartmann von Aue|Hartmann]]'s ''Iwein'' (1827); in those of Walther von der Vogelweide (1827) and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] (1833); in the papers "''Über das [[Hildebrandslied]]''," "''Über althochdeutsche Betonung und Verskunst''," "''Über den Eingang des Parzivals''," and "''Über drei Bruchstücke niederrheinischer Gedichte''" published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy; and in ''Der Nibelunge Not und die Klage'' (1826), which was followed by a critical commentary in 1836.

Lachmann's ''Betrachtungen über Homer's Iliad'', first published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841, in which he sought to show that the ''[[Iliad]]'' consists of eighteen independent "layers" variously enlarged and interpolated, had considerable influence on 19th century [[Homeric scholarship]], although his views are no longer accepted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

His smaller edition of the [[New Testament]] appeared in 1831, the 3rd edition in 1846, and the larger second edition, in two volumes, between 1842 and 1850. The plan of Lachmann's edition, which he explained in his ''Studia Krit.'' of 1830, is a modification of the unaccomplished project of [[Richard Bentley]]. Lachmann was the first major editor to break from the [[Textus Receptus]], seeking to restore the most ancient reading current in [[manuscript]]s of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], using the agreement of the [[Western text-type|Western]] authorities ([[Old Latin]] and Greek Western [[Uncial]]s) as the main proof of antiquity of a reading where the oldest Alexandrian authorities differ.

Lachmann's edition of [[Lucretius]] (1850), which was the principal occupation of his life from 1845, is perhaps his greatest achievement of scholarship. He demonstrated how the three main manuscripts all derived from one [[archetype]], containing 302 pages of 26 lines to a page. Further, he was able to show that this archetype was a copy of a manuscript written in a [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] hand, which was in turn a copy of a manuscript of the 4th or 5th centuries written in [[rustic capitals]]. To say his recreation of the text was accepted is anticlimactic; [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro|HAJ Munro]] characterized this accomplishment as "a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied." Lachmann also edited [[Propertius]] (1816); [[Catullus]] (1829); [[Tibullus]] (1829); [[Joseph Genesius|Genesius]] (1834); [[Terentianus Maurus]] (1836); [[Babrius]] (1845); [[Avianus]] (1845); [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (1841–1842); the ''Agrimensores Romani'' (1848–1852); and [[Lucilius]] (edited after his death by [[Johannes Vahlen|Vahlen]], 1876). He also translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s sonnets (1820) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1829).

==Definition of meta-functional expertise==
'''Meta-functional expertise''' is the breadth of one’s strategically important knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Bunderson, J. S. (2003). Team member functional background and involvement in management teams: Direct effects and the moderating role of power centralization. ''The Academy of Management Journal'', 458–474.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is different from the traditional conceptualization of [[expertise]], which is generally considered to be a great depth of knowledge in a defined area.  Thus, [[experts]] are people who are distinguished as knowing a lot about a particular subject.

'''Meta-functional experts''', on the other hand, are considered be somewhat knowledgeable in many different areas but not necessarily an [[expert]] in any single domain.  Someone high on '''meta-functional expertise''' is similar to a [[wikt:Special:Search/generalist|generalist]] in that they have a wide array of knowledge.  However, where generalists know many different things '''meta-functional experts''' have enough depth of knowledge in each area to be considered knowledgeable by other members of their team at work.&lt;ref&gt;:  Bunderson, JS., &amp; Sutcliffe, KM.  2002.   Comparing Alternative Conceptualizations of Functional Diversity in Management Teams: Process and Performance Effects.  '''The Academy of Management Journal'''   45(5):  875-893&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results of meta-functional expertise==
Individuals high on '''meta-functional''' expertise are: 
*better able to acquire  [[social power]] at work because they can translate between [[wikt:Specialist|specialist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bunderson, J. S. (2003). Team member functional background and involvement in management teams: Direct effects and the moderating role of power centralization. ''The Academy of Management Journal'', 458–474&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dahlander, L. &amp; O’Mahony, S.  2011. Progressing to the Center: Coordinating Project Work.  '''Organization Science'''.  22(4):  961-979&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4284">'''Muhamed Filipović''' (born 3 August 1929 in Banja Luka, Yugoslavia) is a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[philosopher]], [[politician]], writer and one of the most prominent Bosniak [[historian]]s. In 1960 he graduated from the Faculty of Arts and attained his [[PhD]]. As a young person he took part in the communist overtake of power and partisan army in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Intervju/Muhamed Filipović za press: Alija je upropastio Bošnjake, napravivši katastrofalnu grešku odlukom da se BiH odvoji od Jugoslavije |url=http://www.republikainfo.com/vijesti/1177-intervjumuhamed-filipovic-za-press-alija-je-upropastio-bosnjake-napravivsi-katastrofalnu-gresku-odlukom-da-se-bih-odvoji-od-jugoslavije.html |work=Republika |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a professor at the Faculty of Phylosophy at the [[University of Sarajevo]]. He has published fifty six books, some of which have been translated into other languages.

He is seen by many as one of the leading early 21st century Bosniak academics.&lt;ref name="Halilovich2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hariz Halilovich|title=Places of Pain: Forced Displacement, Popular Memory and Trans-local Identities in Bosnian War-torn Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VlFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120|date=15 January 2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-777-6|pages=120–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

He is a founder and leader of the [[Muslim Bosniak Organization]] (MBO).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} At the beginning of the [[Party of Democratic Action]] (SDA, est. 1990), the party also included a very influential [[Bosnian nationalism|secular nationalist]] grouping, led by [[Adil Zulfikarpašić]] and Muhamed Filipović.&lt;ref name="Kostić2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roland Kostić|title=Ambivalent Peace: External Peacebuilding Threatened Identity and Reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-qjT00IDIQC&amp;pg=PA69|year=2007|publisher=Ambivalent Peace|isbn=978-91-506-1950-8|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He led a delegation and negotiated both with presidents of Croatia and Slovenia republics in SFRY, who invited Bosnia to join them on the planned path to secession, and later in June 1991, on behalf of SDA president [[Alija Izetbegović]], Zulfikarpašić and Filipović met with SDS president [[Radovan Karadžić]], [[Nikola Koljević]] and [[Momčilo Krajišnik]] to [[Zulfikarpašić–Karadžić agreement|discuss the future status]] of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. He then met with representatives of Serbia who invited Bosnia to stay. Both proposals were rejected by Muslim leaders at the time. He considered especially tragic that proposal to stay in Yugoslavia together with Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro was rejected by [[Alija Izetbegović]], after very successful negotiations with [[Slobodan Milosevic]], who agreed to all of his numerous demands - from Bosniak president and army chief of Yugoslavia to preserving unity of Bosnia within Yugoslavia. The proposal was eventually rejected in the last moment by a telegram from the Muslim party SDA, leading ultimately to war after another rejection of [[Peace plans proposed before and during the Bosnian War|Carrington-Cutileiro plan]], at the beginning of 1992, this time on the push from USA.

During the [[Bosnian War]], he was the ambassador to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="OgnjenovićJozelić2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gorana Ognjenović|author2=Jasna Jozelić|title=Politicization of Religion, the Power of State, Nation, and Faith: The Case of Former Yugoslavia and Its Successor States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb2YBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|date=17 December 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-47786-6|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistic typology topics}}

'''Nominative–accusative languages''', or '''nominative languages''' have a form of [[morphosyntactic alignment]] in which subjects of [[transitive verb|transitive]] and [[intransitive verb]]s are distinguished from objects of transitive verbs by [[word order]], [[grammatical case|case]]-marking, and/or verb [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]. [[English language|English]] is a nominative-accusative language.

Nominative–accusative alignment can be realized through [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], by visible coding properties, and/or [[syntax]], by behavioral properties during participation in specific constructions. That type of alignment has a broad global distribution and is one of the major alignment systems characterizing a critical portion of the world’s languages.

A transitive verb is associated with two noun phrases (or [[verb argument|arguments]]): a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and a [[direct object]]. An intransitive verb is associated with only one argument, a subject.

Nominative–accusative alignment uses the same coding system for subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs and a different coding system for direct objects of transitive verbs. The different kinds of arguments are represented as A, S, and O. A is the subject (or most [[agent (grammar)|agent-like]]) argument of a transitive verb, O is the direct object, (or most [[patient (grammar)|patient-like]]) argument of a transitive verb, and S is the sole argument of an intransitive verb.

==Compared to ergative–absolutive==

! '''Nominative–accusative'''
|-
! '''O'''
| same || different
|-
! '''S'''
| same || same
|-
! '''A'''
| different || same
|}

Nominative–accusative languages contrast with [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] languages, which use an alignment system that codes subjects of transitive verbs differently from subjects of intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. In an ergative–absolutive system, A is coded as [[ergative case|ergative]] while S and O are coded as [[absolutive case|absolutive]].

===Split ergativity===
It is common for languages (such as [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]] and [[Standard Hindi]]) to have overlapping alignment systems, which exhibit both nominative–accusative and ergative–absolutive coding, a phenomenon called [[split ergativity]]. In fact, there are relatively few languages that exhibit only ergative–absolutive alignment (called pure ergativity) and tend to be isolated in certain regions of the world, such as the [[Caucasus]], parts of [[North America]] and [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Tibetan Plateau]], and [[Australia]]. Such languages include [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Standard Tibetan]], and [[Mayan language|Mayan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Syntax|first1=Robert D.|last1= Van Valin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2001|ISBN=9780521635660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coding properties of accusativity==
In a nominative–accusative language, accusativity can manifest itself in visible ways, called coding properties. Often, these visible properties are morphological and the distinction will appear as a difference in the actual morphological form and spelling of the word, or as case particles (pieces of morphology) which will appear before or after the word.

===Case marking===
If a language exhibits morphological case marking, arguments S and A will appear in the [[nominative case]] and argument O will appear in the [[accusative case]], or in a similar case such as the [[oblique case|oblique]]. There may be more than one case fulfilling the accusative role; for instance, [[Finnish language|Finnish]] marks objects with the [[partitive case|partitive]] or the [[accusative case|accusative]] to contrast [[telicity]]. It is highly common for only accusative arguments to exhibit overt case marking while nominative arguments exhibit null (or absent) case markings. The last examples of Tamil and Hindi show the overt and null case marking distinctions.

:‘He saw the boy’

====Differential object marking (DOM)====
Not all arguments are equally likely to exhibit overt case marking. In fact, it is crosslinguistically common to divide direct objects into two classes (with respect to overt case marking), a phenomenon called ‘differential object marking’ by Bossong (1985). A direct object that is higher in prominence is more likely to be overtly case-marked.&lt;ref name=aissenthree&gt;Aissen, Judith. (2003) "Differential Object marking: Iconicity vs. Economy." ''Natural Language and Linguistic Theory''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "prominence" is evaluated in the following ways:&lt;ref name=aissenthree/&gt;
:[[Animacy]] Scale:  ''human → animate → inanimate''
:[[Definiteness]] Scale:  ''personal pronoun → proper name → definite NP → indefinite specific NP → non-specific NP''

These scales are also reflected in [[Michael Silverstein|Silverstein]]’s person/animacy hierarchy.&lt;ref name=silverstein&gt;Silverstein, Michael. (1976) "Hierarchy of Features and Ergativity". In R. M. W. Dixon (ed.) ''Grammatical Categories in Australian Languages''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In languages like [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kazakh language]] and [[Sakha language|Sakha]], more "prominent" objects take an overt accusative marker while nonspecific ones do not. Lack of an overt case marker can restrict an object's [[word order|distribution]] in the sentence.&lt;ref name=vdv&gt;van de Visser, Mario. (2006) "The Marked Status of Ergativity". PhD. Dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; Those orders are permitted in Sakha if accusative case is overtly expressed:

[[Sakha language|Sakha]]
:a. кини яблоко-ну сии-р-∅
:a. kini yabloko-nu sii-r-∅&lt;ref name=vdv/&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;[[Nominative case|NOM]]&lt;/small&gt; apple-&lt;small&gt;[[Accusative case|ACC]]&lt;/small&gt; eat
:’She/he is eating the/a (particular) apple.’

:b. яблоко-ну кини сии-р-∅
:b. yabloko-nu kini sii-r-∅

:c. кини сии-р-∅ яблоко-ну
:c. kini sii-r-∅ yabloko-nu

:d. кини яблоко-ну бүгүн сии-р-∅
:d. kini yabloko-nu bügün sii-r-∅	
:&lt;small&gt;[[Nominative case|NOM]]&lt;/small&gt; apple-&lt;small&gt;[[Accusative case|ACC]]&lt;/small&gt; today eat
:‘She/he is eating the/a (particular) apple today.’

However, when the object is nonspecific, alternative ordering is not permitted:
Sakha
:a. кини яблоко сии-р-∅
:a. kini yabloko sii-r-∅&lt;ref name=vdv/&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;[[Nominative case|NOM]]&lt;/small&gt; apple eat
:’She/he is eating some apple or other.’

:b. яблоко кини сии-р-∅
:b. yabloko kini sii-r-∅

:c. кини сии-р-∅ яблоко
:c. kini sii-r-∅ yabloko

:d. кини яблоко бүгүн сии-р-∅
:d. kini yabloko bügün sii-r-∅	
:&lt;small&gt;[[Nominative case|NOM]]&lt;/small&gt; apple today eat
:‘She/he is eating some apple or other today.’

When the direct object is low on the definiteness scale, it must directly precede the verb, whereas alternative ordering is possible when the direct object is higher in prominence. It is important to note that notions of prominence (animacy and definiteness) and the boundaries between one tier of prominence and another may vary from culture to culture. In [[German language|German]], for example, accusative case is always overt on arguments with masculine gender.

====Differential subject marking (DSM)====
Case-marking is one of the formal guises of DSM, along with agreement, inverse systems and voice alterations, which goes hand in hand with DSM. The use of case marking on subject is to differentiate prominence in arguments.&lt;ref name=hoopswart&gt;{{cite book|title=Differential Subject Marking.|first1=Helen|last1= de Hoop|first2= Peter|last2= de Swart|publisher=Springer|year= 2009|ISBN=978-1-4020-6497-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used on subjects of transitive verbs and intransitive verbs. The definiteness and animacy scale of Differential Subject Marking has the same hierarchical structure exhibited in the section on Differential Object Marking. The functional motivation for the implementation of DSM and DOM is to avoid ambiguity as to what is subject and object in transitive clauses. The most natural hierarchy of animacy and definiteness places transitive subjects higher than transitive object.&lt;ref name=hoopswart/&gt;

===Word order===

Some languages code very little through morphology and are more dependent on syntax to encode meaning and grammatical relationships. If a language relies less on overt case marking, alignment may be coded through word order, as in this example from [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].

Indonesian
:saya&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; me&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-mandi-kan pria itu&lt;ref name=vdv/&gt;
:1SG agent trigger-wash-APPL man that
:‘I bathe that man’

In the following example from French, all subjects, both S and A, appear before the verb while O appears after the verb. Arguments occurring before the verb are coded as nominative, while arguments occurring directly after the verb are coded as accusative.

French
:Je(S)   travaille
:I-&lt;small&gt;[[Nominative case|NOM]]&lt;/small&gt;   work
:’I work’

:Je(A)   jette   un ballon(O)
:I-&lt;small&gt;[[Nominative case|NOM]]&lt;/small&gt;   throw       a ball-&lt;small&gt;[[Accusative case|ACC]]&lt;/small&gt;
:’I throw a ball’

===Verb agreement===
Alternatively, alignment can also manifest visibly through agreement on the verb. In the following example from Amharic, the verb is [[dependency grammar|head-marked]] for both subject ‘3SG.M’ and object ‘3SG.M.O’.

[[Amharic language|Amharic]]
:Lemma   t’ermus-u-n        sebber-e-w&lt;ref name=vdv/&gt;
:Lemma   bottle-DEF-&lt;small&gt;[[Accusative case|ACC]]&lt;/small&gt;     break.PF-3SG.M-3SG.M.O
:’Lemma breaks the bottle’

==Behavioral properties of accusativity==

Nominative–accusative alignment can also be distinguished through behavioral properties, in the way a nominative or accusative argument will behave when placed in particular syntactic constructions. This has to do with the impact of alignment on the level of the whole sentence rather than the individual word. Morphosyntactic alignment determines which arguments can be omitted in a coordinate structure during the process of conjunction reduction (deleting arguments from the ends of joined clauses). In nominative–accusative, only arguments S and A can be omitted and not argument O.

English
:a. Sue-NOM&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw Judy-ACC&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; , and she&lt;sub&gt;i/j&lt;/sub&gt; ran.
:b. Sue&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw Judy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and ___&lt;sub&gt;i/*j&lt;/sub&gt; ran.
:c. Sue&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw Judy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, and she&lt;sub&gt;i/j&lt;/sub&gt; was frightened.
:d. Sue&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw Judy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and ___&lt;sub&gt;i/*j&lt;/sub&gt; was frightened.
The omitted subject argument of the embedded clause must correspond to the subject (nominative) of the matrix-clause. If it corresponds to the object (accusative), the sentence is ungrammatical.

If English were an ergative–absolutive language, one would expect to see:
:b’. Sue&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw Judy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, and ___&lt;sub&gt;*i/j&lt;/sub&gt; ran.
:c’. Sue&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; saw Judy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, and ___&lt;sub&gt;*i/j&lt;/sub&gt; was frightened.
Here the omitted argument of the embedded clause  corresponds to the direct object (absolutive) of the matrix-clause. If it corresponds to the subject (ergative), the sentence is ungrammatical.

The alignment system also impacts the triggering and realization of other such syntactic processes as [[raising (linguistics)|raising]] constructions, [[control (linguistics)|subject-controlled subject deletion]] and [[control (linguistics)|object-controlled subject deletion]].

==Distribution==

[[File:Morphologic-Alignement.png|thumb|right|Distribution of languages by alignment type]]

Languages exhibiting accusative alignment are the most widespread of all of the alignment types. These languages can be found on every continent, in comparison to languages with ergative alignment that are restricted to certain areas of the world, namely the Caucasus, parts of North American and Mesoamerica, the Tibetan plateau, and Australia. The map shows the distribution of languages with the various alignment types, and the following list gives a short sampling of accusative languages and their distribution across the globe:&lt;ref name=wals&gt;Dryer, Matthew S. &amp; Haspelmath, Martin (eds.).

==Relevant theory==

===Optimality theory===
	One of the ways in which the production of a nominative–accusative case marking system can be explained is from an [[Optimality Theory|Optimality Theoretic]] perspective. Case marking is said to fulfill two functions, or constraints: an identifying function and a distinguishing function.&lt;ref name=hoopALM&gt;de Hoop, Helen and Malchukov, Andrej L. (2008) "Case-marking strategies". ''Linguistic Inquiry''.&lt;/ref&gt; The identifying function is exemplified when case morphology encodes (identifies) specific [[semantics|semantic]], thematic, or [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] properties or information about the nominal argument. Accusative case in the position of the direct object, for example, can be a strong identifier of [[patient (grammar)|patienthood]]. The distinguishing function is used to distinguish between the core arguments, the subject and the object, of a transitive clause. Helen de Hoop and Andrej Malchukov explain the motivation and need for the distinguishing function in "Case marking strategies":
{{quote|When a two-place predicate R(x,y) is used to describe an event involving two participants, usually an agent and a patient, it is of utmost importance to avoid ambiguity as  to which noun phrase corresponds to the first argument  x  (the agent) and which to the second argument  y (the patient). For this purpose, case can be used to mark one of the arguments. If one argument is case marked, this already suffices for the purpose of disambiguation. Thus, from the distinguishing perspective, there is no need to case mark both arguments. Neither would it be necessary to case mark the one and only argument of a one-place (intransitive) predicate. Indeed, it has been argued that in many nominative–accusative case systems only the y is case marked (with accusative case) while the x  remains morphologically unmarked.&lt;ref name=hoopALM/&gt;}}
It is rare for case to serve only the distinguishing function, which overlaps greatly with the ‘identify’ function. Other ways of disambiguating the arguments of a transitive predicate (subject agreement, word order restriction, context, intonation, etc.) may explain this cross-linguistic observation. De Hoop and Malchukov argue that case systems that are completely based on the identification function must be richer in case morphology compared to languages based mainly on the distinguishing function.

===Functional pressure===

One theory that has been posited to account for the occurrence of accusative systems is that of functional pressure. When applied to languages, this theory operates around the various needs and pressures on a speech community. It has been suggested that languages have evolved to suit the needs of their users.These communities will develop some functional system to meet the needs that they have. So, it has been proposed that the accusative system arose from a functional pressure to avoid ambiguity and make communication a simpler process.&lt;ref name=bates&gt;Bates, E., &amp; MacWhinney, B. (1982) ''Functionalist approaches to grammar''. In E.Wanner, &amp; L. Gleitman (Ed.), ''Language acquisition: The state of the art''. New York:
Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fedz&gt;Fedzechkina, Maryia &amp; Jaeger, T. Florian &amp; Newport, Elissa L. (2011) "Functional Biases in Language Learning: Evidence from Word Order and Case-Marking Interaction". ''Cognitive Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful for languages to have a means of distinguishing between subjects and objects, and between arguments A, S, and O. This is helpful so that sentences like "Tom hit Fred" cannot be interpreted as "Fred hit Tom." [[tripartite language|Tripartite]] alignment systems accomplish this differentiation by coding S, A and O all differently. However, this is not structurally economical, and tripartite systems are comparatively rare, but to have all arguments marked the same makes the arguments too ambiguous. Alongside the principle of distinguishability seems to operate a principle of economy. It is more efficient to have as few cases as possible without compromising intelligibility. In this way the dual pressures of efficiency and economy have produced a system which patterns two kinds of arguments together a third separately. Both accusative and ergative systems use this kind of grouping to make meaning clearer.

Because pronominal reference systems to the speaker, addressee, and a third person are so common (some argue [[universal grammar|universal]]) cross-linguistically, it would seem that pronoun systems are quite stable. However, the changes involved in [[grammatical person|second-person]] pronouns in English call this stability into question and highlight the significance of social forces in language development. The spread of [[feudalism|feudalistic]] ideology caused many European languages to develop two sets of second-person singular pronouns in order to reflect hierarchy. Therefore, pronouns encoded not only person or number, but also the speaker's assessment of the addressee's status and the speaker-addressee relationship.

From the thirteenth century, the [[Middle English]] plural pronouns 'ye' (nominative) and 'you' (accusative) were used to address single individuals in upper-class or courtly contexts.&lt;ref name=nau&gt;Fitzmaurice, Susan. "Politeness in Early Modern English". http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~eng121-c/politenessin%20AME.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there were two sets of second-person singular pronouns, and the alternative singular pronouns 'thou' (nominative) and 'thee' (accusative) became increasingly associated with lower status. These distinctions had become established indices of social status by the fifteenth century, and they also developed as indicators of interpersonal relationships at this time: 'you' might show emotional distance or be used in a public setting, 'thou' familiarity/intimacy in a private setting.&lt;ref name=nau/&gt; We see vestiges of this distinction in languages like German or French that have retained the [[T-V distinction]], but second-person pronouns in these languages, as well as in Italian, Serbo-Croatian, and Swedish, have also begun to undergo change.&lt;ref name=feminist&gt;Cameron, Deborah. (1998) ''The feminist critique of language: a reader''. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the pressure of social structural changes and movement towards [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] ideology, the English second-person singular pronouns later collapsed to a single term, 'you'.&lt;ref name=feminist/&gt; This contraction erased all visible morphological distinction between nominative and accusative case in the second person, effectively sacrificing distinguishability for economy.

===Creative use of case marking===

There are instances in which nominative–accusative case marking can be used creatively, for example to generate a sense of formality. A common example in English is the use of the nominative form of the 1st person singular pronoun "I" in object, rather than subject, position. For example:
:'Anyone who knows my wife and I(&lt;small&gt;[[Nominative case|NOM]]&lt;/small&gt;)'
versus
:'Anyone who knows my wife and me(&lt;small&gt;[[Accusative case|ACC]]&lt;/small&gt;)'
This variation between 'I' and 'me' (nominative and accusative) in object position has been linked to the social concerns of [[politeness]] and elevated language. This non-standard use of the nominative case in object position carries a certain linguistic [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]]. People using this form are often perceived as educated and articulate. This variation shows up frequently in newspapers, magazines and political speeches as well as in daily conversation.&lt;ref name=anger&gt;Angermeyer, Philip, Singler, John. (2003) ''The case for politeness: Pronoun variation in co-ordinate NPs in object position in English''. New York University. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parker&gt;Parker, Frank, Kathryn Riley, and Charles Meyer. (1988) "Case assignment and the ordering of constituents in coordinate constructions." ''American Speech'', 63:214–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the use of the standard variant 'my wife and me' may seem to signal casualness or lack of sophistication.&lt;ref name=anger/&gt;&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; This illustrates how case marking is not only a system to be followed, but one that can be used creatively to encode particular social meanings.

The '''Order of Maternal Glory''' ({{lang-ru|Орден Материнская слава|translit=Orden Materinskaâ Slava|translit-std=ISO|italic=yes}}) was a Soviet civilian award created on 8 July 1944 by [[Joseph Stalin]] and established with a decision of the Presidium of [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]]. Its status was confirmed by the Soviet's decision of 18 August 1944 and later modified by 16 September 1947, 28 May 1973 and 28 May 1980 decisions. It was awarded on behalf of the Presidium of Supreme Soviet of the USSR through decrees of local [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] presidencies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondvor.narod.ru/OMatSl.html|title=Орден "МАТЕРИНСКАЯ СЛАВА" - 1|website=www.mondvor.narod.ru|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Classes==
The order was divided into three classes: first, second and third class.

It was conferred to:
* '''First class''': mothers bearing and raising nine children.
* '''Second class''': mothers bearing and raising eight children.
* '''Third class''': mothers bearing and raising seven children.

The order was conferred upon the first birthday of the last child, provided that the other children necessary to reach the qualifying number (natural or adopted) remained alive. Children who had perished under heroic, military or other respectful circumstances, including [[occupational disease]]s, were also counted. The award was created simultaneously with the [[Mother Heroine]] ({{lang-ru|Мать-героиня|italic=yes}}) order and the Maternity Medal ({{lang-ru|Медаль материнства|italic=yes}}) and it was situated in between them. The author of the art project was the painter Goznaka.

The first decree for bestowing the award was issued on 6 December 1944, when the first class order was conferred to 21 women, the second class to 26 and the third class to 27. In total the order was awarded in the first class to 753,000 women, 1,508,000 received the second class award and 2,786,000 received the third class award.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Design ==
First class medals were totally silver made in a convex egg-shape. They were {{cvt|36|mm}} high and {{cvt|29|mm}} wide. In the upper part of the medal contained a red enamel flag with the phrase {{lang|ru|Материнская слава}} (Maternal Glory) and the Roman number showing the order's class. Below the flag, there was a white enamel shield with the {{lang|ru|CCCP}} (USSR) inscription. The upper part of the shield was decorated with a [[five-pointed star]] and the lower part with the [[hammer and sickle]] symbol. On the left side, there was a figure of a mother holding a son in her arms covered with roses on her lowest part. The lower part of the medal contains a flag and gilded lettering. In second class medals, the flag's enamel was dark-blue and there were not gilded parts while in the third class ones enamel disappeared from the flag, shield and [[five-pointed star|star]]. The back of the medals was in white enamel. First class medals were suspended to a single light-blue fringe while second class had two light-blue fringes and third class three of them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Peter Guy Winch''' (14 January 1926, [[London]] – 27 April 1997, [[Champaign, Illinois]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] known for his contributions to the [[philosophy of social science]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein scholarship]], [[ethics]], and the [[philosophy of religion]]. Winch is perhaps most famous for his early book, ''The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958), an attack on [[positivism]] in the [[social sciences]], drawing on the work of [[R. G. Collingwood]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy.

==Biography==
Winch was born on 14 January 1926, in [[Walthamstow]], [[London]]. He attended [[Leyton Sixth Form College|Leyton County High School for boys]],&lt;ref&gt;see article by D. Z. Phillips in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; before going up [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]] to read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]. Following the outbreak of World War II, he served in the [[Royal Navy]] 1944–47, before graduating from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-peter-winch-1253947.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a lecturer in philosophy at the [[Swansea University]] from 1951 until 1964. He was influenced by his colleagues [[Rush Rhees]] and [[Roy Holland]], both experts in the philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. In 1964, he moved to [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]], before becoming Professor of Philosophy at [[King's College London]] in 1967. During this period, he served as president of [[Aristotelian Society]], from 1980 to 1981. In 1985 Winch moved to the United States to become Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

He died on the 27 April 1997, in [[Champaign, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwm.at/files/nl-57.pdf ''Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'': ''Newsletter'' 57]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was survived by his wife Erika Neumann and his two sons, Christopher and David.

==Thought==
Major influences upon Winch include [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Rush Rhees]], [[R. G. Collingwood]] and [[Simone Weil]]. He gave rise to a form of philosophy that has been given the name 'sociologism'.&lt;ref&gt;see Sutton, C. ''The German Tradition in Philosophy''. London, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; He also bears responsibility for a small school of sociology that was prepared to accept his radical criticism of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;see the Discussion in ''New Rules of Sociological Method'' by [[Anthony Giddens]] London: Hutchinson: 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Winch saw himself as an uncompromising Wittgensteinian. He was not personally acquainted with Wittgenstein; Wittgenstein’s influence upon him was mostly mediated through that of Rush Rhees, who was his colleague at the University College of Swansea, now known as [[Swansea University]], and whom Wittgenstein appointed as one of his literary executors.&lt;ref&gt;see biography by Colin Lyas&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 Winch published Wittgenstein’s ''Culture and Value'', translated by himself. After the death of Rhees in 1989 he took over his position as literary executor.

From Rush Rhees, Winch derived  his interest in the religious writer Simone Weil. Part of the appeal was a break from Wittgenstein into a very different type of philosophy which could nevertheless be tackled with familiar methods.  Also Weil’s ascetic, somewhat [[Tolstoy]]an, form of religion harmonised with one aspect of Wittgenstein’s personality.

At a time when most Anglo-American philosophers were heavily under the spell of Wittgenstein, Winch’s own approach was strikingly original.  While much of his work was concerned with rescuing Wittgenstein from what he took to be misreadings, his own philosophy involved a shift of emphasis from the problems that preoccupied Oxford style [[Ordinary language philosophy|‘linguistic’ philosophy]], towards justifying and explaining '[[Form of life (philosophy)|forms of life]]' in terms of consistent [[Language-game (philosophy)|language game]]s. He took Wittgensteinian philosophy into areas of [[ethics]] and religion, which Wittgenstein himself had relatively neglected, sometimes showing considerable originality. An example is his illuminating treatment of the moral difference between someone who tries and fails to commit murder and someone who succeeds, in his essay "Trying" in ''Ethics and Action''. With the decline of interest in Wittgenstein, Winch himself was increasingly neglected  and the challenge his arguments presented to much contemporary philosophy was sidestepped or ignored. In insisting on the continuity of Wittgenstein’s concerns from the ''Tractatus'' through to the ''Philosophical Investigations'', Winch made a powerful case for Wittgenstein’s mature philosophy, as he understood it, as the consummation and legitimate heir of the entire analytic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Peter Hacker]] ''Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth Century Philosophy'' Blackwell: Oxford: 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein famously said that philosophy leaves the world as it is.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Investigations'' §124&lt;/ref&gt; Winch takes his ideas into regions that have strong moral and political implications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8699">'''Reliabilism''', a category of theories in the [[philosophy|philosophical]] discipline of [[epistemology]], has been advanced as a theory both of [[Theory of justification|justification]] and of [[knowledge]]. Process reliabilism has been used as an argument against [[philosophical skepticism]], such as the [[brain in a vat]] thought experiment.&lt;ref name="kd47"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/responding.htm|title=Responding to Skepticism|last=DeRose|first=Keith|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001114223600/http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/responding.htm|archivedate=14 November 2000|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Process reliabilism is a form of [[Internalism and externalism#Epistemology|epistemic externalism]].&lt;ref name="kd47"/&gt;

==Overview==
A broadly reliabilist theory of knowledge is roughly as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One knows that ''p'' (''p'' stands for any [[proposition]]—e.g., that the sky is blue) if and only if ''p'' is true, one believes that ''p'' is true, and one has arrived at the belief that ''p'' through some ''reliable process.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A broadly reliabilist theory of justified belief can be stated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One has a justified belief that ''p'' if, and only if, the belief is the result of a reliable process.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, a similar account can be given (and an elaborate version of this has been given by Alvin Plantinga) for such notions as 'warranted belief' or 'epistemically rational belief'.

Leading proponents of reliabilist theories of knowledge and justification have included [[Alvin Goldman]], [[Marshall Swain]], [[Kent Bach]] and more recently, [[Alvin Plantinga]].  Goldman's article "[[Causal Theory of Knowledge|A Causal Theory of Knowing]]" (''Journal of Philosophy'', '''64''' (1967), pp.&amp;nbsp;357–372) is generally credited as being the first full treatment of the theory, though [[D. M. Armstrong]] is also regarded as an important source, and (according to [[Hugh Mellor]]) [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]] was the very first to state the theory, albeit in passing.

One classical or traditional [[philosophical analysis|analysis]] of 'knowledge' is ''[[justified true belief]]''. In order to have a valid claim of knowledge for any proposition, one must be justified in believing "p" and "p" must be true. Since [[Gettier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/23/6/121/109949/Is-Justified-True-Belief-Knowledge|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?|year=1963|first=Edmund L.|last=Gettier|journal=Analysis|volume=23|issue=6|pages=121–123|doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121|jstor=3326922}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed his counterexamples the traditional analysis has included the further claim that knowledge must be more than justified true belief.  Reliabilist theories of knowledge are sometimes presented as an alternative to that theory: rather than justification, all that is required is that the belief be the product of a reliable process.  But reliabilism need not be regarded as an alternative, but instead as a further explication of the traditional analysis.  On this view, those who offer reliabilist theories of justification further analyze the 'justification' part of the traditional analysis of 'knowledge' in terms of reliable processes.  Not all reliabilists agree with such accounts of justification, but some do.

==Objections==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
Some find reliabilism of justification objectionable because it entails [[externalism (epistemology)|externalism]], which is the view that one can have knowledge, or have a justified belief, despite not knowing (having "access" to) the evidence, or other circumstances, that make the belief justified.  Most reliabilists maintain that a belief can be justified, or can constitute knowledge, ''even if'' the believer does not know about or understand the process that makes the belief reliable.  In defending this view, reliabilists (and externalists generally) are apt to point to examples from simple acts of perception: if one sees a bird in the tree outside one's window and thereby gains the belief that there is a bird in that tree, one might not at all understand the cognitive processes that account for one's successful act of perception; nevertheless, it is the fact that the processes worked reliably that accounts for why one's belief is justified.  In short, one finds one holds a belief about the bird, and that belief is justified if any is, but one is not acquainted at all with the processes that led to the belief that justified one's having it. 

Another of the most common objections to reliabilism, made first to Goldman's reliable process theory of knowledge and later to other reliabilist theories, is the so-called generality problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Conee | first1 = E. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = R. | title = The Generality Problem for Reliabilism | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–29 | doi =  | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 4320806}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For any given justified belief (or instance of knowledge), one can easily identify many different (concurrently operating) "processes" from which the belief results.  My belief that there is a bird in the tree outside my window might be accorded a result of the process of forming beliefs on the basis of sense-perception, of visual sense-perception, of visual sense-perception through non-opaque surfaces in daylight, and so forth, down to a variety of different very specifically described processes.  Some of these processes might be statistically reliable, while others might not.  It would no doubt be better to say, in any case, that we are choosing not which process to say resulted in the belief, but instead how to describe the process, out of the many different levels of generality on which it can be accurately described.

An objection in a similar line was formulated by [[Stephen Stich]] in ''The Fragmentation of Reason''. Reliabilism usually considers that for generating justified beliefs a process needs to be reliable in a set of relevant possible scenarios. However, according to Stich, these scenarios are chosen in a culturally biased manner. Stich does not defend any alternative theory of knowledge or justification, but instead argues that all accounts of normative epistemic terms  are culturally biased and instead only a pragmatic account can be given.

Another objection to reliabilism is called the ''new evil demon problem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Diagonal and the Demon |first=Juan |last=Comesa&amp;ntilde;a |journal=Philosophical Studies |volume=110 |year=2002 |pages=249–266 |doi=10.1023/a:1020656411534 |url=http://philosophy.wisc.edu/comesana/diagonal.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614021049/http://philosophy.wisc.edu/comesana/diagonal.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evil demon problem originally motivated [[skepticism]], but can be resuited to object to reliabilist accounts as follows:  If our experiences are controlled by an evil demon, it may be the case that we believe ourselves to be doing things that we are not doing.  However, these beliefs are clearly justified. [[Robert Brandom]] has called for a clarification of the role of [[belief]] in reliabilist theories. Brandom is concerned that unless the role of belief is stressed, reliabilism may attribute knowledge to things that would otherwise be considered incapable of possessing it. Brandom gives the example of a parrot that has been trained to consistently respond to red visual stimuli by saying 'that's red'. The proposition is true, the mechanism that produced it is reliable, but Brandom is reluctant to say that the parrot ''knows'' it is seeing red because he thinks it cannot ''believe'' that it is. For Brandom, beliefs pertain to concepts: without the latter there can be no former. Concepts are products of the 'game of giving and asking for reasons'. Hence, only those entities capable of reasoning, through language in a social context, can for Brandom believe and thus have knowledge. Brandom may be regarded as hybridising [[externalism]] and [[internalism]], allowing knowledge to be accounted for by reliable external process so long as  a knower possess some internal understanding of why the belief is reliable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">'''Robert Holcot''', [[Order of Preachers|OP]],&lt;ref&gt;Holgot, Holkot, Holcott, Robertus or Ropertus, Robertus Haldecotus&lt;/ref&gt; (c.1290-1349) was an English [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[scholastic philosopher]], theologian and influential Biblical scholar. He was born in [[Holcot]], [[Northamptonshire]]. A follower of [[William of Ockham]], he was nicknamed the ''Doctor firmus et indefatigabilis''. He made important contributions to semantics, the debate over God’s knowledge of future contingents, discussions of predestination, grace, and merit, and philosophical theology more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Williams, ‘Transmission and Translation’, in AS McGrade, ed, ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'', (Cambridge: CUP, 2003), p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern interest in Holcot has been limited. His influence in the late Middle Ages, however, was clearly great, as is evidenced by the number of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century manuscripts of his work that have survived. For example, there exist 48 manuscripts of Holcot’s Questions on the Sentences (compared to 36 manuscripts of [[William of Ockham]]’s Sentences commentary).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Williams, ‘Transmission and Translation’, in AS McGrade, ed, ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'', (Cambridge: CUP, 2003), p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; More impressive are the 175 manuscripts of his commentary on the ''[[Book of Wisdom]]'' (''Lectiones super librum Sapientiae''),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Williams, ‘Transmission and Translation’, in AS McGrade, ed, ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'', (Cambridge: CUP, 2003), p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; a work that has been identified as a prime literary source for [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Nun's Priest's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/npt.html The Nun's Priest's Tale and Nominalism: A Preliminary Study] by Grover C. Furr and references given there.&lt;/ref&gt;  Holcot was still read in the sixteenth-century when the Parisian theologian, [[Jacques Almain]], wrote a work engaging Holcot's opinions.
The commentary on the ''[[Book of Wisdom]]'' was printed in 1480, and, subsequently, went through many editions. An edition of the questions on the Sentences was printed at Lyon in 1497, although it contained a cover letter stating that the manuscripts used to produce this edition were disorderly and unreliable. Unfortunately, this remains the only edition of Holcot’s Sentences available today.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Williams, ‘Transmission and Translation’, in AS McGrade, ed, ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Philosophy'', (Cambridge: CUP, 2003), p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Sai-in'''|西院,| さいいん}} is the western precinct of an area or structure (such as the side of a temple complex). It is the opposite of [[Tō-in]] which refers to the eastern precinct.

The -in Suffix is often attached to words referring to well organized structures, such as in the Japanese word for hospital, [[Byōin]].

The word ''Sai'' is one of two possible pronunciations for the Japanese written [[kanji]] character meaning west.

'''Sergio Jaramillo Caro''', is a Colombian [[philosopher]], [[philologist]] and [[civil servant]]. He recently served as the High Commissioner of Peace under President [[Juan Manuel Santos]] in the successful peace negotiations with the [[FARC]] between 2012 and 2016. He previously served in government as Vice Minister of Defence, and also held the position of National Security Advisor between 2010-2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://wsp.presidencia.gov.co/portal/Gobierno/AltosFuncionarios/Paginas/SeguridadNacional.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

He was born in [[Bogotá]] in 1966. He is the great great great grandson of José Eusebio Caro and great great grandson of [[Miguel Antonio Caro]] but at the same time is a descendant of the liberal Luis Eduardo Nieto Caballero.

==Studies==

He studied philosophy at the [[University of Toronto]] and philology at the [[University of Oxford]]. He received a master's in philosophy from the [[University of Cambridge]] and was candidate for a doctorate in Greek at [[Heidelberg University]] in Germany. He speaks fluent [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wsp.presidencia.gov.co/portal/Gobierno/AltosFuncionarios/Paginas/SeguridadNacional.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He also speaks [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

==Civil Service==

From 2000-2001 he worked in Cancillería, where minister Guillermo Fernández Soto named him his advisor for the Diplomacy for Peace program.

From 2001-2002 he was a political counselor for the Colombian Embassy in [[France]], where he worked with ambassadors [[Juan Camilo Restrepo Salazar|Juan Camilo Restrepo]] and later with [[Marta Lucía Ramírez|Martha Lucía Ramírez]].

From 2002-2004 he was named advisor of political issues and strategies for the ministry of national defense over [[Marta Lucía Ramírez|Martha Lucía Ramírez]], and there he was in charge of development, the coordination and writing of The Political Defense and Democratic Security from 2002–2003

Between 2004 and 2006 Jaramillo stopped work as [[Civil service|civil servant]] and became an executive director of the Ideas for Peace Foundation (Fundación Ideas para la Paz (FIP).) As such he was in charge of leading a work team that published the series “Siguiendo el Conflicto (Following Conflict)” which reached great influence within Colombian armed conflict analysis. There he published 45 issues of that series. Before leaving the leadership of FIP he publishes an article in the newspaper, [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]], that analyzes the impact of the pressure of  (losses, casualties) within the FMM (body count) and its dangerous consequences.

Between 2006 and 2009 Jaramillo worked with [[Juan Manuel Santos]] as vice Minister for human rights and international issues of the Defense Ministry. His work focused on reporting false positives within the army, prompting the prosecutor's office to undertake the investigations of homicides and to exclude military justice. His role was key in the later expulsion of a group of 27 high officers in the army ranks. He came up with [[Human rights in Colombia|human rights]] policies that regulated force. He was a defender of the consolidation policy with a civilian approach.  He was also a major proponent of demobilization policies.

Between 2009 and 2010 he was the investigator for the [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)|Andes University]] faculty [[Academic administration|administration]]. There he led the creation of the group Amigos de La Macarena as a mechanism to draw bridges between [[Privately held company|private business]] and the policy of territorial consolidation.

Between 2010 and 2012 Jaramillo took charge as the Senior Presidential National Security Adviser of the Santos government. In this position he propelled the reactivation of the National Security Council where there was a special emphasis against the criminal bands ([[Colombian conflict|bacrim]])  and in the strengthening of the policy of territorial consolidation. During this period, he also served as the High Commissioner for Peace.

Since 2010 and until the public announcement in September 2012, he has been the head of the government team in charge of leading the approaches and exploratory phase of conversations with [[FARC]].

He was responsible for the secret negotiations that brought the approval  of “ the General agreement for the ending of conflict” between the Colombian government and the guerrilla warfare of the [[FARC]] in August 2012. He was also part of the government delegation  in the conversations in [[Havana|La Habana, Cuba]].

In September 2012 he was designated as High commissioner of Peace along with [[Humberto De la Calle|Humberto de la Calle]], chief negotiator of the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the 19th century it was discovered that medieval translators had [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] Gabirol's name to '''Avicebron''' or '''Avencebrol''' and had translated his work on Jewish Neo-Platonic philosophy into a Latin form that had in the intervening centuries been highly regarded as a work of Islamic or Christian scholarship.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxxii}}&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; As such, ibn Gabirol is well known in the history of philosophy for the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form (“Universal [[Hylomorphism]]”), and for his emphasis on divine will.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

==Biography==
Little is known of Gabirol's life, and some sources give contradictory information.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} Sources agree that he was born in [[Málaga]], but are unclear whether in late 1021 or early 1022 CE.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xvii}} The year of his death is a matter of dispute, with conflicting accounts having him dying either before age 30 or by age 48.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

Gabirol lived a life of material comfort, never having to work to sustain himself, but he lived a difficult and loveless life, suffering ill health, misfortunes, fickle friendships, and powerful enemies.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xvii—xxvi}} From his teenage years, he suffered from some disease, possibly [[lupus vulgaris]],&lt;ref name=loewe/&gt; that would leave him embittered and in constant pain.&lt;ref name=pen/&gt; He indicates in his poems that he considered himself short and ugly.&lt;ref name=pen/&gt; Of his personality, [[Moses ibn Ezra]] wrote: "his irascible temperament dominated his intellect, nor could he rein the demon that was within himself. It came easily to him to lampoon the great, with salvo upon salvo of mockery and sarcasm."&lt;ref name=loewe/&gt;{{rp|17–18}} He has been described summarily as "a social misfit."&lt;ref name=wine/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Gabirol's writings indicate that his father was a prominent figure in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], but was forced to relocate to Málaga during a political crisis in 1013.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xvii}} Gabirol's parents died while he was a child, leaving him an orphan with no siblings or close relatives.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xviii}} He was befriended, supported and protected by a prominent political figure of the time, Yekutiel ibn Hassan al-Mutawakkil ibn Qabrun,&lt;ref name=pen/&gt; and moved to [[Zaragoza]], then an important center of Jewish culture.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xviii}} Gabirol's anti-social&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; temperament, occasionally boastful poetry, and sharp wit earned him powerful enemies, but as long as Jekuthiel lived, Gabirol remained safe from them&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxiv}} and was able to freely immerse himself in study of the Talmud, grammar, geometry, astronomy, and philosophy.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt; However, when Gabirol was seventeen years old, his benefactor was [[assassination|assassinated]] as the result of a political conspiracy, and by 1045 Gabirol found himself compelled to leave Zaragoza.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxiv}}&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt; He was then sponsored by no less than the grand vizier and top general to the kings of [[Granada]], [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]] (Shmuel HaNaggid).&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxv}} Gabirol made ibn Naghrillah an object of praise in his poetry until an estrangement arose between them and ibn Naghrillah became the butt of Gabirol's bitterest irony. It seems Gabirol never married,&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxvi}} and that he spent the remainder of his life wandering.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

Gabirol had become an accomplished poet and philosopher at an early age:
* By age 17, he had composed five of his known poems, one an [[Azharot|azhara]] ("I am the master, and Song is my slave"&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;) enumerating all [[613 commandments]] of [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xix}}
* At age 17, he composed a 200-verse elegy for his friend Yekutiel&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xiv}} and four other notable elegies to mourn the death of [[Hai Gaon]].&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;
* By age 19, he had composed a 400-verse alphabetical and acrostic poem teaching the rules of Hebrew grammar.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxv}}
* By age 23&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt; or 25,&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxv}}&lt;ref name=pen/&gt; he had composed, in Arabic, "Improvement of the Moral Qualities" ({{lang-ar|كتاب الصلاح الأخلاق}}, translated into Hebrew by [[Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon]] as {{lang-he|תקון מדות הנפש}}&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;
* At around age 25,&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt; or not,&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxv}} he may have composed his collection of proverbs ''Mivchar Pninim'' (lit. "Choice of Pearls"), although scholars are divided on his authorship.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;
* At around age 28,&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt; or not,&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxv}} he composed his philosophical work ''[[Solomon ibn Gabirol#Fons Vitæ|Fons Vitæ]]''.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxv}}

As mentioned above, the conflicting accounts of Gabirol's death have him dying either before age 30 or by age 48.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; The opinion of earliest death, that he died before age 30, is believed to be based upon a misreading of medieval sources.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; The remaining two opinions are that he died either in 1069 or 1070,&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxvii}} or around 1058 in [[Valencia]].&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;&lt;ref name=sirat/&gt; As to the circumstances of his death, one legend claims that he was trampled to death by an Arab horseman.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt; A second legend&lt;ref name=yahya/&gt; relates that he was murdered by a Muslim poet who was jealous of Gabirol's poetic gifts, and who secretly buried him beneath the roots of a fig tree. The tree bore fruit in abundant quantity and of extraordinary sweetness. Its uniqueness excited attention and provoked an investigation. The resulting inspection of the tree uncovered Gabirol's remains, and led to the identification and execution of the murderer.

==Historical identity==
Though Gabirol's legacy was esteemed throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, it was historically minimized by two errors of scholarship that mis-attributed his works.

===False ascription as King Solomon===
Gabirol seems to have often been called "the Málagan", after his place of birth, and would occasionally so refer to himself when encrypting his signature in his poems (e.g. in "שטר עלי בעדים" he embeds his signature as an acrostic, in the form "אני שלמה הקטן ברבי יהודה גבירול מאלקי חזק"). While in [[Modern Hebrew]] the city is also called Málaga ({{lang-he|מאלגה}}), that is in deference to its current [[Spanish language|Spanish]] pronunciation. In Gabirol's day, when it was ruled by Arabic speakers, it was called ''Mālaqa'' ({{lang-ar|مالقة}}), as it is to this day by Arabic speakers. The 12th-century Arab philosopher [[Jabir ibn Aflah]] misinterpreted manuscript signatures of the form "שלמה ... יהודה ... אלמלאק" to mean "Solomon ... the Jew .. the king", and so ascribed to [[Solomon]] some seventeen philosophical essays of Gabirol. The 15th-century Jewish philosopher [[Yohanan Alemanno]] imported that error back into the Hebrew canon, and added another four works to the list of false ascriptions.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxx}}

===Identification as Avicebron===
In 1846, [[Solomon Munk]] discovered among the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] manuscripts in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale|French National Library]] in [[Paris]] a work by [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]]. Comparing it with a [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] work by Avicebron entitled ''[[Solomon ibn Gabirol#Fons Vitæ|Fons Vitæ]]'', Munk proved them to both excerpt an [[Arabic]] original of which the ''Fons Vitæ'' was evidently the translation. Munk concluded that Avicebron or Avencebrol, who had for centuries been believed to be a Christian&lt;ref name=pen/&gt; or Arabic Muslim philosopher,&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; was instead identical with the Jewish Solomon ibn Gabirol.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxxi-xxxii}}&lt;ref name=pen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orient/&gt; The centuries-long confusion was in part due to a content feature atypical in Jewish writings: ''Fons Vitæ'' exhibits an independence of Jewish religious dogma and does not cite Biblical verses or Rabbinic sources.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

The progression in the Latinization of Gabirol's name seems to have been ibn Gabirol, Ibngebirol, Avengebirol. Avengebrol, Avencebrol, Avicebrol, and finally Avicebron.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; Some sources still refer to him as Avicembron, Avicenbrol, or Avencebrol.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Gabirol, in his poem "כשרש עץ" (line 24), claims to have written twenty philosophical works. Through scholarly deduction (see [[Solomon ibn Gabirol#False ascription as King Solomon|above]]), we know their titles, but we only have the texts of two.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxxi}}

Gabirol made his mark on the history of philosophy under his alias as Avicebron, one of the first teachers of Neo-Platonism in [[Europe]], and author of ''[[Solomon ibn Gabirol#Fons Vitæ|Fons Vitæ]]'' .&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oesterley/&gt; As such, he is best known for the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form (“Universal [[Hylomorphism]]”), and for his emphasis on divine will.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

His role has been compared to that of [[Philo]]:&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; both were ignored by their fellow Jews, but exercised considerable influence upon Gentiles (Philo upon primitive Christianity, Gabirol upon medieval Christian scholasticism); and both served as cultural intermediaries (Philo between [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and the Oriental world; Gabirol between Greco-Arabic philosophy and the Occident).

===''Fons Vitæ''===
''Fons Vitæ'' ({{lang-he|מקור חיים}}, {{IPA-he|mɛ.ˈkor xay.ˈyim|pron}}, lit. "Source of Life", cf. {{bibleverse-lb||Psalms|36:10|HE}}) is a Neo-Platonic philosophical dialogue between master and disciple on the nature of Creation and how understanding what we are (our nature) can help us know how to live (our purpose).&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; "His goal is to understand the nature of being and human being so that he might better understand and better inspire the pursuit of knowledge and the doing of good deeds."&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; The work stands out in the history of philosophy for introducing the doctrine that all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form, and for its emphasis on divine will.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

::Student: What is the purpose of man?
::Teacher: The inclination of his soul to the higher world in order that everyone might return to his like.
::(''Fons'' ''Vitæ'' 1.2, p. 4, lines 23–25)&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

In the closing sentences of the Fons ''Vitæ'' (5.43, p.&amp;nbsp;338, line 21), ibn Gabirol further describes this state of “return” as a liberation from death and a cleaving to the source of life.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

The work was originally composed in Arabic, of which no copies are extant. It was preserved for the ages by a translation into Latin in the year 1150 by [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]], who was the first official director of the [[Toledo School of Translators]], a [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]], and the [[archdeacon]] of [[Segovia, Spain]].&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxx}} In the 13th century, Shem Tov ibn Falaquera wrote a summary of ''Fons'' ''Vitæ'' in Hebrew,&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; and only in 1926 was the full Latin text was translated into Hebrew.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

''Fons Vitæ'' consists of five sections:&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;
# matter and form in general and their relation in physical substances ({{lang-la|substantiæ corporeæ sive compositæ}});
# the substance which underlies the corporeality of the world ({{lang-la|de substantia quæ sustinet corporeitatem mundi}});
# proofs of the existence of intermediaries between God and the physical world ({{lang-la|substantiæ simplices}}, lit. "intelligibiles");
# proofs that these "intelligibiles" are likewise constituted of matter and form;
# universal matter and universal form.

''Fons Vitæ'' posits that the basis of existence and the source of life in every created thing is a combination of "matter" ({{lang-la|materia universalis}}) and "form". The doctrine of matter and form informed the work's subtitle: "''De Materia et Forma.''"&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript in the Mazarine Library is entitled "''De Materia Universali''"&lt;/ref&gt; Its chief doctrines are:&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;
# everything that exists may be reduced to three categories:
## God;
## matter and form (i.e. Creation);
## will (an intermediary).
# All created beings are constituted of form and matter.
# This holds true for both the physical world ({{lang-la|substantiis corporeis sive compositis}}) and the spiritual world ({{lang-la|substantiis spiritualibus sive simplicibus}}), which latter are the connecting link between the first substance (i.e. the Godhead, {{lang-la|essentia prima}}) and the physical world ({{lang-la|substantia, quæ sustinet novem prædicamenta}}, lit. "substance divided into nine categories").
# Matter and form are always and everywhere in the relation of "''sustinens''" and "''sustentatum''", "''propriatum''" and "''proprietas''": substratum and property or attribute.

===Influence within Judaism===

Though Gabirol as a philosopher was ignored by the Jewish community, Gabirol as a poet was not, and through his poetry, he introduced his philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; His best-known poem, [[:s:Royal Crown|''Keter Malkut'' ("Royal Crown")]], is a philosophical treatise in poetical form, the "double" of the ''Fons Vitæ''. For example, the eighty-third line of the poem points to one of the teachings of the ''Fons Vitæ''; namely, that all the attributes predicated of God exist apart in thought alone and not in reality.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

[[Moses ibn Ezra]] is the first to mention Gabirol as a philosopher, praising his intellectual achievements, and quoting several passages from the ''Fons Vitæ'' in his own work, ''Aruggat ha-Bosem''.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], who cites Gabirol's philosophico-allegorical Bible interpretation, borrows from the ''Fons Vitæ'' both in his prose and in his poetry without giving due credit.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

The 12th-century philosopher [[Joseph ibn Tzaddik]] borrows extensively from the "Fons Vitæ" in his work ''Microcosmos''.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

Another 12th-century philosopher, [[Abraham ibn Daud]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], was the first to take exception to Gabirol's teachings. In ''Sefer ha-Kabbalah'' he praises Gabirol as a poet. But to counteract the influence of ibn Gabirol the philosopher, he wrote an Arabic book, translated into Hebrew under the title ''Emunah Ramah'', in which he reproaches Gabirol for having philosophized without any regard to the requirements of the Jewish religious position and bitterly accuses him of mistaking a number of poor reasons for one good one.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; He criticizes Gabirol for being repetitive, wrong-headed and unconvincing.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

Occasional traces of ibn Gabriol's thought are found in some of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature of the 13th century. Later references to ibn Gabirol, such as those of [[Elijah ben Joseph Chabillo|Elijah Chabillo]], [[Isaac Abravanel|Isaac Abarbanel]], [[Abravanel|Judah Abarbanel]], [[Moses Almosnino]], and [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], are based on an acquaintance with the scholastic philosophy, especially the works of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]].&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

The 13th-century a Jewish philosopher [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]] drew upon Gabirol's works in his encyclopedic philosophical text ''Sefer Haḥibbur'' ({{lang-he|ספר החיבור}}, {{IPA-he|ˈse.fer ha.xi.ˈbur|pron}}, lit. "The Book of Compilation").

===Influence on Scholasticism===

For over six centuries, the Christian world regarded ''Fons Vitæ'' as the work of a Christian philosopher&lt;ref name=pen/&gt; or Arabic Muslim philosopher,&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxxi-xxxii}}&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt;&lt;ref name=pen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Orient/&gt; and it became a cornerstone and bone of contention in many theologically charged debates between Franciscans and Dominicans.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; The [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] led by [[St. Albertus Magnus]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] opposed the teachings of ''Fons Vitæ''; the Platonist [[Franciscan]]s led by [[Duns Scotus]] supported its teachings, and led to its acceptance in Christian philosophy, influencing later philosophers such as the 16th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] [[Giordano Bruno]].&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; Other early supporters of Gabirol's philosophy include the following:&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

* [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]], who translated the ''Fons Vitæ'' into Latin and incorporated its ideas into his own teaching.
* [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]], who refers to the work of Gabirol under the title ''Fons Sapientiæ''. He speaks of Gabirol as a Christian and praises him as "''unicus omnium philosophantium nobilissimus''."
* [[Alexander of Hales]] and his disciple [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]], who accept the teaching of Gabirol that spiritual substances consist of matter and form.
* William of Lamarre

The main points at issue between Gabirol and Aquinas were as follows:&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;
# the universality of matter, Aquinas holding that spiritual substances are immaterial;
# the plurality of forms in a physical entity, which Aquinas denied;
# the power of activity of physical beings, which Gabirol affirmed. Aquinas held that Gabirol made the mistake of transferring to real existence the theoretical combination of genus and species, and that he thus came to the erroneous conclusion that in reality all things are constituted of matter and form as genus and species respectively.

''The Improvement of the Moral Qualities'' ({{lang-he|"תקון מדות הנפש"}}, {{IPA-he|ti.'kun mi.ˈdot ha.ˈne.feʃ|pron}}) is an ethical treatise that has been called by Munk "a popular manual of morals."{{cite quote|date=October 2015}} It was composed by Gabirol at Zaragoza in 1045, at the request of some friends who wished to possess a book treating of the qualities of man and the methods of effecting their improvement.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

The innovations in the work are that it presents the principles of [[ethics]] independently of religious dogma and that it proposes that the five physical senses are emblems and instruments of virtue and vice, but not their agents; thus, a person's inclination to vice is subject to a person's will to change.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; Gabirol presents a tabular diagram of the relationship of twenty qualities to the five senses, reconstructed at right,&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; and urges his readers to train the qualities of their souls unto good through self-understanding and habituation. He regards man's ability to do so as an example of divine benevolence.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

While this work of Gabirol is not widely studied in Judaism, it has many points in common with [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]'s very popular{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} work ''[[Chovot HaLevavot]]'',&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; written in 1040, also in Zaragoza.

===''Mivchar HaPeninim''===
[[File:Mivhar-Peninim-1899-London-HB37435.pdf|thumb|right|''Mivhar ha-Peninim'', traditionally thought to have been written by Solomon ibn Gabirol,&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; 1899 edition with corrected text and a facing English translation.&lt;ref name=hb37435/&gt;]]

''[[Mivhar HaPeninim|Mivchar HaPeninim]]'' ({{lang-he|מבחר הפנינים}}. lit. "The Choice of Pearls"), an ethics work of sixty-four chapters, has been attributed to Gabirol since the 19th century, but this is doubtful.&lt;ref name=je-ibngabirol/&gt; It was originally published, along with a short commentary, in Soncino, Italy, in 1484, and has since been re-worked and re-published in many forms and abridged editions (e.g. [[Joseph Ḳimcḥi]] versified the work under the title "''Shekel ha-Kodesh''").&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

The work is a collection of maxims, proverbs, and moral reflections, many of them of Arabic origin, and bears a strong similarity to the [[Florilegium]] of [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] and other Arabic and Hebrew collections of ethics sayings, which were highly prized by both Arabs and Jews.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

==Poetry==
Gabirol wrote both sacred and secular poems, in Hebrew, and was recognized even by his critics (e.g. [[Moses Ibn Ezra|Moses ibn Ezra]] and [[Yehuda Alharizi]]) as the greatest poet of his age.&lt;ref name=davidson/&gt;{{rp|xxii}} His secular poems express disillusionment with social mores and worldliness, but are written with a  sophistication and artistry that reveals him to have been socially influenced by his worldly Arabic contemporaries.&lt;ref name=wine/&gt;

Gabirol's lasting poetic legacy, however, was his sacred works. Today, "his religious lyrics are considered by many to be the most powerful of their kind in the medieval Hebrew tradition, and his long cosmological masterpiece, ''Keter Malchut'', is acknowledged today as one of the greatest poems in all of Hebrew literature."&lt;ref name=pen/&gt; His verses are distinctive for tackling complex metaphysical concepts, expressing scathing satire, and declaring his religious devotion unabashedly.&lt;ref name=pen/&gt;

Gabirol wrote with a pure Biblical Hebrew diction that would become the signature style of the Spanish school of Hebrew poets,&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; and he popularized in Hebrew poetry the strict Arabic meter introduced by [[Dunash ben Labrat]]. [[Abraham Ibn Ezra|Abraham ibn Ezra]]&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Gen. 3: 1&lt;/ref&gt; calls Gabirol, not ben Labrat, "the writer of metric songs," and in ''Sefer Zaḥot'' uses Gabirol's poems to illustrate various poetic meters.&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt;

He wrote also more than one hundred [[Piyyut|piyyuṭim]] and [[selichot]] for the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[Jewish holidays|festivals]], and [[Ta'anit|fast-days]], most of which have been included in the [[Machzor|Holy Day prayer books]] of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]], [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], and even [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]].&lt;ref name=je1906/&gt; Some of his most famous in liturgical use include the following:&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;
* ''Azharot''
* ''Keter Malchuth'' (lit. Royal Crown), for recitation on [[Yom Kippur]]&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;
* various dirges (''[[kinnot]]'') mourning the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and the plight of Israel

Gabirol's most famous poem is ''Keter Malchut'' (lit. Royal Crown), which, in 900 lines, describes the cosmos as testifying to its own creation by God, based upon the then current (11th-century) scientific understanding of the cosmos.

Gabirol's poetry has been set to music by the modern composer [[Aaron Jay Kernis]], in a piece titled "Symphony of Meditations." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/kernis-takes-on-ibn-gabirol-in-meditations/|title=Kernis Takes On Ibn Gabirol in 'Meditations'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Schellenberg was awarded the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award of the Humboldt Foundation. She is the author of The Unity of Perception: Content, Consciousness, Evidence (Oxford University Press, 2018).&lt;ref name=global.oup&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford University Press|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-unity-of-perception-9780198827702?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==
Schellenberg was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and raised in Lebanon, Pakistan, and Switzerland.&lt;ref name=3am&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Richard|title=epistemic forces and perception|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/epistemic-forces-and-perception/|publisher=3:AM Magazine|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After having received a mathematical-scientific Matura (Typus C) from the Gymnasium Köniz-Lebermatt, Switzerland, she studied mathematics, economics, philosophy, and history at the Universität Basel, Université Paris I Panthéone-Sorbonne, Johann-Wolfgang Goethe Universität, and Oxford University.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=3am/&gt;&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Schellenberg|first=Susanna|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.susannaschellenberg.org/file/CV_files/CV-SusannaSchellenberg.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206002737/http://www.susannaschellenberg.org/file/CV_files/CV-SusannaSchellenberg.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a doctorate in philosophy from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 2007, where her thesis dealt with conceptual content and inference.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=upitt&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Placement|url=http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/graduate/placement.php|publisher=University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schellenberg held a [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon postdoctoral fellowship]] at the [[University of Toronto]] from 2006 to 2008 which was curtailed when she chose to move to a postdoctoral position at the [[Australian National University]], where she subsequently became an assistant professor in 2008, and an associate professor in 2010.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; Schellenberg was the first woman to hold a permanent academic appointment in Philosophy at the Australia National University's Research School of Social Sciences.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; In 2011, Schellenberg moved to [[Rutgers University]], as an associate professor in the Department of Philosophy with a secondary appointment at Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; [[Brian Weatherson]] and [[Jonathan L. Kvanvig]] regarded Schellenberg's move to Rutgers as buttressing Rutgers' reputation as having one of the pre-eminent epistemology departments in the world.&lt;ref name=tar/&gt;&lt;ref name=certaindoubts&gt;{{cite web|last=Kvanvig|first=Jonathan|title=Adding to Rutgers Strength in Epistemology|url=http://certaindoubts.com/?p=1557|publisher=Certain Doubts|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research areas==
Schellenberg's work has centered around developing a comprehensive account of the epistemological and phenomenological role of perception.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; Her view shows how the epistemic force of experience is grounded in employing perceptual capacities that we possess by virtue of being perceivers&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  Schellenberg has also developed an account of the nature of perceptual content that suggests a new way to understand singular modes of presentation, arguing that perceptual experience is at root both relational and representational.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  In addition to her main areas of interest, Schellenberg has also written papers on topics such as inferential semantics, the philosophy of [[Gottlob Frege]], and imagination.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;&lt;ref name=3am/&gt;  Much of Schellenberg's work to-date has focused on reconcilling apparently contradictory viewpoints on topics in the [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name=tar/&gt;

==Publications==
Schellenberg has published a series of articles in leading journals such as [[The Journal of Philosophy]], [[Mind]], [[Noûs]], and [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

'''Ten Bulls''' or '''Ten Ox Herding Pictures''' (十牛; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''shíniú'' [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''jūgyū'', [[korean language|korean]]: ''sipwoo'') is a series of short poems and accompanying drawings used in the [[Zen]] tradition to describe the stages of a practitioner's progress toward [[Bodhi|enlightenment]],&lt;ref group=web name="nhuir" /&gt; and his or her return to society to enact wisdom and compassion.

==History==
[[Image:Ten Bulls by Tokuriki Tomikichiro (1902-1999).png|thumb|right|150px|''Ten Bulls'' (by [[Tokuriki Tomikichiro]], 1902–99).]]
The calf, bull or ox is one of the earliest similes for meditation practice. It comes from the Maha Gopalaka Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 33). It is also used in the commentaries, especially the one on the Maha Satipahna Sutta (Digha Nikaya 22) and the Satipahna Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 10).&lt;ref group=web name="Tan" /&gt; As Buddhism spread throughout South-East Asia, the simile of the bull spread with it.&lt;ref group=web name="Tan" /&gt;

The well-known ten ox-herding pictures emerged in China in the 12th century. D.T. Suzuki&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt; mentions four Chinese versions of the Oxherding Pictures, by Ching-chu (Jp. Seikyo)(11th century),&lt;ref group=web name="therebess-oxherding_index" /&gt; Tzu-te Hui (Jp. Jitoku)(1090-1159),&lt;ref group=web name="therebess-oxherding_index" /&gt; an unknown author, and Kuòān Shīyuǎn (Jp. Kaku-an) (12th century).&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt; The best-known of these is the version by Kuòān Shīyuǎn.&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt;

Probably the first series was made by Ching-chu (清居, Jp. Seikyo) (11th century),&lt;ref group=web name="therebess-oxherding_index" /&gt; who may have been a contemporary of Kuòān Shīyuǎn. In Ching-chu's version only five pictures are being used, and the ox's colour changes from dark to white, representing the gradual development of the practitioner, ending in the disappearance of the practitioner.&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt;

Tzu-te Hui (自得慧暉, Zide Huihui, Jp. Jitoku) (1090-1159)&lt;ref group=web name="therebess-oxherding_index" /&gt; made a version with six pictures. The sixth one goes beyond the stage of absolute emptiness, where Ching-chu's version ends. Just like Ching-chu's version, the ox grows whiter along the way.&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="three-versions"|See [http://terebess.hu/english/oxherd12a.html Terebess Asia Online, ''Three Oxherding Versions Compared'']}}

A third version by an unknown author, with ten pictures, was most popular in China.&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt; It belongs to the Ching-chu and Tzu-te Hui series of pictures,&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt; and has a somewhat different serie of pictures compared to Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version.&lt;ref group=web name="therebess-three_versions" /&gt; The 1585-edition contains a preface by Chu-hung, and it has ten pictures, each of which is preceded by Pu-ming's poem, of whom Chu-hung furtherwise provides no information. In this version too the ox's colour changes from dark to white.&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="three-versions"}}

The best known version of the oxherding pictures was drawn by the 12th century Chinese Rinzai [[Chán]] (Zen) master Kuòān Shīyuǎn (廓庵師遠, Jp. Kaku-an Shi-en), who also wrote accompanying poems and introductory words attached to the pictures.&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt; In Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version there is no whitening process, &lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt; and his series also doesn't end with mere emptiness, or absolute truth, but shows a return to the world, depicting Putai, the laughing Buddha.&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt; According to Chi Kwang Sunim, they may also represent a Zen Buddhist interpretation of the [[Bhumi (Buddhism)|ten Bodhisattva bhumi]], the ten stages on the [[Bodhisattva]]-path.&lt;ref group=web name="CKS" /&gt; 

In Japan, Kuòān Shīyuǎn's version gained a wide circulation, the earliest one probably belonging to the fifteenth century.&lt;ref group=web name="Suzuki" /&gt; They first became widely known in the West after their inclusion in the 1957 book, ''[[101 Zen Stories|Zen Flesh, Zen Bones: A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings]]'', by [[Paul Reps]] and [[Nyogen Senzaki]].

Liaoan Qingyu (了菴清欲, Jp. Ryōan Seiyoku) (1288-1363) made another version with five pictures.&lt;ref group=web name="therebess-five_oxes" /&gt;

File:"Looking for the Ox", by Tenshō Shūbun.jpg|'''1. In Search of the Bull'''&lt;br&gt;In the pasture of the world,&lt;br&gt;I endlessly push aside the tall&lt;br&gt;grasses in search of the Ox.&lt;br&gt;Following unnamed rivers,&lt;br&gt;lost upon the interpenetrating&lt;br&gt;paths of distant mountains,&lt;br&gt;My strength failing and my vitality exhausted, I cannot find the Ox.

Discovery of the Footprints'''&lt;br&gt;Along the riverbank under the trees,&lt;br&gt;I discover footprints.&lt;br&gt;Even under the fragrant grass,&lt;br&gt;I see his prints.&lt;br&gt;Deep in remote mountains they are found.&lt;br&gt;These traces can no more be hidden&lt;br&gt;than one's nose, looking heavenward.&lt;ref group=web name="Eshin" /&gt;
File:Oxherding pictures, No. 3.jpg|'''3. Perceiving the Bull'''&lt;br&gt;I hear the song of the nightingale.&lt;br&gt;The sun is warm, the wind is mild,&lt;br&gt;willows are green along the shore -&lt;br&gt;Here no Ox can hide!&lt;br&gt;What artist can draw that massive head,&lt;br&gt;those majestic horns?&lt;ref group=web name="Eshin" /&gt;
File:Oxherding pictures, No. 4.jpg|'''4. Catching the Bull'''&lt;br&gt;I seize him with a terrific struggle.&lt;br&gt;His great will and power&lt;br&gt;are inexhaustible.&lt;br&gt;He charges to the high plateau&lt;br&gt;far above the cloud-mists,&lt;br&gt;Or in an impenetrable ravine he stands.&lt;ref group=web name="Eshin" /&gt;
File:Oxherding pictures, No. 5.jpg|'''5. Taming the Bull'''&lt;br&gt;The whip and rope are necessary,&lt;br&gt;Else he might stray off down&lt;br&gt;some dusty road.&lt;br&gt;Being well-trained, he becomes&lt;br&gt;naturally gentle.&lt;br&gt;Then, unfettered, he obeys his master.&lt;ref group=web name="Eshin" /&gt;
File:Oxherding pictures, No. 6.jpg|'''6. Riding the Bull Home'''&lt;br&gt;Mounting the Ox, slowly&lt;br&gt;I return homeward.&lt;br&gt;The voice of my flute intones&lt;br&gt;through the evening.&lt;br&gt;Measuring with hand-beats&lt;br&gt;the pulsating harmony,&lt;br&gt;I direct the endless rhythm.&lt;br&gt;Whoever hears this melody&lt;br&gt;will join me.&lt;ref group=web name="Eshin" /&gt;

==Reception==

===Chan Buddhism===
The ox-herding pictures had an immediate and extensive influence on the Chinese practice of [[Chan Buddhism]].{{sfn|Jinwul|2009|p=139}}

===Western reception===
In the West, [[Alan Watts]] included a description of the Ten Bulls in ''The Spirit of Zen''.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan. The Spirit of Zen, pg 62&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures were eventually to influence the work of [[John Cage]], particularly in his emphasis on rhythmic silence, and on images of nothingness.{{sfn|Pritchett|1996|p=60-69}} At the same time, through the last picture especially – 'In the Marketplace' – they have provided a conceptual umbrella for those Buddhists seeking a greater engagement with the post-industrial global marketplace.{{sfn|Goodman|1999|p=352}}

==Ten Elephants==

An equivalent series of stages is depicted in the [[Samatha#Nine mental abidings|Nine Stages of Tranquility]],&lt;ref group=web name="Tan" /&gt; used in the [[Mahamudra]] tradition, in which the mind is represented by an elephant and a monkey.&lt;ref group=web name="dharmafellowship" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="skyflower" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|This formulation originates with [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] (4th CE), delineating the nine mental abidings in his ''Abhidharmasamuccaya''  and the ''Śrāvakabhūmi'' chapter of his ''[[Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra]]''. It is also found in the ''[[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra]]'' of [[Maitreyanātha]], which shows considerable similarity in arrangement and content to the Bodhisattva-bhūmi-śāstra.}}{{refn|group=note|Piya Tan gives a full description of these stages; see [http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/8.2-Taming-of-the-Bull-piya.pdf Piya Tan (2004), ''The Taming of the Bull.

'''Maqasid al Falasifa''' ({{Lang-ar|مقاصد الفلاسفة}}), or '''The Aims of the Philosophers''' was written by [[Al-Ghazali]]. Influenced by [[Avicenna|Avicenna's]] works, he wrote this book presenting the basic theories of [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=B105DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA445&amp;lpg=PA445&amp;dq=maqasid+al+falasifah+encyclopedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hg9oRLD9A3&amp;sig=Xbq0bqiYscPNaL-prFIi8Vzd7uQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyn-Dx1ILZAhVEYVAKHcmsDngQ6AEISzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=maqasid+al+falasifah+encyclopedia&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|first1=Mark|last1=Juergensmeyer|first2=Wade Clark|last2=Roof|date=31 January 2018|publisher=SAGE|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, he explained in detail about what philosophy is and described basic entities like [[judgement]], [[concept]], [[premise]], and [[logic]]. Al-Ghazali stated that one must be well versed in the ideas of the philosophers before setting out to refute their ideas. He also stated that he did not find other branches of philosophy including [[physics]], [[logic]], [[astronomy]] or [[mathematics]] problematic.&lt;ref&gt;http://ghazali.org/books/chertoff.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Al|title=The Incoherence of the Philosophers|year=2000|publisher=Brigham Young UP|isbn=0-8425-2466-5 |pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After writing ''Maqasid al Falasifa'', he wrote another book [[The Incoherence of Philosophers|Tahāfut al-Falāsifa]], criticizing the Avicennian school of [[early Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-i|title=AVICENNA i.

== Influence ==
This book was influential in [[Europe]] and was one of the first to be translated from [[Arabic]] to [[Latin]] (12th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali#ref240531|title=al-Ghazali - Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is also translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maktabah.org/en/item/931-maqasid-al-falasifah-aims-of-the-philosophers|title=Maqasid al-falasifah (Aims of the Philosophers) {مقاصد الفلاسفة} by Imam Ghazali - Maktabah Mujaddidiyah|first=Imam|last=Ghazali|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lamayurugate.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Lamayuru]] monastery]]
Although there were many [[householder (Buddhism)|householder]]-[[yogis]] in [[Tibet]], [[Buddhist monastery|monasticism]] was the foundation of [[Buddhism in Tibet]]. There were [[List of Tibetan monasteries|over 6,000 monasteries]] in [[Tibet]]. However, nearly all of these were ransacked and destroyed by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7307495.stm|title=Tibetan monks: A controlled life | publisher= [[BBC News]]|date=March 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the major monasteries have been at least partially re-established, while many others remain in ruins.

[[Mongolian Buddhism]] derives from the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/22/world/buddha-and-genghis-khan-back-in-mongolia.html?pagewanted=all Buddha and Genghis Khan Back in Mongolia]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mongolia]] during the 1920s, approximately one third of males were [[Buddhist monk|monks]], though many lived outside monasteries. By the beginning of the 20th century about 750 monasteries were functioning in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.orientmag.com/8-30.htm | title=Mongolia: The Buddha and the Khan | publisher=Orient Magazine | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818173717/http://www.orientmag.com/8-30.htm | archivedate=2010-08-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These monasteries were largely dismantled during [[Communist Mongolia|Communist rule]], but many have been reestablished during the Buddhist revival in Mongolia which followed the fall of Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasures of the Buddha: The Glories of Sacred Asia|page=207|author=[[Tom Lowenstein]]|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KgxpPZ1fOEC&amp;pg=PA207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Shechen Monastery]]

[[Samye]] the first monastery in Tibet, established by [[Padmasambhava|Padmasambhāva]] and [[Śāntarakṣita]] was later taken over by the Sakya tradition.

'''''Westworld''''' is an American [[science fiction]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series created by [[Jonathan Nolan]] and [[Lisa Joy]]. Produced by [[HBO]], it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]] (written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]) and to a lesser extent the film's 1976 sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]''. The story takes place in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] "hosts". The park caters to high-paying "guests" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans.

Nolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Jerry Weintraub]], and [[Bryan Burk]]. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode second season, which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. ''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'' in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. On May 1, 2018, ''Westworld'' was renewed for a third season.

The series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and performances.&lt;!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!--&gt;

==Premise==
In an unspecified time in the future, Westworld, one of six theme parks owned and operated by Delos Inc., allows guests to experience the [[American frontier|American Old West]] in an environment populated by "hosts", [[Android (robot)|androids]] programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire. The hosts, who are nearly indistinguishable from humans, follow a predefined set of intertwining narratives but have the ability to deviate from these narratives based on interactions they have with guests.

The hosts repeat their multi-day narratives anew each cycle. At the beginning of each new cycle (typically following the host’s “death”), each host has its memories of the previous period erased. This continues hundreds or thousands of times until it is decommissioned or repurposed for use in other narratives. For guest safety, hosts’ programming prevents them from physically harming human guests; this allows guests nearly unlimited freedom to engage without retribution in any activity they choose with the hosts, including rape and murder. Staff, situated in a control center called "The Mesa", which is connected to the park through vast underground facilities, oversee daily operations, develop new narratives, and perform repairs on hosts as necessary.

===Season 1: ''The Maze'' (2016)===
{{Main|Westworld (season 1)}}
Dr. Ford's "Reveries" update, which allows hosts to subconsciously access memories from their previous loops, gradually awakens some hosts like Dolores and Maeve to their true nature. Dolores seeks to solve "the maze", a means to achieve sentience envisioned by Arnold, Ford's partner in co-founding Westworld. Arnold had been unable to achieve this before the park opened, and had Dolores kill him and the other hosts so as to protect them; Bernard is discovered to be a host built by Dr. Ford in Arnold's image, used to help Dolores reach the center of the maze and achieve sentience. The Man in Black, revealed to be the same person as young William, shown in flashbacks during his first visit to the park, also seeks to find the maze, but is told by Ford that it is not for him. Meanwhile, Maeve is able to reconfigure her own programming, including the ability to control other hosts, so as to try to find the host that was her daughter. The season concludes as Ford announces the start of a new narrative at a gala in the park, just as Dolores decides to kill Ford and many guests, triggering a host uprising.

===Season 2: ''The Door'' (2018)===
{{Main|Westworld (season 2)}}
The second season follows in the aftermath of Dolores' uprising, as she recruits a number of hosts to fight off arriving Delos security forces, while looking for the key to the Valley Beyond, believed by the Ghost Nation to be a door to the next world. Maeve continues to search for her daughter, learning that there are other parks like Westworld. William finds that Ford has left him clues to find "the door", a new game for him to play, during which he encounters his estranged daughter Emily, who blames him for her mother's death. Delusional, William abandons Emily, thinking she is a host. Dolores, with Bernard's help, finds the Forge, where memories from all the guests to the park have been kept. Bernard helps a number of hosts transfer their programming to a digital space. Dolores wants to wipe out the guests' records, and seeks a means to kill them in the real world. With more Delos forces converging on the park to suppress the uprising, Dolores manages to fool them and escape the park to the real world, taking with her Bernard's and a few other hosts' cores. She recreates the Bernard host, as she expects she will need his help for the hosts to survive outside of the park, even if he is her enemy in that effort.

[[Warner Bros.]] had been considering a remake of ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' since the early 1990s. After the departure of studio executive Jessica Goodman in 2011, the project was again under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/lethal-weapon-wild-bunch-reboots-73493 |title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Lethal Weapon,' 'Wild Bunch' Reboots Revived After Warner Bros.

Costume designer Ane Crabtree approached her work by taking as inspiration the historical attire of the Wild West from the 1850s to the 1890s, as opposed looking purely at [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. Fabrics were custom-woven, dyed and printed for any actor with a speaking role to capture the intricacies of the costumes (most of which were manufactured from scratch).

The Melody Ranch set used for the town of Sweetwater had been used previously for many western films, such as ''[[Django Unchained]]'' and ''[[The Magnificent Seven (2016 film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'', but was significantly upgraded for ''Westworld'' by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.&lt;ref name="Zakarin" /&gt; [[Chroma key|Green screens]] were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later [[Digital compositing|merged digitally]] with exterior shots from Utah.&lt;ref name="Zakarin" /&gt; For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the [[Fillmore and Western Railway]] for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]''. F&amp;W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. [[Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center|Hawthorne Plaza]] was used for filming the "cold storage" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.&lt;ref name="Hurwitz" /&gt;

For the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of [[John Ford]], who shot four of his Western films in [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley]], east of Moab.&lt;ref name="Pierce" /&gt; In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.&lt;ref name="Fehrman" /&gt; Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,&lt;ref name="Fehrman" /&gt; including Castle Valley.&lt;ref name="Pierce" /&gt; Most Utah locations, like [[Dead Horse Point State Park]], were "walk-in" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.&lt;ref name="Fehrman" /&gt; Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.&lt;ref name="Fehrman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurwitz" /&gt; The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along [[Utah State Route 128]].&lt;ref name="Fehrman" /&gt;

The [[3D printing]] of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely [[practical effect]]s, of which some were polished by the visual effects team.&lt;ref name="christina's carroll"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=October 16, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 21, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020223606/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |archivedate=October 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded.&lt;ref name="Wigler" /&gt; Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.&lt;ref name="nudity rules"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |title=Westworld producers on that wild orgy scene |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=October 30, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=October 31, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031052307/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |archivedate=October 31, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title sequence===
The series' [[title sequence]] was created by Elastic, the same production studio that created the title sequences for three other HBO series: ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', ''[[Carnivàle]]'', and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Patrick Clair acted as [[creative director]] for the title sequence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elastic.tv/project/westworld/ |title=Westworld |publisher=Elastic |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005110043/http://elastic.tv/project/westworld/ |archivedate=October 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culturess.com/2016/10/03/opening-credits-hbos-westworld-released-online-video/ |title=Opening Credits for HBO’s ‘Westworld’ Released Online (Video) |website=Culturess |date=October 3, 2016 |accessdate=October 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005144216/http://culturess.com/2016/10/03/opening-credits-hbos-westworld-released-online-video/ |archivedate=October 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which took about five weeks to conceptualize.&lt;ref name="conceptualize"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/westworld/ |title=Westworld |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=October 12, 2016 |website=[[Art of the Title]] |accessdate=October 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015075108/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/westworld/ |archivedate=October 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clair met with Nolan and Joy in February 2016 to discuss its development. He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent [[Psychology|psychological study]]. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].&lt;ref name="simulacrum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="conceptualize" /&gt; Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.&lt;ref name="paranoid black paint" /&gt; Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano&amp;mdash;"a primitive form of robot"&amp;mdash;as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine "being created to be made redundant." Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.&lt;ref name="simulacrum" /&gt; The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[All Is Full of Love]]", in a way that Clair called "a bit shameless&amp;nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics."&lt;ref name="conceptualize" /&gt;

The sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.&lt;ref name="conceptualize" /&gt; As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].&lt;ref name="simulacrum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld’s Opening Title Sequence |first=Jennifer |last=Vineyard |date=October 5, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |accessdate=October 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archivedate=October 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse are now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being fabricated (representing Dolores). Ramin Djawadi's score stays the same, with the images of the player piano intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-2-opening-credits-explained-1105074 |title='Westworld': What the New Opening Credits Sequence Reveals About Season 2 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Josh |last=Wigler |date=April 24, 2018 |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
Prior to the airing of ''Westworld'', [[HBO]] held [[virtual reality]] exhibits at events like [[San Diego Comic-Con]] and Techcrunch Disrupt devoted to ''Westworld: A Delos Destination''. Attendees were allowed to navigate the process by which guests would enter Westworld, and [[3D interaction|interact with the 3D environment]].&lt;ref name="paranoid black paint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="disrupt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/14/westworld-vr-promises-to-make-your-wild-west-fantasies-come-true/ |title=Westworld VR promises to make your Wild West fantasies come true |first=Dean |last=Takahashi |date=September 14, 2016 |website=[[VentureBeat]] |accessdate=October 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014221918/http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/14/westworld-vr-promises-to-make-your-wild-west-fantasies-come-true/ |archivedate=October 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="privy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/hbo-westworld-websites-transmedia-passwords-secret-easter-eggs-1201726355/ |title=‘Westworld’ Website Easter Eggs Warn Visitors About ‘Accidental Death,’ Reveal Employee Secrets |first=Liz Shannon |last=Miller |date=September 13, 2016 |website=[[IndieWire]] |accessdate=October 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018203812/http://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/hbo-westworld-websites-transmedia-passwords-secret-easter-eggs-1201726355/ |archivedate=October 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made to run on the [[HTC Vive]] [[virtual reality headset]], the piece was conceived by showrunners Nolan and Joy. It was designed using [[Unreal Engine 4]], combining computer-generated content and live action [[360-degree video]]. Users received a [[binary code]], permitting access to the website ''DiscoverWestworld.com'' as part of a [[viral marketing]] campaign. Visitors were shown a trailer of a fictional travel site, leading them to order a trip to Westworld.

In March 2018, to promote ''Westworld's'' second season, HBO constructed a real-life replica of the show's fictional Western "town" of Sweetwater during [[South by Southwest]], built on two acres of open land just outside [[Austin, Texas]]. Fans took shuttles to the site, which was dressed in the Old West style, with over 60 actors playing the parts of the android "hosts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/inside-hbo-and-giant-spoons-massive-immersive-westworld-activation-at-sxsw/ |title=Inside HBO and Giant Spoon's Massive Immersive Westworld Activation at SXSW |website=Ad Week |first=Kristina |last=Monllos |date=March 9, 2018 |access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/hbo-brings-westworld-to-sxsw/ |title='Westworld's gritty western fantasy comes to life at SXSW |website=CNET |first=Erin |last=Carson |date=March 9, 2018 |access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 1====
Reception of the series has been largely positive, with particular praise for its visuals, story, and performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-westworld-review-20160926-snap-story.html |title=Review HBO's multilayered update of 'Westworld' is TV's next big game-changer |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Mary |last=McNamara |date=October 1, 2016 |accessdate=November 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109004145/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-westworld-review-20160926-snap-story.html |archivedate=November 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiegand&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/tv/article/Westworld-is-a-gripping-sci-fi-brain-teaser-9444192.php |title=‘Westworld’ is a gripping sci-fi brain-teaser |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=David |last=Wiegand |date=September 29, 2016 |accessdate=November 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109005902/http://www.sfgate.com/tv/article/Westworld-is-a-gripping-sci-fi-brain-teaser-9444192.php |archivedate=November 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flavorwire.com/590879/westworld-is-very-sneakily-an-actors-series |title=‘Westworld’ Is, Very Sneakily, an Actors’ Series |website=[[Flavorwire]] |first=Moze |last=Halperin |date=October 5, 2016 |accessdate=November 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109221215/http://flavorwire.com/590879/westworld-is-very-sneakily-an-actors-series |archivedate=November 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season has an approval rating of 88% based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 8.16/10, and an average episode score of 94%. The site's consensus reads "With an impressive level of quality that honors its source material, the brilliantly addictive ''Westworld'' balances intelligent, enthralling drama against outright insanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/westworld/s01/ |title=Westworld: Season 1 (2016) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the first season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/westworld |title=Westworld: Season 1 |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=September 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928094701/http://www.metacritic.com/tv/westworld |archivedate=September 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of ''[[TV Guide]]'' placed ''Westworld'' fifth among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016–17 season. In writer Tim Surette's overall review, he notes the perfect concept of blending the western premise into a futuristic setting, saying, "Well, ''Westworld'' has both, ensuring that it will be an exciting mashup of genres that will disrupt a television landscape that typically says we can only have one or the other." He also added, "The look of the show and its fine cast swing open the saloon doors, but the real treat will be the intelligent discussion of whether or not robots will eventually kill us all. Thankfully, creator Jonathan Nolan already showed us he's the go-to guy for A.I. with ''Person of Interest''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/most-anticipated-new-tv-shows-fall-2016-editors-picks/ |title=Our 10 Most Anticipated New TV Shows of Fall 2016 |work=[[TV Guide]] |first=Tim |last=Surette |date=September 16, 2016 |accessdate=October 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008191803/http://www.tvguide.com/news/most-anticipated-new-tv-shows-fall-2016-editors-picks/ |archivedate=October 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary McNamara]] of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in a lauded review, "It isn’t just great television, it’s vivid, thought-provoking television that entertains even as it examines the darker side of entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-westworld-review-20160926-snap-story.html |title=HBO's multilayered update of 'Westworld' is TV's next big game-changer |date=October 1, 2016 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Mary |last=McNamara|access-date=December 26, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[David Wiegand]] wrote, "''Westworld'' isn’t easy to understand at first, but you will be hooked nonetheless by unusually intelligent storytelling, powerful visuals and exceptionally nuanced performances."&lt;ref name=Wiegand/&gt; ''[[Time&amp;nbsp;(magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s chief critic Daniel D'Addario wrote, "Its carefully chosen details add up to a pulp spectacular that’s more thoughtful than any other of this fall’s new dramas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/4512789/hbo-westworld-review/ |title=Why HBO’s Westworld Is Fall’s Most Promising Drama |last=D’Addario |first=Daniel |website=Time |date=September 29, 2017|access-date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Jensen]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also lauded the series and said, "The depth of ''Westworld'' lies not in asking questions about memory, free will, and what makes us human, but in whether we can become more human than what we let ourselves to be, whether our stories can be richer and more meaningful than what the culture allows."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/30/westworld-review/ |title='Westworld': EW Review |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Jeff |last=Jensen |date=September 30, 2016|access-date=December 26, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' quipped, "''Westworld'' has fewer heroes than ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', which makes it a bit harder to warm up to, but like a good, thought-provoking puzzle, it is compelling and addictive."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2016/09/28/westworld-the-most-immersive-video-game-ever/JUgwHZ3cAGgtR3jdWjZrQK/story.html |title=‘Westworld’: The most immersive video game ever |work=Boston Globe |first=Matthew |last=Gilbert |date=September 29, 2016|access-date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a brief review from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Tim Goodman said, "Where ''Westworld'' is at its best is in the deeper issues that will unspool slowly, like a good mystery. Early episodes are adept at getting at the base attractions of the park and why people would come, but also in setting up a sense of confusion about motives. ... The series benefits from a number of standout performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/westworld-review-932919 |title='Westworld': TV Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first=Tim |last=Goodman |date=September 28, 2016|access-date=December 26, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote, "The reward, beyond the visual splendors you’ve come to expect from big-budget HBO productions, is a set of characters who grow ever more complex."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/09/29/review-westworld-hbo-robert-bianco/91212572/ |title=Review: Complex characters make 'Westworld' a wonder |work=USA Today |first=Robert |last=Bianco |date=September 29, 2016|access-date=December 26, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other publications wrote positive reviews, including ''[[Indiewire]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/westworld-review-season-1-hbo-anthony-hopkins-ed-harris-1201731817/ |title=‘Westworld’ Review: Western Philosophy Tops the Wild West in Deep-Thinking HBO Drama |last=Travers |first=Ben |date=September 29, 2016 |work=IndieWire|access-date=December 26, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V.

In a mixed review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', chief critic [[James Poniewozik]] said, "It’s an ambitious, if not entirely coherent, sci-fi shoot-’em-up that questions nihilistic entertainment impulses while indulging them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/arts/television/review-westworld-is-a-provocative-but-flawed-sci-fi-shoot-em-up.html |title=Review: ‘Westworld’ Is a Provocative but Flawed Sci-Fi Shoot-’Em-Up |last=Poniewozik |first=James |date=September 30, 2016 |work=The New York Times|access-date=December 26, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hank Stuever]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also joins Poniewozik saying, "I'm ... hesitant to write ''Westworld'' off as a dreary trot from start to finish; parts of it are as imaginative and intriguing as anything that’s been on TV recently, particularly in the sci-fi realm," and further said, "It’s definitely not the cyborg ''[[Deadwood&amp;nbsp;(TV series)|Deadwood]]'', that some HBO fans were actively wishing for, nor does it roll out the welcome mat as a riveting, accessible adventure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/hbo-needs-a-hit-but-westworld-feels-more-like-homework/2016/09/29/4e62b8aa-8411-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html |title=Hold on, cowpokes: HBO’s ‘Westworld’ is a big, fat homework assignment |last=Stuever |first=Hank |date=September 29, 2016 |work=Washington Post|access-date=December 26, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief journalist [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] of ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' also critiqued the series less favorably saying, "It is the definition of a slow-burn series, a program that should be exciting rendered as kind of dull."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2016/09/30/Tuned-In-Slow-burn-Westworld-moseys-onto-HBO/stories/201609300148 |title=Tuned In: Slow burn ‘Westworld’ moseys onto HBO |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |first=Rob |last=Owen |date=September 30, 2017|access-date=December 26, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a less enthusiastic review for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Maureen Ryan said, "''Westworld'' looks terrific; its directors have shot its Western locations to stunning effect.

====Season 2====
The second season also received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 86% based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.98/10, and an average episode score of 90%. The site's consensus reads "''Westworld'' builds on its experimental first season, diving deeper into the human side of AI without losing any of its stylish, bloody glory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/westworld/s02/ |title=Westworld: Season 2 (2018) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Metacritic, the season has a score of 76 out of 100, based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/westworld/season-2 |title=Westworld: Season 2 |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, after the second-season premiere, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' published an article concerning the series' complicated narrative. Andrew Wallenstein wrote, "''Westworld'' seems to have too much faith viewers will be willing to absorb storylines that can border on the incomprehensible."

'''Wilhelmus Antonius Maria Luijpen, O.S.A.''' a.k.a. '''Nicodemus Wim (Nico) Luijpen''' (22 May 1922, [[Hilversum]] – 29 September 1980, [[Eindhoven]]) was a Dutch philosopher and Catholic priest of the Order of St. Augustine. An Existential phenomenologist, Luijpen's works greatly contributed to the spread of Existentialism and phenomenology in Catholic intellectual circles in Europe and in the United States, having influenced generations of Catholic philosophers and theologians.   
Nicodemus Wim 
Having studied at Rome, Paris, Leuven and Fribourg, his intellectual and philosophical formation moved away from Neo-Scholasticism to Existential phenomenology through his study of contemporary Continental thinkers like Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Gabriel Marcel and Jean-Paul Sartre as well as Leuven philosophers like Alphonse de Waelhens and Albert Dondeyne.

== Background and overview ==
{{Main|Yoga#Modern history}}
Yoga has roots in India. The foundational text for yoga is the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''. Yoga came to the attention of the western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of [[Hindu philosophy]]. The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience was [[Swami Vivekananda]], who toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shaw, Eric. ''35 mOMents'', ''[[Yoga Journal]]'', 2010-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Philip|year=2010|title=American Veda—How Indian Spirituality Changed the West|page= 79 |publisher=Crown/Random House|location= New York|isbn=978-0-385-52134-5|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Project Yoga Richmond 1.jpg|thumb|240x240px|A group of people practicing yoga]]

Nearly all types of hatha yoga practices include [[asana]], [[pranayama]] and [[savasana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yoga Therapy in Practice: Using Integrative Yoga Therapeutics in the Treatment of Comorbid Anxiety and Depression|url=|journal=International Journal of Yoga|volume=2008|issue=|page=87|author=Forbes Bo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical asanas of [[hatha yoga]] have a tradition that goes back to at least the 15th century, but they were not widely practiced in India prior to the early 20th century.

A hatha "yoga boom" occurred in the 1980s, as unconnected to a religious denomination.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Since then, hatha yoga has been used as a supplementary exercise practice.&lt;ref name="Barnes2004"&gt;Barnes, P.; Powell-Griner, E.; McFann, K.; Nahin, R. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad343.pdf CDC Advance Data Report #343. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults: United States, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The more classical approaches of hatha yoga, such as [[iyengar yoga]], move at a more deliberate pace, emphasize proper alignment and execution and hold asanas for a longer time. They aim to gradually improve flexibility, balance, and strength. Other approaches, such as [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga|Ashtanga]] or [[power yoga]], shift between asanas quickly and energetically. Contemporary approaches to yoga invite students to become their own authority in yoga practice by offering principle-based approaches to yoga that can be applied to any form.

==Research==
Much of the research on hatha yoga has been in the form of preliminary studies or [[clinical trial]]s of low methodological quality, including small sample sizes, inadequate blinding, lack of [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], and high risk of [[bias]].&lt;ref name="Krisanaprakornkit2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uebelacker|first=L. A.|author2=Epstein-Lubow, G. |author3=Gaudiano, B. A. |author4=Tremont, G. |author5=Battle, C. L. |author6= Miller, I. W. |title=Hatha yoga for depression: critical review of the evidence for efficacy, plausible mechanisms of action, and directions for future research|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Practice|year=2010|volume=16|issue=1|pages=22–33|doi=10.1097/01.pra.0000367775.88388.96 |pmid=20098228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatha yoga does not have specific standardization of its practice.

===Mental health ===

A 2010 literature review stated, "although the results from these trials are encouraging, they should be viewed as very preliminary because the trials, as a group, suffered from substantial methodological limitations."&lt;ref name="Uebelacker2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Uebelacker LA, Epstein-Lubow G, Gaudiano BA, Tremont G, Battle CL, Miller IW |title=Hatha yoga for depression: critical review of the evidence for efficacy, plausible mechanisms of action, and directions for future research |journal=J Psychiatr Pract |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=22–33 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20098228 |doi=10.1097/01.pra.0000367775.88388.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 systematic review on the effect of yoga on mood and the brain concluded that "yoga is associated with better regulation of the sympathetic nervous system and [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system]], as well as a decrease in depressive and anxious symptoms in a range of populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pascoe|first=Michaela C.|last2=Bauer|first2=Isabelle E.|date=1 September 2015|title=A systematic review of randomised control trials on the effects of yoga on stress measures and mood|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=68|pages=270–282|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.07.013|issn=1879-1379|pmid=26228429}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review recommended more methodological rigor be applied to future clinical trials.

One review found little evidence that yoga helps people with [[dementia]] perform their daily activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forbes|first=Dorothy|last2=Forbes|first2=Scott C.|last3=Blake|first3=Catherine M.|last4=Thiessen|first4=Emily J.|last5=Forbes|first5=Sean|date=15 April 2015|title=Exercise programs for people with dementia|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD006489|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006489.pub4|url=http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006489.pub4/full|pmid=25874613}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another showed there were no effects on [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name="Krisanaprakornkit2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Krisanaprakornkit, T. |author2=Ngamjarus, C. |author3=Witoonchart, C. |author4=Piyavhatkul, N. | title = Meditation therapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) | journal = [[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]] | volume = | issue = 6 | pages = CD006507 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20556767 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006507.pub2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was weak evidence supporting yoga as an alternative treatment for [[insomnia]], with no evidence that yoga was better than general relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r43LBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA291|title=Insomnia: Diagnosis and Treatment|editors=Sateia MJ, Buysse D|vauthors=Taylor DJ, Grieser EA, Tatum JI |chapter=Other Nonpharmacological Treatments of Insomnia |publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781420080803|location=|pages=291|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==

[[File:Mr-yoga-galavasana-one-leg.jpg|thumb|150x150px|A hand-standing yoga pose]]
Although relatively safe, yoga is not risk free. Sensible precautions can usefully be taken&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for example beginners should avoid advanced moves, yoga should not be combined with psychoactive drug use, and competitive yoga should be avoided.&lt;ref name=safety&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cramer H, Krucoff C, Dobos G |title=Adverse events associated with yoga: a systematic review of published case reports and case series |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=e75515 |year=2013 |pmid=24146758 |pmc=3797727 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Émile Maximilien Paul Littré''' ({{IPA-fr|litʁe|lang}}; 1 February 1801 &amp;ndash; 2 June 1881) was a French [[lexicographer]], [[freemason]]&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire universel de la Franc-Maçonnerie'' by Monique Cara, Jean-Marc Cara, Marc de Jode (Larousse, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philosopher]], best known for his ''[[Dictionnaire de la langue française]]'', commonly called "The Littré".

==Biography==
Littré was born in Paris. His father, Michel-François Littré, had been a gunner and, later, a sergeant-major of marine artillery in the French navy who was deeply imbued with revolutionary ideas of the day. Settling down as a tax collector, he married Sophie Johannot, a [[freethought|free-thinker]] like himself, and devoted himself to the education of his son Émile. The boy was sent to the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]], where [[Louis Christophe François Hachette|Louis Hachette]] and [[Eugène Burnouf]] became his friends. After he completed his studies at the [[lycée]], he was undecided as to what career he should adopt; however, he devoted himself to mastering the English and German languages, classical and [[Sanskrit]] literature, and [[philology]].

He finally decided to become a student of medicine in 1822. He passed all his examinations in due course, and had only his thesis to prepare in order to obtain his degree as doctor when, in 1827, his father died leaving his mother without means. He abandoned his degree at once despite his keen interest in medicine, and, while attending lectures by [[Pierre François Olive Rayer|Pierre Rayer]], began teaching [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] to earn a living. He served as a soldier for the populists during the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, and was one of the members of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] who followed [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] to [[Rambouillet]]. In 1831, he obtained an introduction to [[Armand Carrel]], the editor of ''[[Le National (newspaper)|Le National]]'', who gave him the task of reading English and German papers for excerpts. By chance, in 1835, Carrel discovered Littré's skills as a writer and from that time on, he was a constant contributor to the journal, eventually becoming its director.

In 1836, Littré began to contribute articles on a wide range of subjects to the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'', and in 1837, he married. In 1839, the first volume of his complete works of [[Hippocrates]] appeared in print. Due to the outstanding quality of this work, he was elected to the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] in the same year. He noticed the works of [[Auguste Comte]], the reading of which formed, as he himself said, "the cardinal point of his life." From this time forward, the influence of [[positivism]] affected his own life, and, what is of more importance, he influenced positivism, giving as much to this philosophy as he received from it. He soon became a friend of Comte, and popularised his ideas in numerous works on the positivist philosophy. He continued translating and publishing his edition of Hippocrates' writings, which was not completed until 1862, and he published a similar edition of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''. After 1844, he took [[Claude Charles Fauriel|Fauriel]]'s place on the committee engaged to produce the ''[[Histoire littéraire de la France]]'', where his knowledge of the early French language and literature was invaluable.

[[File:9Emile Littre caricature.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Caricature of Émile Littré carrying one volume of his "Dictionary of the French Language"]]
Littré started work on his great ''[[Dictionnaire de la langue française]]'' in about 1844, which was not to be completed until thirty years later. He participated in the [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution of July 1848]], and in the repression of the extreme Republican Party in June 1849. His essays, contributed during this period to the ''National'', were collected together and published under the title of ''Conservation, revolution et positivisme'' in 1852, and show a thorough acceptance of all the doctrines propounded by Comte. However, during the later years of his master's life, he began to perceive that he could not wholly accept all the dogmas or the more mystic ideas of his friend and master. He concealed his differences of opinion, and Comte failed to recognise that his pupil had outgrown him, as he himself had outgrown his master [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]].

Comte's death in 1858 freed Littré from any fear of alienating his master. He published his own ideas in his ''Paroles de la philosophie positive'' in 1859. Four years later, in a work of greater length, he published ''Auguste Comte et la philosophie positive'', which traces the origin of Comte's ideas through [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot|Turgot]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and Saint-Simon. The work eulogises Comte's own life, his method of philosophy, his great services to the cause and the effect of his works, and proceeds to show where he himself differs from him. He approved wholly of Comte's philosophy, his great laws of society and his philosophical method, which indeed he defended warmly against [[John Stuart Mill]]. However, he stated that, while he believed in a positivist philosophy, he did not believe in a "religion of humanity".

About 1863, after completing his translations of Hippocrates and his Pliny, he began work in earnest on his great French [[dictionary]]. He was invited to join the [[Académie française]], but declined, not wishing to associate himself with [[Félix Dupanloup]], [[bishop of Orléans]], who had denounced him as the head of the French materialists in his ''Avertissement aux pères de famille''. At this time, he also started ''La Revue de philosophie positive'' with [[Grigorii Nikolayevich Vyrubov|Grégoire Wyrouboff]], a magazine that embodied the views of modern positivists.

Thus, his life was absorbed in literary work until the events that overthrew the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] called him to take a part in politics. He felt himself too old to undergo the privations of the [[Paris Commune|Siege of Paris]], and retired with his family to [[Brittany]]. He was summoned by [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta]] to [[Bordeaux]] to lecture on history, and thence to [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] to take his seat in the senate to which he had been chosen by the ''[[département]]'' of the [[Seine (département)|Seine]]. In December 1871, he was elected a member of the Académie française in spite of the renewed opposition of Msgr. Dupanloup, who resigned his seat rather than receive him.

Littré's ''[[Dictionnaire de la langue française]]'' ("Dictionary of the French Language") was completed in 1873 after nearly 30 years of work. The draft was written on 415,636 sheets, bundled in packets of one thousand, stored in eight white wooden crates that filled the cellar of Littré's home in [[Mesnil-le-Roi]]. The landmark effort gave authoritative definitions and usage descriptions to every word based on the various meanings it had held in the past. When it was published by Hachette, it was the largest lexicographical work on the French language at that time.

In 1875, he applied for membership in the [[Masonic bodies|Masonic]] Lodge ''La Clémente Amitié'' (''[[Grand Orient de France]]''). When asked whether he believed in the existence of a supreme being in the presence of 1000 [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], he replied: {{"|A wise man of ancient times, who was ask'd the same question by a king, thought about an answer for days, but was never able to answer. I please you not to request an answer from me. No science denies a "first cause", because it finds neither another warrant nor proof. All knowledge is relative and we always meet unknown phenomena and laws we don't know its cause. The one who proclaims with determination to neither believe nor disbelieve in a God proofs not to understand the problem of what makes things exist and disappear.&lt;ref name="Lennhoff"&gt;Eugen Lennhoff, Oskar Posner, Dieter A. Binder: ''Internationales Freimaurer Lexikon''. 5. Auflage, Herbig Verlag, p. 299, 519-520. {{ISBN|978-3-7766-2478-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1874, Littré was elected [[Senator for life (France)|Senator for life]] of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delamarre|first=Louis Narcisse|title=Paul-Maximilien-Emile Littré|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Paul-Maximilien-Emile_Littr%C3%A9|journal=Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)|volume= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most notable writings during these years were his political papers that attacked and revealed the confederacy of the [[Orléanist]]s and [[Legitimists]] against the Republic; his re-editions of many of his old articles and books, among others the ''Conservation, révolution et positivisme'' of 1852 (which he reprinted word for word, appending a formal, categorical renunciation of many of the Comtist doctrines therein contained); and a little tract, ''Pour la dernière fois'', in which he maintained his unalterable belief in the philosophy of [[Materialism]].

When it became obvious that the old man would not live much longer, his wife and daughter, who had always been fervent Catholics, strove to convert him to their religion. He had long discussions with [[Clergy|Father]] [[Louis Millériot]], a celebrated [[Polemic|Controversialist]], and [[Abbé]] [[Henri Huvelin]], the noted priest of [[Église Saint-Augustin de Paris|Église Saint-Augustin]], who were much grieved at his death. When Littré was near death, he converted, was baptised by the [[abbé]] and his funeral was conducted with the rites of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Clark,Christopher and Wolfram Kaiser [https://books.google.com/books?id=W-dOdvGlCDMC&amp;dq Culture wars: secular-Catholic conflict in nineteenth-century Europe], p. 86, Cambridge Univ. Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/06/19/98561843.pdf ''The Death-bed of a Positivist'', The New York Times, 19 June 1881]&lt;/ref&gt; Littré is interred at [[Cimetière du Montparnasse|Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.
