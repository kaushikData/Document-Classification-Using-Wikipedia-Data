'''''Ahmad v United Kingdom''''' (1982) 4 EHRR 126 is a [[UK labour law]] case which raised questions about the scope of race and religious discrimination. It upholds the view that special allowances do not need to be made by employers for people who want to follow particular religious practices, because people are free to choose their jobs. However, it suggests that employers should give genuine and serious consideration about ways to accommodate their employees requests, even if they cannot ultimately do so.

==Facts==
A teacher, Iftikhar Ahmad was a British citizen born in [[India]] in 1940 and a [[Muslim]]. He had worked at an inner London primary school for maladjusted children from 1968 to 1972. He took study leave and, given the opportunity to change schools, he chose one closer to a mosque. The headmaster allowed him extra time to pray on Fridays at lunch break. He then moved again to Chisern School, [[Bethnal Green]], where his job was to do individual reading with children. The headmistress objected to him being away for an extra 50 minutes. He moved again to Bonner Primary School, Bethnal Green. The headmaster there also refused extra time off, and he went anyway. He moved again to Bethnal Green Primary School. Then he moved again to the Roman Catholic primary school in Mile End. Here he took time off in spite of being told not to. He was told he could take part-time teaching, but he refused and instead he resigned. At this time part-time jobs were not protected by equal pay laws, and often, part-time contracts were paid less per hour than full-time ones.

At tribunal, Dr Pasha said Friday prayer was so important that in Saudi Arabia, three times not attending leads to beheading. One of the main questions was whether under [[Article 9 ECHR]] (the right to freedom of religion and conscience) the school ought to have given Mr Ahmad the time off.

==Judgment==
===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal (Scarman LJ dissenting) dismissed the case [1978] QB 38. [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning MR]] held,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[ECHR|convention]] is not part of our English law, but, as I have often said, we will always have regard to it. We will do our best to see that our decisions are in conformity with it. But it is drawn in such vague terms that it can be used for all sorts of unreasonable claims and provoke all sorts of litigation. As so often happens with high-sounding principles, they have to be brought down to earth. They have to be applied in a work-a-day world. I venture to suggest that it would do the Muslim community no good - or any other minority group no good - if they were to be given preferential treatment over the great majority of the people. If it should happen that, in the name of religious freedom, they were given special privileges or advantages, it would provoke discontent, and even resentment among those with whom they work. As, indeed, it has done in this very case. And so the cause of racial integration would suffer. So, whilst upholding religious freedom to the full, I would suggest that it should be applied with caution, especially having regard to the setting in which it is sought. Applied to our educational system, I think that Mr. Ahmad's right to "manifest his religion in practice and observance" must be subject to the rights of the education authorities under the contract and to the interests of the children whom he is paid to teach. I see nothing in the European Convention to give Mr. Ahmad any right to manifest his religion on Friday afternoons in derogation of his contract of employment: and certainly not on full pay.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scarman LJ said there was a duty to accommodate devout Muslims, even if it involved additional cost, because Art.9 required the right of worship to be unimpeded.

===European Commission===
The [[European Commission of Human Rights]] held that there was not even interference with his freedom of religion under Art.9(1) (at 23). Freedom of religion is not absolute and 'it may as regards the modality of a particular religious manifestation, be influenced by the situation of the person claiming that freedom' (para 11). It also noted that United Kingdom society was with its increasing Muslim community in a period of transition.' But they also made the point that there was no failure to consider better working arrangements.

== Nomenclature ==
Anadenanthera colubrina is known by many names throughout [[South America]]. In [[Peru]] it is known as '''''willka''''' (also spelled ''wilca,'' ''vilca'' and ''huilca'') which in the Quechua languages means "sacred".

== Geography ==
''A. colubrina'' is found in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Cuba]], and [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ildis.org/LegumeWeb?sciname=Anadenanthera+colubrina ILDIS LegumeWeb]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural growing conditions ==
[[File:Anadenanthera colubrina flowers.JPG|thumb|right|''Anadenanthera colubrina'' flowers]]
''A. colubrina'' grows at altitudes of about {{convert|315–2200|m|abbr=on}} with roughly {{convert|25–60|cm|abbr=on}} per year of precipitation and a [[mean]] temperature of {{convert|21|C|F}}. It tends to grow on rocky hillsides in well-drained soil, often in the vicinity of rivers.  It grows quickly at {{convert|1-1.5|m|abbr=on}} per year in good conditions.&lt;ref name="storage"&gt;[http://www.ipgri.cgiar.org/Publications/1032/1032_PDF/7%20-%20South%20and%20Central%20America.pdf Desiccation and storage of Anadenanthera colubrina beans.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716113340/http://www.ipgri.cgiar.org/Publications/1032/1032_PDF/7%20-%20South%20and%20Central%20America.pdf |date=July 16, 2006 }} ''International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI).'' Edilberto Rojas Espinoza.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing areas are often "[[savannah]] to dry [[rainforest]]."

== General uses ==
[[File:Anadenanthera_colubrina_branch.jpg|thumb|right|''Anadenanthera colubrina'']]

=== Food ===
A sweetened drink is made from the bark.&lt;ref name="pubmed"/&gt;

===Gum===
Gum from the tree can be used in the same way as [[gum arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cMSFT5K3C9wC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Anadenanthera+peregrina+falcata&amp;ots=YxsJ1pJmIc&amp;sig=cz-JSXhgUDeHieDOmCq2gseSQ3w#PPA98,M1 | title = Anadenanthera: Visionary Plant of Ancient South America | author = Constantino Manuel Torres | author2 = David B. Repke | page = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tannin ===
''A. colubrina's'' [[tannin]] is used in industry to process animal hides.&lt;ref name="pubmed"/&gt;

===Entheogen===
The beans of ''A. colubrina'' are used to make a snuff called vilca (sometimes called ''cebil'').  The bean pods are roasted to facilitate removal of the husk, followed by grinding with a [[mortar and pestle]] into a powder and mixed with a natural form of [[calcium hydroxide]] ([[Limestone|lime]]) or [[calcium oxide]].  The main active constituent of vilca is [[bufotenin]]; to a much lesser degree [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[5-MeO-DMT]] are also present.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} ''A. colubrina'' has been found to contain up to 12.4% bufotenin.&lt;ref name="PharmanopoPsychonautics"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Ott J |title=Pharmañopo-psychonautics: human intranasal, sublingual, intrarectal, pulmonary and oral pharmacology of bufotenine |journal=J Psychoactive Drugs |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=273–81 |year=2001 |pmid=11718320 |url=http://entheology.org/edoto/anmviewer.asp?a=9&amp;z=8 |doi=10.1080/02791072.2001.10400574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also believed that the beans used in snuff by the [[Inca]]s.&lt;ref name=msnbc1&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27441890/ Hallucinogens Found in Mummy Hair]&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been reports of active use of vilca by [[Wichi]] shamans, under the name ''hatáj''.&lt;ref name="ott1"&gt;{{cite book |author =Ott, Jonathan |author-link =Jonathan Ott |title=Shamanic Snuffs or Enthogenic Errhines |publisher=EthnoBotanica |location= |year=2001 |page=90 |isbn=1-888755-02-4 |url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books/shamanic_snuffs.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional medicine ===

[[Image:Anadenanthera colubrina at Iguazu Falls (Argentina).JPG|thumb|right|300px|''Anadenanthera colubrina'' leaves and bark at [[Iguazu Falls]].]]
The tree's bark is the most common part used medicinally.&lt;ref name="pubmed"/&gt;  Gum from the tree is used medicinally to treat [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s, as an [[expectorant]] and otherwise for cough.&lt;ref name="plantamed"&gt;[http://www.plantamed.com.br/plantaservas/especies/Anadenanthera_colubrina.htm Plantamed (Portuguese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wood ===
[[File:Anadenanthera colubrina trunk.JPG|thumb|right|''Anadenanthera colubrina'' trunk]]

In northeastern [[Brazil]], the tree is primarily used as [[timber]] and for making wooden implements.  "It is used in construction and for making door
and [[window]] frames, [[barrel]]s, mooring masts, [[hedge (barrier)|hedge]]s, platforms, floors,
agricultural implements and railway sleepers."&lt;ref name="storage"/&gt;
The wood is also reportedly a preferred source of [[cooking]] [[fuel]], since it makes a hot and long-lasting fire.  It is widely used there in the making of fences, since [[termites]] seem not to like it.  At one time, it was used in the construction of [[house]]s, but people are finding it more difficult to find suitable trees for that purpose.&lt;ref name="pubmed"/&gt;

==History==
History of Arahanthgiri Jain Math starts from the period of 322–185 BCE as the Last ‘Shrutkevali’ Bhadrabahu expected to stay at this place. He stayed at this place to practice meditation and “Swadhyaya” along with 8000 other saints. The Village Thirumalai where this Jain Math is located is also known as Arhatsugiri or Arihantgiri.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yatrastotemples.com/arahanthgiri-jain-math-in-thirumalai/&lt;/ref&gt;
This more than 2,000 years old temple is near Tirumala. The complex is now managed by [[Archaeological Survey of India]].&lt;ref&gt;https://richardarunachala.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/ancient-jain-temple-complex-near-tiruvannamalai/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exploremytrip.com/location-details/info/MTk2NjE/Arihant-Giri-Digambar-Jain-Temple&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Temple==
We can find the 16 meter Neminath Idol on the top of the hill having 140 steps at this location.This idol is believed to be dated as old as 12th century. A very famous south Indian movie has been shot around the theme of Neminatha. We can see various ancient caves existing in this Jain Math along with 16 meter idol of Neminath and hundreds of Religious books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3532">'''Aturfarnbag-i Farruxzatan''' was a 9th-century [[Zoroastrian]] high-priest who served as the leader of the Zoroastrian community of [[Fars Province|Fars]] in [[Iran]]. His first name has the meaning 'holy fire of Farnbag', the Farnbag fire being one of the three preeminent [[atar]] of Iran. He was the son of a certain Farruxzadan, and is known to have held a religious disputation in 825 at the [[Abbasid]] court with the former Zoroastrian [[Abalish]], known as "the apostate" and formerly called Dadv-Ohrmazd. Aturfarnbag managed to win the debate and Abalish was removed from the Abbasid court.

Aturfarnbag is also known to have written the [[Denkard]], an Encyclopedia about Zoroastrian beliefs and customs. He also wrote the book ''Ēwēn-nāmag'' on the tenets of the Zoroastrian religion. The fourth Book of Denkard is regarded as a condensed version of this work.

Aturfarnbag was later succeeded by his son [[Zardusht-i Aturfarnbag|Zardusht]]. He also had another son named Goshnjam, who, like his father, would later have a distinguished career. Another Zoroastrian high-priest named [[Adurbad-i Emedan]] would later edit the Denkard, putting much more information about Zoroastrian beliefs and customs. Aturfarnbag was also the ancestor of the prominent Zoroastrian [[Manushcihr-i Goshn-Yam]], who wrote the [[Dadestan-i Denig]].

The '''Bricket Wood coven''', or '''Hertfordshire coven'''&lt;ref name="Hutton1"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Withcraft| publisher = Oxford University Press| year=1999 }} Page 289&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[coven]] of [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian witches]] founded in the 1940s by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]. It was notable for being the first coven in the Gardnerian line, though having its supposed origins in the pre-Gardnerian [[New Forest coven]]. The coven formed after Gardner bought the Fiveacres Country Club, a [[Naturism|naturist club]] in the village of [[Bricket Wood]], [[Hertfordshire]], southern [[England]], and met within the club's grounds. It played a significant part in the history of the [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]].

Many important and influential figures in Wicca were members of the coven, including [[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]], [[Doreen Valiente]], [[Jack Bracelin]], [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Fred Lamond]], [[Dayonis]], [[Eleanor Bone]] and [[Lois Bourne]]. The coven is still active today, though it maintains secrecy and its history is only known up until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Withcraft| publisher = Oxford University Press| year=1999 }} Chapter 11 and 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1940s===
Gardner founded the coven around 1946 after moving to the area from the [[New Forest]] with his wife Donna. In the New Forest, Gardner claimed to have been initiated into the [[New Forest coven]], where he learned the mysteries and practices of the witchcraft religion. Gardner, fearing that the "Old Religion", as he called it, would die out, decided to form a new coven near to his new home, where he could initiate more people into the craft and keep it alive.

Gardner acted as the coven's High Priest, with [[Edith Woodford-Grimes|Dafo]] acting as High Priestess. She had also been a member of the New Forest coven. Dafo remained a member of the coven until she left it by late 1952, annoyed at Gardner for seeking publicity.&lt;ref name="Hutton"/&gt;

Gardner gained several members to the coven, all of whom were either members of the Fiveacres naturist club or were already witches,&lt;ref name="Valiente"&gt;{{cite book | first=Doreen | last=Valiente | authorlink=Doreen Valiente | title=The Rebirth of Witchcraft| publisher = Hale| year=1989 }} Page 60&lt;/ref&gt; although Donna, Gardner's wife, never got involved, having no interest in witchcraft. They held their meetings on the grounds of the local wooded Fiveacres nudist club, which Gardner had purchased in 1945. He was himself not interested in running the club, and as such appointed an administrator to take on the job.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner re-assembled what he called "The Witches' Cottage" on a plot of land which he owned in the club grounds. The small cottage was decorated with magical sigils on the inside. He had purchased this building from a friend, the [[Freemason]] [[John Sebastian Marlowe Ward|John S.M. Ward]], who was a pioneer of the restoration of historical buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; It was within this 16th-century cottage that Ward had found near to Ledbury, Herefordshire  that the coven assembled to perform their rituals.

===1950s===

====Doreen Valiente, 1953-1957====
[[Doreen Valiente]], whom Gardner had initiated into the craft at Midsummer 1953 at the home of Dafo in the [[New Forest]], joined the coven, and rose to become High Priestess.

In 1956, [[Jack Bracelin]] was initiated into the coven by Valiente. He became a favourite of Gardner, who gave him the job of running the Fiveacres club after sacking the previous administrator, who "had deliberately run the club at a loss by setting unrealistically high requirements for membership, hoping thereby to persuade Gerald to eventually sell him the club at a low price".&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; The sacked administrator had felt scorned, and convinced the president of the [[Central Council of British Naturism]], Ernest Stanley, that the club was a cover for witchcraft, and that they should not be allowed membership to the CCOBN. Hoping to help Jack and Gardner's club out, the coven performed a ritual, and the situation was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1950s, Gardner began to encourage more publicity, something which annoyed many coven members. In 1957, Valiente and several other coven members confronted Gardner over this, claiming that they should have a set of rules to regulate such a thing. Gardner, in response, brought about the Wiccan Laws (not to be confused with the Wiccan Rede), which offended Valiente, and in 1957 she and many of the group's older members left to form their own coven.

The split-off coven asked if they could continue to use the Witches' Cottage for their rituals, but in a letter Gardner replied that:

{{quote|There is an ancient lore dating back to the Burning Times that for security reasons no witch coven may meet less than 25&amp;nbsp;miles from another witch coven's meeting place.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gardner was left with a much younger coven, composed of Dayonis, her then partner Jack Bracelin, [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Fred Lamond]], a hospital anaesthetist, and a new initiate.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dayonis, 1958-1959====
With Valiente gone, Dayonis took over as the high priestess of the coven in January 1958.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; With Dayonis in charge, Gardner asked her to immediately initiate anyone who asked into the craft, in contrast with his former belief that prospective candidates should wait for a year and a day before initiation. One such of these new fast-tracked initiates was Fred Lamond, who was initiated only four months after meeting the coven for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner also insisted on the initiation of [[Eleanor Bone]], despite the fact that the coven members felt that they "simply couldn't circle with her" because of differences in exuberance. Within a month, Gardner had brought about her 2nd and 3rd initiations, and set her up as the High Priestess of a new coven, independent of the Bricket Wood one.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1958, whilst Gardner was away from the coven staying at his museum on the [[Isle of Man]], the other members decided that they did not want to continue using only binding and scourging to raise energies, and so they tried to do so by the circle dance method, which most found to be more effective than Gardner's preferred methods.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the group decided that they wanted to celebrate the solstices and the equinoxes as well as the cross-quarter days (the coven at the time called them [[Halloween]], [[Imbolc|Candlemass]], [[Beltane]] and [[Lammas]]). Gardner gave his written permission for this, and it was adopted by other practitioners of the craft, such as Doreen Valiente.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of the belief in the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]].

Dayonis moved to [[Canada]] in October 1959, and [[Lois Bourne]] became the coven's high priestess.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
After Gardner's death in 1964, Jack Bracelin, who had remained loyal to Gardner throughout, took over the group as high priest. At the same time he inherited the Fiveacres club from Gardner. However, he soon left the coven and abandoned the craft; this, according to coven member Fred Lamond, was because "he asked himself whether the [[Book of Shadows]]' simplified ceremonial magic rituals expressed his own religious feelings, and concluded they did not".&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, 2004, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The coven continued to assemble at the Witches' Cottage, which Bracelin allowed them to use as long as they paid rent on it. Many coven members were not happy with this, as they were not members of the nudist club, though they did so anyway.

===1970s===
In 1972, the group stopped using the Witches' Cottage all year round, and instead started meeting at the north London home of the High priest and priestess during winter.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Bracelin tried to get the group to pay for the nudist club's electricity as well as paying rent; the coven members were unwilling to do this, and so they sold their plot to another club member.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifty Years of Wicca'', Frederic Lamond, 2004, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bunyip''' is a large [[Mythology|mythical]] [[animal|creature]] from [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], said to lurk in [[swamp]]s, [[billabong]]s, [[stream|creeks]], riverbeds, and [[wiktionary:waterhole|waterhole]]s.

The origin of the word ''bunyip'' has been traced to the [[Wemba-Wemba]] or Wergaia language of Aboriginal people of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in South-Eastern Australia.&lt;ref name = Hughes&gt;{{cite book |editor-last = Hughes |editor-first = Joan |title = Australian Words and Their Origins |year = 1989 |publisher = Oxford University Press |page = 90 |isbn = 0-19-553087-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Butler |first = Susan |title = The Dinkum Dictionary: The origin of Australian Words |year = 2009 |page = 53 |publisher = Text Publishing |isbn = 978-1-921351-98-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Holden|2001|p = 15}} But the figure of the bunyip was part of traditional Aboriginal beliefs and stories throughout Australia, while its name varied according to tribal nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Wannan |first = Bill |title = Australian Folklore |year = 1976 |origyear = 1970 |publisher = Landsdowne Press |page = 101 |isbn = 0-7018-0088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2001 book, writer Robert Holden identified at least nine regional variations of the creature known as the bunyip across Aboriginal Australia.{{sfn|Holden|2001|p = 22–24}} Europeans recorded various written accounts of bunyips in the early and mid-19th century, as they began to settle across the country.

== Meaning ==
The word ''bunyip'' is usually translated by Aboriginal Australians today as "devil" or "evil spirit".&lt;ref&gt;See for example, "[[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]]", Kath Walker's story collected in ''Stradbroke Dreamtime.'' [http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/bunyips/html-site/abor-stories/biami.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This contemporary translation may not accurately represent the role of the bunyip in pre-contact [[Aboriginal mythology]] or its possible origins before written accounts were made. Some modern sources allude to a linguistic connection between the bunyip and [[Bunjil]], "a mythic 'Great Man' who made the mountains and rivers and man and all the animals."&lt;ref name = Oxford&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Davey |editor1-first = Gwenda |editor2-last = Seal |editor2-first = Graham |title = The Oxford Companion to Australian Folklore |year = 1993 |pages = 55–56 |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 0-19-553057-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''bunyip'' may have first appeared in print in English about the mid-1840s.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Geelong Advocate'', 2 July 1845, at Peter Ravenscroft's ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[https://archive.today/20130511031804/http://pool.abc.net.au/media/bunyip-and-inland-seal-archive-australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1850s, ''bunyip'' was also used as a "synonym for impostor, pretender, humbug and the like" in the broader Australian community.&lt;ref name = Hughes/&gt; The term ''[[bunyip aristocracy]]'' was first coined in 1853 to describe Australians aspiring to be aristocrats. In the early 1990s, Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] used this term to describe members of the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia]] opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1732 |title = Parliamentary decorum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = But those names will never hurt them |first = Don |last = McGillivray |newspaper = [[Windsor Star]] |date = 15 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''bunyip'' can still be found in a number of Australian contexts, including place names such as the [[Bunyip River]] (which flows into [[Westernport Bay]] in southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the town of [[Bunyip, Victoria|Bunyip]], Victoria.

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:Bunyip (1935).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Bunyip'' (1935), artist unknown, from the [[National Library of Australia]] digital collections, demonstrates the variety in descriptions of the legendary creature.]]

Descriptions of bunyips vary widely. George French Angus may have collected a description of a bunyip in his account of a "water spirit" from the Moorundi people of the [[Murray River]] before 1847, stating it is "much dreaded by them&amp;nbsp;... It inhabits the Murray; but&amp;nbsp;... they have some difficulty describing it. Its most usual form&amp;nbsp;... is said to be that of an enormous starfish."&lt;ref&gt;George French Angus(1847) ''Savage Life and Scenes in Australia and New Zealand''. Vol 1, p.99. London. Reprinted 1969 Libraries Board of South Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Brough Smyth's ''Aborigines of Victoria'' (1878) devoted ten pages to the bunyip, but concluded "in truth little is known among the blacks respecting its form, covering or habits; they appear to have been in such dread of it as to have been unable to take note of its characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Smyth cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p = 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common features as reported in many 19th-century newspaper accounts include a dog-like face, a crocodile-like head, dark fur, a [[horse]]-like tail, [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s, and [[walrus]]-like [[tusk]]s or horns, or a [[duck]]-like bill.&lt;ref&gt;For numerous examples see Peter Ravenscroft's survey of nineteenth-century newspaper accounts of the bunyip at ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://archive.li/BFSng]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Challicum bunyip, an outline image of a bunyip carved by Aborigines into the bank of Fiery Creek, near [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]], Victoria, was first recorded by ''The Australasian'' newspaper in 1851. According to the report, the bunyip had been speared after killing an Aboriginal man. Antiquarian Reynell Johns claimed that until the mid-1850s, Aboriginal people made a "habit of visiting the place annually and retracing the outlines of the figure [of the bunyip] which is about 11 paces long and 4 paces in extreme breadth."&lt;ref&gt;Johns cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outline image no longer exists.{{sfn|Holden|2001|p = 176}}

== Debate over origins of the bunyip ==
Non-Aboriginal Australians have made various attempts to understand and explain the origins of the bunyip as a physical entity over the past 150 years. Writing in 1933, Charles Fenner suggested that it was likely that the "actual origin of the bunyip myth lies in the fact that from time to time seals have made their way up the Murray and Darling (Rivers)". He provided examples of seals found as far inland as [[Barmera, South Australia|Overland Corner]], [[Loxton, South Australia|Loxton]], and [[Conargo, New South Wales|Conargo]] and reminded readers that "the smooth fur, prominent 'apricot' eyes, and the bellowing cry are characteristic of the seal",{{sfn|Fenner|1933|pp = 2 – 6}} especially [[southern elephant seal]]s and [[leopard seal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_bunyips_mythology1/index1.htm BUNYIP SIGHTINGS - IN SEARCH OF AN ORIGIN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggestion is that the bunyip may be a [[cultural memory]] of extinct Australian marsupials such as the ''[[Diprotodon]]'', ''[[Zygomaturus]]'', ''[[Nototherium]]'', or ''[[Palorchestes]]''. This connection was first formally made by Dr George Bennett of the Australian Museum in 1871.{{sfn|Holden|2001|p=90}} In the early 1990s, palaeontologist Pat Vickers-Rich and geologist Neil Archbold also cautiously suggested that Aboriginal legends "perhaps had stemmed from an acquaintance with prehistoric bones or even living prehistoric animals themselves&amp;nbsp;... When confronted with the remains of some of the now extinct Australian marsupials, Aborigines would often identify them as the bunyip."&lt;ref name = PVR&gt;{{citation |editor1-first = Pat |editor1-last = Vikers-Rich |editor2-first = J.M. |editor2-last = Monaghan |editor3-first = R.F.|editor3-last = Baird |editor4-first = T.H. |editor4-last = Rich |year = 1991 |title = Vertebrate Palaeontology of Australasia |page = 2 |publisher = Pioneer Design Studio and Monash University |isbn = 0-909674-36-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also note that "legends about the'' mihirung paringmal'' of western Victorian Aborigines&amp;nbsp;... may allude to the&amp;nbsp;... extinct giant birds the [[Dromornithidae]]."&lt;ref name = PVR/&gt;

In a 2017 ''[[Australian Birdlife]]'' article, Karl Brandt suggested Aboriginal encounters with the [[southern cassowary]] inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=Karl|title=Bunyip Hunters|journal=Australian Birdlife|date=June 2017|volume= 6|issue=2|page= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the first written description of the bunyip from 1845,&lt;ref name = "firstuse"/&gt; the creature, which laid pale blue eggs of immense size, possessed deadly claws, powerful hind legs, a brightly coloured chest, and an [[emu]]-like head, characteristics shared with then undiscovered Australian cassowary. As the creature's bill was described as having serrated projections, each "like the bone of the [[stingray]]", this bunyip was associated with the indigenous people of [[Far North Queensland]], renowned for their spears tipped with stingray barbs and their proximity to the cassowary's Australian range.

Another association to the bunyip is the shy Australasian bittern (''[[Botaurus poiciloptilus]]'').{{sfn|Fenner|1933|p = 6}} During the breeding season, the male call of this marsh-dwelling bird is a "low pitched boom";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1 = Ken |last1 = Simpson |first2 = Nicolas |last2 = Day |first3 = Peter |last3 = Trusler |year = 1999 |title = [[Field Guide to the Birds of Australia (Simpson &amp; Day)|Field Guide to the Birds of Australia]] |page = 72 |publisher = Viking Books, Australia |isbn = 0-670-87918-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence, it is occasionally called the "bunyip bird".&lt;ref name = Oxford/&gt;

== Early accounts of European settlers ==
[[File:Story of the bunyip 1882.jpg|thumb|right|An 1882 illustration of an Aboriginal man telling the story of the bunyip to two European children]]

During the early settlement of Australia by Europeans, the notion became commonly held that the bunyip was an unknown animal that awaited discovery. Unfamiliar with the sights and sounds of the island continent's peculiar fauna, early Europeans believed that the bunyip described to them was one more strange Australian animal and they sometimes attributed unfamiliar animal calls or cries to it. Scholars suggest also that 19th-century bunyip lore was reinforced by imported European folklore, such as that of the Irish [[Púca]].&lt;ref name = Oxford/&gt;

A large number of bunyip sightings occurred during the 1840s and 1850s, particularly in the southeastern colonies of [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]], [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]] and [[Colony of South Australia|South Australia]], as European settlers extended their reach. The following is not an exhaustive list of accounts:

=== Hume find of 1818 ===
One of the earliest accounts relating to a large unknown freshwater animal was in 1818,{{sfn|Holden|2001|p = 86}} when [[Hamilton Hume]] and James Meehan found some large bones at [[Lake Bathurst]] in [[New South Wales]]. They did not call the animal a bunyip, but described the remains indicating the creature as very much like a [[hippopotamus]] or [[manatee]]. The Philosophical Society of Australasia later offered to reimburse Hume for any costs incurred in recovering a specimen of the unknown animal, but for various reasons, Hume did not return to the lake.&lt;ref&gt;See minutes cited (19 December 1821) in Peter Ravenscroft's ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://70.32.76.50/text/peter_ravenscroft/the_bunyip_and_inland_seal_archive_of_australia]{{dead link|date = November 2016 |bot = InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient ''[[Diprotodon]]'' skeletons have sometimes been compared to the hippopotamus; they are a land animal, but have sometimes been found in a lake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Price |first = G.

=== Wellington Caves fossils, 1830 ===
More significant was the discovery of fossilised bones of "some quadruped much larger than the ox or buffalo"&lt;ref&gt;Ranken, George cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Wellington Caves]] in mid-1830 by bushman George Ranken and later by [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]]. Sydney's Reverend [[John Dunmore Lang]] announced the find as "convincing proof of the deluge", referring to Biblical accounts of the Flood.&lt;ref&gt;Lang cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; But British anatomist [[Sir Richard Owen]]  identified the fossils as the gigantic marsupials ''[[Nototherium]]'' and ''[[Diprotodon]]''. At the same time, some settlers observed that "all natives throughout these&amp;nbsp;... districts have a tradition (of) a very large animal having at one time existed in the large creeks and rivers and by many it is said that such animals now exist."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First written use of the word ''bunyip'', 1845 ===
In July 1845, ''The [[Geelong Advertiser]]'' announced the discovery of fossils found near [[Geelong]], under the headline "Wonderful Discovery of a new Animal".&lt;ref name = "firstuse"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article94443733 |title = WONDERFUL DISCOVERY OF A NEW ANIMAL. |newspaper = Geelong Advertiser and Squatters' Advocate (Vic. : 1845 – 1847) |location = Vic. |date = 2 July 1845 |accessdate = 16 September 2013 |page = 2 |publisher = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a continuation of a story on 'fossil remains' from the previous issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91122742 |title = No Title. |newspaper = Geelong Advertiser and Squatters' Advocate (Vic. : 1845 – 1847) |location = Vic. |date = 28 June 1845 |accessdate = 16 September 2013 |page = 2 |publisher = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper continued, "On the bone being shown to an intelligent black, he at once recognised it as belonging to the bunyip, which he declared he had seen.&lt;ref name = "firstuse"/&gt; On being requested to make a drawing of it, he did so without hesitation." The account noted a story of an Aboriginal woman being killed by a bunyip and the "most direct evidence of all" – that of a man named Mumbowran "who showed several deep wounds on his breast made by the claws of the animal".&lt;ref name = "firstuse"/&gt;

The account provided this description of the creature:
{{quote|The Bunyip, then, is represented as uniting the characteristics of a bird and of an alligator. It has a head resembling an emu, with a long bill, at the extremity of which is a transverse projection on each side, with serrated edges like the bone of the stingray. Its body and legs partake of the nature of the alligator. The hind legs are remarkably thick and strong, and the fore legs are much longer, but still of great strength. The extremities are furnished with long claws, but the blacks say its usual method of killing its prey is by hugging it to death. When in the water it swims like a frog, and when on shore it walks on its hind legs with its head erect, in which position it measures twelve or thirteen feet in height.&lt;ref&gt;''The Geelong Advertiser'' 2 July 1845 in Peter Ravenscroft, ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://archive.li/BFSng]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this account appeared, it was repeated in other Australian newspapers. This appears to be the first use of the word ''bunyip'' in a written publication.

=== Australian Museum's bunyip of 1847 ===
[[File:Bunyip skull.jpg|thumb|The purported bunyip skull]]

In January 1846, a peculiar skull was taken by a settler from the banks of [[Murrumbidgee River]] near [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]], New South Wales. Initial reports suggested that it was the skull of something unknown to science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article94445051 |title = PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES. |newspaper = Geelong Advertiser and Squatters' Advocate |date = 12 January 1847 |accessdate = 16 September 2013 |page = 2 Edition: EVENING |publisher = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squatter who found it remarked, "all the natives to whom it was shown called [it] a bunyip".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1847, several experts, including W. S. Macleay and Professor Owen, had identified the skull as the deformed foetal skull of a foal or calf.{{sfn|Holden|2001|pp = 92 – 93}} At the same time, the purported bunyip skull was put on display in the [[Australian Museum]] (Sydney) for two days. Visitors flocked to see it, and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that many people spoke out about their "bunyip sightings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/bunyips/html-site/evidence/skull.html] National library of Australia. Bunyips – Evidence&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of this discovery used the phrase 'Kine Pratie' as well as Bunyip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31750864 |title = THE BUNYIP, OR KINE PRATIE. |newspaper = [[Sydney Chronicle]] |date = 23 January 1847 |accessdate = 16 September 2013 |page = 2 |publisher = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explorer [[William Hovell]], who examined the skull, also called it a 'katen-pai'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12897214 |title = ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. |newspaper = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = 9 February 1847 |accessdate = 16 September 2013 |page = 3 |publisher = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March of that year "a bunyip or an immense Platibus" ([[Platypus]]) was sighted "sunning himself on the placid bosom of the Yarra, just opposite the Custom House" in [[Melbourne]]. "Immediately a crowd gathered" and three men set off by boat "to secure the stranger" which "disappeared" when they were "about a yard from him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71607452 |title = PORT PHILLIP. |newspaper = [[The South Australian]] |location = Adelaide |date = 2 March 1847 |accessdate = 16 September 2013 |page = 7 |publisher = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Buckley's account of bunyips, 1852 ===
Another early written account is attributed to escaped convict [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] in his 1852 biography of thirty years living with the [[Wathaurong]] people. His 1852 account records "in&amp;nbsp;... Lake Moodewarri [now Lake Modewarre] as well as in most of the others inland&amp;nbsp;... is a&amp;nbsp;... very extraordinary amphibious animal, which the natives call Bunyip." Buckley's account suggests he saw such a creature on several occasions. He adds, "I could never see any part, except the back, which appeared to be covered with feathers of a dusky grey colour. It seemed to be about the size of a full grown calf&amp;nbsp;... I could never learn from any of the natives that they had seen either the head or tail."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Flannery(Ed.)(2002): ''The Life and Adventures of William Buckley; 32 Years a wanderer amongst the Aborigines of the then unexplored country around Port Phillip, now the Province of Victoria'' by John Morgan. First published 1852. This edition, Text Publishing, Melbourne Australia. p.66. {{ISBN|1-877008-20-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley also claimed the creature was common in the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] and cites an example he heard of an Aboriginal woman being killed by one. He emphasized the bunyip was believed to have supernatural powers.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Flannery(Ed.)(2002) ''The Life and Adventures of William Buckley.'' pp. 138 – 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stocqueler's sightings and drawings, 1857 ===
In an article titled, 'The Bunyip', a newspaper reported on the drawings made by [[Edwin Roper Loftus Stocqueler|Edwin Stocqueler]] as he travelled on the Murray and Goulburn rivers: 'Amongst the latter drawings we noticed a likeness of the Bunyip, or rather a view of the neck and shoulders of the animal. Mr. Stocqueler informs us that the Bunyip is a large freshwater seal, having two small padules or fins attached to the shoulders, a long swan like neck, a head like a dog, and a curious bag hanging under the jaw, resembling the pouch of the pelican. The animal is covered with hair, like the platypus, and the colour is a glossy black. Mr. Stocqueler saw no less than six of these curious animals at different times; his boat was within thirty feet of one near M'Guire's punt on the Goulburn, and he fired at the Bunyip, but did not succeed in capturing him. The smallest appeared to be about five feet in length, and the largest exceeded fifteen feet. The head of the largest was the size of a bullock's head, and three feet out of water. After taking a sketch of the animal, Mr. Stocqueler showed it to several blacks of the Goulburn tribe, who declared that the picture was "Bunyip's brother," meaning a duplicate or likeness of the bunyip. The animals moved against the current, at the rate of about seven miles an hour, and Mr. Stockqueler states that he could have approached close to the specimens he observed, had he not been deterred by the stories of the natives concerning the power and fury of the bunyip, and by the fact that his gun had only a single barrel, and his boat was of a very frail description.'&lt;ref&gt;https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/64568063&lt;/ref&gt;

The description varied across newspaper accounts: 'The great Bunyip question seems likely to be brought to a close, as a Mr. Stocqueler, an artist and gentleman, who has come up the Murray in a small boat, states that he saw one, and was enabled to take a drawing of this "vexed question," but could not succeed in catching him. We have seen the sketch, and it puts us in mind of an hybrid between the water mole and the great sea serpent.'&lt;ref&gt;https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/189958682&lt;/ref&gt; 'Mr. Stocqueler, an artist, and his mother are on an expedition down the Murray, for the purpose of making some faithful sketches of the views on this fine stream, as well as of the creatures frequenting it. I have seen some of their productions, and as they pourtray localities with which I am well acquainted, can pronounce the drawings faithful representations. Mother and son go down the stream in a canoe. The lady paints flowers, &amp;c.; the son devotes himself to choice views on the river's side. One of the drawings represents a singular creature, which the artist is unable to classify. It has the appearance in miniature of the famous sea-serpent, as that animal is described by navigators. Mr. Stocqueler was about twenty-five yards distant from it at first sight as it lay placidly on the water. On being observed, the stranger set-off, working his paddles briskly, and rapidly disappeared. Captain Cadell has tried to solve the mystery, but is not yet satisfied as to what the animal really is. Mr. Stocqueler states that there were about two feet of it above water when he first saw it, and he estimated its length at from five to six feet. The worthy Captain says, that unless the creature is the "Musk Drake" (so called from giving off a very strong odour of musk), he cannot account for the novelty.'&lt;ref&gt;https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/64982354&lt;/ref&gt;

Stocqueler disputed the newspaper descriptions in a letter; stating that he never called the animal a bunyip, it did not have a swan like neck, and he never said anything about the size of the animal as he never saw the whole body.&lt;ref&gt;https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/88000162?searchTerm=stocqueler%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=exactPhrase|||anyWords|||notWords|||requestHandler|||dateFrom=1857-01-01|||dateTo=1857-12-31|||l-advstate=New+South+Wales|||l-advstate=Victoria|||sortby&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to write that all would be revealed in his diorama as an 'almost life size portrait of the beast' would be included. The diorama took him four years to paint and was reputed to be a mile (1.6 km) long and made of 70 individual pictures. The diorama has long since disappeared and may no longer exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbs.com.au/gold/story.php?storyid=97&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2582">{{Buddhism}}'''Chung Tai Shan''' ({{zh|c=中台山|poj=Tiong-tai-san}}) is a [[Taiwan]]-based [[Buddhist]] monastic order founded by the Venerable Master [[Wei Chueh]] in 1987. The monastery headquarters, [[Chung Tai Chan Monastery]] (or Chung Tai Chan Buddhist Temple, 中台禪寺), completed in September 2001, is located in [[Puli, Nantou|Puli]], [[Nantou County]], in central Taiwan. It is the tallest and one of the largest [[monastery|monasteries]] in both Taiwan and the world, having a height of {{Convert|136|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= SkyscraperPage - Chung-Tai Buddhist Temple | url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=2945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely-admired as an architectural masterpiece because of the mountain monastery's more modern look, the temple is second only to [[Fo Guang Shan]]'s monastery in physical size and in the number of ordained disciples.

The temple follows traditional Chinese [[Ch'an]] teaching, emphasizing sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation. Chung Tai Chan Monastery has established more than 90 meditation centers and branches in Taiwan and abroad, including eight branches in the [[United States]]: two in Northern [[California]] - [http://www.ctzen.org/sunnyvale/ Chung Tai Zen Center of Sunnyvale] in Silicon Valley and [http://www.buddhagate.org/ Buddha Gate Monastery] in Lafayette in the East Bay; one in Southern California - [http://www.ctzen.org/middleland/ Middle Land Chan Monastery] in Pomona; two in the state of [[Texas]] - [http://cthouston.org/jen Chung Tai Zen Center of Houston] and [http://ctcmusa.org/jen Chung Tai International Retreat Center]; one in the state of Oklahoma  [http://www.ctbuddhamind.org/ Buddha Mind Monastery] in Oklahoma City; one in the state of Washington — [http://www.ctzen.org/BuddhaJewel/ Buddha Jewel Monastery] in Seattle; and one in the state of Georgia - [http://dharmajewel.us/ Dharma Jewel Monastery] in Atlanta; as well as branches in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Philippines, and Thailand.

The '''compadre''' ({{IPA-es|komˈpaðɾe|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|kũˈpaðɾɨ|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|kõˈpadɾi|}}, literally "co-father" or "co-parent") relationship between the parents and [[godparents]] of a child is an important bond that originates when a child is baptized in Iberian, Latin American, and Filipino families. The abstract noun '''compadrazgo''' (Spanish and Filipino), '''compadrio''' (in Portuguese), both meaning "co-parenthood," is sometimes used to refer to the institutional relationship between  ''compadres''.&lt;ref&gt;"Counting on Kin: Social Networks, Social Support, and Child Health Status." Shawn Malia Kana'iaupuni, Katharine M Donato, Theresa Thompson-Colón, Melissa Stainback. Social Forces. Chapel Hill: Mar 2005.Vol.83, Iss. 3; pg. 1137, 28 pgs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Las Comadres as a social support system." Rebecca A Lopez. Affilia. Thousand Oaks: Spring 1999.Vol.14, Iss. 1; pg. 24, 18 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Forgotten Liberator: Buenaventura Martínez and Yucatán's Republican Restoration." Terry Rugeley. Mexican Studies. Berkeley: Summer 2003.Vol.19, Iss. 2; pg. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

From the moment of a baptism ceremony, the [[godparents]] (godfather and godmother, ''padrino'' and ''madrina'' in Spanish, ''padrinho'' and ''madrinha'' in Portuguese, and ''ninong'' and ''ninang'' in Filipino) share the parenting role of the baptised child with the natural parents. By Catholic doctrine, upon the child's baptism the godparents accept the responsibility to ensure that the child is raised according to the dictates of the Catholic faith and to ensure the child pursues a life of improvement and success (through education, marriage, personal development, and so forth).

At the moment of baptism, the godparents and natural parents become each other's ''compadres'' (the plural form ''compadres'' includes both male and female co-parents). The female equivalent of ''compadre'' is '''comadre''' ({{IPA-es|koˈmaðɾe|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|koˈmaðɾɨ|lang}}, Brazil: {{IPA-pt|kuˈmadɾi|}}). Thus, the child's father will call the child's godmother "comadre," while she will call him "compadre," and so on.

Traditionally among Iberians and Latin Americans, this relationship formalizes a pre-existing friendship which results in a strong lifelong bond between ''compadres''. In its original form, the ''compadre'' relationship is among the strongest types of family love soon after one's [[nuclear family]]. In many Latin American societies, lifelong friends or siblings who have always spoken to each other informally (using the informal Spanish second-person, ''tú'') may mark their new ''compadre'' relationship by using respectful or formal speech (using the formal Spanish second-person, ''usted'').

There are a number of other ritual occasions that are considered to result in a ''compadre'' relationship in various Latin American societies. These may include ritual sponsorship of other Catholic sacraments (first communion, confirmation, and marriage); sponsorship of a ''[[quinceañera]]'' celebration; and, in Peru, sponsorship of a ritual first haircut ceremony that normally takes place when a child turns three years old. 

''Compadrazgo'' has its roots in mediaeval European Catholicism. The [[Doge of Venice]] [[Pietro II Orseolo]] worked all his life for creating solid contacts with the contemporary monarchs, achieving good relationships with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On the other hand, he approximated to [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]] and eventually named him literally with the title of ''compadre'', which meant "the co-father of the Venetian Doge's children". Otto specially liked this, and became the children's godfather.&lt;ref&gt;Katus László: Németország történeti gyökerei. In: Rubicon, 1999 1-2, pp. 4-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic Spanish novel [[Don Quixote]] (1605–1615) contains several references to ''compadres''; however, the ''compadre'' relationship has much less formal meaning in modern Spain where it is a reference both to a godfather/''padrino'' or just to a best friend, with no reference to any ritual. The expression is in use particularly in southern Spain. In medieval England, parents and godparents called each other "godsibs" (that is, "God siblings"). The only trace of this old Catholic English practice in modern English is the word [[gossip]], presumably a reference to the propensity of close companions such as ''compadres'' to chat and gossip with one another. In Spanish, the verb ''comadrear'' (from ''comadre'') similarly means "to gossip," as does the French cognate ''commérage'' (from ''commère'').

The term ''compadre'' has been extended in some regions, such as Brazil to describe a common relationship between two good friends. In Argentina and Paraguay, the word is used in popular speech (especially in the diminutive, ''compadrito'') to mean "braggart, loud-mouth, bully." However, among more traditional Latin American and Hispanic/Latino families, the word retains its original meaning and symbolism, and for its members, to be asked to be a ''padrino'' or ''compadre'' is a great, lifelong honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2495">'''Constant Chevillon''' (born 26 October 1880 in [[Annoire]] ([[Jura (department)|Jura]]); died 23 March 1944 in Lyon) was Grand Master of the [[Freemasonry]] [[Rite of Memphis-Misraïm]] and head of [[FUDOFSI]] and other [[occult]] societies.

As a member of the Rosicrucian Fraternity, he was opposed to [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]]' [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|AMORC]] and [[FUDOSI]].

He was enthroned as [[Patriarch]] of the [[Eglise Gnostique Universelle]] after [[Jean Bricaud]], and succeeded by one of his students, René Chambellant, who maintained the compendium of esoteric societies in cooperation with the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica|Gnostic church]].

At an early age, his prodigious memory and learning genius made their debut and the priest decided to teach him Latin. At the age of twelve, he entered the College of Montciel, near Lons-le-Saunier (Jura). He studied [[Literature]], [[Ancient History]], the [[Classics]] and [[Philosophy]].

He moved on to higher branches of learning, receiving a bachelor's degree at the Faculty of Letters at Lyon where he also received his [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]]'s Degree and a Fellowship.

He studied philosophy under the celebrated Professor Arthur Hennequin. He knew [[Socrates]]' [[Precept]]s of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], but the one that guided his life was: "Renounce thyself while serving others". His philosophy professor was such an ideal for him that after Hennequin's death, he left the University.

He went to work at the Société Générale, a bank in Lyon and worked there until 1913. Later he went to work for the Banque Nationale de Crédit in Lyon and continued his work there until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Swinburne Clymer]], M. D. ''The Book of Rosicruciae'', v. ii pp. 96-99, The Philosophical Publishing Co., 1947 ASIN: B00104HMOW&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, he was shot and killed by the Milice (French police submitted to the Gestapo) in a brutal hostage murder on 23 March 1944 in [[Lyon]].

Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The scroll in his right hand is an 18th-century restoration.]]

'''Cynicism''' ({{lang-el|κυνισμός}}) is a [[school of thought]] of [[ancient Greek philosophy]] as practiced by the Cynics ({{lang-el|Κυνικοί}}, {{lang-la|Cynici}}). For the Cynics, the [[meaning of life|purpose of life]] is to live in [[virtue]], in agreement with [[physis|nature]]. As reasoning creatures, people can gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which is natural for themselves, rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, sex, and fame. Instead, they were to lead a [[simple living|simple life]] free from all possessions.

The first philosopher to outline these themes was [[Antisthenes]], who had been a pupil of [[Socrates]] in the late 5th century BC. He was followed by [[Diogenes]], who lived in a pot on the streets of [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Laërtius &amp; Hicks 1925, Ⅵ:23 ; Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum, 2.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes took Cynicism to its [[logical extreme]]s, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by [[Crates of Thebes]], who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the [[Roman Empire|empire]].

Cynicism gradually declined and finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar [[Asceticism|ascetic]] and [[rhetoric]]al ideas appear in [[early Christianity]]. By the 19th century, emphasis on the negative aspects of Cynic philosophy led to the [[Cynicism (contemporary)|modern understanding of cynicism]] to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions.

==Origin of the Cynic name==
The name Cynic derives {{ety|grc|''κυνικός'' (kynikos)|dog-like||''κύων'' (kyôn)|[[dog]]}} ([[genitive]]: ''kynos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2360864 '''Kynikos''', "A Greek-English Lexicon", Liddell and Scott, at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called "dogs" was because the first Cynic, Antisthenes, taught in the [[Cynosarges]] gymnasium at Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 13. Cf. ''[[The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature]]'', 2nd edition, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''cynosarges'' means the "place of the white dog". It seems certain, however, that the word ''dog'' was also thrown at the first Cynics as an insult for their shameless rejection of conventional manners, and their decision to live on the streets. Diogenes, in particular, was referred to as the "Dog",&lt;ref&gt;An obscure reference to "the Dog" in Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' (3.10.1411a25) is generally agreed to be the first reference to Diogenes.&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction he seems to have revelled in, stating that "other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them."&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by [[Stobaeus]], ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage, as a later commentator explained:
{{quote|There are four reasons why the ''Cynics'' are so named. First because of the ''indifference'' of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second reason is that the dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.&lt;ref name="dudley5"&gt;Scholium on Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'', quoted in {{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Philosophy==
Cynicism is one of the most striking of all the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]].&lt;ref name="long28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offered people the possibility of happiness and freedom from suffering in an age of uncertainty. Although there was never an official Cynic doctrine, the fundamental principles of Cynicism can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="kidd"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kidd|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="long29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Navia"&gt;Navia, Luis E. Classical Cynicism: A Critical Study. pg 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The goal of life is ''[[eudaimonia]]'' and mental clarity or lucidity (ἁτυφια) - literally "freedom from smoke (τύφος)" which signified false belief, mindlessness, folly, and conceit.
* ''Eudaimonia'' is achieved by living in accord with [[Physis|Nature]] as understood by human [[logos|reason]].
* Arrogance (τύφος) is caused by false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]], unnatural desires, and a vicious character. 
* ''Eudaimonia'', or human flourishing, depends on self-sufficiency (αὐτάρκεια), [[apatheia|equanimity]], ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'', [[Philanthropy#History|love of humanity]], ''[[parrhesia]]'' and indifference to the vicissitudes of life (ἁδιαφορία).&lt;ref name="Navia" /&gt;
* One progresses towards flourishing and clarity through [[asceticism|ascetic practices]] (ἄσκησις) which help one become free from influences – such as wealth, fame, and power – that have no value in Nature. Examples include Diogenes' practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter.
* A Cynic practices shamelessness or impudence (Αναιδεια) and defaces the ''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'' of society; the laws, customs, and social conventions which people take for granted.

[[File:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|225px|upright|The Cynics adopted [[Heracles]], shown here in this gilded bronze statue from the second century AD, as their patron hero.&lt;ref name="LaerChrysPsL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson"/&gt;]]

Thus a Cynic has no property and rejects all conventional values of money, fame, power and reputation.&lt;ref name="kidd" /&gt; A life lived according to nature requires only the bare necessities required for existence, and one can become free by unshackling oneself from any needs which are the result of convention.&lt;ref name="long34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cynics adopted [[Heracles]] as their hero, as epitomizing the ideal Cynic.&lt;ref name="LaerChrysPsL"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 2, 71; Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/8*.html#26 ''Orations'', viii. 26–32]; Pseudo-Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl431.htm ''Cynicus''], 13; Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl420.htm ''De Morte Peregrini''], 4, 33, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Heracles "was he who brought [[Cerberus]], the hound of Hades, from the underworld, a point of special appeal to the dog-man, Diogenes."&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;Orlando Patterson: [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0w9bA4PeOQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA186&amp;lpg=RA1-PA186&amp;dq=Cerberus+Cynics+Heracles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x1qmPJVy56&amp;sig=mMiI_KA938eJmULvCwbDWtBwXdA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TiKwSeyDKJaitge5nNngBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result ''Freedom''. p. 186]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lucian]], "Cerberus and Cynic are surely related through the dog."&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/LucianDialoguesDead1.html#4 ''Dialogues of the Dead'', 21]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cynic way of life required continuous training, not just in exercising judgments and mental impressions, but a physical training as well:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Diogenes] used to say, that there were two kinds of exercise: that, namely, of the mind and that of the body; and that the latter of these created in the mind such quick and agile impressions at the time of its performance, as very much facilitated the practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect without the other, since the health and vigour necessary for the practice of what is good, depend equally on both mind and body.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

None of this meant that a Cynic would retreat from society. Cynics were in fact to live in the full glare of the public's gaze and be quite indifferent in the face of any [[insults]] which might result from their unconventional behaviour.&lt;ref name="kidd" /&gt; The Cynics are said to have invented the idea of [[cosmopolitanism]]: when he was asked where he came from, Diogenes replied that he was "a citizen of the world, (''kosmopolitês'')."&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 63&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ideal Cynic would evangelise; as the [[wiktionary:watchdog|watchdog]] of humanity, they thought it their duty to hound people about the error of their ways.&lt;ref name="kidd" /&gt; The example of the Cynic's life (and the use of the Cynic's biting [[satire]]) would dig up and expose the pretensions which lay at the root of everyday conventions.&lt;ref name="kidd" /&gt;

Although Cynicism concentrated solely on [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethics]], Cynic philosophy had a major impact on the Hellenistic world, ultimately becoming an important influence for [[Stoicism]]. The Stoic [[Apollodorus of Seleucia|Apollodorus]] writing in the 2nd century BC stated that "Cynicism is the short path to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Pillars of their philosophy were [[Adiaphora]], [[Parrhesia]] and [[Anaideia]].

==History of Cynicism==
[[File:Antisthenes pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Antisthenes]]
The classical [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Cynics regarded virtue as the only necessity for happiness, and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it. Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the  title of ''Cynic'', derived from the Greek word ''κύων'' (meaning "dog") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogs. They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, [[power (sociology)|power]], and [[celebrity|fame]], to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, [[personal life|lives]].&lt;ref name="cynic1"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cynics.htm ''Cynics''] – ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values, and would criticise the types of behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering. Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;David Mazella, (2007), ''The Making of Modern Cynicism'', University of Virginia Press. {{ISBN|0-8139-2615-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the modern understanding of cynicism as "an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Cynicism ''Cynicism''], ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language''. Fourth Edition. 2006. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy, which emphasized "virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', page 231. Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
Various philosophers, such as the [[Pythagoreans]], had advocated [[simple living]] in the centuries preceding the Cynics. In the early 6th century BC, [[Anacharsis]], a [[Scythians|Scythian]] sage, had combined plain living together with criticisms of Greek customs in a manner which would become standard among the Cynics.&lt;ref&gt;R. Martin, ''The Scythian Accent: Anacharsis and the Cynics'', {{Harvnb|Bracht Branham|Goulet-Cazé|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps of importance were tales of [[India]]n philosophers, known to later Greeks as the ''[[gymnosophists]]'', who had adopted a strict [[asceticism]] together with a disrespect for established [[laws]] and [[Norm (sociology)|customs]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Romm, ''Dog Heads and Noble Savages: Cynicism before the Cynics'', {{Harvnb|Bracht Branham|Goulet-Cazé|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 5th century BC, the [[sophists]] had begun a process of questioning many aspects of Greek society such as [[religion]], law and ethics. However, the most immediate influence for the Cynic school was [[Socrates]]. Although he was not an ascetic, he did profess a love of virtue and an indifference to wealth,&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1656 ''Apology''], 41e.&lt;/ref&gt; together with a disdain for general opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1171 ''Apology''], 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  These aspects of Socrates' thought, which formed only a minor part of [[Plato]]'s philosophy, became the central inspiration for another of Socrates' pupils, Antisthenes.

===Symbolisms===
Cynics were often recognized in the ancient world by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to [[Socrates]] and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epictetus]], 3.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social evolution from the [[Archaic Greece|archaic age]] to the [[Classical Greece|classical]], the public ceased carrying weapons into the ''[[poleis]]''. Originally it was expected that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [[Politics|Politics (Aristotle)]]: bk 2, 1268b&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, and at the same time it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself.&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, 1994[1899]: 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ploug Jørgensen, ''The taming of the  aristoi - an ancient Greek civilizing process?'' [[History of the Human Sciences]]: July 2014 vol. 27 no. 3, pg 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.

===Antisthenes===
{{main|Antisthenes}}
The story of Cynicism traditionally begins with Antisthenes (c. 445–365 BC),&lt;ref name="dudley1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bracht6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bracht Branham|Goulet-Cazé|1996|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was an older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates.  About 25 years his junior, Antisthenes was one of the most important of Socrates' disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1181 ''Symposium''], 4.57–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism,&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 2&lt;/ref&gt; his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism.  In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by [[Diogenes Laërtius]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; writings on [[language]], [[dialogue]] and [[literature]] far outnumber those on ethics or [[politics]],&lt;ref name="prince79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|2005|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time.&lt;ref name="navia40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Navia|1996|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is certainly true that Antisthenes preached a life of [[poverty]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have enough to eat till my hunger is stayed, to drink till my thirst is sated; to clothe myself as well; and out of doors not [even] [[Callias III|Callias]] there, with all his riches, is more safe than I from shivering; and when I find myself indoors, what warmer shirting do I need than my bare walls?&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1181 ''Symposium''], 4.34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Diogenes of Sinope===
[[File:Diogenes looking for a man - attributed to JHW Tischbein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|''Diogenes Searching for an Honest Man'' ({{circa}} 1780) attributed to [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]]]]
{{main|Diogenes}}
Diogenes (c. 412–323 BC) dominates the story of Cynicism like no other figure.  He originally went to Athens, fleeing his home city, after he and his father, who was in charge of the mint at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], got into trouble for falsifying the coinage.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;  (The phrase "defacing the currency" later became proverbial in describing Diogenes' rejection of conventional values.)&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 20, 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Later tradition claimed that Diogenes became the disciple of Antisthenes,&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 6, 18, 21; Aelian, x. 16; Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii. 22. 63&lt;/ref&gt; but it is by no means certain that they ever met.&lt;ref name="long45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dudley2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prince77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|2005|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diogenes did however adopt Antisthenes' teachings and the ascetic way of life, pursuing a life of self-sufficiency (''autarkeia''), austerity (''askēsis''), and shamelessness (''anaidei''a).&lt;ref&gt;Sarton, G., ''Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece,'' Dover Publications. (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many anecdotes about his extreme asceticism (sleeping in a tub),&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 23; Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum, 2.14&lt;/ref&gt; his shameless behaviour (eating raw meat),&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and his criticism of conventional society ("bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters"),&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 66&lt;/ref&gt; and although it is impossible to tell which of these stories are true, they do illustrate the broad character of the man, including an ethical seriousness.&lt;ref name="long33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crates of Thebes===
[[Crates of Thebes]] (c. 365–c. 285 BC) is the third figure who dominates Cynic history.  He is notable because he renounced a large fortune to live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;  He is said to have been a pupil of Diogenes,&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 85, 87; Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii. 22. 63&lt;/ref&gt; but again this is uncertain.&lt;ref name="long46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crates married [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] after she had fallen in love with him and together they lived like beggars on the streets of Athens,&lt;ref&gt;Although there is no mention in ancient sources of them actually begging. Cf. Doyne Dawson, (1992), ''Cities of the gods: communist utopias in Greek thought'', page 135. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; where Crates was treated with respect.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Symposiacs'', 2.1; Apuleius, ''Florida'', 22; Julian, ''Orations'', 6.201b&lt;/ref&gt; Crates' later fame (apart from his unconventional lifestyle) lies in the fact that he became the teacher of [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, i. 15, vi. 105, vii. 2, etc&lt;/ref&gt; The Cynic strain to be found in early Stoicism (such as Zeno's own radical views on sexual equality spelled out in his ''[[The Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'') can be ascribed to Crates' influence.&lt;ref name="schofield"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schofield|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Cynics===
There were many other Cynics in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, including [[Onesicritus]] (who sailed with [[Alexander the Great]] to India), and the moral satirists [[Bion of Borysthenes]] and [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]].  However, with the rise of Stoicism in the 3rd century BC, Cynicism as a serious philosophical activity underwent a decline,&lt;ref name="dudley117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bracht13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bracht Branham|Goulet-Cazé|1996|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not until the [[Roman era]] that Cynicism underwent a revival.

==Cynicism in the Roman world==
[[File:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|''Diogenes Sitting in His Tub'' (1860) by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]]]

There is little record of Cynicism in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC; [[Cicero]] (c. 50 BC), who was much interested in [[Greek philosophy]], had little to say about Cynicism, except that "it is to be shunned; for it is opposed to modesty, without which there can be neither right nor honor."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Officiis'', i. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1st century AD, Cynicism reappeared with full force. The rise of [[Imperial Rome]], like the Greek loss of independence under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] and Alexander three centuries earlier, may have led to a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people, which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self-sufficiency and inner-happiness to flourish once again.&lt;ref name="dudley124"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cynics could be found throughout the empire, standing on street corners, preaching about virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl420.htm ''De Morte Peregrini''], 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian]] complained that "every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog,"&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl421.htm ''Fugitivi''], 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aelius Aristides]] observed that "they frequent the doorways, talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters, making up for their lowly condition by using impudence."&lt;ref name="aristides"&gt;Aelius Aristides, iii. 654–694&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century AD was [[Demetrius the Cynic|Demetrius]], whom [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] praised as "a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself denied it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3794 ''De Beneficiis''], vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and the ideal of the thinker. In the 2nd century AD, Lucian, whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher [[Peregrinus Proteus]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl420.htm ''De Morte Peregrini''].&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher, [[Demonax]], in a dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6829 ''Demonax''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Cynicism came to be seen as an idealised form of [[Stoicism]], a view which led [[Epictetus]] to eulogise the ideal Cynic in a lengthy discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], 3. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Epictetus, the ideal Cynic "must know that he is sent as a messenger from [[Zeus]] to people concerning good and bad things, to show them that they have wandered."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], 3. 22. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately for Epictetus, many Cynics of the era did not live up to the ideal: "consider the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables, and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in [[flatulence|breaking wind]]."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], 3. 22. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Stoicism, which declined as an independent philosophy after the 2nd century AD, Cynicism seems to have thrived into the 4th century.&lt;ref name="dudley202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The emperor, [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] (ruled 361–363), like Epictetus, praised the ideal Cynic and complained about the actual practitioners of Cynicism.&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Oration 6: To the Uneducated Cynics''; ''Oration 7: To the Cynic Heracleios''.&lt;/ref&gt; The final Cynic noted in classical history is [[Sallustius of Emesa]] in the late 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Damascius, ''Life of Isidorus'': fragments preserved in the ''Commentary on Plato's Parmenides'' by [[Proclus]], in the ''Bibliotheca'' of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], and in the ''[[Suda]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A student of the Neoplatonic philosopher [[Isidore of Alexandria]], he devoted himself to living a life of Cynic asceticism.

==Cynicism and Christianity==
[[File:StAnthony.jpg|thumb|Coptic icon of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony of the Desert]], an early Christian ascetic. Early Christian asceticism may have been influenced by Cynicism.&lt;ref name="dudley209"/&gt;]]

===Jesus as a Jewish Cynic===
Some historians have noted the similarities between the teachings of [[Jesus]] and those of the Cynics. Some scholars have argued that the [[Q document]], a hypothetical common source for the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], has strong similarities to the teachings of the Cynics.&lt;ref&gt;Leif Vaage, (1994), ''Galilean Upstarts: Jesus' First Followers According to Q''. TPI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Gerald Downing, (1992), ''Cynics and Christian Origins''. T. &amp; T. Clark.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars on the [[quest for the historical Jesus]], such as [[Burton L. Mack]] and [[John Dominic Crossan]] of the [[Jesus Seminar]], have argued that 1st-century AD [[Galilee]] was a world in which [[Hellenization|Hellenistic]] ideas collided with Jewish thought and traditions. The city of [[Gadara]], only a day's walk from [[Nazareth]], was particularly notable as a centre of Cynic philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;In particular, [[Menippus]] (3rd century BC), [[Meleager of Gadara|Meleager]] (1st century BC), and [[Oenomaus of Gadara|Oenomaus]] (2nd century AD), all came from Gadara.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mack has described Jesus as a "rather normal Cynic-type figure."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in R. Ostling, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968139,00.html ''Who was Jesus?", Time, August 15, 1988, pages 37–42''].&lt;/ref&gt;  For Crossan, Jesus was more like a Cynic sage from a [[Hellenistic Jewish]] tradition than either a [[Christ]] who would die as a [[Substitutionary atonement|substitute for sinners]] or a [[Jewish messianism|messiah]] who wanted to establish an independent Jewish state of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;John Dominic Crossan, (1991), ''The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant'', {{ISBN|0-06-061629-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars doubt that Jesus was deeply influenced by the Cynics and see the Jewish prophetic tradition as of much greater importance.&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans, ''Life of Jesus Research: An Annotated Bibliography'', page 151. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cynic influences on early Christianity===
Many of the ascetic practices of Cynicism may have been adopted by [[early Christians]], and Christians often employed the same [[rhetoric]]al methods as the Cynics.&lt;ref&gt;F. Gasco Lacalle, (1986) ''Cristianos y cinicos. Una tificacion del fenomeno cristiano durante el siglo II,'' pages 111–119. Memorias de Historia Antigua 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Cynics were martyred for speaking out against the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#p291 ''Epitome of book 65'', 15.5]; Herodian, [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre109.html ''Roman History'', 1.9.2–5]&lt;/ref&gt; One Cynic, [[Peregrinus Proteus]], lived for a time as a Christian before converting to Cynicism,&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl420.htm ''De Morte Peregrini''], 10–15&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the 4th century, [[Maximus the Cynic|Maximus of Alexandria]], although a Christian, was also called a Cynic because of his ascetic lifestyle. Christian writers would often praise Cynic poverty,&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''adv. Cels.'' 2.41, 6.28, 7.7; Basil of Caesarea, ''Leg. Lib. Gent.'' 9.3, 4, 20; Theodoret, ''Provid.'' 6; John Chrysostom, ''Ad. Op. Vit. Monast.'' 2.4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; although they scorned Cynic shamelessness: [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] stating that they had, "in violation of the modest instincts of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, {{Ws|''[[s:The City of God/Book XIV/Chapter 20|De Civitate Dei'' 14.20]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ascetic orders of Christianity also had direct connection with the Cynics, as can be seen in the wandering [[mendicant]] monks of the early church who in outward appearance, and in many of their practices differed little from the Cynics of an earlier age.&lt;ref name="dudley209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|pp=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Did Jesus Exist?''''' is a 1975 book written by the modern German historian [[George Albert Wells]] who speculated  on the evidence of [[Jesus Christ]]. Wells argues there was no historical evidence of Jesus existing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=68 | title=Did Jesus Exist? | publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|date= | first= | last=  | accessdate =2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/XXVII/2/447 | title=Review: Did Jesus Exist? | publisher=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|year=1976  | first=John | last=Robinson  | accessdate =2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised second edition was published in 1986.

Wells has since modified his position, and in 2003 stated that he now disagrees with [[Robert M. Price]] on the information about Jesus being "all mythical".&lt;ref name=WellsTrust49&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells (Nov 26, 2003) {{ISBN|0812695674}} pages 49-50: "In my first books on Jesus, I argued that the gospel Jesus is an entirely mythical expansion of the Jesus of the early epistles. The summary of the argument of ''The Jesus Legend'' (1996) and ''The Jesus Myth'' (199a) given in this section of the present work makes it clear that I no longer maintain this position", page 50 states that Wells does not agree with Price: "My present standpoint is: this complex is not all post-Pauline (Q, or at any rate parts of it, may well be as early as ca. A.D. 50); and if I am right, against Doherty and Price - it is not all mythical."&lt;/ref&gt; Wells now believes that the Jesus of the gospels is obtained by attributing the supernatural traits of the Pauline epistles to the human preacher of [[Q source]].&lt;ref&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells (Nov 26, 2003) {{ISBN|0812695674}} page 43 states: "In the gospels, the two Jesus figures - the human preacher of Q and the supernatural personage of the early epistles who sojourned briefly on Earth as a man and then, rejected, returned to heaven - have been fused into one. The Galilean preacher of Q has been given a salvific death and resurrection."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Bart Ehrman]], in his ''Did Jesus Exist?'' (2012) stated: "The best-known mythicist of modern times — at least among the NT scholars who know of any mythicists at all — is George A. Wells...He has written many books and articles advocating a mythicist position, none more incisive than his 1975 book, ''Did Jesus Exist?''. Wells is certainly one who does the hard legwork to make his case: Although an outsider to NT studies, he speaks the lingo of the field and has read deeply in its scholarship. Although most NT scholars will not (or do not) consider his work either convincing or particularly well argued." (p.&amp;nbsp;19).  Wells, 86, provided an answer to these points in an article in ''Free Inquiry''.&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Wells, "Ehrman on the Historicity of Jesus and Early Christian Thinking", ''Free Inquiry'', June–July 2012, p. 58-62. It is a 5-page, 4,100-word answer to Ehrman's book. [http://www.radikalkritik.de/Wells_Ehrman.htm Excerpts available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053543/http://www.radikalkritik.de/Wells_Ehrman.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}, (1,000 words only).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dumbleton–Powles Report''' is a report on [[Scientology]] prepared for the government of [[New Zealand]] by E.V. Dumbleton and [[Guy Powles|Sir Guy Richardson Powles]], and published on 30 June 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/nzhome.html|title=Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand|date=3 February 1969|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology existed in New Zealand at least as early as 1954.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1959 [[L. Ron Hubbard]] purchased and moved into [[Saint Hill Manor]], a few miles from East Grinstead in Sussex, England.  The practice of Scientology spread to a number of English-speaking countries, and Scientology soon attracted attention due to its controversial teachings, policies, and activities.  Several official inquiries took place into Scientology in England, Australia, and elsewhere, and the respective governments published a number of reports in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In 1968 a petition with 716 signatures called upon the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] to set up a board of inquiry into Scientology. The [[Commission of Inquiry]] into the Hubbard Scientology organisation in New Zealand issued public notice that it would hear evidence in Auckland and Wellington in March and April 1969. The commission aimed to "hear about and examine cases where it is said that Scientology has in New Zealand led to the estrangement of families, affected the control of persons under 21, or put unreasonable pressure upon former Scientologists who have left it, or other persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/nz01.html|title= Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing evidence, the Commission found against Scientology, concluding that "the activities, methods, and practices of Scientology did result in persons being subjected to improper or unreasonable pressures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.xenu.net/archive/audit/nz03.html|title= Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on receiving assurances that Scientology would change its practices, the Commission recommended that - subject to those assurances - no immediate action be taken against Scientology.

'''Erlang Shen''' (二郎神), or '''Erlang''' is a [[Religion in China|Chinese]] God with a [[Third eye|third truth-seeing eye]] in the middle of his forehead.

Er-lang Shen may be a deified version of several semi-mythical folk heroes who help regulate China's torrential floods, dating variously from the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]], [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] dynasties. A later [[Buddhist]] source identify him as the second son of the Northern [[Four Heavenly Kings|Heavenly King]] Vaishravana.

In the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] semi-mythical novels ''[[Creation of the Gods]]'' and ''[[Journey to the West]]'' Erlang Shen is the nephew of the [[Jade Emperor]]. In the former he assisted the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] army in defeating the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]]. In the latter, he is the second son of a mortal and Jade emperor's brother.  In the legend, he is known as the greatest warrior god of heaven.

==Origin==
===Li Erlang===
[[File:二郎像.jpg|thumb|250px|Effigy of god Erlang inside the [[Erwang Temple]] in [[Dujiangyan City|Dujiangyan]], [[Sichuan]].]]

Of the various identifications of Erlang Shen the most common is as Li Erlang, the second son of [[Li Bing (administrator)|Li Bing]], the engineer behind the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]].&lt;ref name="chengManchao"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Origin of Chinese Deities |last=Cheng Manchao |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Foreign Languages Press |location=Beijing |isbn=7-119-00030-6 |pages=170–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Story about Li Bing and His Son in Harnessing the Rivers" in ''Records of Guansian'',{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Li Erlang assisted his father in the construction of the complex irrigation system that prevented the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]] from flooding and irrigated the [[Chengdu Plain]]. In thanks for the prosperity that this brought to them the local people elevated the father and son to gods and dedicated the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system#Two Kings Temple|Two Kings Temple]] to their honour.

Legend states that Governor Li Bing sent his son out to discover the source of the flooding. He spent a year exploring the county without success. One day whilst sheltering in a cave he encountered a tiger which he slew and seven hunters who had witnessed this bravery agreed to join him on his quest.

The group finally came to a cottage on the outskirts of Guan County (modern [[Dujiangyan City]]). From within they heard the sound of an old woman crying. The woman was Grandma Wang and she told them that her grandson was to be sacrificed to an evil dragon who was the local river god. Li Erlang reported this to his father who devised a plan to capture the dragon.

The eight friends hid in the River God Temple and jumped out on the dragon when it arrived to claim its offering. The dragon fled to river pursued by Li Erlang who eventually captured it. Grandma Wang arrived with an iron chain and the dragon was secured in the pool below the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system#Dragon-Taming Temple|Dragon-Taming Temple]], freeing the region from floods.

Another legend tells of Li Erlang suppressing a fire dragon that lived in the mountains north of Dujiangyan by climbing to the top of [[Mount Yulei]], turning into a giant and building a dam with 66 mountains then filling it with water from Dragon Pacifying Pool.&lt;ref name="disDragons1"&gt;{{cite news | first = | last = | authorlink = | author = | coauthors = | title = Zhulong | url = | format = | work = | publisher = God Erlang Suppressed Fire Dragon | pages = | page = | date = | accessdate =  | quote =  Legend goes, on one of the northern mountains of Dujiang Dam lived a fire dragon which was raging the common people. Libing asked his son-God Erlang to subdue it. God Erlang climbed onto Yulei Mountain and became a giant. He was as tall as the sky. He wrapped clouds on his waist and cut a tree to make a carrying pole. Then he carried two mountains at a time to build the dam. After he brought 66 mountains the dam was built. God Erlang got water from Pacifying Dragon Pool to put into the dam. At length the fire dragon was subdued.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theatrical interpretation (Bao Lian Deng)==
Erlang Shen means "2nd son god" as direct translation.  Er means 2nd, lang means boy, and Shen means god.  His mother was the goddess of the desire realm in heaven.  Her job was to limit the gods and spirit's mortal desires such as love/affection, greed, and dream.  When she was chasing an evil dragon who broke his chain in his heavenly prison, she fell in love with a mortal man who was willing to save her with his heart.  They had three children: Yang Jiao, Yang Jian (Erlang Shen), and Yang Chan (Holy Mother of Hua Shan).  When Jade emperor discovered her marriage, he sent his son and heaven armies to kill the half bloods, the mortal man, and the goddess of desire realm.  Only Erlang and his sister Yang Chan survived.

==As Li Bing==
As Li Bing, the first hydraulic engineer in the Shu area, was the hero who stopped the flooding of the Min River by constructing the Dujiangyan. This somehow led to Li Bing being turned into a folk hero who defeated a river god in order to save his prefecture from being flooded, where this story had then associated him as a new river god that protected the local people in the area from floods.
However a discrepancy comes up that even though Li Bing/Erlang was known as Guankou Shen, the river that he is associated with is in Qianwei and not Guankou. 
Another  discrepancy is that Li Erlang had never appeared in any of the tales related to stopping the Min River. The first appearance of Li Erlang was in Zhishui ji 治水記 by Li Ying 李膺 of the Liang 梁 Dynasty.

Historically Li Bing was conferred an official title until the Five Dynasties period under the rule of the Shu kingdom. He rose to political power when the great flood that occurred on the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month in 920 CE, was reported to the emperor by Daoist [[Du Guangting]] 杜光庭.

==Yang Jian==
Many legends and novels often describe Erlang as Yang Jian, a nephew of the [[Jade Emperor]].
According to an ancient text Erlang Baojuan, Yang Jian's mother was the Jade Emperor's sister, Princess Yaoji who was imprisoned under Mount Tao, because she violated the Heavenly Rules by marrying a human named Yang Tianyou. Many years later her son Yang Jian cleaved Mount Tao using his axe, hoping to set his mother free. Unfortunately ten Sun Gods (the Jade Emperor's sons) arrived and burnt her to death. 
The angry Yang Jian killed nine of the sun deities, but was advised to release the last sun by the Queen of moon. Later he married a Dragon Princess and canonized as a deity.&lt;ref name="HaroldBurham"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Esoteric Codex: Deities of Knowledge |last=Burham |first=Harold |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2015 |publisher=LULU Press, {{ISBN|1312998571}}, 9781312998575 |location= |isbn= |pages=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Identifications==
Erlang Shen is also identified with Zhao Yu, a hermit who lived on [[Mount Qingcheng]] and was appointed by [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] as Governor of [[Leshan|Jiazhou]]. Zhao Yu is said to have set forth with 1000 men to defeat a flood dragon that had been tormenting the area. Upon reaching the river Zhao Yu dived into the water with his double-edged sword and emerged holding the dragon’s head, Following his death, according to the ''Chronicle of Changshu County'', the region was once again plagued by flood and he was seen riding a white horse amidst the swirling currents. The locals built a temple enshrining Zhao Yu as the God Erlang and the floods were subdued.&lt;ref name="chengManchao" /&gt;

Deng Xia is said to have been a general under Erlang who surpassed his predecessors in valour and defeated a flood dragon, receiving the title "Erlang Shen" and a temple in his honour at Zhongqingli in [[Hangzhou]].&lt;ref name="chengManchao" /&gt;

===Journey to the West===
Erlang makes an appearance near the start of the classic ''[[Journey to the West]]'' by [[Wu Cheng'en]]. Erlang, who is titled as being either True Lord, or Illustrious Sage, is the nephew of the [[Jade Emperor]]. Erlang made his first appearance when he had been ordered by the Jade Emperor (in which Erlang was also with his seven elite sages whom he called his brothers) to subdue [[Sun Wukong]], who was to be punished for his havoc in heaven.
{{quote|His bearing was refined, his visage noble, His ears hung down to his shoulders, and his eyes shone. The hat on his head had three peaks and phoenixes flying, And his robe was of a pale goose−yellow. His boots were lined with cloth of gold; dragons coiled round his socks; His jade belt was decorated with the eight jewels, At his waist was a bow, curved like the moon, In his hand a Three-Pointed Double-Edged Spear. His axe had split open Peach Mountain when he rescued his mother, His bow had killed the twin phoenixes of Zongluo. Widespread was his fame for killing the Eight Demons, And he had become one of Plum Hill's seven sages. His heart was too lofty to acknowledge his relatives in Heaven; In his pride he went back to be a god at Guanjiang. He was the Merciful and Miraculous Sage of the red city, Erlang, whose transformations were numberless.|Description from ''[[Journey to the West]]'', [[Wu Cheng'en]]}}
Throughout the course of Erlang's duel between Sun Wukong, Erlang had been the stronger adversary though Sun Wukong always managed to stay ahead and at times get the better of Erlang thanks to his quick wits. After many transformations that were performed in their duel (Sun Wukong fleeing as a fish; Erlang and Sun Wukong becoming larger birds, and so forth). Near the conclusion of the battle, he managed to see through Sun Wukong's disguise (as a temple) using his third-eye. He eventually defeated Wukong through teamwork with several other gods; [[Laozi]] personally had dropped his refined golden ring that had hit Sun Wukong on the head, giving Erlang a chance to bring him down, and Erlang's [[Dog in Chinese mythology|dog]] bit him in the leg. After Sun Wukong had been captured (to which Sun Wukong retorts that they are cowards for attacking from behind), he and his heavenly soldiers would burn random areas of the [[Mount Huaguo]]. Erlang is seen again far later in the novel when he assists Sun Wukong through chance by fighting against a certain ancient [[Dragon King]] and his villanous son-in-law, a Nine-headed Demon.&lt;ref name="HaroldBurham" /&gt;

===Fengshen Yanyi===
In ''[[Investiture of the Gods]]'', Yang Jian would first appear during the time of the Diablo Brothers' attack on the Western Foothills. After hearing of the situation, Yang would personally take the offensive against the brothers. During his duel against all four brothers, Yang would deliberately allow himself to be consumed by Diablo Long Life's flying mink. Following the battle, Yang Jian would suddenly reappear before [[Jiang Ziya]] after killing the mink inside its stomach with his many transformations. To trick the Diablo Brothers, Yang Jian would later transform himself into Long Life's flying mink and steal Diablo Red's Havoc-Umbrella. Thus, Yang would be renowned as the true reason for Jiang Ziya's victory over the Diablo Brothers at an overall point.&lt;ref name="HaroldBurham" /&gt;

===Bao Lian Deng===
In the tale [[Lotus Lantern]] (''Bao Lian Deng''), Erlang had a sister known as the Holy Mother of [[Mount Hua]] (''Hua Shan''). She married a mortal man, Liu Yanchang, who was a scholar. Together, they had a son by the name of Chen Xiang. She was admonished by Erlang for this unlawful human-deity union and imprisoned under Mount Hua. When Chen Xiang came of age, he split the mountain with an axe to free his mother, but not before facing people who repeatedly tried to undermine his mission, most notably his own uncle Erlang.&lt;ref name="HaroldBurham" /&gt;

===As a filial deity===

In Chinese belief he was a filial son that entered the Chinese [[underworld]] to save his deceased mother from torment and will punish unfilial children by striking them with [[thunder]] strike as a punishment, hence the Chinese parent saying "Being smitten by lightning for being unfilial and ungrateful" towards unruly children. A warrior deity, he wields a ''Sān Jiān Liǎng Rèn Dāo'' (三尖兩刃刀 - "three-pointed, double-edged blade") and always has his faithful ''Xiàotiān quǎn'' (嘯天犬 - "Howling Celestial Dog") by his side. This dog also helps him subdue [[evil spirits]].&lt;ref&gt;https://read01.com/R7GoN.html, retrieved 23 Feb 2017 (二郎神楊戩...三尖兩刃刀，哮天犬。)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HaroldBurham" /&gt;

===In popular culture&lt;ref name="HaroldBurham" /&gt;===

Erlang Shen is mostly portrayed, whether in ancient legends or games or television, as a noble and powerful Warrior God who slays and vanquishes Demons and Monsters in the mortal realm and who embodies justice and righteousness. He is shown to have vast, superhuman strength, being able to cleave an entire mountain with his axe to save his mother in just one stroke and being capable of 72 Transformations(sometimes said to be 73 Transformations), meaning he can transform into virtually anything he wants.
 
His main weapon of choice is his "three-pointed, double-edged Lance" (三尖兩刃槍), a long three-pointed Spear with two cutting edges of a Saber. This Spear is powerful enough to penetrate and cleave through steel and stone like wool. Erlang wields the Divine Spear with unmatched skill and superior mastery, being an unstoppable force of destruction in battle when wielding said Spear, having slain countless Evil Gods, monstrous demonic beasts and vast, massive armies of demons &amp; ogres with it. He is almost always accompanied by his faithful 'Howling Celestial Dog'  (嘯天犬), which has the ability to viciously attack, maul and subdue Demons and evil spirits.

Erlang Shen has also been portrayed as possessing a unique skill known as the "Nine Turns Divine Skill" (九轉玄功). It grants him vast, physical durability of undefined limits and nigh-invulnerability to conventional weapons and various magic spells. In the novel "Creation of the Gods", Erlang was shown to be completely impervious to hits from various powerful mystical objects due to this skill; he has emerged completely unscathed from mystical weapons and artifacts that have proven capable of severely injuring or even killing other Immortals.

Erlang Shen, as a God that embodies justice, can execute 'Heaven's Punishment, by calling down countless massive, devastating bolts of Holy Lightning to strike and totally disintegrate evil beings.

The third-eye on his forehead does not have a fixed name, though its most popular name currently is "The Eye of Heaven" (天眼). It has the ability to differentiate truth from lies and see through deceptions and disguises. It may be used as an offensive weapon, being able to fire continuous, highly destructive blasts of light energy and/or divine fire. 

The light &amp; fire blasts from the third-eye possesses vast, almost immeasurable destructive power; enough power to utterly destroy and vaporize anything it hits, even powerful enough to shatter and disintegrate entire mountains, or completely erase and obliterate hundreds of thousands of Demons from existence in one go, or even cripple and destroy Immortals that have supposedly 'indestructible' bodies.

Erlang Shen is a playable character in the RPG 'League of Immortals' (亂鬥西遊), an action-adventure game that combined RPG and MOBA gameplay. He is known as only 'Erlang' in the game and is of the Immortal Class（仙）, which is strong against the Devil Class（魔）.

The playable character 'Exiled God'（神將）from the Asian MMORPG 'Asura Online'（鬥戰神）is based on Erlang Shen, in appearance and skills. He is a melee fighter who mainly uses the Spear but can also use the Sword and Crossbow. While most of his skills involves deadly combos with his Spear, they include melee attacks with the Celestial Hound and ranged Power attacks with his Heavenly Eye.

In the [[MOBA]] game [[SMITE]], he is a playable character featured as a melee warrior.

The character of Combustion Man from [[Avatar: The Last Airbender]] takes inspiration from Erlang Shen.

[[Dragon Ball]] character [[Tien Shinhan]] is inspired by him. He even has a third eye as well.

In the 1973 animation Chinese Gods the likeness of [[Bruce Lee]] is used to portray him. Here he possesses the Third Eye, kills a dragon and fights a shape-shifting priest.

In the Gumballs&amp;Dungeons roguelike RPG for Android, Erlang Shen, accompanied by his dog Xiàotiān quǎn as sidekick is a playable character with the "Eye of Heaven" designed as a specific attack for him, causing damage and diminishing the defense of the enemies.

In the 2010s, uprisings of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant | Islamic State]] (IS), formerly called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have led to violations of religious freedom in certain parts of Iraq.

There were allegations that the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG) engaged in discriminatory behavior against Christians.

==History==

===Early history===
The geographical area surrounding Santa María De Lara was populated by numerous [[Roman villa]]e preceding the construction of the church.&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt; After the [[Visigoths]] had invaded the Iberian Peninsula (particularly the area we now know as Spain) and the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] had left the area, they settled in Quintillana de las Vinas, and built the church of Santa María De Lara, around the beginning of the 8th century. Soon afterwards, in 711 AD, the [[Moors]]   invaded the Iberian Peninsula&lt;ref name="brittanica1"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (Second Edition), 1970, pages 140(b)-141(a)&lt;/ref&gt; and Lara was abandoned as the populace fled north to the [[Picos de Europa|mountains]].&lt;ref name="smdl"&gt;"Santa María De Lara", An informative booklet on the church - Jesus Vicario Moreno, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, during the Spanish [[Reconquista]], the areas that were previously abandoned (such as Lara), were repopulated, although the buildings were largely in ruins. Santa María De Lara was neglected during the period of [[Moors|Moorish]] rule, and therefore the church had to be rebuilt. A funerary [[stela]] that is now housed in the Museum of Burgos that has been studied by archeologists, is believed to record the date of the reconstruction of Santa María De Lara. It is inscribed with the letters '''DCCCC''' (...), and despite the only partial remnant of the date, it is widely believed that this refers to the year 902&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt; (bearing in mind that the inscription adheres to the Spanish medieval [[Chronological dating|dating system]], from which 38 years must be subtracted to obtain the European chronological year).
[[Image:Santamariadelaraback.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the western side of the church. The ruins of the foundations of the previously sizeable nave can be seen, as well as rooms that provided for the monks who lived in Santa María de Lara during the 10th century. This part of the church collapsed during the period of time that the church was abandoned, from around 1100.]]

A document that has been dated from the year 967 AD (or the Spanish [[Medieval]] date 929) records a monetary donation to the church and the monastery that, at that time, was under the control of Santa María de Lara, by a woman named ''Muniadona'', the mother of [[Fernán González of Castile]].&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt; However, due to the lack of documents from that early era, historians have been unable to verify the location of this monastery.

In 1038, the church was donated to the nearby monastery of [[San Pedro de Arlanza]]&lt;ref name="jdie"/&gt; and from then on the church began a gradual decline both in religious status and architectural stability. Undated documents from the [[Bishop]]ry of Burgos later refer to it as a 'hermitage'.&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt;' After that, the church was abandoned, and parts of the building collapsed  and much of its ancient [[Wood carving|carvings]] and decoration was lost.

===Discovery and modern history===
In 1921, a local [[parish priest]], was walking near Quintanilla de las Vinas, when he came across the remains of Santa María de Lara, forgotten since the early [[Middle Ages]] and hidden by thick bush. Don Bonifacio Zamora, the priest, strived to bring his discovery to the interest of historians and experts.&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt; However, until 1927, he was unsuccessful and the site was used simply as a [[corral]] for livestock. In 1927, the church was finally brought to the attention of experts such as Helmut Schlunk, a notable German scholar, who, amongst others, visited this 'newly discovered' Visigoth church in order to research it.&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitehillClapham2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitehill|first1=W. M.|last2=Clapham|first2=A. W.|title=The Church of Quintanilla de las Viñas|journal=The Antiquaries Journal|volume=17 |issue=1|year=1937|pages=16–27 |issn=0003-5815|doi=10.1017/S0003581500010581}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter1928"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kingsley Porter|first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Kingsley Porter|title=Spanish Romanesque Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGbqAAAAMAAJ|year=1928|publisher=Pantheon casa editrice|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlunk, Helmut, “Arte Visigodo”. in ''Ars Hispaniae'', vol. II. Madrid, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of studying the site, it was granted 'National Monument' status on 25 November 1929. Later, during the 1930s, extensive excavations were carried out that revealed a large amount of data that shows the area was inhabited from early times. The research undertaken in the 1920s and 1930s has given us almost all we know about the church today. Many of the [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s uncovered, such as funerary [[stela]]e, [[dolmen]]s and objects from [[Roman villa]]e, are now housed in the 'Museo Provincial de Burgos.&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt;'

Up until the 1970s, the church could only be reached by a local road, until Jesus Vicario Moreno, who looked after Santa María de Lara and showed it to visitors until his recent death, oversaw the construction of an [[asphalt]] road leading to the church from Quintanilla de las Vinas, where he lived. Tourism and visitors to the site have provided money to keep the church stable and protect it with projects such as the modern wooden roof. Numbers of visitors have increased significantly and in 1992, 8000 tourists were recorded to have visited the site.&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt;

==Connected historic persons==

===Lady Flammola===
Lady Flammola is mentioned in an [[inscription]] carved onto the right side of the [[triumphal arch]] within the church   of the church. Translations differ, but it is believed that the text, reading ''{{lang|la|+ OC EXIGUUM EXIGUA OFF(ERO) D(E)O FLAMMOLA VOTUM}}'', meaning "Flammola, the least of the least, makes this promised offering to God".&lt;ref name=Villalon2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sepúlveda González |first=María de los Ángeles |title=Los anagramas y el programa iconográfico de Quintanilla de las Viñas: una hipótesis de interpretación |journal=En La España Medieval |volume=V |publisher=Editorial de la Universidad Complutense |location=Madrid |year=1986 |url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ELEM/article/download/ELEM8686221217A/24339 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another translation is: ''This small gift the Lady Flammola offers to God''.&lt;ref name="ema"&gt;[http://www.earlymedievalart.com/category/stonework/ A webpage featuring a short article regarding the carvings within the church]&lt;/ref&gt; Dona Lambra, as modern historians now refer to Lady Flammola,&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt; possibly ordered the [[Building restoration|restoration]] of the church in the 10th century, and supported it with the money that she donated according to the inscription.&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt; However, there are numerous women dating from that period of time that bear the same name, so a more accurate dating of the inscription may reveal precisely who it was that ordered the restoration.

===Fernán González family===
Muniadona features in an early document from 967 AD,&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt; which records her giving a donation to the church. Muniadona was the mother of Count [[Fernán González of Castile]] (who at that point ruled over Castile&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490665/Ramiro-II#ref=ref182291 "Ramiro II"] Online ''Britannica'' article&lt;/ref&gt;).

Fernán González of Castile, the first independent count of Castile, was closely linked to the church, which is evident for three reasons. First, he was a member of the influential Lara family, and shares his name with the church.&lt;ref name="fernan"&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/f/fernan_gonzalez.htm A short biography of Fernan González] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in, and later commanded, the castle of Lara,&lt;ref name="fernan"/&gt; which is visible from Santa María de Lara with favourable weather.&lt;ref name="smdl"/&gt; He was buried in the monastery of [[San Pedro de Arlanza]],&lt;ref name="fernan"/&gt; which at that point owned Santa María de Lara.

p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct  from [[Krishnaism]], as in the revival of [[Bhakti]], found in the [[Bhagavata]] it is referred as Vishnuism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2753385 Review: by Kenneth Scott Latourette] India and Christendom: The Historical Connections between Their Religions. by Richard Garbe; Lydia Gillingham Robinson Pacific Affairs, Vol. 34, No. 3 (Autumn, 1961), pp. 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of Vaishnavism are referred to as ''Vaishnava(s)'' or ''Vaishnavites''. According to recent statistics, a majority of [[Hindu]]s are Vaishnavas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Hinduism Major Branches - Hinduism] from adherents.com&lt;/ref&gt; with the vast majority living in [[India]]. The name Vaishnavite is a direct translation of Vishnite and often lead to confusion. Some sources identify  Visnuism with  Vaishnavism, while others prefer to distinguish Vishnuism from Krishnaism and Ramaism.

In his ''The Religions of India'', Edward Washburn Hopkins presents an accepted distinction as to the assumption that Vishnuism is associated with Vedic [[Vedic Brahmanism|brahmanism]], and was part of [[Vedic Brahmanism|brahmanism]].  Krishnaism was adopted much later, and it is for this reason, amongst others, that despite its modern iniquities [[Shiva|Siva]] has appealed more to the [[brahmana]]s than Krishna. Its only later that Vishnuism merged with Krishnaism.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins,''The Religions of India'', p. 530:  "When, however, pantheism, nay, even Vishnuism, or still more, Krishnaism, was an accepted fact upon what, then, was the wisdom of the priest expended?"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''Vaishnavism'' and ''Vishnuism'', entered the English language in the 19th century, and was formed by attaching the suffix ''[[-ism]]'' to [[Sanskrit]] ''Vaishnava''  or ''Vishnu'' ([[IAST]]: {{IAST|vaiṣṇava}} or {{IAST|viṣṇu}}), where first is the ''[[vriddhi]]'' form of the second meaning "relating, belonging, or sacred to Vishnu" or "a worshiper or follower of Vishnu".&lt;ref&gt;''Vaishnavism'' in {{cite book |editor-last=Simpson |editor-first=John |editor-link=John Simpson (lexicographer) |editor2=[[Edmund Weiner|Weiner, Edmund]] |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |edition=Second |year=1989 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=USA |isbn=0-19-861186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However ''Vaishnava'' may also refer to worshiper of [[Rama]], [[Nrisimha]] or [[Krishna]], whereas ''Vishnuite'' more often refers to one who primarily worships Vishnu.

==Principal beliefs==

===Vishnu: The Supreme===
[[File:Vishnu.jpg|thumb|Vishnu, as commonly depicted in his four-armed form]]
The principal belief of Vishnuism is the identification of [[Vishnu]] as supreme or principal worship of him as was the case in the Historical Vedic times. Hopiks writes: there is a passage like the great Ka hymn of the [[Rig Veda]], 'whom as god shall one worship?' The sages say to Vishnu: "All men worship thee;"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Washburn Hopkins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dj33XvXqJO8C&amp;pg=PA581&amp;dq=Vishnu+Rig+Veda+worship+Vishnuism&amp;ei=Bo-TSOnkIZ7QigHPn4jOCA&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3fNpHXjhFT0D1d-dEyGGYPiBOY4g The Religions of India p. 581]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rig Veda he is referred by his name of ''[[Vamana|trivikrama]]'' (who took three strides&lt;ref name = Guy/&gt;)  and is believed by some scholars as the starting point of the evidence of such worship.

==History of Vishnu-centered Vaishnavism==
[[File:Tirumala temple.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Temple]] dedicated to the worship of Vishnu as [[Venkateswara]].]]

Number of stages to the history of Vaishnavism place worship of Vishnu in different perspective according to the different theories by different authors. On the first stage, in its twofold aspect - historic and philosophical, is referred as by some as Bhagavata and is believed to be founded by [[Krishna-Vasudeva]], of [[Yadu|Yadava]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Chrierson, ''Narayani and the Bhagavatas'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhandakar, ''Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts,'' pp. 72-74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, ''Monotheistic Religion of Anscient India'',p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical basis of this stage was that supreme being is eternal, infinite and full of grace, and that salvation consisted in a life of perpetual bliss near the Lord.&lt;ref name = EOH&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ot8YesdjROQC&amp;pg=PA1077&amp;dq=Visnu+Bhagavatism&amp;lr=&amp;ei=1SOSSMrcLYa4jgGcw_T5DA&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0bwmnAGaoSWdFEIM6tqBiPfMbPzQ#PPA1076,M1 Encyclopaedia of Hinduism], (ed) N.K. Singh, p.1076&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage some believe that Pancaratra entered into alliance with ancient [[Samkhya]] [[yoga|yogic]] system, in line with tendency to combine philosophy with religion.&lt;ref&gt;Garbe, ''Bhagavad Gita'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; It is this period that is described as the stage when the sect of [[Narayana]] was absorbed into temple of Krishna-Vasudeva.&lt;ref name = EOH/&gt; According to Grierson's views at this stage [[Bhagavatism]] became a sect of Brahmanised anti-Brahmanists.&lt;ref&gt;Chrierson, ''Narayani and the Bhagavatas'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins often remarked on the often expressed view, that Bhagavad Gita bears witness to the compromise thus arrived at between [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Bhagavatism]] - "it is a [[Krishnaism|Krishnaite]] version of a [[Vishnu]]ite poem.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''Religions of India'', p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Krishna, the personal name of [[Vasudeva]], was given ''admission'' into the circle of Brahminical gods as an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name = EOH/&gt;

Adoption of [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] as one of the [[avatar]]s of Vishnu under Bhagavatism believed to be similarly a canalizing factor in assimilation in relationships during [[Gupta period]] 330-550 CE. Thus [[Mahayana Buddhism]] is sometimes called ''Buddha-Bhagavatism''.&lt;ref name="Budd"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hāṇḍā, Omacanda |title=Buddhist Art &amp; Antiquities of Himachal Pradesh: Up to 8th Century A.D. |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1994 |isbn=81-85182-99-X |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in this period that it is commonly accepted among academics that the concept of [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] was fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus complex religion of Vaishnavism is often viewed as a synthesis of the worship of gods Vishnu, [[Narayana]], [[Vasudeva]] and [[Krishna]] which is archived by the time of [[Bhagavad Gita]] (c. 4th century BCE to 3rd century CE).&lt;ref name = Guy/&gt; Worship of Vishnu is called Vishnuism and the monotheistic worship of Vishnu was already well developed in the period of the [[Itihasa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074641/Vaishnavism britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Vaishnavism flourished in [[South India]] and it is still commonplace, especially in present-day [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], as a result of the twelve [[Alvars]], saints who spread the sect to the common people with their devotional [[hymn]]s. The temples which the Alvars visited or founded are now known as [[Divya Desams]]. Their poems in praise of [[Vishnu]] and [[Krishna]] in [[Tamil language]] are collectively known as ''Naalaayira'' [[Divya Prabandham]] (alternatively called as [[Dravida Vedas]]).&lt;ref name=Annangaracariyar1971&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4127">{{nihongo|'''Houkisugi''' or '''Hōkisugi at Nakagawa'''|箒スギ}} is a 2000-year-old Japanese cedar ([[cryptomeria]]) at Nakagawa Settlement, [[Yamakita, Kanagawa|Yamakita town]], [[Ashigarakami District, Kanagawa|Ashigarakami District]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]].

==General Description==
[[File:Yamakita-Hokisugi.jpg|thumb|200px|Houkisugi at Nakagawa, photograph taken in June, 2007]]
Houkisugi at Nakagawa is estimated to be more than 2000 years old. Its height is about {{convert|45|m}}. The circumference at head height is {{convert|12|m}}. The circumference around the root is {{convert|18|m}}. It was [[Cultural Properties of Japan|designated]] as a national [[Monuments of Japan|Natural Monument]] on March 26, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=401&amp;item_id=791 |title=箒スギ |trans-title=Hoki Sugi |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.town.yamakita.kanagawa.jp/contents_detail.php?frmId=207 |title=箒杉 |trans-title=Hoki Sugi |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Yamakita, Kanagawa|Yamakita Town]] |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was revered by locals because it prevented a great fire from spreading in 1904. There is still visible fire damage on the tree. On July 12, 1972, it stopped a great landslide and lessened the damage during heavy rainfall in the [[Tanzawa Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi[2009:64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yomiuri[1990:70-71]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe[1999:160]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
There are two views about the origin of the term "Houki:" 1) The place was earlier called ''Houkizawa'' or 2) the tree is Japanese [[Broom]] shaped. Broom is Houki in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi[2009:64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yomiuri[1990:70-71]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe[1999:160]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the [[Edo]] era, the felling of trees such as  [[cryptomeria]], ''[[Chamaecyparis obtusa]], [[Zelkova serrata]]'', [[firs]] (Abies), ''[[Tsuga sieboldii]]'', or ''[[Torreya nucifera]]'' was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi[2009:64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe[1999:160]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Meiji Restoration]], trees which were around the cryptomeria tree were cut down, and the area became a Japanese tea plantation.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi[2009:64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe[1999:160]&lt;/ref&gt; The local people held [[shinto]] ceremonies at the local guardian shrine called Suga Shrine on July 12 and October 13 (Festival) thanking the sacred tree. They cleaned the shrine every month. In the summer of 2003, a branch of the tree was broken but the tree was restored to health with the treatment by an [[arborist]].&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi[2009:64]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
*In 1990, this tree was selected as one among the ''New Japan Noted 100 Trees'' by  [[Yomiuri Shimbun]].
*This tree was selected as one among the ''100 Noted Trees'' in Kanagawa Prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;Yomiuri[1990:70-71]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001, this tree was selected as one in ''Kanagawa Prefecture Future Heritage'' by Kanagawa Prefecture and Kanagawa Shimbun.

[[File:Palacio Alvorada commons.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"The Iaras", bronze sculpture by Cheschiatti, at the [[Palácio da Alvorada|Alvorada Palace]]]]
'''Iara''', also spelled '''Uiara''' or '''Yara''' ({{IPA-pt|iˈjaɾɐ}}, {{IPA-pt|iˈaɾɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈjaɾɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|wiˈjaɾɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|ujˈjaɾɐ|}}) or '''Mãe das Águas''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈmɐ̃j dɐˈz aɣwɐs|}}, "mother of waters"), is a figure from [[Brazilian mythology]] based on ancient [[Tupi people|Tupi]] and [[Guaraní mythology]]. The word derives from [[Old Tupi]] ''yîara'' = ''y'' + ''îara'' (water + lord/lady) = lady of the lake (water queen). She is seen as either a water [[nymph]], [[siren (mythology)|siren]], or [[mermaid]] depending upon the context of the story told about her. The Brazilian town of Nova Olinda claims the Cama da Mãe D’água as the home of Iara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guiabrasilturismo.com.br/pontos_turisticos.asp?regiao=regiao2z3# Article on the city of Olinda]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iara is a beautiful young woman, sometimes described as having green hair, light brown or copper-colored skin (as that of an Indigenous Amerindian from Brazil, or of a {{lang|pt|[[caboclo]]}}) and brown eyes, connected to a freshwater dolphin, manatee or fish body (the Tupi word ''y'' did not have a distinct meaning, being used in general for any riverine or freshwater lacustrine place) who would sit on a rock by the river combing her hair or dozing under the sun. When she felt a man around she would start to sing gently to lure him. Once under the spell of the Iara a man would leave anything to live with her underwater forever, which was not necessarily a bad thing, as she was pretty and would cater for all needs of her lover for the rest of his life.

It is often claimed that, until the 18th century, the Iara legend was originally about an aggressive monstrous river [[merman]] known as Ipupiara ("freshwater monster", {{IPA-pt|ipupiˈaɾɐ|}} in Portuguese phonological rules; by that [Pre-[[History of Portugal (1640–1777)|Pombaline]]] time, most Brazilians still spoke {{lang|pt|[[língua geral|línguas gerais]]}}), that would readily devour fishers, rather than that of a seducing, docile river [[mermaid]].

Iaras are immortal (like the nymphs of [[Greek mythology]]), but her lovers do age and die, which means that they live most of eternity alone.

The legend of the Iara was one of the usual explanations for the disappearance of those who ventured alone in the [[Rainforest|jungle]].

Iara (or Yara) is also a very popular female name in Brazil.

The Iara is similar in nature to several other female figures of folklore from other regions such as [[La Llorona]] from Mexico and the Southwestern United States, the Colombian creatures La [[Patasola]] and the ''[[Tunda]]'' and the [[Deer Woman]] of North America.  All are females who at times function as sirens leading men to their death.

In the 1969 [[Macunaíma (film)|film version]] of the novel ''[[Macunaíma (novel)|Macunaíma]]'', the protagonist of the same name meets his death at the hands of an Iara. He embraces her eagerly and sees too late the blow hole in the back of her neck that gives her away as the creature she is and not the beautiful woman he mistook her for.

This physical deformity marking an otherwise perfect woman is a common theme among siren figures in the Americas but it is usually one of the feet. [[Deer Woman]] has hooves for feet, La [[Patasola]] and the ''Tunda'' have deformed feet and ''La Llorona'' is often said to have no feet by those who see her.

The [[Twelve Imams]] are the spiritual and political successors to [[Muhammad]], the [[Prophets in Islam|Prophet of Islam]], in the Twelver branch of [[Shia Islam]].{{sfn |Britannica |2007}} According to Twelver theology, the successors to Muhammad are [[The Fourteen Infallibles|infallible]] human beings, who rule justly over the community and maintain and interpret [[sharia]] and undertake the [[esoteric interpretation of the Quran]]. The [[Sunnah|words and deeds]] of Muhammad and the Imams guide the community. For this, the Imams must be free from error and sin and chosen by divine decree—[[Nass (Islam)|''nass'']]—through the Prophet.{{sfn |Nasr |1979 |p=10}}{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=B0OL5Z8S-V0C}} 173]}}

Shi'a believe that divine wisdom—[['Aql]]—is the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge—''[[hikmah]]''—and that their suffering is a means by which their devotees may acquire divine grace.{{sfn |Britannica |2007}}{{sfn |Nasr |1979 |p=15}}{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |pp=45–51}} The Imam is not the recipient of [[wahy|divine revelation]], but has a close relationship with God, who guides him, allowing the Imam in turn to guide others. The Imamat, or belief in the divine guide, is a fundamental belief in Shia Islam and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.{{sfn |Martin |2004}}

According to the Twelvers, an Imam of the Age is always the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law. [[Ali]] was the first Imam in this line and in the view of Twelvers the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by the male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter [[Fatimah]]. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was the brother of [[Hasan ibn Ali]].{{sfn |Britannica |2007}} The twelfth and final Imam is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is believed by the Twelvers to be alive and [[The Occultation#Major Occultation|in hiding]].{{sfn |Martin |2004}}

==Imamah==
According to al-Mofid and Allamah Hilli, Imamate is a universal authority over the religious and secular matters of the community as the successor of the prophet{{sfn |Rizvi |2000}}{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1985 |p=21}} and in Shia theology it means the legitimate successor to the Islamic community who are just the family of the prophet (ahl al-Bayt).{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=20}} not because they are the prophet's family, but because they have the prerequisites of religious and political leadership.{{sfn |Vaezi |2004 |p=56}} Allamah Tabatabaei states that Imamate is under investigation from three perspectives: Islamic government, Islamic sciences and spiritual guidance.The Motahhari states that the term Imamate reflects spiritual and sociopolitical leadership.{{sfn |Rizvi |2000 |p=}} Shia theology, philosophy and mysticism, politics as well as historical progression derives from the doctrine of Imamah.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=2}}

==Necessity==
Two important functions of [[Muhammad]] were to reveal the divine law to humans and to guide them towards [[Allah|God]]. Twelver Shia believe that with the death of Muhammad, the first function, [[Wahy|divine legislation]], is completed, but that the second, guiding people and preserving and explaining the [[Sharia|divine law]], is continued through the Imams.{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=147}} [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam, explaining why the Imams are needed, states: "So that the world may remain in righteousness, thus Allah withholds chastisement from the world while a Prophet or Imam is upon it, for Allah has said 'Allah will not chastise them while you are among them' [http://tanzil.net/#8:33 8:33] and the Prophet had said ' the stars are safety for the people of the heaven and the members of my family are safety for the people of the earth. By ''members of my family'' is meant the Imams....Through them Allah gives sustenance ([[Rizq]]) to His servants and through them His lands prosper and the rain falls from the heaven and the earth gives out its blessings".{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=148}} The prophetic mission must be followed by a keeper of the [[Quran]] because it contains esoteric depth, superficial contradictions and hidden meaning. The meaning can be manifested not by ordinary knowledge, but by an inspired heir who is the Hujjah of Allah. Divine knowledge is attainable only through divine revelation or inspiration.{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=46}} While the prophet was a "legislative prophet" (nabi al-tashri), the continuation of the "esoteric prophecy" (nubuwah al-batiniyah) is through [[walayah]]. The role of the Imam in society is equivalent to the role of the mind in the body.{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=159}}

===Theological aspect===
{{Aqidah |Shia}}

====The station of Imams====
Before the creation of the world, from His own light, Allah derived a light called light of Nubuwwa (prophethood) or exoteric and from that derived another light called Walaya (Imamah) or esoteric. Allah said "Here is a Light from my Light, its trunk is the prophecy and its branch is the Imamate; prophecy belongs to Muhammad, my servant and messenger and Imamate belongs to Ali, my proof and my friend. Without them, I would have created none of my creation..." The very names of prophecy and Imamate are derived from the names of Allah.{{sfn |Amir Moezzi |1994 |p=30}} Allah has two kinds of attributes: Essence (Dhat) and Act (Fi'l); attributes of Essence exist in Allah Himself, not having its opposites, but attributes of the act, the Most Beautiful Names of Allah, are those which are manifested in His creatures, these creatures of manifestation of these attributes are Imams.Through these creatures, men could know His attributes.This is His plan to make Himself known.{{sfn |Amir Moezzi |1994 |p=45}} By verse [http://tanzil.net/#2:124 2:124], Shia believe that the position of Imamate is higher than prophethood.{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=306}}{{sfn |Kardan |2014 |}} Shia believe that Imam is God's Witness for the people, the Gate to God (bāb Allāh) and the Road (sabīl) and the Pillar of His Unity{{sfn |Nasr |2008 |p=318}} so he should be infallible and chosen by God.{{sfn |Nasr |2008 |p=318}} [[Allamah al-Majlisi]], a Shia scholar of the [[Safavid Empire|Safawid]] era, states: "The Imams are superior to the prophets (except Muhammad) and the entire creation. The Covenant of the Imams was taken from the prophets, the angels and the entire creation. The major prophets called [[Ulu'l azm prophets|ulul-‘Azm]] (Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa and ‘Isa ) attained the status of ulul-‘Azm on account of loving the Imams."{{sfn |Majlisi |pp=267–318–88}} Muḥammad al-Bāqir narrates that God chose Ibraham first as a worshipper (ʿabd), then a prophet (nabī), then a messenger (rasūl), then a friend (khalīl) and finally as an Imam over the people.{{sfn |Lalani |2010 |p=33}} The Imams in many passages of Quran are referred as the Light of God (Nur), His Witnesses among mankind (Shuhada), His Signs (Ayat), those firm in the knowledge (Rasikhun), the vicegerents of God on earth (Khulafa), the gates through which he is approached (Abwab), the heirs of the knowledge of the prophet.The Imam is endowed with the holy spirit (Ruh al-Kuds).{{sfn |Madelung |2015}} Shi'a Twelver believes that five ''Messengers'' achieved the rank of Leadership:[[Noah in Islam|Nuah]], [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]], [[Moses in Islam|Musa]], [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]], [[Muhammad]]

====Vicegerent (Khalifat Allah)====
The Imam as vicegerent is the representative of all of God's attributes, whom he manifests. The Imam is God's image and face.{{sfn |Nasr |2008 |p=424,425}} It is the highest position for man that is mentioned, ([http://tanzil.net/#2:30 2:30]) which causes the [[angels]] to prostrate themselves before him ([http://tanzil.net/#15:30 15:30]).{{sfn |Javadi Amoli |2008 |p=92}} Khalifah is God's appointee ([http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/38:26 38:26]).{{sfn |Askari |1998 |p=71}} As God's best representative and sign, the vicegerent in the best way can contribute to God's goals. So every attribute which God owns by His [[Essence]], the vicegerent also owns by [[accident]]. The vicegerent is the epiphany (mazhar){{efn |like a mirror in which the image appears without being incarnate in it}} of God's divine names. In fact he is the soul of the universe which can cause [[Ontology|ontological]] changes in it.{{sfn |Javadi Amoli |2008 |p=93}}

====Mediator====
[[Muhammad Baqir Majlisi|Allamah al-Majlisi]] states that the Imams are mediators between [[Allah|God]] and humankind and that through their intercession, man can escape the punishment of the last day. In addition to [[Muhammad]]'s role as intermediate between God and man, he is also a mediator before God on behalf of his followers. According to [[Shia]] belief, this idea of a religious mediator includes the Imams.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=103}} [[Ibn Babawayh|Al-Shaykh al-Saduq]] has recorded a tradition that the prophet told [[Ali]]: "There are three things that I swear to be true. The first is that you and your descendants are mediators for mankind, as they will not be able to know Allah except through your introduction. The second is that you are to present to Allah those who may enter Paradise, i.e. those who recognize you and those whom you recognize. The third is that you are the absolute mediators, for those who will go to Hell will only be those who do not recognize you and whom you do not recognize." [[Muhammad al-Baqir|Al-Baqir]] said, "through us God is known and is worshiped by human kind...whoever calls Allah through our mediation is blessed".{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=344,345}} Without Imam, [[Theophany|theophanic]] form (mazhar) and Face of Allah, no one can know Allah because through him, Allah manifests himself.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=170}} [[Mulla Sadra]] explains that as the Imam is the perfect man—''insan al-Kamel''—is a higher-degree creature and the existence of the lower depends upon the higher degree, so the existence of the Imam is necessary.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=179}}

====Wali====
{{main |Walayah (Twelver doctrine)}}
Shia believe that the Divine Truth or the True Religion has two aspects: exoteric ([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]]) and esoteric ([[Batin (Islam)|batin]]). The exoteric side is revealed by the prophet and his Holy Book to the general people but the esoteric side is the mission of Imams and for the believers by the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran]](Ta'wil).{{sfn |Amir Moezzi |1994 |p=29 }} As the exoteric speaks of Shariah and esoteric speaks of Haqiqah, it is not a matter of succession but a matter of simultaneity.{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=27}} Haqiqah is based on the spiritual meaning of Quran.{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=38}} The kinship between the prophet and Imams is the sign of their [[walayah]], not the basis for their walayah.{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=61}} According to Shia just those are the real faithful that "Allah has written faith upon their hearts" ([http://tanzil.net/#58:22 58:22]): only if Walayah is obtained the faith is perfect.{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=63}} Shia theologians refer to the verse [http://tanzil.net/#5:55 5:55] as a proof for the Walayah of Imams.{{sfn |Vaezi |2004 |p=58}} According to Motahhari, Walayah has four dimensions: the right of love, loving the Ahl al-Bayt is obligatory for all Muslims, the authority of Alh al-Bayt in spiritual guidance, the authority of Ahl al-Bayt in socio-political guidance and the authority of the universal nature by the grace of Allah.{{sfn |Rizvi |2000}} By Shia, in fact, a guardian must protect the religion against any additions or subtractions after the prophet. According to al-Baqir, the prophet has revealed the religion but in every age there must be an Imam who leads to the religion and verse [http://tanzil.net/#13:7 13:7] refers to Imam.{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=308,309}} A [[hadith]] narrates that "He who knows himself knows his Lord.",{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=168}} but knowing Allah without His theophanic form (Mazhar), the Face of Allah, is impossible. Imam is the one who carries the human knowledge of Allah, without him we will be trapped in ta'til or metaphysical idolatry (tashbih)."{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=170,171}} Numerous Shia hadith narrate: The Quran is the silent Imam, the Imam is the speaking Quran; Imam is the Guide by whom Quran remains alive. Regarding this matter, Mulla Sadra believes that the earth can not be without an Imam otherwise, the Quran will die.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=177,178}} By Shia, Wali is the one who has the most love and devotion to God, so God has bestowed His knowledge upon him.{{sfn |Nasr |2008 |p=316}}

====Hujjah====
{{see also |Hujja}}
The Hujja means the proof or God's guarantee to men; as the presence of the Hujja, whether hidden or apparent, is necessary for all times, this presence expresses the metaphysical reality of the Hujja and the inseparability of the prophetology from Imamology.{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=40}} Al-Baqir stated, "...Imam is the Proof of Allah to His servants and the earth will not remain without the Proof of Allah to His servants".{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=148}} From the Time of [[Adam]], Allah has sent Imams to guide the people towards Him who are His Hujjah upon His worshippers.{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=83}} Khomeni described "Proof of Allah" as follows: "A ‘Proof of Allah’ is one whom Allah has designated to
conduct affairs, all his deeds, actions and sayings constitute a proof for the Muslims. If someone commits an offense, will be made to the ‘proof’ for adducing evidence and formulating the charge. If the ‘proof’ commands you to perform a certain act, to implement the penal provisions of the law in a certain way, or to spend the income derived from booty,
zakat and sadaqa in a certain manner and if you fail to obey him in any of these respects, then God Almighty will advance a ‘proof’ against you on the day of Judgment".{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1985 |pp=55}}

===Political aspect===
The Shia believe that only the divinely chosen one is the legitimate leader of the community who owns some spiritual gifts. The first of these leaders was [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and his successors were the descendants of the prophet and the heirs of the charisma of Ali.{{sfn |Dakake |2007 |p=3}} Imams possess all the attributes, duties, authorities of the prophet except receiving revelation. They are the political and religious guardians over the community.{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1985 |pp=56}} Although Imam has a political role, his Imamah does not depend on this role.{{sfn |Madelung |2015}} According to verse [http://tanzil.net/#5:55 5:55], because absolute authority belongs to Allah, He can grant this authority to whomever He wishes as Guardians.{{sfn |Vaezi |2004 |pp=58,59}} Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr stated that the political and spiritual dimensions are inseparable.{{sfn |Mavani |2013 |p=11}}

==Necessary attributes of Imams==
According to Shia theology, Imam must display three attributes: divine appointment (nass), wisdom (hikmah), superiority (afdaliyyah). This right to authority is derived from the prophet and Quran and thereby [[Allah]].{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=4}}

===Nass (divine designation)===
One of the fundamental principles of Shia is that Imam is designated by the prophet and every Imam nominates his successor by divine designation ([[Nass (Islam)|nass]]).{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=314}}{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=147}}{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=153}} The divine designation is a logical necessity because Imam must be infallible and as this is a hidden virtue, known only to Allah. Thus this designation is expressed to the people only by an infallible: the previous Prophet or Imam.{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=314}}{{sfn |Momen |1985 |pp=154,155}} Al-Baqir stated that the prophet was commanded by Allah, before his death, to grant to [[Ali]] his knowledge, his faith and the Great Name (al-Ism al-A'zam), as well as the legacy of knowledge and prophethood so that the Divine Heritage would be continued through the prophet's progency. So one of the fundamentals in the principle of Imamate was nass al-Jali (explicit designation) which was hereditary.{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=77}} Shia Muslims believe that Allah appointed leaders for those who practice the religion of Allah. When the prophet had taught the people the religion, he would then appoint a leader, in accordance with the orders of Allah, to guide believers towards perfection. Imamate is a universal authority and this right is derived from (niyabah) the prophet.{{sfn |Mashita |2013 |p=}} Allamah Majlesi stated that from the time of Adam, every prophet had a successor.{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=316}} Imam like the prophet had a perfect authority over the Muslim community including matters of religion and government.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |pp=105,106}}{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=317}} As the prophet is the representative of Allah, his successor is also a representative of Allah. If he is to represent Allah, he must be appointed by Allah.{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1988 |p=7}} Imam can not be distinguished except by designation.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=101}} Following verse [http://tanzil.net/#2:124 2:124] of [[Quran]], Shia believe that Imamah is something that is given by Allah and must be appointed by Him. The earth never can be without a true Imam.{{sfn |Ayoub |1984 |p=156,157}}{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=98}} The relation between Imams is spiritual, carrying the Muhammadan Light from one Imam to the other.{{sfn |Nasr |1994 |p=159}} The Shia idea that the succession should continue in the descendants of the prophet originates from the Quran as verse [http://tanzil.net/#4:54 4:54].{{sfn |Nasr |2008 |p=312}}

===Ismah===
{{Main |Ismah}}
Shia believe that Ismah is a logical prerequisite of Imamah as Allah has made their obedience necessary and the verse [http://tanzil.net/#33:33 33:33] proves Ismah of the fourteen infallible. Ismah in addition to sinlessness means infallibility, without error.{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=155}} Imam by virtue of Nass based on Hikmah (wisdom) and Nur (light) becomes Ma'sum ([[The Fourteen Infallible|Infallible]]).{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=82}}

===Hikmah (wisdom)===
The Imam has a perfect knowledge about religion and mankind.{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=156}} The Imams are the most knowledgeable in religious law and the rewards and punishments of the next world. They understand the literal meaning and the internal meaning (Ta'wil) of the Quran.{{sfn |Martin |2004 |p=625}} Some [[Hadith]]s state the link between Allah and the Imams is a pillar descending from the heaven.{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=149}} The sources of the knowledge of Imam are the transmission from the previous Imam, inherited knowledge, acquired through angels and acquired from books whose contents are known only to the Imams.{{sfn |Arjomand |1988 |p=26}} According to some Hadiths, Imams possess several special books including [[Al-Jafr (book)|Al-Jafr]] (The Divination), Al-Sahifa (The Book), [[Al-Jamia]] (The Compilation), [[Book of Fatimah]] and a codex of [[Quran]] and its commentary ([[Mus'haf of Ali]]) written by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]].{{sfn |Amir Moezzi |1994 |p=73,74}} He has the knowledge of the [[Names of God in Islam#The Greatest Name|Greatest Name]] of [[Allah]].{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=150}} As Imams are the manifestation of the attributes of act (fi'l) of Allah, their Knowledge is equivalent to the Knowledge of Allah.{{sfn |Amir Moezzi |1994 |p=45}} Imams have all the revealed books of the prophets.{{sfn |Amir Moezzi |1994 |p=73}} As [[Sayyid Haydar Amuli]] states: "All the Imams are one and the same Light (nur), one and the same Essence (haqiqah), exemplified in twelve persons."{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=48}} The hereditary character of nass embodied in itself a kind of exclusive Hikmah for its recipient which was traced back to [[Ali]] of whom the prophet told "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate".{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=78}} Ibn Babaway states that "the title Amir al-Momenin reserved for Imam indicates that he is the storehouse (mirror) of knowledge (mira't al-ilm) from whom people derived knowledge but he did not derive knowledge from anyone else."{{sfn |Afsaruddin |2015}} Only Imam has knowledge of Unseen (Ilm al-Qayb) and fully understands [[Quran]] and worldly matters, a knowledge that he received from Allah through Muhammad. Only Quran and Imam can truly manifest the Divine Truth.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=5}}

===Afdaliyyah (superiority)===
As the Imam is infallible (masum), he is the best of his age, otherwise, Allah would choose another.{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=155}} Ontologically the fourteen infallibles are superior to prophets, since they are created from a nobler matter.{{sfn |Amir Moezzi |1994 |p=71 }} In Quran, with respect to kingship (Imamate) and wisdom (hikmah, book), the heirs of the prophets are their descendants and kin.{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=20}} Al-Baqir states that Imamate is among the progeny of Imams as indicated in verse [http://tanzil.net/#33:6 33:6] which its interpretation refers to the descendants of [[Husayn ibn Ali]].{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=68}} He added that the light that is mentioned in verse [http://tanzil.net/#64:8 64:8] refers to Imams who are the light of Allah, this spiritual light which passes from the prophet to Imams is the symbol of eternal knowledge (hikmah). Referring to the light, he stated," the first beings that Allah created were Mohammad and his family, the rightly guided ones and the guides, they were the phantoms of light before Allah".{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=80}} Personal qualities are known only through Quran or hadith.{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1988 |p=21}} Although Imamate is not hereditary, Shia believe that Imamate are among the progeny of Muhammad.{{sfn |Pakatchi |Ansari |Naji |1988 |p=140}}

==The necessity of recognizing Imams==
According to [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]: " We are the ones to whom Allah has made obedience obligatory. The people will not prosper unless they recognize us and the people will not be excused if they are ignorant of us. He who has recognised us is a believer (Momin) and he who has denied us is an unbeliever (Kafir)"...{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=150}} Al-Riza remarks that "....whoever tends not to be separated from Allah, he love the household of Mohammad ...and follow his Imam, whoever does this is under the mercy of Allah..."{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=353}} Kulaini, Na'mani attributed a tradition to al-Baqir that those who worship Allah without recognizing his righteous Imam are not accepted.{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=353}}

==The necessity of obeying Imams==
If the Imamate of Imams is not affirmed, one can not enter into heaven.{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=159}} Al-Baqir states that according to verse [http://tanzil.net/#42:23 42:23], the believers must both obey and love the Imams.{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=66}} Shia believe that Imamah is inseparable from Wilayah,{{efn |wilayan with kasr of waw means authority but with fatha means love, devotion}} which involves loving [[ahl al-Bayt]] (Imams), obeying them in their commands and prohibitions, recognising their rights and believing in their Imamat and that this is one of the five principles (usul) of Shia.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=96}} According to al-Khu'i: "the wilayat and imamate in the meaning of succession (khilafat) is an essential part (dharuriy) of Shi'ism; anyone who rejects this dimension of the wilayat would not be considered as a Shia".{{sfn |Rizvi |2000}} Muhammad Baqir Majlisi states: "All the Imamis agree that the spiritual validity of deeds and Allah's approval of them are conditioned by faith (Imam); this point is as integral a part of faith as is love for the Twelve Imams and their imamate."{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=169}} Sajjad, the fourth Imam, states that the religion is attained only through submission and whoever submits to  the Imams is guided and blissful. Obeying the Imams is obligatory because Allah has thus commanded.{{sfn |al-Qarashi |2014 |p=86,87}}

===Guidance is only through Imams===
According to Tabatabaei ([http://tanzil.net/#21:73 21:73], [http://tanzil.net/#32:24 32:24]) the word guidance is used side by side by the word Imamah and is followed by "our command", a kind of guidance with a divine command that conveys humankind to the final truth, not just showing the way.{{sfn |Tabatabaei |2008 |p=78,79}} According to Mesbahyazdi, while Allah is the Creator, all praise is due to Him and He is the only ontological (takwini) and legislative (tashri'e) Lord. So everyone who wishes to be a servant and a monotheist should accept His legislative laws and accept the executer of His laws, because this is His Will (Iradah).{{sfn |Mesbahyazdi |2014}} A mutawatir hadith narrates that loving the prophet's family (Ahl al-Bayt) is the sign of faith and enmity towards them is the sign of hypocrisy.{{sfn |Sobhani |2001 |p=114}} According to Mottahari, everyone who does not accept walayah, he is in enmity with walayah which causes his deeds to be worthless ([http://tanzil.net/#6:88 6:88], [http://tanzil.net/#18:105 18:105], [http://tanzil.net/#14:18 14:18],[http://tanzil.net/#3:117 3:117], [http://tanzil.net/#25:23 25:23]), because he is not humble before the Truth which is the basis of a pure deed.{{sfn |Motahhari |2003 |p=43}} Many hadith introduce Imam as the Guide because there is no knowledge of Allah accessible to man without the knowledge of Imam.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=177}} Through hadiths, in order to reach to Allah, man must pass the Path (Sirat) who are the Imams.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=184}}

==Imamate and revelation (Wahy)==
As Muhammad was the last person to receive revelation, the Imams receive divine inspiration (elham) and, as such, are in contact with the holy source of knowledge.{{sfn |Dabashi |1989 |p=116}} A hadith narrates that "Imam hears the voice of the Angel, but does not have his vision, either in sleep or in waking".{{sfn |Donaldson |1984 |p=306}}{{sfn |Kardan |2014 |p=}} Imams get Revelation but not like the prophets. They are called [[Hadith studies|Muhaddath]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t and are spoken to by angels via sounds through their ears and are supported by the Holy Spirit. They receive additional information on the Night of Power [[Laylat al-Qadr]]. They make Spiritual Ascension to the Divine Throne on Friday to add their knowledge.{{sfn |Mavani |2013 |p=52,53}} Regarding this matter, Shaykh al-Muzaffar explains: "We maintain that the powers of the Imams to receive inspiration have reached the highest degree of excellence and we say that it is a Divinely given power. By this means the Imam is able to understand information about anything, anywhere and at anytime and he understands by means of this Divinely-given power at once, without recourse to methodological reasoning or guidance from a teacher. When he desires to know about some matter, it is reflected in his pure mind as if in a polished mirror. It is clear from the histories
of their lives that like the Prophet, the Imams were not trained or taught by anyone at all, not even in reading and writing, from their childhoods to the maturing of their minds. No author or teacher was seen to instruct one of them, but they were incomparable masters of knowledge so that they never asked
about any problem without being able to answer it immediately and they never said that they did not know. They never required time to consider a question before replying."{{sfn |Rizvi |2000}}

==Arguments==

===Shia view of Quran===
Shias claim the verse of Light ([http://tanzil.net/#24:35 24:35]) is attributed to [[The Fourteen Infallible]].{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=48}} According to Shia sources on the nature and basis of Imamate, [[H al-Baqir]] emphasizes that verse [http://tanzil.net/#5:55 5:55] refers to [[Ali]].{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=58}} According to al-Baqir's interpretation of verse [http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/35:32 35:32], Imams are "Then we caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of Our servants".{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=65}} Shias mind verse [http://tanzil.net/#4:59 4:59], which signifies a perfect love and obedience to divine guides.{{sfn |Manavi |2013 |p=11}}

Other Shia sources claim that Imams are expressed in Quran as: "the Supreme Sign" (al-Ayat al-Kobra) ([http://tanzil.net/#79:20 79:20]), "the August Symbol" (al-Mathal al-a'la) ([http://tanzil.net/#16:60 16:60]), "the Most Solid Handle" (al-Urwat al-Wuthqa) ([http://tanzil.net/#2:256 2:256]), ([http://tanzil.net/#31:22 31:22]).{{sfn |Amir Moezzi |1994 |p=45}} According to al-Baqir Imams are the Light of Allah ([http://tanzil.net/#64:8 64:8], [http://tanzil.net/#57:28 57:28]).{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=67,68}} These verses ([http://tanzil.net/#28:68 28:68], [http://tanzil.net/#2:30 2:30], [http://tanzil.net/#38:26 38:26], [http://tanzil.net/#2:124 2:124], [http://tanzil.net/#21:73 21:73]) state that Imamate is a divine appointment and a fallible person can not be an Imam.{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1985 |pp=43–46}} Madelung, regarding the blood ties which is found in Quran, states the superiority of [[Ali]] for his succession.{{sfn |Mavani |2013 |p=33}} Regarding verse [http://tanzil.net/#2:124 2:124], Tabatabaei states that Imamah is a divine status, Imam must be Ma'sum (infallible), the earth can not be without an Imam, Imam have the complete knowledge which is related to this world and the next of the people, Imam excels all people in all virtues.{{sfn |Tabatabaei |1973 |p=83}} However it is argued by many scholars that the 12 Shia Imams have not been mentioned in the Quran and the Shia doctrine of Imamah is based heavily on interpretation based on weak hadiths.

===By Hadith===
{{QuoteHadith |Ali al-Ridha |matn=" ...[[Allah]] did not cause His Prophet to leave this world before completing for him the religion...The issue of Imamat (leadership) is part of the completion of the religion..."Do they realize the value and the status of the Imamat (leadership) of the ’Umma (the nation) to justify their selection? Imamat (leadership) in fact, is far sublime in values, greatest in position, highest in status, the most exclusive issue in all aspects, the most profound and deep for the intellect of the people to reach and grasp it in their opinions, or to appoint an Imam through their selection. Imamat (leadership) is that particular distinction which Allah, has distinguished Ibrahim, the very close friend (al-Khalil), after Prophethood(2;124). This close friendship is the third stage (in the progression of spiritual degrees)... Allah bestowed him more honors in establishing Imamat (leadership) in purified and clean persons of his offspring. "We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a gift and helped both of them to become righteous people (21:72)..."So the Imamat (leadership) remained in his offspring inheriting it from each other, generation after generation until Allah made Prophet Muhammad to inherit...So the Imamat belonged to him particularly, and he then, entrusted Imam Ali, with it by the command of Allah, as He had made it obligatory. It then came to be in his (Ali's) purified and clean of sins offspring, to whom Allah has given knowledge and faith...Imamat (leadership) will remain in the sons of Imam Ali exclusively, till the Day of Judgment and there will no prophet after Muhammad. Wherefrom then have these ignorant people received the right to select Imams?
" Imamat (leadership) is, certainly, the position of the prophets, and the inheritance of the successors. Imamat (leadership) indeed, is the representation (khilafa) of Allah and the deputy of the Messenger, and the office of Amir al-mu'minin and the inheritance of Imam al-Hasan and al-Husayn. "Imamat (leadership) is, in fact, the reins of the religion, the social system of the Muslims. It is best for the world, and honor for the believers. Imamat (Islamic leadership) is Islam's maturing root, and its towering branch. Through the Imam prayers are complete, Zakat, (charity) is paid, fasting, is maintained, Hajj is performed and Jihad, proper defense is exercised, the wealth of the nation (fay') and charity (sadaqat) are increased, the laws are enforced and the frontiers are protected and defended. "The Imam declares as lawful what Allah has done so and prohibits what Allah has prohibited...The Imam is as crystal-clear water to thirst, an indicator of true guidance and the protector against destruction. The Imam is as fire of a lighthouse that provides warmth and guidance for those who seek heat protection against fatalities. Whoever would depart him would perish...The Imam is as a comforting friend, a very kind father, a real brother, a tender-hearted mother of a small child, a refuge for people in disastrous conditions. The Imam is Allah's trustee over His creatures, His authority over His servants, His representative in His lands, the preacher of His cause and the defender of His sanctuary."The Imam is clean of sins, free of faults, possesses special knowledge and is distinguished in forbearance. The Imam maintains law and order in religion... The Imam is the peerless person of his time, no-one can reach even near his rank in virtue and no scholar is comparable to him... in fact, his virtues are all from bestowed up on him by the source of all virtue, the Generous One. Who is he that can know all about the Imam, or can select him?... The Imam is a scholar that is not ignorant of any thing... the mine of holiness purity, of worship and restraint from sins and Knowledge and worship. He (enjoys) the blessings of the exclusive prayers of the Messenger of Allah and of being of the progeny of the Holy Lady, al-Batul. There is no doubt about their genealogical purity...Allah grants success and support to the prophets and the Imams through His treasured knowledge and command in a way that is granted to no one else...When Allah chooses a person for the affairs of His servants, He opens his heart for the task, places in it the fountains of wisdom and inspires him with knowledge... He is infallible, Divinely supported, successful and guarded... Allah has granted him this exclusively so that he would serve as the Divine authority over His servant, as a witness over them and this is the grace of Allah that He grant to whoever He wills and Allah’s grace is the greatest. Can one among the people have such things so they would choose him as the Imam or can their selected person have such distinctions to be preferred over the others?
...May Allah grant blessings up on Prophet Muhammad and his family and may He grant them peace, a great deal of peace."{{efn |1ـ أَبُو مُحَمَّدٍ الْقَاسِمُ بْنُ الْعَلاءِ رَحِمَهُ الله رَفَعَهُ عَنْ

In Ghadir Khum, when Ali was appointed Imamate, verse [http://tanzil.net/#5:3 5:3] was revealed, which expresses that the religion had become perfect because of the appointment of Ali to Imamate.{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1988 |p=27}} and obedience to him had become obligatory upon Muslims.{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1988 |p=38}} Hadith of Two Weighty Things reflects the proximity of the Imams to the Quran.{{sfn |Rizvi |2014 |p=}} Addressing Hussain, the prophet said:" you are Imam, the son of the Imam, the brother of the Imam, nine of your lineal descendants will be pious Imams, the ninth of them being their Qa'im.{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1988 |p=26,27}} The Shia scholar 'Allamah Kashif al-Ghita said about the Imamah: "Imamah is a divine station, just like Nubuwwah. Just as Allah chooses whomsoever He wants to for Nubuwwah and Risalah … similarly, for Imamah, too, He selects whomsoever He wishes."&lt;ref&gt;Asl ash-Shi'a wa Usuluha p.58 by Allamah Muhammad Hussayn Kashif al-Ghita (Mu'ssasat al-A'lami, Beirut)&lt;/ref&gt;

===By reason===
Al-Baqir states that while people need a guide for their journey to a strange place, their journey to heaven is stranger and more in need of a guide.{{sfn |Lalani |2000 |p=75}} Al-Mufid states that an Imam is necessary for defining the exact laws that are obligatory upon the Muslims.{{sfn |McDermott |1978 |p=385}} Many verses in Quran are ambiguous, revelation of Quran without further explanation is unlikely from Allah.{{sfn |Momen |1985 |p=159}} While Imamate brings the people nearer to obedience and away from disobedience, it is Grace (Lutf) that is incumbent of Allah.{{sfn |Akhtar Rizvi |1988 |p=12}} Regarding rejecting the Imamah-doctrine, {{PresentScholar |al-Hilli|14th |Shi'a |Twelver}}, writes: "Imamah is a universal grace (lutf ‘amm) while Nubuwwah (prophethood) is a special grace (lutf khass), it is possible that a specific period in time can be void of a living Nabi while the same is not true for the Imam. To reject universal grace is worse than to reject any special grace.&lt;ref&gt;al-Alfayn pp.3 by [[al-Hilli|Ibn Mutahhar al-Hilli]] (al-Maktabah al-Haydariyyah, Najaf, 3rd ed. 1388)&lt;/ref&gt; The prophet founded an eternal Shari'ah for all the times and this eternal religion could not continue without a leader.{{sfn |Sobhani |2015}}

==History==
{{main |The Twelve Imams}}In the period of Minor Occultation, theologians like Ibn Qube Razi, Newbakhtis, al-Shaykh al-Mufid, Seyyed Morteza and al-Shaykh al-Tusi rebuild the theological school of Imamiyah.{{sfn |Pakatchi |Ansari |Naji |1988 |p=137}} In the second and third century of [[Migration to Abyssinia|Hijra]], a Ma'sum (infallible) and divinely chosen leader of the religion was more focused than the political role of the Imams by the theologians.{{sfn |Pakatchi |Ansari |Naji |1988 |p=138}} Although Imamiyah believed that most of the works on the early Islamic centuries argue that Shi'ism began as a political movement rather than a religious group.{{sfn |Dakake |2007 |p=3}} However this does not mean that religious sentiments were absent in the first century.{{sfn |Dakake |2007 |p=4}}
Dakake believes that the doctrine of Imamate was established in the time of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], while Kohlberg states that the Twelver Shi'ism dates back not much before the beginning of the [[The Occultation#Major Occultation|"Major_Occultation"]].{{sfn |Dakake |2007 |p=2}}

Muhammad is reported to have said that the Islamic leadership is in [[Quraysh (tribe)|Koreish]] (i.e., his tribe) and that [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors|12 “Imams” shall succeed him]]. Sunni and [[Shiite]] [[sect]]s differ as to whom Muhammad was referring. Muhammad stated (authenticated by Sunnis and Shiites), that “Whoever does not know the Imam of his Lifetime (Hadith of the Current Imam: i.e., recognizes same) has died the death of Ignorance”.{{sfn |Nasr |Dabashi |Nasr |1989 |p=96}}{{sfn |Corbin |1993 |p=49}} The idea of a prophet appointing a successor is found in the Old Testament where [[Joshua#Joshua in Islamic history|Joshua son of Nun]] is declared [[Moses]]’ successor or manager of his affairs after his death.
				
*Before conception, the preceding the Imam is sent through a heavenly syrup which he drinks. 
*The Imam is born pure and circumcised. ([http://tanzil.net/#93:5 93:5])
*The Imam's mother experiences light and noises before the birth of the Imam. 
 
Shias believe that just as Moses appointed Aaron as his successor on Bani-Israel, ([[Hadith of position]]), in accordance with God’s order, Muhammad, the final prophet, appointed [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] to be the leader of the believers.

The [[Shi'a]] [[Twelver]] [[religious denomination|denomination]] of [[Islam]] consider it to be the highest level of responsibility given by God to a human.

'''Jacques Fesch''' (April 6, 1930, [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] – October 1, 1957, [[La Santé Prison]], [[Paris]]) was the [[murder]]er of a [[French National Police|French police officer]], who became such a devout [[Roman Catholic]] while in prison awaiting [[capital punishment|execution]] that he has been proposed for beatification.

==Early life==
Fesch's father was a wealthy banker of [[Belgium|Belgian]] origin, an artist and [[atheist]], distant from his son. Jacques was a young aimless dreamer. Brought up a Roman Catholic, he abandoned religion by the age of 17, after his parents divorced. He was expelled from school for laziness and misconduct. At 21, he married his pregnant girlfriend Pierrette in a [[civil marriage|civil ceremony]]. He gave up a position at his father's bank, lived the life of a playboy, left his wife and their daughter, and fathered an [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son with another woman. Disillusioned with his life, he dreamed of escaping to sail around the [[South Pacific Ocean]], but his parents refused to pay for a boat.&lt;ref name=Luxmoore&gt;[https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/ByIssue/Article/TabId/735/ArtMID/13636/ArticleID/9067/Strange-tale-of-Frances-saintly-killer.aspx Luxmoore, Jonathan. "Strange tale of France's saintly killer', ''OSV Newsweekly'', June 15, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
On 24 February 1954, to fund the purchase of a boat, he went to rob Alexandre Sylberstein, a [[bureau de change|money changer]], of [[gold coin]]s. Sylberstein was struck but not unconscious, and raised the alarm. Fesch fled, losing his [[eyeglasses|glasses]], and shot wildly at Jean Vergne, a pursuing police officer, killing him. Minutes later he was arrested. Murdering a police officer was a heinous crime and public opinion, inflamed by newspaper reports, was strongly in favour of his execution.&lt;ref name=Luxmoore/&gt; The [[Cour d'assises]] of Paris condemned him to death on 6 April 1957.

== Religious conversion ==
At first Fesch was indifferent to his plight and mocked his lawyer's Catholic faith. However, after a year in prison, he experienced a profound religious conversion, became very pious, and bitterly regretted his crime. He corresponded regularly with his family, notably his brother and stepmother, and kept a spiritual [[personal journal|journal]].&lt;ref name=Luxmoore/&gt; He accepted his punishment serenely and was reconciled to his wife the night before his execution. His last journal entry was "In five hours, I will see [[Jesus]]!".  An appeal for [[clemency]] to [[President of France|President]] [[René Coty]] failed, and he was [[guillotine]]d.

==Legacy==
After his death his wife and daughter honoured his memory as an example of [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]. At first he was excoriated by the public, but with the work of Soeur Véronique, a [[Carmelite]] nun, and Father Augustin-Michel Lemonnier, the family effected publication of his writings, and from the 1970s these served as an inspiration to many.

On September 21, 1987 the [[Archbishop of Paris]], Cardinal [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]], opened a diocesan inquiry into his life; the cause for his [[beatification]] was formally opened in 1993. This has proved controversial, with those who feel his early crimes make him unfitting as a role model opposed to those who emphasize the hope of his final conversion.

== Theatrical plays about Fesch ==
The extraordinary story of Jacques Fesch remains relatively unknown in France. However, inspired by the true events of this "murderer turned Christian," the students of [[Gymnázium sv. Cyrila a Metoda|Ss Cyril and Method High School]] in [[Nitra]], [[Slovakia]], under the direction of Sr. Maria Marthe Galová, wrote and performed a theatrical play, "[http://spomensinamna.gcm.sk/ Spomeň si na mňa]" (Remember Me), which is based on the life and conversion of Jacques.The play premiered on March 11, 2018, in the [[Andrej Bagar Theatre]], [[Nitra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcm.sk/divadlo/1062-spomen-si-na-mna|title=Spomeň si na mňa - Gymnázium sv.

'''Kuda Caves''' are located in the small village of Kuda, on the eastern side of the north shore of [[Murud-Janjira]]  in south [[Konkan]], [[India]]. These fifteen [[Buddhist]] [[caves]] are small, simple, and were excavated in first century B.C.&lt;ref name=AHIR&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahir|first=D. C.|title=Buddhist sites and shrines in India : history, art, and architecture|year=2003|publisher=Sri Satguru Publ.|location=Delhi|isbn=8170307740|pages=197–198|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verandah of [[Chaitya]] has several reliefs of the [[Buddha]], carved with symbols of lotus, wheel and [[Nāga|Nagas]]. Later in 5th / 6th century the Buddhist branch of the [[Mahayana]] took over the caves and added their sculptures.&lt;ref name=AHIR /&gt; The first cave has ancient writing on its wall. The sixth cave entrance is adorned with elephants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunaji|first=Milind|title=Offbeat tracks in Maharashtra|year=2010|publisher=Popular Prakashan|location=Mumbai|isbn=8179915786|pages=222–223|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thirty inscriptions describe donations by lay Buddhists and Buddhist monks. Other donors include an iron monger, a banker, a gardener, a writer, physician, a flower vendor and a minister.&lt;ref name=AHIR /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8592">'''Kum Nye''' and '''sKu-mNyé''' are a wide variety of Tibetan religious and medical body practices. The two terms are different spellings in the [[Latin alphabet]] of the same Tibetan phrase ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''sku mnye''), which literally means "[[massage]] of the [[subtle body]]".  Some systems of ''sku mnye'' are vaguely similar to [[Yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], [[Qigong]], or therapeutic [[massage]].  "Kum Nye", '''Ku Nye''', and '''Kunye''' are also used to transcribe the Tibetan phrases ''dku mnye'' ("belly massage") and ''bsku mnye'' ("oil massage"), which are pronounced identically to ''sku mnye''.  ''dKu mnye'' and ''bsku mnye'' manipulate the physical body, rather than the subtle (energetic) one.

Systems of Kum Nye are found in many [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] and [[Bön]] traditions.  These can be entirely different both in purpose and in methods. For instance, some forms are very slow moving; others are intensely aerobic. Some systems are based in the Tibetan Medical [[Tantras]] (scriptures), and are mainly therapeutic. Other systems are based in [[Dzogchen]], and are mainly religious in purpose.

Three systems of ''sku mnye'' have been described and taught in detail in English.  These are [[Kum_Nye#Tarthang_Tulku's_Kum_Nye|Tarthang Tulku's Kum Nye]], the [[Kum_Nye#Aro_gT.C3.A9r_sKu-mNy.C3.A9|Aro gTér sKu-mNyé]]  Systems of ''bsku mnye'' are taught by the International Academy for Traditional Tibetan Medicine and the Shang Shung Institute.

== Tarthang Tulku's Kum Nye ==
{{Main|Tarthang Tulku}}

{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}

[[Lama]] [[Tarthang Tulku]] first introduced Kum Nye into the West. He has written five books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tarthang Tulku]] (1978a) ''Kum Nye Relaxation Part 1: Theory, Preparation, Massage'', Dharma Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-913546-10-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tarthang Tulku]] (1978b) ''Kum Nye Relaxation: Part 2: Movement Exercises'', Dharma Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-913546-74-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tarthang Tulku]] (2003) ''Tibetan Relaxation: Kum Nye Massage and Movement'', Thorsons, {{ISBN|978-0-00-766238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tarthang Tulku]] (2005) ''The Joy of Being'', Dharma Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-89800-388-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tarthang Tulku]] (2007) ''Kum Nye: Tibetan Yoga: A Complete Guide to Health and Wellbeing'', Dharma Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-89800-421-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This system appears to be largely from the Medical [[Tantras]], but includes exercises similar to those found in the [[Dzogchen]] series. It is based on very slow movements, stillness practices, and massage. This Kum Nye has been described as Inner Massage.

=== Exercises ===
To give an example, in the exercise called "flying" the practitioner extends their arms slowly out from the side up to stretching above the head and then slowly back down again. One cycle can take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes.  The practice of breathing in and out of both nose and mouth at the same time is recommended while doing the exercises. The key is to pay close attention to the subtleties of sensations and the quality of experience while doing the exercises, thus linking body and mind in the presence of awareness given to the sensations.

== Aro gTér sKu-mNyé ==
This system is part of the [[Aro gTér]], a [[Nyingma]] [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]]. It is described in detail in the book ''moving being'', by Khandro Déchen.&lt;ref&gt;Khandro Déchen (2009) ''moving being: illustrated handbook of sKu-mNyé yogic exercises'', Aro Books worldwide, {{ISBN|978-1-898185-05-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aro sKu-mNyé belongs to [[Longde (Dzogchen)|Longde]], the section of [[Dzogchen]] concerned with the [[subtle body]].  As with all Dzogchen methods, its main goal is to realize [[rigpa]], or [[Non-dual#Buddhism|non-dual awareness]].  This is described as "finding the presence of awareness in the dimension of sensation".&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Physical exercises are used to "shake" the [[Lung_(Tibetan_Buddhism)#Tsa_Lung|tsa-lung system]] of energetic "channels", winds", and "essences".&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This perceptually disorients the practitioner,&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OReilly"&gt;Julia Lee Barclay, Ansuman Biswas, Traci Kelly, Kira O'Reilly and Franc Chamberlain, "[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/pajj.2009.31.1.54#.VKZqtidrlYE Playing with Post-Secular Performance]." ''PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art'', MIT Press, Vol. 31, No. 1 (Jan., 2009), pp. 54-67; discussion of Aro sKu-mNyé is on pp. 59 and 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  and produces "zap nyams". Zap nyams ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''zab nyams''), literally "profound experiences" in Tibetan, are described as "intense psychophysical sensations".&lt;ref name="Déchen 2009, p. 6"&gt;Déchen (2009), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  These are said to occur in the energetic space that surrounds the body, rather than in the physical body.&lt;ref name="Déchen 2009, p. 6"/&gt;

Although the purpose of the Aro gTér sKu-mNyé is mainly religious, the system is said also to have a variety of mundane benefits, including more vivid sensory experience, emotional openness, enhanced meditation, physical fitness, and lessening of depression.&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, Aro sKu-mNyé is a set of 111 movement exercises&lt;ref name="OReilly" /&gt; divided into series that correspond to the [[Mahabhuta#Buddhism|Buddhist five elements]].&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; They range from simple and gentle to vigorous and extremely difficult,&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and bear no similarity to any other Eastern or Western form of exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The moving exercises are alternated with periods of motionless meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; The instructions for the Aro sKu-mNyé exercises frequently give very specific details about eye movements.&lt;ref name="OReilly" /&gt;

Aro sKu-mNyé is taught by instructors certified by a board headed by the Aro Lamas.&lt;ref&gt;Déchen (2009), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise example: "waking lion" ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''lie on your back / legs splayed as far apart as comfortable / arms 90 degrees to your body / palms upwards / eyes closed / simultaneously (with a quick movement) raise your torso and legs (legs straight and locked at the knee) / simultaneously clap feet together and hands together (arms are straight and locked at the elbow) / in the moment of clapping, open eyes wide and shout '''Ra!''' (roll the 'R' to enunciate fiercely) / when clapping feet and hands, eyes, hands, and feet should be at the same height – feet and hands meet at the same level as your eyes; and at this point your bottom is all that is touching the floor / it is important that the back is kept absolutely straight / try to achieve an angle of 45 degrees to the floor, but NOT by bending your back – bending the back will result in injury! / relax back into the starting position and repeat''&lt;ref&gt;http://arobuddhism.org/q-and-a/sku-mnye.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Lamdré'''&lt;ref&gt;Davidson R. lamdré(2005). ''Tibetan Renaissance'', 53&lt;/ref&gt; is a meditative system in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] rooted in the view that the result of its practice is contained within the path. The name "lamdré" means the “path" ({{bo|w=lam}}) with its fruit {{bo|w=‘bras}}).&lt;ref&gt;Powers, J. (1995). ''Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism'', 525&lt;/ref&gt; In Tibet, the lamdré teachings are considered the ''summum bonum'' of the [[Sakya]] school.

== History of lamdré ==

According to traditional accounts, the lamdré teachings were originally bestowed upon [[Virūpa]], an Indian [[Śrāmaṇera |monk]], by the tantric deity [[Nairatmya|Nairātmyā]]. By practicing the instructions given to him, Virūpa is said to have realized enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, C. (2001). ''Luminous Lives'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Hagiographical accounts of Virūpa’s exploits record outrageous events, including binge drinking, seducing women, and destroying non-Buddhist (Skt. ''tīrtika'') religious sites. Davidson suggests that this depiction shows the laxity of Buddhist morals during the Indian medieval period,&lt;ref&gt;Davidson R. (2002). ''Indian Esoteric Buddhism'', 258&lt;/ref&gt; but Wedemeyer suggests that the behavior shown in esoteric Buddhist hagiographies is intentionally scandalous, forming a social commentary on broader issues being discussed in the Indian religious milieu.&lt;ref&gt;Wedemeyer C. (2007). "Beef, Dog, and Other Mythologies", ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', vol. 75, no. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

During his adventures in India, Virūpa converted the Hindu yogin Kāṇha (also called Kṛṣṇa, {{bo|w=nag po pa}})&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, C. (2001). ''Luminous Lives'', 291&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the ''Vajra Verses'' as a guide to Kāṇha’s meditations. The teachings were passed from mentor to student in India until they reached the sage Gayādhara.

==Lamdré in Tibet==
Lamdré entered Tibet through the Indian [[Pandita (Buddhism)|paṇḍita]] Gayādhara (d. 1103) in 1041. Gayādhara worked with a Tibetan [[lotsawa]], [[Drogmi Śākya Yeshe]] ({{bo|w='brog mi śākya ye shes}}, 993-1077?), to translate a plethora of Buddhist tantras from Indian classical and vernacular languages. Drogmi himself spent considerable time in India and Nepal learning both the exoteric and esoteric teachings of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], and was both an accomplished scholar and meditation master when he returned to Tibet. Gayādhara transmitted the entire Lamdré teaching to Drogmi, who in turn passed the teachings on to several other disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson R. (2005). ''Tibetan Renaissance''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The Founders of Sakya==
A student of Drogmi Lotsāwa, Chos bar, instructed [[Sachen Künga Nyingpo]], who is considered the founder of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. Sachen mastered the teachings over a period of eighteen years and wrote several explications of the root text of the Lamdré system. He instructed his two sons, [[Loppön Sönam Tsemo]] and [[Jetsün Dragpa Gyaltsen]], who themselves became accomplished masters of lamdré. The teachings became fully incorporated into the Sakya school and grew to be the main practice of the Sakyapa.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson R. (2005). ''Tibetan Renaissance''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early lamdré lineage===
*Virupa
*Krishnapa and Dombipa
*Damarupa
*Avadhutipa
*Gayadhara (994–1043)
*Drogmi Lotsaba (992–1074)
*Khon Konchog Gyalpo (1034–1102) (tantra), Zhangton Chobar (1053–1156) (pith)
*Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092–1158) 
*Sonam Tsemo (1142–1182) 
*Jetsun Dakpa Gyaltsen (1147–1216) 
*Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyeltsen (1182–1251) 
*Drogon Chogyal Phagpa (1235–1280)

==lamdré as Practice==
The lamdré system is rooted in a very specific view, that the path and its result are contained within each other. All beings have an inherently enlightened nature; however, due to afflictive obscurations, they are prevented from recognizing this nature. The path to Buddhahood, then, aims at removing these obscurations and experiencing the liberated existence of nirvāṇa.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, J. (1995). ''Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism'', 459-460&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jetsün Dragpa Gyaltsen summarized the path into five stages:
1.	initiation 
2.	the creation stage
3.	the completion stage
4.	training 
5.	concluding practice with tantric seals&lt;ref&gt;Powers, J. (1995). ''Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism'', 455&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that [[saṃsāra]] (cyclical existence) and [[nirvana]] (liberation from suffering) are indivisible illuminates the Lamdré teachings. To enter the path, a student must be consecrated (Skt. ''[[abhiṣeka]]'') by an authentic mentor (Skt. [[guru]], Tibetan [[lama]]), who instructs the student on how to recognize his or her own [[buddha-nature]]. Initiation into the system of practice is crucial because it shows the Lamdré practitioner the result of the path, the wisdom of a buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, C. (2001). ''Luminous Lives'', 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

After being consecrated, the student then engages in the practices of the path. The path includes specific meditations and yogic exercises that aim to remove the adventitious obscurations that are the cause suffering. As with most [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] systems, the Lamdré practitioner will engage in two stages of meditation, the [[creation stage]] ({{bo|w=bskyed rim}}), where the meditator attempts to embody the awake nature of a buddha, and the [[completion stage]] ({{bo|w=rdzogs rim}}), which includes yogic meditations on various parts of the tantric anatomy. These practices directly purify obscurations. 

In the lamdré tradition, the instructions for mediation are passed orally from mentor to student. As with all tantric Buddhist lineages, in the lamdré tradition, maintaining the secrecy of the teachings is extremely important. This is a reason why the consecration and initiation of the student into the tradition is strongly emphasized. Although eventually teachers like Sachen Künga Nyingpo wrote down oral instructions, originally, the important texts were memorized by the students. This tradition continues to the present day, where some oral teachings remain unwritten, known only by lamdré lineage holders.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, C. (2001). ''Luminous Lives'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
The root text of the lamdré tradition is Virūpa’s ''Vajra Verses'' ({{bo|w=rdo rje tshig rkang}}). These verses form the basis of practice, explicate the view of the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, and allude to experiences on the path. Because of the cryptic nature of the topics contained in the ''Vajra Verses'', secret instructions (Skt. ''upadeśa'')&lt;ref&gt;Davidson R. (2005). ''Tibetan Renaissance'', 53&lt;/ref&gt; from the mentor are required to make use of them. Within the tradition of Lamdré literature, eleven commentaries on the ''Vajra Verses'' were written by Sachen Künga Nyingpo. Other volumes of importance include the ''Pod ser'' by Jetsün Dragpa Gyaltsen and the ''Pod nag'' by Lama Sönam Gyaltsen.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, C. (2001). ''Luminous Lives'', 32-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Vajra Verses'' are considered the essence of the lamdré teachings, the actual practice of the system comes from the ''Hevajra tantra'' and its supplemental explanatory tantras. 
{{quote|The Lam ‘bras is a system of tantric theory and practice based generally on all the anuttarayoga tantras, specifically on the three scriptures known as the ''Kye rdor rgyud gsum'' (''The Tantra Trilogy of Hevajra''), and especially on the ''Hevajra tantra'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, C. (2001). ''Luminous Lives'', 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Vajra Verses'' elucidate the experiences that one will have while practicing the tantric liturgy (Skt. [[sādhanā]])&lt;ref&gt;Wedemeyer C. (2007). "Beef, Dog, and Other Mythologies", ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', vol. 75, no. 2&lt;/ref&gt; of the deity [[Hevajra]]. However, although, traditionally the Lamdré is intimately connected with the ''Hevajra Tantra'', because of the ambiguous language of the ''Vajra Verses'', other tantric systems could theoretically be used in the creation stage, as Sachen does in his ''Yum don ma'' commentary, where he connects the ''Vajra Verses'' to the [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]] for the creation stage meditations.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, C. (2001). ''Luminous Lives'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within the sub-sects of the Sakya school, there are unique traditions of lamdré instructions. Certain controversies of the types of practices included in some traditions occurred, but eventually most Sakyapas agreed that the Slob bshad teachings were the standard.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, C. (2001). ''Luminous Lives'', 45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern times ==

The lamdré tradition continues to be practiced by the Sakya school today. The current head of the Sakya school, the [[Sakya Trizin]] Ngawang Künga, gave the Lamdré teachings at [[Dzongsar Institute]] in India in 2008. In 2009, he bestowed lamdré in Australia.

This is a '''list of notable converts to Christianity''' who were not theists before their conversion. See [[Nontheism]] for specifics of what encompasses nontheism. All names should be sourced and the source should indicate they had not been a theist, not merely non-churchgoing, before conversion.

'''Michael Casimir "Mike" Stivic''' is a fictional character on the 1970s American television [[sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]''.  He was the live-in son-in-law of the series' lead character, [[Archie Bunker]], who frequently called him '''"Meathead"'''.  Michael was the husband of Archie's daughter [[Gloria Stivic|Gloria]] (played by [[Sally Struthers]]).  [[Rob Reiner]] played the role of Michael Stivic throughout the series.

== Character overview ==

The character of Michael Stivic is an Americanized version of the British original: ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'''s Mike Rawlins, the [[Trotskyist]] "Randy [[Scouse]] Git" who arouses the passionate ire of his [[arch-conservative]] father-in-law [[Alf Garnett]]. For the American version of this character, the Trotskyist angle was drastically softened: Michael Stivic is a [[Liberalism|social liberal]] and a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]], but not an adherent of any form of communism and is presented as possibly a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who is sympathetic to the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] movement (SDS), which is hinted by his occasional use of SDS ally and [[Yippie]] leader [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s [[guerrilla theatre]] antics.

Michael Stivic is a [[Polish-American]] from [[Chicago]]. He was orphaned at a young age, with his parents having been killed in a car crash. He was raised by his uncle Casimir Stivic, an ex-Marine lieutenant turned florist, who calls him "Mickey" with great affection.  He also had an uncle Alex.

When ''All in the Family'' begins, Michael is married to Gloria and shares a bedroom with her in the home of her parents, whom he addresses as "Ma" and "Archie" (or "Arch"), while focusing his efforts on earning a college degree in [[sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ptop/plain/A1076780&lt;/ref&gt;  His first meeting with Archie (seen in a [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]]) shows him as a bearded [[hippie]] with a [[tie-dye]]d shirt. His wardrobe throughout most of the series is much more subdued: most often he wears a denim shirt, jeans, and boots. He shaves his beard for his wedding with Gloria, but keeps his mustache afterwards (on rare occasions later in the series, however, he would go for a clean-shaven look) and wears his hair well below the collar. (As Reiner's hairline was receding very rapidly early on in the series, he began wearing a toupee when playing the character.) In season 2, episode 5, "Flashback: Mike Meets Archie" (mentioned above), which first aired October 16, 1971, Mike and Gloria celebrate their first wedding anniversary. A 1972 episode centers on Mike and Gloria's second wedding anniversary, while in the 1978 episode ''The Stivics Go West'' it is revealed that Mike and Gloria are coming upon the ninth anniversary.

Exacerbating the conflicts between college student Michael and his [[conservative]] father-in-law [[Archie Bunker]], is the fact that in the early years of the television series, these two characters live under the same roof. This proximity means that the tensions between these seemingly diametrically opposed people result in endless arguments over the simplest of topics, even the proper order in which to put on socks and shoes.  Along with other issues, such as Michael's frequent decision to sit in Archie's coveted chair and huge appetite for food purchased by Archie's working-class income, their huge ideological differences greatly contributed to the conflict between the two characters.&lt;ref name=uoooooav /&gt;  Michael is a determined [[agnostic]]-though he would at times identify himself as an atheist in order to rile up Archie, who assumed he was in complete disbelief of God-,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJIUrjBs4tA&amp;t=1m42s|title=Real Time With Bill Maher: Overtime - Episode #233|first=|last=Real Time with Bill Maher|date=January 18, 2012|publisher=|access-date=October 5, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to his mother-in-law's quiet Christian church attendance and his non-practicing but nonetheless staunchly Christian father-in-law.  He also is a dedicated humanitarian who wishes to help change the world:&lt;ref name=uoooooav /&gt; originally, Michael wanted to become a social worker, but his career aspirations shifted towards teaching as the series progressed.&lt;ref name=uoooooav /&gt;  When the neighboring Jefferson family moves out of the neighborhood, the family patriarch George allows Michael to rent his old house so Michael and Gloria can have a home of their own. George, however, is still the house's legal owner. Although being next door still results in frequent visits, the tension between Michael and Archie eases as they now live under different roofs.

Despite his frequent conflicts with his father-in-law, Mike enjoys a warm relationship with his mother-in-law, Edith, whom he calls "Ma". Edith frequently intervenes to try to defuse tensions between her husband and son-in-law, though she also occasionally takes Mike to task for initiating unnecessary arguments with Archie, and, in 1973 episode "Games Bunkers Play", offers insight to Mike into Archie's attitude toward him, suggesting that Archie had to drop out of high school to help support his family during the Depression, and that he resents the fact that Mike had the chance to attend college and advance his education.

Michael is presented as a representative of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] (reflecting current events during the period in which the show was broadcast).  There is no suggestion, however of the drug use or "[[free love]]" of that subculture and Michael is a dedicated [[academic]]. It is revealed in the season eight episode ''Gloria and Mike Meet'' that in 1969, Michael's dedication to humanitarianism was galvanized in order to weaken support for newly elected President Richard Nixon and that he was probably a member of the SDS's newly formed [[Worker Student Alliance]] that sought to encourage university students to find ways to fix problems within the working class.

Though supportive of human rights, Michael would at times display [[male chauvinism]] as well; examples showed when he did not want his appendix removed by a female doctor and was a sore loser when playing a board game called ''Group Therapy'' with his family and neighbors.  Though he differed with Archie over the potential successes women and racial minorities could achieve, Michael also believed that neither could [[social evolution|socially evolve]] without good education from people like him; such an example showed when he falsely characterized a [[blue collar|blue-collar]] handyman's African American assistant as a [[Stereotypes of African Americans|minstrel show stereotype]] who donned the same "happy-go-lucky" attire as his boss in the season 3 episode ''Everybody Tells the Truth'' (Archie's version is just as stereotyped—the assistant is a member of the [[Black Power]] movement and his boss is a [[mafia]] thug).  He was also determined to ensure that Gloria shared his beliefs.&lt;ref name=uoooooav&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=gloria+bunker+stivic+high+school&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R2FEnlZLby&amp;sig=eFwNAdgwaL9-RLVN9gh8u5MJtgQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QZoCU9fdG4TWyQHIi4CQBQ&amp;ved=0CHsQ6AEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=gloria%20bunker%20stivic%20high%20school&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010, 2d ed|author=Vincent Terrace|page=240|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|date=2011|ISBN=9780786464777|access-date=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although taken by surprise, Michael is excited to learn that Gloria is pregnant in 1971, though the pregnancy ends in a [[miscarriage]]. Gloria becomes pregnant again in 1975 and their baby Joseph "Joey" Stivic is born in December of that year.

During early episodes, Michael's best friend is [[Lionel Jefferson]]. In the first season, Lionel surprises Michael by announcing that he and his family are moving into the house next door to the Bunkers.  However, the characters rarely see or refer to each other after the Jeffersons leave ''All in the Family'' to join the spin-off ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', George Jefferson, however, would later make a guest appearance at his old residence when the Stivics start preparing for their move to California and meet with him to give notice that they will no longer be staying in his house.  Another of Michael's close friends, Al Bender (played by [[Billy Crystal]]), marries Gloria's best friend Trudy Tannen in a 1976 episode.

Mike accepts a faculty position at [[UCSB]] and he and Gloria move to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]], at the end of the 1977–78 season (at which time Reiner and Struthers ceased to be regulars on the show). They appear in a Christmas episode during the 1978–79 season, in which Archie and Edith (and Edith's niece [[Stephanie Mills (All in the Family)|Stephanie]]) visit Michael and Gloria, exposing the fact that the couple have secretly [[marital separation|separated]] due to troubles in their marriage, including an infidelity Gloria had with one of his college faculty colleagues.  Though they seemingly resolve their differences during this episode, a Thanksgiving visit by Mike and Gloria to the Bunkers' house during the 1979-80 season of ''Archie Bunker's Place'' shows that the Stivics' marriage is still troubled, exacerbated by Michael having lost his job after he and Gloria participated in a nude protest of a proposed nuclear power plant and got arrested.  This is the last appearance of the character.

Michael Stivic does not appear in the 1982 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Gloria (TV series)|Gloria]]'', which starred Sally Struthers.  Initially, Reiner had been asked to participate in the series, resurrecting his Michael Stivic character, but he declined. It is explained (on the show) that Michael had left his wife and young son [[Joey Stivic|Joey]] (then played by [[Christian Jacobs]]) to live in a California [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] with one of his students (which suggests he had found a new teaching job) -- whom Gloria described as "the [[homecoming queen]], a girl named Muffy"—and was in the process of going through a bitter divorce.  At the beginning of the series (September 1982), it has been 63 days since Michael walked out on Gloria; Michael calls to invite Gloria to the commune, but things deteriorate quickly when he claims Gloria is incapable holding a job, or of supporting herself and Joey. By the end of the series (spring 1983), the divorce is final.

==="Meathead"===
Archie routinely refers to Michael by the derogatory nickname "Meathead", from the first time they meet, as seen in [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]] in the second season episode "Mike Meets Archie".  In Archie's own words, it means "dead from the neck up".  Rob Reiner has said that "I could win the Nobel Prize and they'd write 'Meathead wins the Nobel Prize'."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Ivor. [http://www.yehey.com/entertainment/celebs/article.aspx?id=106489 "5 minutes with Rob Reiner"], ''[[Manila Times]]'', 2003. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311133819/http://www.yehey.com/entertainment/celebs/article.aspx?id=106489 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later episode of ''All in the Family'' reveals that Archie Bunker himself was referred to as "Meathead" in his youth.

Norman Lear said his father used to call him "Meathead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://wtop.com/entertainment/2015/11/king-lear-tv-legend-shares-his-sitcom-secrets-in-new-memoir/|title=King Lear: TV legend shares his sitcom secrets in new memoir|last=Fraley|first=jason|work=[[WTOP-FM]]|date=November 9, 2015|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Netzer logo.png|thumb|right|The Netzer ''semel'' (emblem)]]
'''Netzer Olami''' is the worldwide youth movement of the World Union for Progressive Judaism (WUPJ) and is affiliated to [[Arzenu]] (the Zionist arm of the WUPJ). "Netzer" is an acronym in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for '''Reform Zionist Youth''' (''Noar Tsioni Reformi'', נוער ציוני רפורמי), and Netzer Olami means 'Global Netzer'. (The word 'Progressive' is used as an umbrella term to include Reform, Liberal, Reconstructionist and other 'non-orthodox' Jewish movements - hence the 'World Union for Progressive Judaism', so a better rendition is really Progressive Zionist Youth, but of course the acronym wouldn't work).  Today there are 16,000 members active in our different sniffim (chapters) that are located in the following places: Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Germany, Israel (Noar Telem), North America ([[NFTY]]), Panama, Russia, South Africa, Spain, France, United Kingdom (LJY-Netzer, RSY-Netzer) and Ukraine. The Netzer Olami head office is in Beit Shmuel, Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netzerolami.org/Eng/Index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Netzer Symbol==

The Netzer symbol was designed in Melbourne, Australia, by Daniel (Danny) L. Schiff.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Ideology==
Every year, the ''Netzer Veida'' (the decision-making and ideology forum) attracts participants from most of, if not all, the sniffim. Each ''snif'' (branch) has an equal voice and vote. The official ideology of Netzer Olami is set out in the '''Netzer Platform''', which was last changed in 2003.

The following is a simplified version of the Netzer Platform 2003:

# '''Judaism as a People, a Nation and a Religion'''
#*Israel, with Jerusalem as its capital, is necessary as a spiritual, cultural and physical home for the Jews.
#*As religious Zionists we affirm that [[Judaism]] is a people, a nation and a religion and that these three elements are indivisible.
#'''The covenant as a moral obligation'''
#*Israel is given to us by God as a home for the Jewish people as part of the covenant struck with [[Abraham]].
#*This means that Medinat Yisrael, the [[State of Israel]], is obliged to make itself a more moral state than every other in the world.
#*This is to be achieved by upholding the Jewish people’s highest moral obligations to be:
#*#Memlechet Kohanim, 'a kingdom of priests'
#*#Goy Kadosh, 'a holy people'
#*#L'or Goyim, 'a light unto other nations'
#'''Sovereignty'''
#*The Jews have been historically persecuted and Israel provides a refuge from such pogroms.
#*Therefore, we affirm Israel’s national sovereignty- allowing Jews to once again live within a Jewish majority.
#*However, we must strive to ensure that such sovereignty be used to create the kind of society in which full civil, human and religious rights exist for all its citizens- a society both Jewish and Democratic.
#*Reclaiming sovereignty gives us the opportunity to strive to demonstrate that the traditions and values of Judaism, in which we believe, have relevance for dealing with the issues of a modern world of nation states.
#'''Israel and Diaspora'''
#*Although Israel is the centre of Judaism (see 1.) Israel and Diaspora Jewry cannot exist without one another, are responsible for one another, and partners in the shaping of Jewish destiny.
#*Each Jewish kehilla (community) is individual and self-regulating yet also shares responsibility for Jews everywhere.
#'''[[Aliyah|Aliya]] Nimshechet'''
#*Literally "continuing immigration" - making Aliya (moving) to Israel and then continuing to live out the Netzer values there.
#'''[[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism|Progressive Judaism in Israel]]'''
#*We believe that Progressive Judaism can make a positive contribution to Am Yisrael thanks to its combination of modern and traditional ways of life.
#*Therefore, we should strive to educate and inform Israelis about Progressive Judaism and support progressive communities in Israel.
#'''A pluralistic approach to Judaism in Israel'''
#*Israel exists to benefit the spiritual integrity of the Jewish people.
#*Am Yisrael contains many interpretations of Judaism, which sometimes conflict.
#*Therefore, the Jewish people will be best served when Israel is a pluralistic, democratic society.
#*This would mean that no one interpretation of Judaism would have legal superiority over another.
#'''Tikkun Olam'''
#*We are committed to Tikkun Olam, repairing the world, and that this will help bring about the Messianic Era.
#*We can bring this about on 5 different levels, all of which interlink but also can be achieved separately and in no particular order.
#*#''Tikkun Atzmi'' - healing the self
#*#''Tikkun Kehila'' - repairing our communities
#*#''Tikkun Am'' - healing the Jewish people
#*#''Tikkun Medinat'' - repairing the Jewish state
#*#''Tikkun Olam'' - repairing the world
#'''Our Values''':
#*As a reform Zionist youth movement we believe in the following fundamental values.
#*#Prayer through Ma’amad (creative services relevant to the time and place)
#*#Celebration of the Chagim (festivals) including Shabbat
#*#Jewish, especially Torah, study as an ongoing lifelong commitment.
#*#Informed decision making, individually and communally
#*#A belief in the oneness of God
#*#The Unity of the Jewish People
#*#The centrality of the land and State of Israel to Jewish life
#*#Tzedaka (charity)
#*#A commitment to the prophetic tradition and its understanding and vision of Judaism
#*#Social Justice and a commitment to Peace
#*#Equality, particularly gender equality, in Judaism
#*#Mutual care and cooperation
#*#Care for the environment
#*#The dignity of all human beings, tolerance for their differences and a respect for “the other” within our society and community.
#*The exact meanings of these values to the daily lives of Netzer chevarim (members) is open to their own interpretation.
#'''Reform Zionist Community'''
#*We recognise the value of communal living and urge chevarim to consider the option.
#*We will support Reform Zionist communities built upon our values (see 9.)  who are committed to becoming ones of intimacy, purpose, of participation and of communal religious authority.
#'''[[Hebrew language|Ivrit]] (Hebrew)'''
#*Ivrit is the language of the Scriptures and so is vital for the study of Judaism
#*Ivrit also unifies the Jewish people with a common language and strengthens ties between the Diaspora and Israel.
#*We are therefore committed to learning Ivrit and teaching it to others.
#'''Spending Time in Israel'''
#*The completion of the ideals expressed in 1-11 can be made easier if all chevarim were to spend an extended period of time in Israel.
#*We should, therefore, try to ensure that as many chevarim as possible come to Israel as part of a Netzer program, such as Israel Tour
#*We also encourage chevarim to spend a serious length of time in Israel after leaving the movement.
#'''Hagshama (Self-realisation) and Activism'''
#*We are committed to being an activist, as well as educational, movement.
#*One way to achieve this is through hagshama- that is, the living out of the Netzer ideology in our everyday lives.
#*We also believe that it is both our right and responsibility to take a stand on key issues and work actively to bring about our vision of the world.
#'''Geula (redemption)'''
#*By implementing the ideology expressed in points 1-13 we believe that we can hasten the coming of Messianic Age and the redemption of the Jewish People.
#*The path to this dream has been a difficult one and although significant progress has already been made, great challenges still lie ahead.
#*"Lo alecha hamlacha ligmor, v'lo atah ben chorin lehibatel mimena" - It is not your duty to complete the work; yet neither are you free to desist from it.

[[File:Our Lady of Willesden - black madonna.jpg|thumb|The black madonna image of Our Lady of Willesden in the restored shrine at St Mary's parish church.]]
'''Our Lady of Willesden''' is a title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated by Christians in London, especially by [[Anglican]]s and [[Roman Catholic]]s. It is associated with the historic image (statue) and pilgrimage centre in the community of [[Willesden]], originally a village in [[Middlesex]], [[England]], but now a suburb of [[London]]. The pre-Reformation shrine was home to the [[Black Madonna]] of Willesden statue.

==History==
Willesden has always possessed a [[water well]], from which the community derives its name, which means "spring at the foot of the hill".&lt;ref name=rcpar&gt;{{cite web |url = https://parish.rcdow.org.uk/willesden/patron/ |title = Our Lady of Willesden |last= |first= |author= |publisher = Parish of Our Lady of Willesden |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 20 July 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The well was associated with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], and with the church dedicated to her, St Mary's, Willesden. The church and well are of great antiquity, being mentioned in a royal charter of 939.&lt;ref name=rcpar/&gt; Whilst the origins of the pilgrimage tradition are lost in history, it is clear that a significant volume of pilgrims visited the site, and medieval pilgrim medals were struck and sold, a number of which have been uncovered by archeological investigation.&lt;ref name=anpar&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.shrineofmary.org/shrine |title = The Shrine |last= |first= |author= |publisher = Parish of St Mary, Willesden |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 20 July 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas More]] was a pilgrim here only a fortnight before his arrest.&lt;ref name=anpar/&gt;

A [[Canonical visitation|Visitation]] report dated 1249 reports two statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary at St Mary's Church.&lt;ref name=rcpar/&gt; It is uncertain what the second image was, but the primary one was the "Black Madonna" image of Our Lady of Willesden, the central point of veneration for the pilgrims who journeyed to Willesden. The statue was said to possess miraculous powers.&lt;ref name=natarch&gt;{{cite web |url = http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/968207d0-3252-44c6-8f10-706473119c18 |title = Catalogue description: Saint Mary, Willesden: Neasden Lane, Brent. |last= |first= |author= |publisher = The National Archives (United Kingdom Government) |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 20 July 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Reformation]] the English shrines of Mary were destroyed, and their images burned. The "Black Madonna" image of Our Lady of Willesden was dragged to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1538, and burned there by the King's Commissioners.&lt;ref name=anpar/&gt;&lt;ref name=natarch/&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Our Lady of Willesden - St Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|St Mary's parish church, home of the Shrine.]]
At the start of the twentieth century the Reverend James Dixon, Vicar of Willesden, restored the shrine,&lt;ref name=anpar/&gt; and placed a gilded image of Mary and Jesus at the location within the parish church where the original had once stood. A small number of pilgrims began visiting the shrine.

The Right Reverend [[Graham Leonard]], [[Bishop of Willesden]] 1964-1973, actively promoted pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Willesden, and in 1972 a new "Black Madonna" statue was commissioned from the sculptor [[Catharni Stern]].&lt;ref name=anpar/&gt; On completion it was set in the former chapel of St Catherine within St Mary's parish church, Willesden, and the chapel was redesignated the Shrine Chapel. A visit to this chapel is now the climax of the Willesden pilgrimage.

The older image was left in place, so that since 1972 the shrine has housed two images of the Blessed Virgin Mary, just as it did in medieval times according to the 1249 visitation report.

The original spring and holy well at St Mary's Church, which had become lost through disuse after the Reformation, were rediscovered in 1998, and returned to use.&lt;ref name=twin/&gt;

==The shrines today==
[[File:Our Lady of Willesden - chapter priest.jpg|thumb|A chapter priest of the Shrine, wearing the distinctive mozzetta of that rank.]]
In a similar manner to [[Our Lady of Walsingham]], who is venerated at twin Anglican and Roman Catholic shrines a mile apart, Our Lady of Willesden today has two shrines. The original has been restored in the Anglican parish church of St Mary, and a Roman Catholic shrine has been established about two miles away in the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Willesden, where a crowned image of Our Lady forms the focus of the shrine. At both Walsingham and Willesden the twin shrines provide a vehicle for practical ecumenical endeavour between the two traditions.&lt;ref name=twin&gt;{{cite web |url = http://interfaithmary.net/blog/willesden |title = London |last= |first= |author= |publisher = Interfaith Mary |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 20 July 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original shrine at St Mary's Church is administered by the [[Parochial Church Council]], working in close cooperation with the [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] of Our Lady of Willesden (see below).

==Companionate==
The Companionate of Our Lady of Willesden is an Anglican devotional society for those who wish to be associated with the shrine. It is headed by an Episcopal Patron, a bishop who provides the figurative leadership of the Companions.

The day to day direction of the Companionate is in the hands of a [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] of capitular priests (usually numbering six, of whom the vicar of St Mary's, Willesden, is a member ''ex officio''), and laity (of whom the [[churchwarden]]s of St Mary's are also ''ex officio'' members). Chapter priests of Our Lady of Willesden are distinguished by a black [[mozzetta]] with pale blue buttons, [[Piping (sewing)|piping]] of blue and gold, and the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of Our Lady of Willesden embroidered on the left breast.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.shrineofmary.org/companions |title = Companions of the Shrine |last= |first= |author= |publisher = Parish of St Mary, Willesden |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 20 July 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lay members of Chapter are distinguished by a pale blue collarette from which the shrine badge is displayed.

Other members, not on the Chapter, are known as a priest-companion or lay-companion, as the case may be. Companions wear the seal of Our Lady of Willesden as a badge, and undertake to pray for the work of the Shrine, and to visit it on pilgrimage when able.

The nearby Roman Catholic shrine has a similarly constituted Guild of Our Lady of Willesden.

==Annual pilgrimage==
[[File:Our Lady of Willesden - pilgrimage mass.jpg|thumb|The 2018 pilgrimage mass. The Episcopal Patron celebrates with chapter-priests of the shrine.]]
Private pilgrimages and parish pilgrimages journey to the shrine of Our Lady of Willesden throughout the year, but the main national pilgrimage takes place on a Saturday in July. The format of the day usually involves a public procession in the morning, a celebration of mass at midday in St Mary's parish church, a variety of stalls and entertainments during the afternoon, sprinkling at the holy well in the late afternoon, and benediction of the blessed sacrament to end the pilgrimage day.

The '''Convention of Chinese-Filipino [[Southern Baptist]] Churches''' was formally established on January 21, 1957, though they were technically in existence since 1950. It began in November 30, 1948, as Philippine Chinese Baptist Convention, when Southern Baptist missionaries in [[Shanghai, China]] were forced to relocate to the [[Philippines]] due to the civil unrest caused by the [[Chinese Revolution (1946−1952)]].  The missionaries settled in [[Baguio City]] where they started their work in converting the local Chinese there before eventually establishing churches in [[Dagupan City]], [[Manila]] and [[Davao City]] in 1952.  The PCBC also established the [[Philippine Baptist Theological Seminary]] in Baguio City on July 15, 1952. Later, it was renamed to Convention of Chinese-Filipino Southern Baptist Churches (CCF-SBC).

==Member Churches==
As of April 2013, the CCF-SBC has the following member churches:
#Baguio Chinese Baptist Church
#Manila Chinese Baptist Church
#Davao Chinese Baptist Church
#La Union Chinese Baptist Church
#Dagupan Chinese Baptist Church
#La Trinidad Benguet International Baptist Church
#Caloocan Christian Baptist Church
#Tarlac Living Faith Christian Baptist Church

==Summer Camps==
The CCF-SBC has annual camps held during the Holy Week from Monday-Saturday for the Youth and the Children's Camp. The Adult Camp holds its camp on Thursday to Saturday of the Holy Week. The Youth and Children's Camp are usually held at the [[Philippine Baptist Theological Seminary]] in Baguio City.

'''Qamar al-Din'''&lt;ref group=fn&gt; Also transliterated Qamar al-Deen, Qamar ad-Din/ad-Deen, Qamar Eddine, Qamaruddin, Kamaruddin, Amardine, and a myriad of other ways. [[Transliteration of Arabic]] is notoriously fraught with challenges, even before differences between Arabic's many [[Dialects of Arabic|dialects]] are taken into account.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|قمر الدين|lit=Moon of the Religion}}) is an [[apricot]] [[juice]] or nectar beverage from [[Arab cuisine|Arab cuisine]] that is typically consumed during the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]].

==Etymology==
Several theories have been proposed for the origin of qamar al-din's name. One theory holds that it was named for its inventor, a Syrian man named Qamar al-Din. He was said to have been so handsome that he resembled the moon (''qamar'', {{lang-ar|قمر}}), hence his name.&lt;ref name=Xawaash /&gt;

Another theory holds that apricot season coincided with the sighting of the new moon marking the beginning of Ramadan in the year when qamar al-din was invented.&lt;ref name=Xawaash /&gt; A similar theory, widespread in [[Egypt]], traces the name's origin to a [[Caliph]] who was known to celebrate with qamar al-din upon seeing the crescent moon during Ramadan.&lt;ref name=Amy /&gt;

==Method of preparation==
To produce Qamar al-din, apricots and [[sugar]] are boiled over a fire and then strained through a wooden strainer that is soaked in [[olive oil]]. The apricots are then left to dry in direct sunlight. Once it has completely dried, it is then packaged, shipped, and sold. This [[dried apricot]] leather is thicker, more consistent, and has a stronger flavor than ordinary apricot [[Fruit leather|leather]], and is thus more suitable for making qamar al-din.&lt;ref name=Joel /&gt; Making the drink from this apricot leather only requires adding [[rosewater]] or [[orange blossom water]], though apricot pieces (fresh or dried) and ice are often added as well. Sometimes, some of the floral water is replaced with [[orange juice]] or plain water.&lt;ref name=Xawaash /&gt; Qamar al-din is traditionally served thick and cold, and it is believed to be especially fortifying and a good source of energy, [[electrolytes]], and hydration, all of which are crucial after a day of fasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Amira|title=QAMAR AL-DEEN (APRICOT JUICE); FAMOUS MIDDLE EASTERN DRINK|url=https://amiraspantry.com/qamar-al-deen-apricot-drink/|website=Amira's Pantry|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joel /&gt; Some in the [[Levant]] add [[pine nuts]] and ice to their qamar al-din, making a beverage that resembles a thicker, apricot-flavored version of [[jallab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=نانا|title=3 طرق مختلفة لعمل مشروب قمرالدين|url=http://arab-cooking.toiledz.com/ar/easy-recipes/10505-3-different-ways-to-do-drink-qamaruddin.html|website=Arabic Cooking (الطبخ العربي)|date=October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saraswats''' are a sub-group of [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]]s of India who trace their ancestry to the banks of the [[Sarasvati River]].

In [[Kalhana]]'s ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' (12th century CE), the Saraswats are mentioned as one of the five [[Pancha Gauda]] Brahmin communities residing to the north of the [[Vindhyas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXyWE6KbG8oC&amp;pg=PA168 |title=Caste in Life: Experiencing Inequalities |editor=D.

One group lived in coastal [[Sindh]] and Gujarat, this group migrated to [[Bombay State]] after the [[partition of India]] in 1947. One group was found in [[Punjab, British India|pre-partition Punjab]] and Kashmir most of these migrated away from Pakistan after 1947. Another branch, known as [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin]], are now found along the [[Konkan coast|western coast of India]].&lt;ref name="JGL_2002"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6FsB3psOTIC&amp;pg=PA490 |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z |author=James G.

They are also known as Sindhwa and Chenva.&lt;ref name=GujaratXXI&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1283-1286&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

According to some of their traditions, the community was born out of the union of [[Rajput]] men and tribal women. There are also other traditions which refer to the Shenva being descended from [[Rajput]]s who fled into the forests fleeing [[Muslim]] invaders. They are found throughout [[Gujarat]], with their main concentrations are in the districts of [[Mehsana]], [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmedabad]], [[Sabarkantha]], [[Kaira district|Kaira]], [[Rajkot]], and [[Jamnagar]]. The community have [[scheduled caste]] status. They speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] with no particular dialect.&lt;ref name=GujaratXXI/&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Shenva community consists of several clans, each of whom is exogamous. Their main clans are the Vatukia, Gangadia, Morakia, Zalia, Vaghela, Solanki, Makwana, Parmar, Chauhan and Rathore.  The Shenva are traditionally agricultural labourers. Some of them are engaged in the manufacturing of brooms and mats. Like other [[scheduled caste]] communities, they suffer from social and economic disabilities.&lt;ref name=GujaratXXI/&gt;

In Shinto, {{nihongo|'''''shintai'''''|[[wiktionary:神体|神体]]|''body of the [[kami]]''}}, or {{nihongo|'''go-shintai'''|[[wiktionary:御神体|御神体]]|''sacred body of the kami''}} when the honorific [[prefix]] ''go-'' is used, are physical objects worshipped at or near [[Shinto shrine]]s as repositories in which spirits or ''[[kami]]'' reside.&lt;ref name="sos"&gt;''Shintai'', Encyclopedia of Shinto&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shintai'' used in [[Shinto sects and schools|Shrine Shinto]] (Jinja Shinto) can be also called {{nihongo|''[[mitama]]shiro''|[[wiktionary:御霊代|御霊代]]|''spirit replacement'' or ''substitute''}}.&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt;

In spite of what their name may suggest, ''shintai'' are not themselves part of ''kami'', but rather just temporary repositories which make them accessible to human beings for worship.&lt;ref&gt;Smyers, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shintai'' are also of necessity ''[[yorishiro]]'', that is objects by their very nature capable of attracting ''kami''.

==Description==
The most common ''shintai'' are man-made objects like mirrors, swords, jewels (for example comma-shaped stones called ''[[magatama]])'', ''[[gohei]]'' (wands used during religious rites), and sculptures of ''kami'' called {{nihongo|''shinzō''|神像}},&lt;ref&gt;''Kami'' are as a rule not represented in [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] or physical terms, however numerous paintings and statues representing them have appeared under Buddhist influence.&lt;/ref&gt; but they can be also natural objects such as stones, mountains, trees and waterfalls.&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; Before the forcible separation of ''kami'' and Buddhas of 1868 (''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'') a ''shintai'' could even be the statue of a Buddhist deity.

Famous ''shintai'' include the mirror (part of the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]]), [[Mount Miwa]], [[Mount Nantai]], the [[Nachi Falls]], and the [[Meoto Iwa]] rocks. Many mountains like [[Mount Miwa]] or the Three Mountains of Kumano (Kumano sanzan) are considered ''shintai'' and are therefore called {{nihongo|''shintaizan''|神体山|extra=''shintai'' mountain}}.&lt;ref name="ono"&gt;Ono, Woodard (2004:100)&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely known and renowned ''shintai'' is [[Mount Fuji]].&lt;ref&gt;For details on Mount Fuji worship, see [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=786 Fuji Shinkō], Encyclopedia of Shinto.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Makuuchi#Yokozuna|yokozuna]]'', a wrestler at the top of [[sumo]]'s power pyramid, is a living ''shintai''. For this reason, his waist is circled by a ''[[shimenawa]]'', a sacred rope which protects sacred objects from evil spirits. A [[kannushi]], that is, a Shinto priest, can become a living ''shintai'' when a [[kami]] enters his body during religious ceremonies.

The founding of a new shrine requires the presence of either a pre-existing, naturally occurring ''shintai'' (for example a rock or waterfall housing a local ''kami''), or of an artificial one, which must therefore be procured or made to the purpose. An example of the first case are the [[Nachi Falls]], worshiped at Hiryū Shrine near [[Kumano Nachi Taisha]] and believed to be inhabited by a ''kami'' called Hiryū [[Gongen]].&lt;ref name="nachi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kkr.mlit.go.jp/wakayama/rekishi/disco131.html|title=Hiryū Gongen|last=Kamizaka|first=Jirō|publisher=Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport - Kinki Regional Development Bureau|language=Japanese|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second, the ''[[mitama]]'' (spirit) of a ''kami'' is divided in half through a process called ''[[kanjō]]'' and one of the halves is then stored in a ''yorishiro''. This is the process which has led to the creation of networks of shrines housing the same ''kami'', as for example the [[Hachiman shrine]], [[Inari shrine]] or [[Kumano shrine]] networks.
 
Because over the years the ''shintai'' is wrapped in more and more layers of precious cloth and stored in more and more boxes without being ever inspected, its exact identity may become forgotten.&lt;ref name=bocking&gt;{{cite book|last=Bocking|first=Brian|title=A Popular Dictionary of Shinto|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The first role of a shrine is to house and protect its ''shintai'' and the ''kami'' which inhabits it.&lt;ref name="scheid1"/&gt; If a shrine has more than one building, the one containing the ''shintai'' is called ''[[honden]]''; because it is meant for the exclusive use of the ''kami'', it is always closed to the public and is not used for prayer or religious ceremonies. The ''shintai'' leaves the ''honden'' only during [[Japanese festivals|festivals]] (''matsuri''), when it is put in a "divine palanquin" (''[[mikoshi]]'', a term usually translated in English as "portable shrine"&lt;ref&gt;Progressive English-Japanese/Japanese English Dictionary, 2008, Shogakukan&lt;/ref&gt;), and carried around the streets among the faithful.&lt;ref name="scheid1"/&gt; The portable shrine is used to physically protect the ''shintai'' and to hide it from sight.&lt;ref name="scheid1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/bauten/schrein.htm|title=Schreine|last=[[Bernhard Scheid|Scheid, Bernhard]]|first=|publisher=University of Vienna|language=German|accessdate=27 March 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

IV, S-Z |page=Sri Chand, Baba}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the founder of the ascetic sect of [[Udasi]] and was the elder son of [[Guru Nanak]], first [[Guru]] and founder of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/personalities/baba%20srichand/babasrichand.htm Baba Sri Chand] Sikh-heritage.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; He was born to [[Guru Nanak|Mata Sulakhani]] on [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]] sudi 9, 1551 [[Bikrami]] (i.e. 8 September 1494). 

==Compositions==
Sri Chand Ji is said to have composed an Aarta – a poem in name of his father, [[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]]. Many of his compositions are known to be part of the [[Udasi]] scripture, [[Matra Sahib]]. 
The 17th Ashtapadi of [[Sukhmani Sahib]] is said to have been composed by Sri Chand on the occasion of a visit by [[Guru Arjan]].

==Relationship with Sikh Gurus==
Not much is known about the relationship of Guru Angad and Sri Chand.

[[Guru Amardas]] declared active and domestic sikhs to be separate from passive and recluse [[Udasi|Udasis]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Joseph Davey Cunningham|Cunningham,Joseph]] [https://ia800306.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/28/items/historyofthesikh025030mbp/historyofthesikh025030mbp_tif.zip&amp;file=historyofthesikh025030mbp_tif/historyofthesikh025030mbp_0104.tif&amp;scale=4&amp;rotate=0 ''A History of the Sikhs'']
&lt;/ref&gt;
.

However the Sikh Gurus, [[Guru Amardas]], [[Guru Ramdas]], [[Guru Arjan]] and [[Guru Hargobind]] who were also contemporaries of Sri Chand did revere him.

Guru Hargobind's eldest son joined Udasi, while Sri Chand was alive.

Ram Rai, son of Guru Har Rai joined Udasi sect after a failed attempt of being a official eighth Guru of the Sikhs.

Sikh organizations like the [[Nihangs]], [[Damdami Taksal]] and even some Jathedars of Takhts, have admired Sri Chand Ji.

==Death==
He reportedly died at [[Kiratpur]] on 13 January 1629. However this appears unlikely, as if true that would meant he lived to 134 years old; the [[Oldest people|oldest human]] on record only lived 122 years.

[[File:Types of Karma.JPG|thumb|Types of Karma]]
{{Jainism}}
According to [[Jain]] [[Karma in Jainism|karma theory]], there are eight main '''types of karma''' (''Prikriti'') which are categorized into the ‘harming’ and the ‘non-harming’; each divided into four types. The harming karmas (''ghātiyā karmas'') directly affect the soul powers by impeding its perception, knowledge and energy, and also brings about delusion. These harming karmas are: ''darśanāvaraṇa'' (perception obscuring karma), ''Jnanavarniya'' (knowledge obscuring karma), ''antarāya'' (obstacles creating karma) and ''mohanīya'' (deluding karma). The non-harming category (''aghātiyā karmas'') is responsible for the reborn soul's physical and mental circumstances (nāma), longevity (āyuś), spiritual potential (gotra) and experience of pleasant and unpleasant sensations (vedanīya). In other therms these non-harming karmas are: ''nāma'' (body determining karma), ''āyu'' (life span determining karma), ''gotra'' (status determining karma) and ''vedanīya'' (feeling producing karma) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =|others=trans. by K. K. Dixit}} p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Dictionary of Religions (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of karmas thus affect the soul in different ways as per their nature. Each of these types has various sub-types. ''Tattvārthasūtra'' generally speaks of 148 sub-types of karmas in all. These are: 5 of ''jñānavaraṇa'', 9 of ''darśanavaraṇa'', 2 of ''vedanīya'', 28 of ''mohanīya''  4 of ''āyuṣka'', 93 of ''nāma'', 2 of ''gotra'', and 5 of ''antarāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghatiya karmas==
''Ghātiyā karmas'' (harming karmas) directly affect the attributes of the soul. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} pp. 131-32&lt;/ref&gt;

#Knowledge-obscuring karma (''Jñānāvaraṇīya karma'') – These karmas obscure the knowledge attribute of the soul.
#Perception-obscuring karma (''Darśhanāvaraṇīya karma'') – These karmas diminish the powers of Perception of a soul.
#Deluding karma (''Mohanīya karma'') – These karmas are an instrumental cause of destruction the soul's right belief and right conduct. Of all karmas, deluding karma is the most difficult to overcome. Once this is eradicated, liberation is ensured within a few lifetimes.
#Obstructing karma (''Antarāya karma'') – The fruition of these karmas creates obstructions to giving donations, obtaining gains, and enjoying things.

When ''ghātiyā karmas'' are totally destroyed, the soul attains ''[[kevala Jnana]]'' or omniscience. Liberation is guaranteed for such souls in the same lifetime as soon the aghātiyā karmas are exhausted in the due course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p.51
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jnanavaraniya karma===
''Jñānāvaraṇīya karma'' or the knowledge-obscuring karma are of five types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Glasenapp | first =Helmuth Von | editor =H. R. Kapadia|title =The Doctrine of Karman in Jain Philosophy | origyear=1942 | publisher =Asian Humanities Press| year =2003 | location =Fremont, CA | language =English |translator=G. Barry Gifford|isbn =0-89581-971-6}} p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
#''mati jnanavarana-karma'' which causes the obscuration of the knowledge, transmitted through the senses,
#''shruta jnanavarana-karma'' which produces the obscuration of knowledge acquired by interpreting signs (i.e.words, writings, gestures),
#''avadhi jnanavarana-karma'' which hinders transcendental knowledge of material things,
#''manahparyaya jnanavarana-karma'' which hinders transcendental knowledge of the thoughts of others,
#''kevala jnanavarana-karma'' which obscures the omniscience inherent in the jiva by natural disposition.

Of these, the last mentioned karman hinders [[Kevala Jnana|omniscience]] altogether; the four others do not result in complete destruction of the corresponding faculties of knowledge, but often produce only greater or less disturbances.

===Darshanavarana karma===
''Darshanavarana karma'' or the perception-obscuring karma are of four types:&lt;ref name=glasnape7-8&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt;
#''chakshur darshanavarana-karma'' which produces the obscuration of the darsana conditional upon the eye,
#''achakshur darshanavarana-karma'' which causes the obscuration of the undifferentiated  cognition, conditional upon the other senses and the organ of thinking,
#''avadhi darshanavarana-karma'' which causes the obscuration of the transcendental undifferentiated cognition of material things,
#''kevala darshanavarana-karma'' which hinder the absolute undifferentiated cognition (the counterpart of the omniscience).

The last mentioned karma hinders completely; the three others produce under certain circumstances only a disturbance of the respective cognition faculties.

In addition to these four darshanavarana karmas there are five others which produce physio-psychological conditions in which the sense organs are not active, and which, therefore, exclude all possibility of perception. These are the five nidra karmas, (sleep karmas), namely:&lt;ref name=glasnape7-8/&gt;

#''nidra-karma'' which produces a light, pleasant slumber, out of which the sleeper is already aroused by the clicking of finger nails.
#''nidranidra-karma'' which produces a deep slumber, out of which the sleeper can only be awakened by being shaken violently,
#''prachala-karma'' which sitting or standing upright
#''prachalaprachala-karma'' which produces an exceedingly intensive sleep, that overcomes a person while walking,
#''styanagriddhi (styanariddhi) karma'' which causes somnambulism, acting an unconscious state.

===Mohaniya karman===
''Mohaniya'' is derived from ''Moha'' which means attachment. ''Mohaniya'' karma (deluding karma) is the most dangerous, out of all the eight karmas because `moha' (attachment) is the root cause of all Kasayas (passions). It is also most difficult karma to destroy. If mohaniya karma is destroyed fully, the self becomes free from all Kasayas and liberation is assured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Mehta | first =T. U. | editor =Ashok Kumar Singh | title =The path of Arhat : a religious democracy | publisher =Pujya Sohanlal Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha| year =1993 | location =Varanasi | isbn = | oclc =29703055}} p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Two main categories of Mohaniya karman are—darshana mohaniya and charitra mohaniya karma. With their subtypes there are 28 sub-types of mohaniya karman.&lt;ref&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] pp.8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Darshana mohaniya karman====

{{Further|Ratnatraya}}
The ''darshana mohaniya-karma'' causes a disturbance of the knowledge of the religious truth inherent in the jiva by natural disposition. These are further divided into three types according as to whether the disturbance is an absolute or a partial one:&lt;ref name="Glasenapp, Helmuth Von 2003 p.8"&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.8&lt;/ref&gt;
#''mithyatva karma'': This causes complete unbelief or heterodoxy. If it realize itself, the [[jiva]] does not believe in the truths as proclaimed by [[Mahavira]]; he believes false prophets to be saints and enjoins false doctrines.
#''samyagmithyatva (misra) karma'': This produces a mixed belief, i.e., if it operates the soul waves to and for betwixt true  and false; it is  indifferent to the religion of the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]] and has no predilection for, nor hatred against it.
#''samyaktva karma'': This induces the correct belief. This [[samyaktva]] is, however, not the correct faith in its completeness, but  only in a preliminary degree; it is a so-called [[mithyatva]], from which the mithyatva quality has been abstracted a mithyatva free from poison.

====Charitra mohaniya karman====

{{Further|Kashaya (Jainism)}}
The ''charitra mohaniya-karma'' disturbs the right conduct possessed innately by the jiva; it hinders the soul from acting according to the religious prescriptions. The disturbance of the conduct is produced through the sixteen passions ''(kasaya)'', the six emotions with are categorised as non-passions ''(nokasaya)'' and the three sexes ''(veda)''.&lt;ref&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] pp.9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The four main passions are ''krodha'' (anger), ''maya'' (deceitfulness), ''mana'' (pride) and ''lobha'' (greed). The [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions &lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998): pp. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these is separated into 4 sub divisions, according to the intensity of their manifestation.  The first one is ''anantanubandhin'' (of lifelong duration) which completely hinders belief and conduct. The second one is ''apratyakhyanavarana'' (hindering and non-renunciation) It makes impossible every reninciation, but allows the existence of true belief and lasts for one year. The third one of still milder intensity is ''pratyakhyanavarana'' (hindering with renunciation). It hinders the  beginning of complete self-discipline, but does not prevent the existence  of true belief and partial self-discipline (desavirati). Its effect lasts  for 4 months. The last one is samjvalana (flaming up). It allows complete self-discipline,  yet works against the attainment of complete right conduct  (yathakhyata charitra). It lasts a fortnight.

The nokasayas or the six non-passions are: ''hasya'' (laughing, joking or making fun of), ''rati'' (prejudicial liking or impartiality), ''arati'' (improper conduct) ''soka'' (sorrow), ''bhaya'' (fear), and ''jugupsa'' (disgust). All these six emotions are ''charitra mohaniyas'', because the soul which is subjected to them, is hindered through them in the practice of right conduct.&lt;ref name=glasenap10&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The vedas or the sex passion hinders the jiva from obeying the laws and from practicing self-discipline. It is of threefold variety, according to the three species of sexes:&lt;ref name="glasenap10"/&gt;
*''Purusa veda'' (the male sex and corresponding sex passion) - Through  this, in the man the desire for union with a female is produced. Also man has at first an exceedingly strong desire, which disappears as soon as his  lust is satisfied.
*''stri veda'' (the female sex and corresponding sex passion) – Through this, in a woman the desire for union with a man is excited. Also the  desire in the woman is weak so long as she is untouched, but  grows into immensity through the enjoyment of intercourse.
*''napumsaka veda'' (the third sex and corresponding sex passion) – Effects the third sex belong all those beings who have no sexual  organs. The sexual desire is with them exceedingly strong because  it is directed towards men and women. It is to be compared to the burning of a town, which lasts long and finds no satisfaction.

===Antaraya karma===
The ''antaraya-karma'' hinders the energy (''virya'') of the ''jiva'' in a fivefold manner:&lt;ref&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Dana antaraya-karma'' hinders dispensing alms. When it operates a person who knows the merit in giving and who has something to give away, is not capable to give it, although there is someone worthy of the gift.
#''Labha antaraya-karma'' hinders receiving. When it operates, a person is not capable of receiving a present, although a friendly giver and a suitable present are present.
#''Bhoga antaraya-karma'' hinders the enjoyment of something which can only be taken once (such as eating drinking).
#''Upabhoga antaraya-karma'' hinders the enjoyment of something which can be repeatedly used (such as a dwelling, clothing, women).
#''virya antaraya-karma'' hinders the will power. When it operates, even a strong, full grown man is incapable of bending a  blade of grass.

==Aghatiya karmas==
These do not affect the soul directly; rather, they have an effect on the body that houses the soul. These are:&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998): pp. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

#Lifespan-determining karma (''Āyu karma'') – These karmas determine the subsequent states of existence and lifespan therein after death. The soul gets locked either into animal (tiryañca), infernal (nāraki), human (manuṣya), or celestial (deva) bodies for its next birth.
#Body-determining karma (''Nāma karma'') – These karmas determine the type of body occupied by the soul.
#Status-determining karma (''Gotra karma'') - The fruition of these karmas gives one high status or low status in society.
#Feeling-producing karma (''Vedanīya karma'') - These karmas become an instrumental cause of the interruption of the soul's uninterrupted happiness. As a result of this, the soul remains agitated.

As soon as the Aghātiyā karmas gets exhausted soul attains ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]]'' (liberation).&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998): pp. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ayu Karma===
The ''ayus-karma'' confers on a being a certain quantum of life in one of the four states of existence. Therefore there are four types of ''ayu karmas'': ''deva ayu'' (the celestial lifespan), ''manusya ayus'' (the human lifespan), ''tiryancha ayu'' (the animal lifespan), and ''naraka ayu'' (the infernal lifespan).&lt;ref name=glasnape11&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ayu-karma'' bestows a certain quantity of life, but not a definite number of years of life. For, as with a sponge, the quantity of water that it absorbs is determined, but not the time it takes to leave it, so also the quantum of life is determined, but not the time occupied in its consumption. The word ayu would, therefore, be approximately interpreted by "quantity of life" or "quantity of vitality").&lt;ref name="glasnape11"/&gt; The ayu of the new existence is always bound during the life immediately preceding it, especially in the 3rd, 9th, or 27th part or within the last 48 minutes of life.

===Nama Karma===
The ''nama-karma'' causes the individual diversities of the jivas. It is divided into 93 ''uttara prakrtis'' (sub-types), which are mostly quoted in a definitely fixed succession in 4 groups (''pinda prakrtis, pratyeka prakrtis, trasadasaka, sthavara dasaka''). They are the following:

*Four states of existence:&lt;ref name=Glas12&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Deva gati nama-karma'' bestows the celestial state of existence,
**''manusya gati nama-karma'' bestows the human state of existence,
**''tiryag gati nama-karma'' bestows the animal state of existence, and
**''[[Naraka (Jainism)|naraka gati]] nama-karma'' which bestows the infernal state of existence.
*Five classes of beings:&lt;ref name="Glas12"/&gt;
**''Ekendriya jati nama karma'' causes birth as a being with one sense.
**''Dvindriya jati nama karma'' causes birth as a being with two senses.
**''Trindriya jati nama karma'' causes birth as a being with three senses.
**''Caturindriya jati nama karma'' causes birth as being with four senses
**''Pancendriya jati nama karma'' causes birth as a being with five senses.
*Five types of bodies:&lt;ref name="Glas12"/&gt;
**''Audarika sarira nama karma'' gives a gross physical body peculiar to animals and men.
**''Vaikriya sarira nama karma'' gives the transformational body which consists of fine matter that changes in form and dimension. This body exists by nature in gods, infernal beings and certain animals; men can  attain it through higher perfection.
**''Aharaka sarira nama karma'' gives the translocation body. This body consists of good and pure substance and is without active and passive resistance. It is created for a short time by an ''apramatta samyata ascetic'' (ascetic with some carelessness), in order to seek for information concerning intricate dogmatic questions from an [[arhat]] who is in another part of the world, while his own physical body remains in its original place.
**''Taijasa sarira nama karma'' gives the fiery body. This body consists of fire pudgalas and serves for the digestion of swallowed food. It can also be used by ascetics to burn other beings or things.
**''Karmana sarira nama karma'' gives the karman body which is possessed by all worldly souls. This body is the receptacle for karman matter. It changes every moment, because new karman is continually assimilated by the soul and the already existing one consumed. Accompanied by it, the jiva at death leaves his other bodies and betakes himself to the place of his new birth, where the karman body then forms the basis of the newly produced other bodies. This body is destroyed only when all the karma are destroyed.
:Of these 5 bodies each succeeding one is finer than the one preceding it, but contains more material points than it; it is therefore denser. Every worldly soul (that is, soul not yet liberated) is always connected with a fiery and a karman body, but can, in addition, still possess one or two other bodies. At any given point of time four bodies can co-exist with a soul. For example, humans normally have three bodies simultaneously—''audarika sarira'' (normal visible gross physical body), ''taijasa sarira'' (fiery body), and ''karmana sarira'' (karmic body). Some higher spiritual ascetics may possess ''vaikriya sarira'' (transformational body).

*Corresponting to these five bodies there are thirteen more karmas to make the bodies operative.&lt;ref name=Glas13&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three types of ''angopanga nama karma'' for body parts—''audarika angopanga nama-karma, vaikriya angopanga nama-karma and  aharaka angopanga nama-karma''. Fiery and the karman body are subtle and have no body parts. Each body requires specific binding to operate that is enabled by its respective karma. Hence there are five types of bandhana or bindings for these body parts—''audarika bandana nama-karma, vaikriya bandana nama-karma, aharaka bandana nama-karma, taijasa bandana nama-karma'' and ''karmana bandana nama karma'' which procures the binding of physical, transformational, translocational, fiery and karmic body respectively. At the same time, combination of molecules (''samghatanas'') is required for binding of bodies, which are—''audarika samghatana nama-karma, vaikriya samghatana nama-karma adharaka samghatana nama-karma, taijasa samghatana nama-karma'', and ''karmana samghatana nama-karma.''&lt;ref name="Glas13"/&gt;
*Six Karmas related to joints:&lt;ref name=Glas14&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.14&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Vajra rsabha naraca samhanana nama-karma'' gives an excellent  joining. The two bones are hooked into one another, through the joining, a nail (''vajra'') is hammered and the whole joint is  surrounded by a bandage.
**''Rsabha naraca samhanana nama-karma'' gives a joining not so firm as  the preceding one, because the nail is missing.
**''Naraca samhanan nama-karma'' gives a joining which is still weaker, because the bandage is missing.
**''Ardha naraca samhanana nama-karma'' gives a joining which is on one side like the preceding one, while on the other the bones are simply pressed together and nailed.
**''Kilika samhanana nama-karma'' gives a weak joining, by which the  bones are merely pressed together and nailed.
**''Sevarta (chedaprstha) samhanana nama-karma'' gives quite a weak joining, by which the ends of the bones only touch one another. The humans in this era as per [[Jain cosmology]] have this type of joint structure.
:The ''samhananas'' play a great role in Jain doctrine. Only the first four make a meditation possible and only the best structure, the 1st joining of the joints, permits the highest kind of concentration which precedes [[Moksa (Jainism)|salvation]].

*The six samsthana nama-karmas related to body symmetry are:&lt;ref name="Glas14"/&gt;
**''Samacaturasra samsthana nama-karma'', which causes the entire body to be  symmetrically built.
**''Nyagrodhaparimandala samsthana nama-karma'', which causes the upper part of the  body to be symmetrical, but not the lower.
**''Sadi samsthana nama-karma'', which makes the body below the navel symmetrical and above it unsymmetrical.
**''Kubja samsthana nama-karma'' makes the body hunchbacked, i.e. hands, feet, head and neck symmetrical, breast and belly unsymmetrical.
**''Vamana samsthana nama-karma'' dwarf like, i.e. breast and belly  symmetrical, hands, feet etc. unsymmetrical.
**''Hunda samsthana nama-karma'' makes the entire body unsymmetrical.
:The conception of symmetry is explained in the following way: One imagines a man sitting in the paryanka posture, i.e. crossing the legs and placing the hands over the navel. If one imagines that the two knees are joined by a line, and from the right shoulder to the left knee, and from the left shoulder to the right knee, and from the forehead to the hands, a straight line is drawn, one gets four lines. If these are equal to one another, symmetry is apparent; if they are not so, one of the other 5 ''samsthanas'' results. Gods have only the first symmetry, infernal beings and jivas who have been produced through coagulation only the 6th figure; in the case of animals and men (also of kevalins) all six ''samsthanas'' are to be found.

*The following karmas provide different types colours to the bodies:&lt;ref name=Glas15&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.15&lt;/ref&gt; ''krsna varna nama-karma'' (black), ''nila varna nama-karma'' (dark, blue green, like an emerald), ''lohita varna nama-karma'' (colour which is red, like vermillion), ''haridra varna nama-karma'' (yellow, like turmeric) and ''sita varna nama'' ( white, like a shell). Other colors, such as brown etc., are produced by mixing. Black and green are considered as being pleasant, the others as unpleasant colors.
*The following karmas provide different types of odours to the bodies:&lt;ref name="Glas15"/&gt; ''surabhi gandha nama-karma'' produces pleasant odors (e.g., that of camphor) and ''durabhi gandha nama-karma'' produces unpleasant odors (e.g., that of garlic).
*The following karmas provide different abilities of tastes to the bodies:&lt;ref name="Glas15"/&gt; ''tikta rasa nama-karma'' gives a bitter taste (like that of the nimba fruit), ''kasaya rasa nama-karma'' gives an astringent taste (like that of bibhitaka), ''amla rasa nama-karma'' gives a sour taste (like that of tamarind) and ''madhura rasa nama-karma'' gives a sweet taste (like that of sugar). The salt taste is produced by a combination of the sweet taste with another. Bitter and biting tastes are considered unpleasant, the others pleasant.
*Eight karmas related to different type of touches are:&lt;ref name=Glas16&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Guru sparsa nama-karma'' which causes a thing to be heavy, like an iron ball.
**''Laghu sparsa nama-karma'' which causes a thing to be light, like particles in a sunbeam.
**''Mrdu sparsa nama-karma'' causes a thing to be smooth, like a tinisa tendril.
**''Khara sparsa nama-karma'' which causes a thing to be rough, like stone.
**''Sita sparsa nama-karma'' causes a thing to be cold, like snow.
**''Usna sparsa nama-karma'' causes a thing to be warm, like fire.
**''Snigdha sparsa nama-karma'' causes a thing to be adhesive, like oil.
**''Ruksa sparsa nama-karma'' cases a thing to be dry like ashes.
:Heavy, hard, dry, cold are considered to be unpleasant touches, the others pleasant.

*The ''anupurvi nama-karma'' causes that the ''[[jiva]]'', when one existence is finished, goes from the place of death in the proper direction to the place of his new birth. According to the 4 states of existence (celestial, human, animal, infernal) there are 4 anupurvi karmas, namely: ''deva anupurvi nama karma'', ''manusya anupurvi nama karma'', ''tiryag anupurvi nama karma'', and ''naraka anupurvi nama karma''.&lt;ref name="Glas16"/&gt;
*Karma that bestows different gaits to souls are: ''prasasta vihayogati nama-karma'' which causes a being to move in a pleasant  manner, as e.g. oxen, elephants and geese do and ''aprasasta vihayogati nama-karma'' which causes an ugly manner of motion, as, e.g. one finds with camels and asses.&lt;ref name="Glas16"/&gt;
*Following are the eight karmas related to eight ''pratyeka prakrtis'':&lt;ref&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] pp.16-17&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Paraghata nama karma''– It gives superiority over others. It endows the  capability of injuring or vanquishing others; on the other hand, it prevents one from being injured or overcome by others.
**''Ucchvasa nama karma'' – It bestows the capability of breathing.
**''Atapa nama karma'' – It causes the body of a being not in itself hot to emit a warm splendour.
**''Uddyota nama karma''– It causes the transformation body of the gods and  ascetics, as well as moon, stars, precious stones, herbs and shining insects to emit a cold lustre.
**''Agurulaghu nama karma''– It makes a being neither heavy nor light, i.e., causes it to possess neither absolute weight nor absolute lack of it.
**''[[Tirthankara]] nama karma''– It procures the position of a ford-maker of the [[Jain]] religion.
**''Nirmana nama karma'' – It causes the formation of the body, i.e., it causes the members of a being to be in their right place.
**''Upaghata nama karma'' – It causes self-annihilation. It produces that the  parts of the body of a being (e.g.the uvula in the throat) cause its death.
*The ten karmas related to ''trasa prakrtis'' (positive karmas) are:&lt;ref name=Glas17&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.17&lt;/ref&gt;
**''Trasa nama karma'', which gives a voluntarily movable body.
**''Badara nama karma'', which gives a gross body.
**''Paryapta nama karma'', which causes the complete development of the organs (karana) and capacities (labdhi) of nourishment, of the body, of the senses, of breathing, of speech, and of thought.
**''Pratyeka nama karma'', which causes the being to possess an individual body.
**''Sthira nama karma'', which causes the teeth, bones, etc., to be firm.
**''Subha nama karma'', which causes the parts of the body above the navel to be beautiful.
**''Subhaga nama karma'', which causes some one to whom is not under an  obligation to be sympathetic to one.
**''Susvara nama karma'', which bestows a voice which is melodious.
**''Adeya nama karma'', which causes that some one is suggestive, so that his speech meets with approbation and belief.
**''Yasahkirti nama karma'', which grants honour and glory.
*The ten karmas related to ''sthavara prakrtis'' (opposite of ''trasa prakrtis'') are:&lt;ref name="Glas17"/&gt;
**''Sthavara nama karma'', which, causes a body (of plants and elementary beings) that cannot be moved voluntarily.
**''Suksma nama karma'' gives (to elementary beings) a subtle body, imperceptible to our senses.
**''Aparyapta nama karma'' causes that the organs or faculties of a being do not attain full development, but remain undeveloped.
**''Sadharana nama karma'' gives (to plants etc.) a body in common with others of their species.
**''Asthira nama karma'' causes that ears, brows, tongue, etc. are flexible.
**''Asubha nama karma'' causes at all parts of the body, below the navel are considered to be ugly, so that somebody who is touched by the foot feels this to be unpleasaant.
**''Durbhaga nama karma'' makes the jiva unsympathetic.
**''Duhsvara nama karma'' makes the voice ill sounding.
**''Anadeya nama karma'' makes the jiva unsuggestive.
**''Ayasahkirti nama karma'' causes dishonor and shame.

===Gotra Karma===
The gotra karma or the status determining karma destines the rank occupied by a person through his birth. They are of two types:&lt;ref&gt;Glasenapp, Helmuth Von (2003) [1942] p.18&lt;/ref&gt;
*''uccair gotra-karma'' bestows high family surroundings.
*''nicair gotra-karma'' bestows low family surroundings.

===Vedaniya Karma===
[[Image:Vedniya Karma.jpg|thumb|250px|Vediniya karma: Pain and Pleasure is induced on account of licking honey from the sword]]

The ''vedaniya karma'' or feeling producing karmas are of two types:&lt;ref name="Glasenapp, Helmuth Von 2003 p.8"/&gt;
*''sata vedaniya-karma'' which causes a feeling of pleasure, created, e.g. by licking something sweet,
*''asata vedaniya-karma'' which causes the feeling of pain, created, e.g. if one is hurt by a sword.

With gods and men the sata vedaniya is predominant, although, also with the former at the time of the downfall from the celestial world, and with the latter through cold and heat, death and accident, pain can be produced. Animals and infernal beings experience chiefly the asata vedaniya, although, also, at the birth of a [[Tirthankara|Jina]] or on a similar occasion, they can experience a feeling of pleasure.

==Duration of Karmas==
The maximum duration of attachment of karma is 7 Quadrillion Sagaropama or 7 x 10^225 Years.  A Sagaropama or "ocean measured year"equals 10^210 Years. It is derived from Sanskrit word sagara or ocean. The minimum amount of time is less than one ''muharta''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;1 muharta = 48 minutes&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum and minimum time for which the karmas remain bound to our consciousness depends on the type of karma which is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;-

'''''Tzniut''''' ({{lang-he-n|[[wikt:צניעות|צניעות]]}} {{transl|he|tzniut}}, {{small|[[Sephardi pronunciation|Sephardi]]:}} {{transl|he|tzeniut(h)}}, {{small|[[Ashkenazi pronunciation|Ashkenazi]]:}} {{transl|he|tznius}}; "[[modesty]]" or "[[privacy]]"; {{Lang-yi|באשיידנקייט}} {{transl|yi|basheydnkeyt}}) describes both the character trait of modesty and discretion, as well as a group of [[Halakha|Jewish laws]] pertaining to conduct. In modern times, the term has become more frequently used with regard to the rules of dress for women within [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bloch |first1=Emmanuel |title=Immodest Modesty: The Emergence of Halakhic Dress Codes |journal=Studies in Judaism, Humanities, and the Social Sciences |date=2018 |volume=2 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is most important within [[Orthodox Judaism]].

== Description ==
''Tzniut'' includes a group of laws concerned with modesty of both dress and behavior. In the [[Babylonian Talmud]], Rabbi [[Elazar Bar Tzadok]] interprets the injunction at [[Book of Micah|Micah]] 6:8 to "go discreetly with your God" as referring to discretion in conducting funerals and weddings. The Talmud then extends his interpretation: "If in matters that are generally performed in public, such as funerals and weddings, the Torah instructed us to go discreetly, matters that by their very nature should be performed discreetly, such as giving charity to a poor person, how much more so must one take care to do them discreetly, without publicity and fanfare" (Tractate [[Sukkah]] 49b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Tractate Succah Vol. II p. 49b3 |author=Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (eds.) |year=2005 |location=New York |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the legal dimension of Orthodox Judaism, the issue of ''tzniut'' is discussed in more technical terms: how much skin may a person expose, and so on.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} These details underscore the concept of tzniut as a positive code of conduct, character, and awareness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Practical applications ==

=== Dress ===
The principal guiding point of ''tzniut'' in regard to dress is that a Jew should not dress in a way that attracts undue attention.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} This does not mean dressing poorly, but that neither men nor women should dress in a way that overly emphasizes their physical appearance or attracts undue attention. There are many different interpretations of what ''tzniut'' means, so people from different communities will sometimes dress differently.

Orthodox Judaism requires both men and women to substantially cover their bodies. According to many opinions, this involves covering the elbows and knees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modestworld.com/laws.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishanswers.org/ask-the-rabbi-category/womens-issues/?p=2677|title=Ask the Rabbi, JewishAnswers.org » Skirts, Wigs, and Feminine Modesty|publisher=|access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communities, men wear long trousers and usually long-sleeved shirts; most&lt;REF NAME="MensModesty"&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/resources/additional-resources/2010/01/modesty-not-just-for-women Modesty: Not Just For Women], ''[[Patheos]]''&lt;/ref&gt; will not wear short sleeves at all. Haredi [[Ashkenazi]] practice discourages sandals without socks both in and out of the synagogue, whereas Haredi [[Sefardi]] communities tend to accept sandals at least outside of synagogue. Dress in a synagogue and, according to many, in public should be comparable to that worn by the community when meeting royalty or government.

Haredi women wear blouses covering the elbow and collarbone, and skirts that cover the knees while standing and sitting. The ideal sleeve and skirt length varies by community. Some women try not to follow fashion, while others wear fashionable, but modest, clothing. Haredi women avoid skirts with slits, preferring instead [[kick pleat]]s. They also avoid overly eye-catching colors, especially bright red, as well as clothing that is tight. Many will only wear closed-toe shoes, and always wear stockings, the thickness of which varies by community.

[[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] women also usually adhere to ''tzniut'' and dress in a modest fashion (as compared to the general society),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Joseph|title=Sisters Revolutionize Fashion|url=https://simplebooklet.com/publish.php?wpKey=adTHJSIIzpQ0ATQkAhgCG3#page=72|publisher=FYI Magazine|access-date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their communal definition does not necessarily include covering their elbows, collarbones, or knees, and may allow for wearing pants, although some Modern Orthodox women will, when in front of men or in public, wear skirts that cover their knees, preferably loose ones, and cover their elbows and cleavage.

Modern Orthodox men's dress is often indistinguishable from their non-Orthodox peers, apart from them wearing a skullcap. They may wear short-sleeved shirts and even shorts. Sandals without socks, while generally not worn in a synagogue, are usually accepted in Modern Orthodox and [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] communities in Israel for daily dress, for both men and women.

[[Conservative Judaism]] formally encourages but does not require modest dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Booth |first1=David (et al.) |title=Modesty Inside and Out: A Contemporary Guide to Tzniut |journal=CJLS |date=February 2, 2017 |page=20 |url=https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/Modesty%20Final.pdf |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While day-to-day dress often simply reflects the general society, many Conservative synagogues expect somewhat more modest dress (although not necessarily as stringent as in Orthodox Judaism) for synagogue attendance, and may have specific dress requirements to receive synagogue honors (such as being called for a [[Torah reading]]).

[[Reform Judaism]] has no religious dress requirements.

Style of dress involves cultural considerations distinct from religious requirements. Members of Conservative and Reform synagogues may abide by [[dress code]]s generally ranging from [[business casual]] to [[informal wear|informal]]. There are many Orthodox synagogues (especially in [[Israel]]), where dress, while meeting religious modesty requirements, is quite casual. Many Haredi and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] communities have special customs and styles of dress that serve to identify members of their communities, but regard these special dress features as [[Minhag|customs]] of their communities, rather than as general religious requirements expected of all observant Jews.&lt;REF NAME="MensModesty" /&gt;

=== Hair covering ===
[[File:Women praying in the Western Wall tunnels by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Three styles of hair covering common among married Orthodox Jewish women. From left to right: [[snood  (headgear)|snood ]], fall, and hat.]]
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] governing tzniut requires married women to cover their hair;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], Even Ha'ezer 115, 4; Orach Chayim 75,2; Even Ha'ezer 21, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schiller, Mayer|url=http://www.jofa.org/pdf/Batch%201/0101.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062723/http://www.jofa.org/pdf/Batch%201/0101.pdf|archive-date=2008-04-07|title=The Obligation of Married Women to Cover Their Hair|journal= JHCS|volume= 30|year=1995|pages=81–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the Talmud, this is a biblical requirement,&lt;ref&gt;Ketubot 72a, bottom of the page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Halichot Bat Yisrael |author=Yakov Yitzchak Fuks |year=1989 |location=Jerusalem |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in this context is called ''dat Moshe'' (the [[law of Moses]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], Mishneh Torah [http://mechon-mamre.org/i/4124.htm ''Ishut'' 24:9]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]], Even Ha'ezer 115, 4 in Beit Shmu'el&lt;/ref&gt; The most common hair coverings in the Haredi community are the [[sheitel]] (wig), the [[Snood (headgear)|snood]], and the ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for 'scarf') or ''[[tichel]]'' (Yiddish), as well as hats and berets.

The practice of covering hair with wigs is debated among [[halakhic]] authorities. Many authorities, including Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Rav Moshe Feinstein |url=http://parsha.blogspot.com/2007/10/igros-moshe-on-wigs-and-shavers-part-i.html |title=Igros Moshe, Even HaEzer chelek 2, siman 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; permitted it, and the [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|Lubavitcher Rebbe]] actively encouraged it,&lt;ref&gt;All over his published correspondence&lt;/ref&gt; while many other authorities, especially Sephardi rabbis, forbid it.

Modern Orthodox Jewish women usually use hats, berets, baseball caps, bandanas, or scarves tied in a number of ways to accomplish the goal, depending on how casually they are dressed. Some modern Orthodox women cover their hair with wigs. A style of half wig known as a "fall" has become increasingly common in some segments of Modern and Haredi Orthodox communities. It is worn with either a hat or a headband.

In [[Yemen]], unmarried girls covered their hair also, like the Muslims there;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/dresscodes/en/home/ "Dress Codes: Revealing the Jewish Wardrobe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023811/http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/dresscodes/en/home/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, An exhibition focusing on this collection was presented at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem 11 March 2014 – 18 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; however, upon [[Yemeni Jew]]s' emigration to Israel and other places, this custom has been abandoned. While Rebbe [[Aharon Roth]], founder of [[Shomer Emunim (Hasidic dynasty)|Shomer Emunim]], praised this custom, no Ashkenazi community – including the most strict Haredi circles – have ever practiced such a custom.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Shomer Emunim, Rav Aharon Roth [[zt"l]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative and Reform Judaism do not generally require women to wear head coverings. Some more traditional Conservative synagogues may ask that married women cover their heads during services. However, some more liberal Conservative synagogues suggest that women, married or not, wear head-coverings similar to those worn by men (the [[kippah]]/yarmulke); and some require it (or require it only for women receiving honors or leading services from the ''[[Bema#Judaism|bimah]]'') – not for modesty, but as a [[feminism|feminist]] gesture of [[egalitarianism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Almost all Conservative synagogues require men to wear a head covering (usually a kippah), but in Reform synagogues, there is no requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lauterbach |first=Jacob |title=Worshiping with Covered Heads |journal=CCAR Responsa: American Reform Responsa |date=1928 |volume=XXXVIII |pages=589-603 |url=https://www.ccarnet.org/ccar-responsa/arr-8-21/ |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''kippot'' may be provided to anybody who wishes to wear them.

=== Female singing voice ===

==== Orthodox Judaism ====
In Orthodox Judaism, men are generally not allowed to hear women sing, a prohibition called ''kol isha'' (literally “a woman's voice”).&lt;ref&gt;[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] 24a&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud classifies this as ''ervah'' (literally "nakedness"). The majority view of halakhic authorities&lt;ref&gt;[[Or Zarua]] 1, hilkot taharat keriat shema utefilah, no. 133; [[Shlomo ben Aderet|Rashba]]; Hiddushei ha-Rashba, Berachot [[ibid.]]; [[Asher ben Yechiel|Rosh]] Berachot 3:37, [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]]-[[Shulkhan Arukh]] Even ha-Ezer 21:2 following [[Maimonides|Rambam/Maimonides]], Hilhot Issurei Biah 21:2&lt;/ref&gt; is that this prohibition applies at all times, and forbids a man to pray or study Torah in the presence of a woman who is singing, similar to other prohibitions classified as ''ervah''.&lt;ref name=bigman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishideas.org/rabbi-david-bigman/new-analysis-kol-bisha-erva|title=A New Analysis of "Kol B'Isha Erva" - jewishideas.org|author=|date=|website=www.jewishideas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minority view&lt;ref&gt;Rav [[Hai Gaon]], [[Rabbenu Hananel]], and [[Halachot Gedolot]] (as cited in [[The Mordechai|Mordechai]] Berakhot chapter Mi sheMeito 247:80). This opinion is also followed by the [[Ra'avya]] and the [[Ritva]] (in his [[chidushim]] to Berachot). However, Rashba – quoting Rabbenu Hananel – says that this leniency applies only to one's own wife's voice, not to that of another woman.&lt;/ref&gt; holds that the prohibition of praying or studying in the presence of ''kol isha'' applies only while reciting the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer.&lt;ref name=bigman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cherney&gt;Cherney, Ben. [http://www.jofa.org/pdf/Batch%201/0099.pdf ''Kol Isha''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215033509/http://www.jofa.org/pdf/Batch%201/0099.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }}. ''JHCS'' 10, pp. 57–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate between [[posek|''poskim'']] whether the prohibition applies to a recorded voice, where the singer cannot be seen, where the woman is not known to the man who is listening, and where he has never seen her or a picture of her.

There are also opinions,&lt;ref name=jachter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/The%20Parameters%20of%20Kol%20Isha.htm|title=The Parameters of Kol Isha|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] and [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], that exclude singing in mixed groups from this prohibition, such as synagogue prayer or dinner-table ''[[zemirot]]'', based on the idea that the female voice is not distinctly heard as separate from the group in these cases (''Trei Kali Lo Mishtamai'', two voices cannot be heard simultaneously &amp;ndash; Megila 21b).&lt;!-- However, [[Yehiel Yaakov Weinberg]] found this explanation unsatisfactory, and instead proposed, following the [[Sdei Chemed]]&lt;ref&gt;Klalim, Maarechet Hakuf, 42&lt;/ref&gt; quoting the [[Divrei Cheifetz]], that the ''kol isha'' prohibition does not apply to women singing ''zemirot'', songs to children, and lamentations for the dead, because in these contexts, men do not derive pleasure from the woman's voice.

In a novel ruling, Rabbi David Bigman holds that ''kol isha'' only applies when there is sexual pleasure involved.&lt;ref name=bigman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosh yeshiva]] of Yeshivat Maale Gilboa in Kibbutz Maale Gilboa, Israel; [http://www.maalegilboa.org/ensite/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=5 Biographical information at Yeshivat Maale Gilboa]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the majority of authorities, i. e., those who did ''not'' link ''kol isha'' to Kriat Shema, ''kol isha'' is, in fact, similar to gazing at a woman's little finger, which is another case in Berachot ibid. But the [[Rishonim]] rule that gazing at a woman's finger only applies when done expressly for sexual pleasure, or when there is any sexual pleasure involved. Thus, it stands to reason (no previous authority has explicitly stated as such) that ''kol isha'' is similar, and has parallel by-laws applicable to it. Therefore, Rabbi Bigman states,&lt;ref name="bigman"/&gt; "There is no prohibition whatsoever of innocent singing; rather, only singing intended for sexual stimulation, or flirtatious singing, is forbidden. Although this distinction is not explicit in the early rabbinic sources, it closely fits the character of the prohibition as described in different contexts in the Talmud and the Rishonim, and it is supported by the language of the Rambam, the Tur, and the Shulchan Aruch."

In a similarly novel ruling,&lt;ref&gt;Original article: {{Cite web |url=http://www.kolech.org.il/show.asp?id=25318 |script-title=he:קול באישה (ערווה) בראייה עכשווית |author=Rabbi Avraham Shammah |language=Hebrew|trans_title=Kol b'isha erva in a Contemporary Perspective |date=16 January 2008 |access-date=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reply to criticisms against the original article: {{Cite web |url=http://www.kolech.org.il/show.asp?id=25484 |script-title=he:והכל כפי המנהגות והמקומות |author=Rabbi Avraham Shammah |trans_title=All is According to the Customs and Locations |language=Hebrew|date=27 January 2008 |accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English translation of the original article, and the response: {{Cite web |url=http://www.jofa.org/pdf/uploaded/1529-GHKB8620.pdf |title="''Kol b'Isha'' with a Current Perspective": A halakhic opinion offered by Rabbi Avraham Shammah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Avraham Shammah comes to the same conclusion as Rabbi Bigman. He argues that ideologically, the laws of ''tzniut'' are defined by time and place, according to what people are accustomed to, and what gives them sexual pleasure. He quotes the [[Maharam Alkashar]] (a 15th century rabbinic exile from Spain), who says
&lt;blockquote&gt;Response: Indeed, there is no concern about that hair [that is outside of the braid], because it is customary to reveal it ... and that [which is said] 'a woman's hair is a sexual enticement' is only referring to hair that it is usual to be covered, but a person is accustomed to that which is usually uncovered [and therefore is not aroused] and it is permitted ... Likewise, the [[Ra'avya]] wrote that all those [things] that we mentioned for [concern about] sexual enticement are specifically for things that are not customarily exposed ... all is according to the customs and the locations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi Shammah cites many sources, such as [[Maharshal]] and Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]], who permit various violations of their theretofore normative laws of ''tzniut'', on the basis that the behavior in question is not sexually enticing in that time and place. In regards to ''kol isha'' specifically, he notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;R. [Yehiel Yaakov] Weinberg cites Maimonides Hilkhot Isurei Bi'a (Laws of Forbidden Sexual Relations) 21:2, in which Maimonides states that "one who looks even at a woman's little finger with the intent to derive [erotic] pleasure is as if he looked at her privates and even to hear the voice of a forbidden woman or to see her hair is forbidden." R. Weinberg points out that the meaning of Maimonides' words is that the prohibition to hear a woman’s voice is only if there is intent to thereby derive erotic pleasure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi Weinberg relies also on the [[Sdei Chemed]], quoting the [[Divrei Cheifetz]], that Shabbat hymns and funeral dirges, when sung by women, are not ''kol isha'', as men do not derive sexual pleasure from them. Rabbi Shammah simply takes this logic further, and concludes that if a man judges himself sincerely and honestly, that in a particular case, he will not be enticed by a woman's voice, he may listen to her sing, even ordinary songs in concerts, and the like, depending on the case. He closes saying that
&lt;blockquote&gt;From my childhood [growing up under Syrian Jewish-Orthodox immigrants to Israel] until my adulthood I do not remember closing my ears, nor was I instructed to do so, and I heard the best music, both from the Orient and the West, even when performed by female singers, and even at live performances. Apparently, the principle is based on the fact that there is no intent here for some forbidden pleasure. [People] have testified to me that there were Torah-observant Jews at the performances of the famous Egyptian singer, [[Umm Kulthum]] [considered by some to be Egypt's most famous and distinguished twentieth-century singer], and even more than that, they listened to her songs and learned them well, even though some of the songs had inappropriate words. Prayer leaders (among them scholars) used her tunes [in the prayer services], until this day, with the approval of halakhic authorities, who knew quite well the source [of these tunes].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, against the novel and minority view of Rabbis Bigman and Shammah, Rabbi Cherney&lt;ref&gt;Cherney, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e find that Shmuel's claim that it [i.e., various violations of the normative laws of ''tzniut''] is permitted "for the sake of Heaven, {{lang|he|הכל לשם שמים}}," [meaning, the act is normatively forbidden, but permitted because it gives no sexual pleasure in the given time and place] is quoted by later authorities. R. [[Moses Isserles]] (the Ramo) quotes Shmuel's liberal view, as stated by Tosafot. But we should note that although Ramo obviously accepts this principle, he does not quote it in the context of ''Kol isha''. In our own generation, R. Ovadia Yosef [who elsewhere is willing to be lenient on certain normative laws of ''tzniut'' when men are no longer enticed by them in the given time and place] has expressed the opinion that, "you should not let your heart seize the argument that nowadays since we are accustomed to the voices of women, we need not be concerned that [the voice arouses lewd thoughts], for we may not say these things out of our own understanding if it is not mentioned in the authorities."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in 2009, R. Ovadia Yosef proclaimed publicly that a woman could chant Megillat Esther (the Scroll of Esther) for men in order to fulfill their obligation to hear the Scroll on Purim, since the obligation of women and men is equal in this area. In terms of ''kol ishah'', he stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[M]ost rabbis forbid women to read the megillah on the grounds that men are forbidden to listen to women sing, because a woman's singing voice can stimulate sexual arousal. However, he said, he does not agree that a woman chanting a sacred text is the kind of singing that stimulates sexual arousal. The analogy rabbis have drawn between singing and chanting sacred texts has 'no value', he declared."&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Yair. "Top Sephardi rabbi rules women may chant Scroll of Esther for men" ''Haaretz''. 2 March 2009. http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/top-sephardi-rabbi-rules-women-may-chant-scroll-of-esther-for-men-1.271212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is in contrast to most prominent Ashkenazi authorities. However, it is well within the halakhic and sociological norms of Middle Eastern and Sephardic Jewry, which have a long tradition of both secular and religious women's song.

Rabbi [[Yehuda Henkin]], based especially on the Maharshal, permits&lt;ref&gt;Henkin, Yehuda, "Hirhur and Community Norms", in ''Equality Lost'', Urim Publications, 1999, pp. 76–86&lt;/ref&gt; men and women to mix in general society, based on the fact that this is no longer sexually enticing today, but he, like Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, likewise forbids this same argument to be applied to ''kol isha''.--&gt;

==== Other denominations ====
Conservative Judaism interprets the relevant passage of the Talmud as expressing a rabbi's opinion, rather than imposing a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Golinkin, David. [http://www.schechter.edu/kol-bishah-ervah-is-it-really-forbidden-for-jewish-men-to-listen-to-women-singing/ "'Kol B'ishah Ervah' – Is it Really Forbidden for Jewish Men to Listen to Women Singing?"] ''The Schechter Institutes''. 18 November 2011. 27 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform Judaism fundamentally rethought the status of women within Judaism in a series of synods from 1837 onward in both Europe and the United States, formally abolishing most distinctions between men and women in the observance of Jewish life, particularly concerning dress and public participation. It no longer regards this [[Halakha|traditional law]] as applicable to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Nadell, ''Women Who Would Be Rabbis'' pp. 14–22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wang Hao-te''' (1921–1999) was the founder of the Great Way of Maitreya ({{zh|t=彌勒大道|p=Mílè Dà Dào}}), which is based in [[Hsinchu]], [[Taiwan]]. According to Taiwan's survey in 2004 this religion has 1,000,000 members and 2000 temples all over the world. Wang was born in 1921, the 28th day of the 7th lunar month (August 31, 1921) in a small village called Zhang Gu in Shandong province in China.  He went to Taiwan when he was 17 years old during the 2nd War time and he was introduced to [[Yiguandao]] in 1948 by chance.  He was a hardworking, well loved and down to earth talented young man and he was the only person appointed to take care of Sun Su Zhen or "Shi Mu" 師母 when he was 23 years old, the great mistress of Yiguandao for 11 years until her death in 1975, 4 April.

In 1987, Wang set up the Providence Maitreya Buddha Institute ({{zh|t=天恩彌勒佛院|p=Tiān'ēn Mílè Fó Yuàn}}) in [[Hsinchu]], Taiwan. Unfortunately, Wang died of CO2 poisoning on Christmas Day in 1999 during his mission to Chiang Mai, Thailand; left his only daughter Wu Xian. The Great Way of Maitreya led by Wang has had a large number of followers for the past sixty over years.

The '''"Word of Wisdom"''' is the common name of a section of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]],&lt;ref&gt;In the edition published by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], it is {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89}}. In the edition published by the [[Community of Christ]], it is [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-086.htm section 86]. In older editions which are used by some other Latter Day Saint denominations, it is section 81.&lt;/ref&gt; a book considered by many churches within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] to consist of [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] from [[God]]. It is also the name of a [[taboo food and drink|health code]] based on this scripture, practiced most strictly by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and [[Mormon fundamentalists]], and to a lesser extent, some other [[Latter Day Saint denominations]]. In the LDS Church, compliance with the Word of Wisdom is currently a prerequisite for [[baptism]], service in [[Mormon missionary|full-time missionary work]], attendance at [[Church Educational System|church schools]], and entry into the church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]]; however, violation of the code is not considered to be grounds for [[excommunication]] or other [[Disciplinary council|disciplinary action]].&lt;ref name = churchdiscipline&gt;"When a Disciplinary Council Is Not Necessary", ''[[Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (LDS Church, 2010) § 6.7.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text discourages "strong drink" and wine (in some cases this includes [[sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacramental]] wine which has been replaced with sacramental water in some sects), the non-medicinal use of tobacco, "hot drinks", and [[meat]] used more than "sparingly". The scripture also recommends the consumption of herbs, fruits, and grains, as well as grain-based "mild drinks". As practiced by the LDS Church, there is no firm restriction relating to [[meat consumption]], but all [[alcoholic beverage]]s are forbidden, including beer. The LDS Church currently interprets "hot drinks" to mean [[coffee]] and [[tea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/word-of-wisdom |title= Word of Wisdom |work= Gospel Topics |publisher= lds.org |accessdate= 2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and publication==
According to [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the Word of Wisdom was received in 1833 as a revelation from God. After Smith's death, [[Brigham Young]] stated that the revelation was given in response to problems encountered while conducting meetings in the Smith family home:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When they assembled together in this room after breakfast, the first they did was to light their pipes, and, while smoking, talk about the great things of the kingdom, and spit all over the room, and as soon as the pipe was out of their mouths a large chew of tobacco would then be taken. Often when the Prophet [Joseph Smith] entered the room to give the school instructions he would find himself in a cloud of tobacco smoke. This, and the complaints of his wife at having to clean so filthy a floor, made the Prophet think upon the matter, and he inquired of the Lord relating to the conduct of the Elders in using tobacco, and the revelation known as the Word of Wisdom was the result of his inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young, ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'', [http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=9838&amp;filename=110504_183925_ep158_Va_M230_J82_v12.pdf vol. 12, p. 158].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Word of Wisdom was first published as a stand-alone broadsheet in December 1833. In 1835, it was included as section 89  in the first edition of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]].

==Word of Wisdom revelation==
The revelation contains four parts:
#an introduction;&lt;ref name = introduction&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=1|range=–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a list of substances that should not be ingested, including [[wine]], strong drink, [[tobacco]] and "hot drinks";&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=5|range=–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a list of foods that should be used, some with certain limitations;&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=10|range=–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
#a divine promise to those who follow the guidelines.&lt;ref name = promise&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=18|range=–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
The introduction and explanation as presented by Smith is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion— To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days— Given for a principle with a promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. &lt;ref name = introduction/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Prohibitions===
Among the substances which the revelation indicates should not be ingested, the first is "wine or strong drink", which the revelation says should not be drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (An exception is allowed for the use of "pure wine of your own make" as part of the [[Sacrament (Mormonism)|sacrament]] [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=5|range=–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the LDS Church today uses water in place of wine.) The revelation also advises against the consumption of tobacco&lt;ref name = tobacco&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "hot drinks".&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Word of Wisdom revelation also suggests proper uses for some prohibited substances. While "strong drinks" are not to be ingested, they are appropriate when used "for the washing of your bodies";&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, while human ingestion of tobacco is forbidden, tobacco is said to be "an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill."&lt;ref name = tobacco/&gt;

===Prescriptions===
The list of foods and substances which the revelation encourages includes "wholesome herbs [and] every fruit in the season thereof"&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=10|range=–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also prescribes the use of "all grain", which is described as "the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field."&lt;ref name = vfourteen&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barley]] and other [[grain]]s are recommended for use in making "mild drinks".&lt;ref name = vseventeen&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth" may be used as food "sparingly" and "with thanksgiving". 

The revelation states that it is pleasing to God if these recommendations are not used, "only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine" and times of "excess of hunger".&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=12|range=–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine promise===
The Word of Wisdom states that it comprises a "principle with promise".&lt;ref name = versethree&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise given to those who followed the advice of the word of wisdom is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.  And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.&lt;ref name = promise/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Application by Joseph Smith==
Originally, abiding by the recommendations and prohibitions of the Word of Wisdom was not considered mandatory: it explicitly declares itself to be "not by commandment or constraint".&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1834, however, Joseph Smith proposed a resolution before the [[presiding high council|high council]] of the church that stated, "No official member in this Church is worthy to hold an office after having the word of wisdom properly taught him; and he, the official member, neglecting to comply with and obey it."&lt;ref name = TPJS&gt;[[Joseph Fielding Smith]] (ed.) (1938). ''[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 117, n. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution was accepted unanimously by the council.&lt;ref name = TPJS/&gt;

In 1842, Smith's brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], who was the [[Assistant President of the Church]] and its [[presiding patriarch]], provided an interpretation of the Word of Wisdom's proscription of "hot drinks":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And again "hot drinks are not for the body, or belly;" there are many who wonder what this can mean; whether it refers to tea, or coffee, or not. I say it does refer to tea, and coffee.&lt;ref&gt;Hyrum Smith, [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/9200/rec/4 "The Word of Wisdom"], ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', 1 June 1842, vol. 3, p. 800.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a book written by LDS missionary and hymnographer [[Joel H. Johnson]] in 1881, Joseph Smith shared Hyrum's interpretation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I understand that some of the people are excusing themselves in using tea and coffee, because the Lord only said "hot drinks" in the revelation of the Word of Wisdom .... Tea and coffee ... are what the Lord meant when He said "hot drinks".&lt;ref&gt;In Joel H. Johnson (1881). ''Voice from the Mountains'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Juvenile Instructor Office) p. 12; cited in [http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-81-89/section-89-the-word-of-wisdom "Section 89 The Word of Wisdom"], ''Doctrine and Covenants Student'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The charge of "not observing the Word of Wisdom" was one of five leveled against [[David Whitmer]] on April 13, 1838, which led to his [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith ([[B. H. Roberts]] (ed.)), ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 3, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, contemporary records indicate that Joseph Smith was not, himself, a strict observer. Smith is recorded at various times as drinking tea,&lt;ref&gt;"Diary of Joseph Smith", March 11, 1843 entry&lt;/ref&gt; beer,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Millennial Star]]'', vol. 23, no. 45 [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/MStar/id/22187 p. 720] (9 November 1861).&lt;/ref&gt; and wine.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith ([[B. H. Roberts]] (ed.)), ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' (January 1836) vol. 2, 369 ("Our hearts were made glad by the fruit of the vine."; Joseph Smith ([[B. H. Roberts]] (ed.)), ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' (May 2, 1843) vol. 5, p. 380 ("Called at the office and drank a glass of wine with Sister Jenetta Richards, made by her mother in England,..."); Joseph Smith ([[B. H. Roberts]] (ed.)), ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' (June 27, 1844) vol. 6, p. 616 ("Dr. Richards uncorked the bottle, and presented a glass to Joseph, who tasted, as also Brother Taylor and the doctor..."); Joseph Smith ([[B. H. Roberts]] (ed.)), ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' (June 27, 1844) vol. 7, p. 101 ("Sometime after dinner we [John Taylor and other prisoners at [[Carthage Jail]]] sent for some wine. It has been reported by some that this was taken as a sacrament. It was no such thing; our spirits were generally dull and heavy, and it was sent for to revive us.... I believe we all drank of the wine, and gave some to one or two of the prison guards.").&lt;/ref&gt; There is a report he also smoked tobacco: according to [[Amasa Lyman]], a member of the [[First Presidency]] under Smith, Smith once finished preaching a sermon on the Word of Wisdom and immediately afterward rode through the streets smoking a cigar.&lt;ref&gt;Diary of [[Abraham H. Cannon]], vol. 19 (October 1895 entry); cited in Gary Dean Guthrie, [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/4732/ ''Joseph Smith As An Administrator''], M.A. thesis, [[Brigham Young University]], May 1969, [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5731&amp;context=etd p. 161].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lyman, this was just one of many instances in which Smith "tried the faith of the Saints ... by his peculiarities." (One modern commentator has suggested that this may have been done by Smith to ensure that his followers' faith was based on the Latter Day Saint religion and not on Smith's personality or leadership.)&lt;ref&gt;Gary Dean Guthrie, [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/4732/ "Joseph Smith As An Administrator"], M.A. thesis, Brigham Young University, May 1969, [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5731&amp;context=etd/ p. 161].&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 1835, [[Almon W. Babbitt]] was brought before the church's [[presiding high council|high council]] on three charges. On the charge of "not keeping the Word of Wisdom", Babbitt stated "that he had taken the liberty to break the Word of Wisdom, from the example of President Joseph Smith, Jun., and others, but acknowledged that it was wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith ([[B. H. Roberts]] (ed.)), ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 2, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, Smith was operating a hotel/tavern in [[Far West, Missouri]]. In June 1838, the high council of Far West felt compelled to remind Smith's family that there was a ban on the sale and consumption of "ardent spirits in the place".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Q. Cannon]], Lyndon W. Cook. ''Far West Record: Minutes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1830–1844'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==

===Emphasized by Brigham Young===
After Smith's death, several factions emerged from the Latter Day Saint movement. The largest of these groups, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), was led by [[Brigham Young]]. At a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] of the church held on September 9, 1851, Young called on the attendees to "leave off the use of" items mentioned in the Word of Wisdom:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Patriarch &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[John Smith (uncle of Joseph Smith)|John Smith]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; again rose to speak on the Word of Wisdom, and urging on the brethren to leave off using tobacco, &amp;c.

President Young rose to put the motion and called on all the sisters who will leave off the use of tea, coffee, &amp;c., to manifest it by raising the right hand; seconded and carried.

And then put the following motion; calling on all the boys {{sic}} who were under ninety years of age who would covenant to leave off the use of tobacco, whisky, and all things mentioned in the Word of Wisdom, to manifest it in the same manner, which was carried unanimously."

The Patriarch then said, may the Lord bless you and help you to keep all your covenants. Amen.

President Young amongst other things said he knew the goodness of the people, and the Lord bears with our weakness; we must serve the Lord, and those who go with me will keep the Word of Wisdom, and if the High Priests, the Seventies, the Elders, and others will not serve the Lord, we will sever them from the Church. I will draw the line, and know who is for the Lord and who is not, and those who will not keep the Word of Wisdom, I will cut off from the Church; I throw out a challenge to all men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/utils/getfile/collection/MStar/id/37435/filename/37436.pdf "Minutes of the General Conference"], Tuesday, Sep. 9, 1851, afternoon session; ''[[Millennial Star]]'', 1 February 1852, vol. 14, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though Young encouraged Mormons to follow the Word of Wisdom code, the church was tolerant of those who did not follow it. In 1860, he counseled those chewing tobacco in church meetings to at least be discreet and not excessive, but did not charge users with sin.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'', vol. 8, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870, however, he ended the practice of chewing and spitting tobacco in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'', vol. 13, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young also recognized a separation between using tobacco (which was discouraged), and selling it to non-Mormons as a business (which was encouraged).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'', vol. 9, p. 35 (encouraging Mormons to raise and sell tobacco).&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned and maintained a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] in Salt Lake City for the sale of alcoholic beverages to non-Mormon travelers, on the theory that it was better for LDS Church authorities to run such establishments than for outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''History of Utah'', p. 540, n. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meat===
The Word of Wisdom states that "flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air ... are to be used sparingly", and that "it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=12|range=–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the injunctions against tobacco, alcohol, and hot drinks, however, compliance with this injunction has never been made mandatory.

Many LDS Church leaders have expressed their views on the subject of [[meat]]. In 1868, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Brigham Young]] counseled, "Flesh should be used sparingly, in famine and in cold."&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young, "The True Church of Christ—the Living Testimony—Word of Wisdom", ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''12''':209, May 10, 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, apostle [[George Q. Cannon]] said, "We are told that flesh of any kind is not suitable to man in the summer time, and ought to be eaten sparingly in the winter."&lt;ref&gt;George Q. Cannon, "Word of Wisdom—Fish Culture—Dietetic", ''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''12''':221–22, April 7, 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1897 to 1901, apostle and then [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Lorenzo Snow]] repeatedly emphasized the importance of eating meat sparingly, teaching that church members should refrain from eating meat except in case of dire necessity, and that this should be seen in light of Smith's teaching that animals have spirits.&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt; In 1895, Snow stated, "Unless famine or extreme cold is upon us we should refrain from the use of meat."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis B. Horne, ed., ''An Apostle’s Record: The Journals of Abraham H. Cannon'' (Clearfield, Utah: Gnolaum Books, 2004) p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; Apostle [[George Teasdale]] taught the same thing, and held that eating [[pork]] was a more serious breach of the Word of Wisdom than drinking tea or coffee.&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt; When [[Joseph F. Smith]] succeeded Snow as president of the church in 1901, he preached regularly against the "unnecessary destruction of life", and emphasized kindness to animals and the important stewardship humans have toward them .&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Smith, "Humane Day", ''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'' '''53''' no. 4 (April 1918):182–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these statements, restricting meat consumption was not made an explicit requirement for worthiness in the LDS Church as the standards for obedience to the Word of Wisdom were made increasingly central to LDS Church doctrine and practice in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Peterson, An Historical Analysis of the Word of Wisdom (M.A. thesis, Brigham Young University, August 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; The increased emphasis on the Word of Wisdom took place during the presidency of [[Heber J. Grant]], a long-time enthusiastic promoter of the Word of Wisdom. Although Grant did not make restricting meat consumption an explicit part of the standard, he continued to interpret it as part of the counsel in the Word of Wisdom. In the 1937 General Conference, at 80 years old, Grant said he worked long hours "without fatigue and without feeling the least injury". He attributed his excellent health, in part, to eating very little meat.&lt;ref&gt;Heber J. Grant, ''Conference Report'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, April 1937) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Grant's presidency, the emphasis on limiting the consumption of meat has lessened, but there have been some church leaders who have taught on the subject. In a 1948 LDS general conference address, apostle [[Joseph F. Merrill]] emphasized the importance of not eating meat as "freely as many Americans are doing".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Merrill, "Eat Flesh Sparingly", ''Conference Report'', April 1948, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, apostle and plant scientist [[John A. Widtsoe]] wrote, in relation to meat consumption, "they who wish to be well and gain the promised reward stated in the Word of Wisdom must obey all of the law, not just part of it as suits their whim or their appetite, or their notion of its meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Widstoe, John A., ''The Word of Wisdom: A Modern Interpretation'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as 2012, official church spokesperson [[Michael Otterson]] stated "the church has also encouraged limiting meat consumption in favor of grains, fruits and vegetables.|&lt;ref&gt;Tumulty, Karen. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/mormonism-good-for-the-body-as-well-as-the-soul/2012/06/20/gJQARk3IqV_blog.html "Mormonism good for the body as well as the soul?"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, the LDS Church's [[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|hymnal]] includes a hymn with the following lyrics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
That the children may live long / And be beautiful and strong, / Tea and coffee and tobacco they despise, / Drink no liquor, and they eat / But a very little meat; / They are seeking to be great and good and wise.&lt;ref&gt;"In Our Lovely Deseret", ''[[Hymns of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1985 book)|Hymns]]'', no. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A student manual published by the church has suggested that the suggestion that the consumption of meat be limited to wintertime may to some degree be a historical relic of the time in which the "Word of Wisdom" was delivered by Smith:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This verse has caused some to ask if meat should be eaten in the summer. Meat has more calories than fruits and vegetables, which some individuals may need fewer of in summer than winter. Also, before fruits and vegetables could be preserved, people often did not have enough other food to eat in winter. Spoiled meat can be fatal if eaten, and in former times meat spoiled more readily in summer than winter. Modern methods of refrigeration now make it possible to preserve meat in any season. The key word with respect to the use of meat is ''sparingly''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-81-89/section-89-the-word-of-wisdom "Section 89 The Word of Wisdom"], ''Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002) pp. 206–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Beer===
The Word of Wisdom states in part,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
16. All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground—

17. Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 89|verse=16|range=–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The revelation suggests that barley-based mild drinks (such as [[beer]]) may be permissible.&lt;ref name = vseventeen/&gt; As recently as 1901, [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] [[Brigham Young, Jr.]] and [[John Henry Smith]] argued that the revelation did not prohibit beer.&lt;ref name = Alexander&gt;[[Thomas G. Alexander]], [http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V14N03_80.pdf "The Word of Wisdom: From Principle to Requirement"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' '''14''':3 (1981) pp. 78–88.&lt;/ref&gt; However, LDS Church leaders now teach that consumption of any form of alcohol, including beer, violates the Word of Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church (2002, 2d ed.) [http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-fundamentals/chapter-27-the-word-of-wisdom "Chapter 27: The Word of Wisdom"], ''Gospel Fundamentals'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://www.lds.org/new-era/2006/11/the-body-is-sacred "The Body Is Sacred"], ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', November 2006, pp. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas S. Monson]], [http://www.lds.org/new-era/2008/10/standards-of-strength "Standards of Strength"], ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', October 2008, pp. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refined grain products===
In a pamphlet written in 1930 called ''The Word of Wisdom'', apostle [[John A. Widtsoe]] taught that refined flour was contrary to the Word of Wisdom.&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt; The church, however, has never prohibited the use of refined flour.

===Standards of adherence===
Adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom was not made a requirement for entry into LDS Church [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] until 1902. However, even then, church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] encouraged [[stake president]]s to be liberal with old men who used tobacco and old ladies who drank tea.&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt; Of those who violated the revelation, it was mainly habitual drunkards that were excluded from the temple.&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt; Around the turn of the century, the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom were not strictly adhered to by such notable church leaders. [[Anthon H. Lund]], a First Counselor in the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], drank beer and wine; apostle [[Matthias F. Cowley]] drank beer and wine; [[Charles W. Penrose]], who also served as a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank wine; [[Relief Society]] general president [[Emmeline B. Wells]] drank coffee; and church president [[George Albert Smith]] drank [[brandy]] for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt; In 1921, church president [[Heber J. Grant]] made adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom an absolute requirement for entering the temple.&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt;

Today, adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom is required for [[baptism]]&lt;ref&gt;"To this day those regulations [of the Word of Wisdom] apply to every member and to everyone who seeks to join the Church. They are so compelling that no one is to be baptized into the Church without first agreeing to live by them.": [[Boyd K. Packer]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1996/05/the-word-of-wisdom-the-principle-and-the-promises "The Word of Wisdom: The Principle and the Promises"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1996, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and for entry into [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temples]] of the LDS Church.&lt;ref name = temple&gt;LDS Church (2009). [http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-29-the-lords-law-of-health "Chapter 29: The Lord’s Law of Health"], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church) p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; BYU historian [[Thomas G. Alexander]] points out that while the original Word of Wisdom as a "principle with promise" was given by revelation, there is no evidence that any church leader has claimed a separate new revelation, or even a spiritual confirmation, of changing the Word of Wisdom from "a principle with promise" to a commandment.&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt;

===Official modern interpretation===
The church's official statement on the interpretation of the Word of Wisdom is short: it reaffirms the long-standing meaning of "hot drinks" and extends the substances covered by prohibition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The only official interpretation of "hot drinks" (D&amp;C 89:9) in the Word of Wisdom is the statement made by early Church leaders that the term "hot drinks" means tea and coffee.

Members should not use any substance that contains illegal drugs. Nor should members use harmful or habit-forming substances except under the care of a competent physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies#21.3.11 |title= 21.3.11 Word of Wisdom |work= [[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 2: Administering the Church]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although avoiding the prohibitions of the Word of Wisdom is a requirement for admission to [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS Church temples]],&lt;ref name = temple/&gt; violation of the Word of Wisdom no longer results in [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]], as it once did;&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt; the church instructs its leaders that church discipline "should not be [used] to discipline or threaten members who do not comply with the Word of Wisdom."&lt;ref name = churchdiscipline/&gt;

LDS Church leaders have counseled church members that they should not have personal interpretations of, or become extreme in their observance of the Word of Wisdom. One church leader specifically warned that adding additional unauthorized requirements, emphasizing it with excess zeal, or making it a "gospel hobby" is a sign of spiritual immaturity and sometimes apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Quentin L. |last= Cook |authorlink= Quentin L. Cook |date=March 2003 |title= Looking beyond the Mark |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2003/03/looking-beyond-the-mark |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular application==

===Alcohol===
The prohibition of "wine or strong drink" is widely interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all [[alcoholic beverage]]s, regardless of the level of alcoholic content of the drink.

===Hot drinks===
Generally, members of the church view the prohibition on "hot drinks" as covering [[coffee]] and [[Camellia sinensis|tea]], whether or not the drinks are hot.&lt;ref name = dummies/&gt; There is generally thought to be no prohibition against drinking boiling or hot water&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ldsliving.com/Recent-Studies-from-WHO-Back-Up-One-of-the-Most-Contested-Parts-of-the-Word-of-Wisdom/s/82418&lt;/ref&gt;, [[herbal tea]], [[hot chocolate]], [[coffee substitute]]s such as [[Postum]] or [[malt]] drinks such as [[Ovaltine]] or [[Milo (drink)|Milo]]. Other members choose to prohibit themselves from drinking any beverage that contains [[caffeine]].&lt;ref name = dummies/&gt;

===Cola and other caffeinated beverages===
A longstanding issue among members of the church is whether it is permissible to ingest drinks containing [[caffeine]] that are not coffee or tea. In 1918, [[Frederick J. Pack]], a Latter-day Saint professor at the [[University of Utah]], published an article in an official church magazine in which he reasoned that because [[Coca-Cola]] contained [[caffeine]], which is also present in tea and coffee, Latter-day Saints should abstain from Coca-Cola in the same way that they abstain from the Word of Wisdom "hot drinks".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Pack, "Should Latter-Day Saints Drink Coca-Cola?" ''[[Improvement Era]]'' '''21''':5 (March 1918).&lt;/ref&gt; Since Pack's article, many Latter-day Saints have come to believe that the reason tea and coffee are proscribed is the presence of caffeine in the drinks. However, the church has never stated that this is the reason for the prohibition.

The church does not have an official position on the consumption of caffeinated beverages, apart from the general statement that the Word of Wisdom does not specifically mention it. In 2012, in response to a report on Mormonism on NBC’s ''[[Rock Center with Brian Williams]]'', which claimed that LDS faithful were prohibited from drinking caffeine, the church wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite what was reported, the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine. The Church’s health guidelines prohibits alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and "hot drinks"—taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Mormonism in the News: Getting It Right–August 29|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/mormonism-news--getting-it-right-august-29|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|date=August 29, 2012|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the past, a number of church leaders have discouraged the use of such products. For example, in 1922, church president [[Heber J. Grant]] counseled the Latter-day Saints:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am not going to give any command, but I will ask it as a personal, individual favor to me, to let coca-cola {{sic}} alone. There are plenty of other things you can get at the [[soda fountain]]s without drinking that which is injurious. The Lord does not want you to use any drug that creates an appetite for itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Conference Report'', April 1922, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two years after making this statement, Grant met with a representative of [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to discuss the church's position on Coca-Cola; at the conclusion of their second meeting, Grant stated that he was "sure I have not the slightest desire to recommend that the people leave Coca-Cola alone if th[e] amount [of caffeine in Coca-Cola] is absolutely harmless, which they claim it is."&lt;ref name = Alexander/&gt; Grant never again spoke out against the use of cola drinks.

Approximately fifty years later, the church issued an official statement which stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit.  Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church, "Priesthood Bulletin", February 1972, p. 4; quoted in [http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-81-89/section-89-the-word-of-wisdom "Section 89 The Word of Wisdom"], ''Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002) p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of such statements, some adherents believe that caffeine is officially prohibited under the Word of Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=Robert|title=Mitt stirs up old caffeine controversy|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/faith/ci_5401092|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=March 10, 2007|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Erickson, "Caffeine not prohibited" (letter to the editor), ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'', 3 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950's, the director of the food services for [[Brigham Young University]], a college owned by the LDS Church, decided not to sell caffeine on campus.  This changed in September 2017 when the current director of BYU Dining Services announced that caffeinated beverages would be sold on campus. Wright said this was the result of a change in customer preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/education/college/byu/byu-to-begin-selling-caffeinated-sodas-on-campus/article_3baaa121-38c1-57ac-834d-0711d86f941e.html |title=BYU begins selling caffeinated sodas on campus |last=Herald |first=Shelby Slade and Braley Dodson Daily |work=Daily Herald |access-date=2017-09-21 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official church publications have occasionally published articles by medical practitioners that warn of the health risks of consuming caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boud|first=Thomas J.|title=The Energy Drink Epidemic|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/2008/12/the-energy-drink-epidemic|magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stratton|first=Clifford J.|title=Caffeine–The Subtle Addction|url=http://www.lds.org/liahona/1990/03/caffeine-the-subtle-addiction|magazine=[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]|date=March 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephenson|first=William T.|title=Cancer, Nutrition, and the Word of Wisdom: One Doctor's Observations|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/2008/07/cancer-nutrition-and-the-word-of-wisdom-one-doctors-observations|magazine=Ensign|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November 2010, the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' noted that in the [[Handbook (LDS Church)|2010 church ''Handbook'']], which sets out the official position of the church on health and social issues, no position on drinking Coca-Cola or caffeinated drinks is included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peggy Fletcher Stack|title=LDS Church handbook on social issues available online|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/50690125-80/church-handbook-says-members.html.csp?page=1|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=November 26, 2010|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' concluded that the church "takes no official position on caffeine".&lt;ref name=dew&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Peggy Fletcher Stack]]|title=Mormons can drink caffeine?

===Other areas===
Speculation also exists concerning the use of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] as a cooking ingredient or the use of [[Decaffeination|decaffeinated]] coffee or tea.&lt;ref name = dummies&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/whats-not-on-the-mormon-menu.html | title = What's Not on the Mormon Menu | accessdate = 2009-06-19 | publisher = Dummies.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church has taken no official stance on either.

== Health studies regarding Latter-day Saints ==
A 14-year selective study conducted by [[UCLA]] [[epidemiologist]] James E. Enstrom tracked the health of 10,000 moderately active LDS Church members in [[California]] and ended in 1987. Of these non-[[Tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[monogamy|monogamous]] non-[[alcoholic beverage|drinkers]], Enstrom concluded from the study "that LDS Church members who follow religious mandates barring smoking and drinking have one of the lowest death rates from cancer and cardiovascular diseases&amp;mdash;about half that of the general population. ... Moreover, the healthiest LDS Church members enjoy a life expectancy eight to eleven years longer than that of the general white population in the United States." The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for whites in the general population is defined as 100. For males in the study, the SMRs "are 47 for all cancers, 52 for cardiovascular diseases, and 47 for all causes; the SMRs for females are 72 for all cancers, 64 for cardiovascular diseases, and 66 for all causes." For LDS [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]] who exercised, had proper sleep, and never smoked cigarettes, the mortality rate was less. The results were largely duplicated in a separate study of an LDS-like subgroup of white non-smoking churchgoers in [[Alameda County, California]].&lt;ref name="enstrom"&gt;Enstrom, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Rosicrucian Crucifixion by John Augustus Knapp.jpg|thumb|"A Rosicrucian Crucifixion" showing the five Hebrew letters of the "Pentagrammaton" in the [[hexagram]].]]
The '''pentagrammaton''' ({{lang-el|πενταγράμματον}}) or '''Yahshuah''' ({{lang-he|יהשוה}}) is a constructed form of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name of [[Jesus]] originally found in the works of [[Athanasius Kirchner]], [[Johann Baptist Grossschedel]] (1619) and other late Renaissance [[Esotericism|esoteric]] sources. It is to be distinguished from the name [[Yahshua]] found in the works of the Sacred Name Movement in the 1960s, though there has been some conflation or confusion between the two.  The pentagrammaton Yahshuah has no support in archeological findings, such as the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] or inscriptions, nor in rabbinical texts as a form of Joshua. Scholarship generally considers the original form of Jesus to be [[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]], a Hebrew Bible form of Joshua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The essential idea of the pentagrammaton is of an alphabetic consonantal framework Y-H-Sh-W-H, which can be supplied with vowels in various ways.  (Also, the "W" can be converted into a "U", since the Hebrew letter ו ''waw'' writes either a [w] consonant sound &amp;mdash; later on pronounced [v] &amp;mdash; or a long [u] vowel sound: see [[Matres lectionis|Mater Lectionis]].)

==Renaissance occultism==

The first ones to use a name of Jesus something like "Yahshuah" were [[Renaissance magic|Renaissance occultists]]. In the second half of the 16th century, when knowledge of Biblical Hebrew first began to spread among a significant number of Christians, certain esoterically minded or [[occult]]istic circles came up with the idea of deriving the Hebrew name of Jesus by adding the Hebrew letter ''shin'' ש into the middle of the [[Tetragrammaton]] divine name ''yod-he-waw-he'' יהוה to produce the form ''yod-he-shin-waw-he'' יהשוה.  

This was given a basic [[Latin]] transliteration JHSVH or IHSVH or IHSUH (since there was no letter "W" or ''sh'' / [š] sound in Latin, and "I" and "J" were then not yet clearly distinguished as letters of the alphabet, nor were "U" and "V"). This could then be supplied with further vowels for pronounceability. It was a coincidence that the first three letters of this consonantal transcription IHSVH etc. were identical with the old IHS/JHS [[Christogram|monogram of the name of Jesus]] (from Greek ''iota-eta-sigma'').

In Renaissance occultistic works, this pentagrammaton (or five-letter divine name) was frequently arranged around a mystic [[pentagram]], where each of the five Hebrew letters י ה ש ו ה was placed at one of the points (the letter ''shin'' ש was always placed at the upward-pointing vertex of the pentagram).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byzant.com/Mystical/Symbols/Pentagrammaton.aspx Byzant Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the earliest attested examples of this diagram is in the ''[[Calendarium Naturale Magicum Perpetuum]]'' or "Magical Calendar" (published 1620 but dated 1582)&lt;ref&gt;"Bernard Picart and the first global vision of religion" - Page 158 Lynn Avery Hunt, Margaret C. Jacob, W. W. Mijnhardt - 2010 &lt;/ref&gt; of either
[[Theodor de Bry]] (Flemish-born German, 1528–1598) or [[Matthäus Merian the Elder]] (Swiss, 1593–1650).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levity.com/alchemy/wroclaw.html The Wroclaw codex of the Magical Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea of the ''pentagrammaton'' was funneled into modern occultism by 19th-century French writer [[Eliphas Levi]] and the influential late 19th-century [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. The Golden Dawn favored the consonantal transcription IHShVH or YHShVH, and the pronunciation Yeheshuah.

However, in all early Hebrew or Aramaic sources, the name "Jesus"/"Jeshua" actually appears as ''yod-shin-waw-`ayin'' ישוע [[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]] (or as the related longer form of the same name, ''yod-he-waw-shin-`ayin'' יהושע "Joshua"; or as the intentionally altered derogatory Talmudic variant ''yod-shin-waw'' ישו [[Yeshu]]), so that the Renaissance speculations were incorrect.  Note that the letter ''`ayin'' ע was specifically pronounced as a voiced [[pharyngeal consonant]] sound in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic, and could not be easily confused with either a pronounced [h] sound or a silent Hebrew letter ''he'' ה.

==Modern "Divine Name" groups==
{{main|Sacred Name Movement}}
Some modern religious groups have speculated that the most correct form of the Hebrew name of Jesus should be based on the spelling ''yod-he-shin-waw-`ayin'' יהשוע (apparently  a reordering of the letters in the Hebrew spelling of the name ''yod-he-waw-shin-`ayin'' יהושע, pronounced [yěhōšūǎ`] and usually translated into English as "Joshua", but closely connected with the Hebrew form of the name of Jesus).  This Hebrew letter sequence ''yod-he-shin-waw-`ayin''  can be transcribed into English in various ways (since Masoretic [[Niqqud]] is rejected), including Yahshua, Yahoshua, etc. &amp;mdash; see [[Yahshua]].

When a final "H" is added on to these transcriptions (e.g. Yahshuah, Yahoshuah etc.), or when such consonantal transcriptions as YHSWH or YHShWH are used (both quite similar to the old transcription JHSVH, given the differences between the English and Latin uses of the alphabet), then it seems rather clear that there is confusion between the name of Jesus and the Tetragrammaton (whether under the influence of the old occultistic "Pentagrammaton", or independently). The consonantal transcription YHShVH is used both by occultists and Divine Name religious adherents.
