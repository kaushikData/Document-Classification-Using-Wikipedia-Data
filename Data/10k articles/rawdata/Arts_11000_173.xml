'''Aliza Olmert''' ({{lang-he|עליזה אולמרט}}; born 1946) is an Israeli artist, photographer, author and social worker. She is married to former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Aliza olmert 1.jpg|thumb|right|Laura Bush welcomes Aliza Olmert]]

Aliza Olmert was born in a [[displaced persons camp]] in [[Eschwege]], [[Germany]]. Her parents were [[Holocaust]] survivors from [[Łódź]], [[Poland]]. She immigrated to Israel with her family in 1949, grew up in [[Ramat Gan]], and served as an instructor in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981971.html |title=That Midas touch |work=Haaretz}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met her husband, [[Ehud Olmert]], at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where she was studying social work.&lt;ref name=Shabi&gt;{{cite news |work=The Guardian |title=The unlikely first lady |author=Rachel Shabi |date=5 May 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/05/israel1 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olmerts live in Jerusalem's [[Katamon]] neighborhood. They have five children (including [[Shaul Olmert]]), one of them adopted.&lt;ref name=Shabi /&gt;

=== Art career ===
In 1985–1988, at the age of 40, Olmert studied environmental design at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]]. In Israel, Olmert has exhibited at the Museum on the Seam in Jerusalem, the Museum of Israeli Art in Ramat Gan, the Eretz Israel Museum in Tel Aviv and the Tel Aviv Artists' House.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt; Her work has also been exhibited in Japan, Uruguay, Italy, Britain, Poland, Argentina and New York.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt; In March 2008, she was awarded the Steiger Prize in Germany.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt;

===Politics===

Olmert espouses left-wing politics, and has been accused of influencing her husband's political views. Olmert dislikes the political limelight, and says that their most difficult period as a couple was 1993–2003, when Ehud was mayor of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=Shabi /&gt;

She is said to support [[Meretz]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Berger, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/international/middleeast/13israel.html How a Zionist Hawk Grew His New Dovish Feathers], ''New York Times'' (13 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social welfare ===
Olmert is active in social programs promoting child welfare. She is the chairman of Or Shalom and Tlalim, which aid children at risk and families with homebound sick children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nir Magal |date=14 May 2006 |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3250714,00.html |publisher=Ynet |script-title=he:עליזה אולמרט: לא אוותר על הבריחות לתל אביב |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Aliza Olmert: I will not give up on escapes to Tel Aviv |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olmert is also a member of the Action Committee for Children of Foreign Workers.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt;

An '''artist cooperative''' (also [[co-operative]] or co-op) is an autonomous [[visual arts]] organization, enterprise, or association jointly owned and democratically controlled by its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html International Co-operative Alliance ''Statement on the Co-operative Identity''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081503/http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html |date=2012-02-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist cooperatives are legal entities organized as non-capital stock [[corporations]], [[non-profit organizations]], or [[voluntary association|unincorporated associations]]. Such cooperatives typically provide professional facilities and services for its artist-members, including studios, workshops, equipment, exhibition galleries, and educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/cooperatives/whatis.html#arts Small Farm Center, University of California] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305050618/http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/cooperatives/whatis.html#arts |date=March 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By design, all economic and non-economic benefits and liabilities of the cooperative are shared equally among its members. Cooperative members elect their board of directors from within the membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncba.coop/abcoop.cfm National Cooperative Business Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218093223/http://www.ncba.coop/abcoop.cfm |date=February 18, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Blue Apple was founded in 2005 by [[Jane Jessop]] to provide opportunities for people with a wide range of learning difficulties to participate in high quality theatre and dance opportunities.  Her aim was to enable them to discover and explore their talents on and off stage and to challenge expectations, with no ceiling on the opportunities given to them or on our expectations of them. She was inspired by the experience of her son [[Tommy Jessop]]  who was acting with the [[BBC]]. Over 50 people came to each of the pilot  workshops and Blue Apple has had a waiting list ever since.

Jane Jessop led the company for over ten years during which time Blue Apple won several awards, gained Arts Council funding, developed a film programme and broke through many barriers, enabling Blue Apple's performers to work in a professional environment, bring celebrated performances to mainstream theatres, and attract audiences of several thousand to touring productions. Jane's final project was a tenth birthday performance event on stage at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in London.

Blue Apple now delivers over 400 drama and dance workshops a year for over 70 members, in addition to two professional theatre shows and one touring production each year. the company attracts audiences from all over England and has become respected as a leading producer of theatre and dance  by performers who have disabilities.

The company's first show was a basic [[Variety show]] called "Born to be Blue". This was such a success it was followed by a fully costumed pantomime "Cinderella and the Wolf" written with the cast by the playwright and film maker [https://www.thetalentmanager.co.uk/talent/23520/william-jessop William] Jessop. The company has created two full-scale productions a year ever since and launched a touring programme.

In 2008 the Apple Core auditioned theatre training group was established, Blue Apple launched its dance programme, made its first film and had a membership of around 50 people with learning disabilities. Blue Apple actors and dancers performed to a standing ovation in London, and in Brighton, Birmingham and around London.  Blue Apple won its first award for changing the way people see and understand learning disability in spring 2009.
 
In Autumn 2009, Blue Apple appointed their first arts consultant Peter Clerke, who in 2012 became the company's first Artistic Director.&lt;ref name="Pete"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharts.org.uk/1/artsinscotland/drama/features/archive/profilepeterclerke.aspx |title=Scottish Arts Council - Archive - Profile: Peter Clerke |publisher=Scottisharts.org.uk |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Clerke  worked with the [[playwright]] William Jessop &lt;ref name="William Jessop profile in Ink Pellet magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inkpellet.co.uk/2012/04/william-jessop/ |title=William Jessop |publisher=Ink Pellet |date= |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create various productions including promenade performances of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]] to mark Blue Apple's fifth anniversary in June 2010,&lt;ref name="MND"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/winchester/8206826.Blue_Apple_tackles_the_Bard/ |title=Blue Apple tackles the Bard (From Hampshire Chronicle) |publisher=[[Hampshirechronicle.co.uk]] |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; an original play called "Captain Miserable and the Book Guardian" for Christmas 2010, a lively [[comic]] adaptation of [[Gogol|Gogol's]] [[The Government Inspector]] for Summer 2011, a groundbreaking touring adaptation of [[Hamlet]] for 2012, an adaptation of [[Théâtre Feydeau|Feydeau]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20140423235733/http://blueappletheatre.hampshire.org.uk/hotel.html The Hotel du Paradis] for full company performance in 2013 and adaptations of  [[Much Ado About Nothing]] for both the touring and main company productions in 2014.

Volunteer support has always been vital to the success of the company. The crucial support of nearly 200 volunteers who have supported Blue Apple since its foundation was recognised by the Queen when in 2012 Blue Apple became the 1,000th winner of the Queen’s Award for volunteering.

==Apple Cores==
[[File:BlueAppleCores.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;The Apple Core Actors&lt;/center&gt;]]

In 2008, Blue Apple Theatre introduced an intensive theatre training scheme for auditioned actors and dancers which has evolved into Blue Apple's touring company. The "Apple Core" began by  creating various theatre and dance productions for performance at local and national events such as the [[Winchester Hat Fair]], [[Mencap]] conferences, medical schools and universities and two of the actors performed scenes from Hamlet in the cabinet office as part of the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II]].

In Autumn 2011, the six Apple Core actors (Four of the six have Downs syndrome) created the company's first major touring production, the hard hitting "Living Without Fear", which addressed the difficult subject of [[disability]] [[hate crime]] as perpetrated towards people with learning disabilities.Living Without Fear toured nationally and was performed to over 4,000 people including MPs and ministers in Parliament and over 600 school children and 800 police personnel. The [[Hampshire Chronicle]] described the play as 'the most powerful production seen in Winchester for many years'.&lt;ref name="Hampshire Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Joseph|title=Living Without Fear|newspaper=The Hampshire Chronicle|date=9/6/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Living Without Fear" had its second tour in March and April 2013.&lt;ref name="Entertainment Focus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainment-focus.com/theatre-section/theatre-news/living-without-fear-to-tour/ |title=Living Without Fear to tour |publisher=Entertainment Focus |date=2013-03-02 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Blue Apple Theatre received funding from the [[Home Office]] for the filmmaker William Jessop to create a film adaptation of the play for and with [[Hampshire Constabulary]].&lt;ref name="Community Action Against Crime Innovation Fund Grants"&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Office |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-action-against-crime-innovation-fund-successful-applicants |title=Community action against crime: innovation fund successful applicants - Publications |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the Apple Core actors created a radical new touring production of [[Hamlet]] and in 2014 toured [[Much Ado About Nothing]] to theatres across the south of England and at [[RADA]].

==Hamlet==

In 2012, Blue Apple received [[Arts Council England]] funding&lt;ref name="Arts Council England Announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/be-or-not-be-blue-apple-theatres-hamlet-goes-tour/ |title=To Be or Not to Be: Blue Apple Theatre’s Hamlet Goes on Tour |publisher=Arts Council |date=2012-05-01 |accessdate=2013-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708084519/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/be-or-not-be-blue-apple-theatres-hamlet-goes-tour/ |archivedate=2013-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for its Core actors to tour a groundbreaking production of [[Hamlet]] to theatres across the South of England, playing at illustrious venues like the [[Minack Theatre]] in [[Cornwall]] and the [[Rose Theatre, Kingston]]. The production received positive reviews in [[The Stage]]&lt;ref name="The Stage Review of Blue Apple's Hamlet"&gt;{{cite web|author=Francesca Morrison |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/36167/hamlet |title=The Stage / Reviews / Hamlet |publisher=Thestage.co.uk |date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hampshire Chronicle]]. Blue Apple's [https://web.archive.org/web/20160423153452/http://www.blueappletheatre.hampshire.org.uk/hamlet.html Hamlet] was performed to over 3,500 people in all and scenes were  performed by [[Tommy Jessop]], and Lawrie Morris in the cabinet office in 2012 and by [[Tommy Jessop]], and Katy Francis on stage at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre's Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in 2016..

The role of Hamlet was played by the [[Down Syndrome]] TV actor [[Tommy Jessop]], who starred in [[Coming Down the Mountain]] and has appeared in [[Holby City]], [[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]], [[Monroe (TV series)|Monroe]] and [[Doctors (soap opera)|Doctors]]. The other actors were Anna Brisbane, Ros Davies, James Elsworthy, Katy Francis and Lawrie Morris.

At the end of June 2012, the Core actors returned to the main company for three performances of "Hamlet" at the Theatre Royal, Winchester.

The story of Blue Apple's Hamlet is the subject of William Jessop's [[emmy]] nominated BBC 3 feature documentary, "[https://growingupdowns.co.uk/ Growing] Up Down's" &lt;ref name="DFG Winner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedfg.org/news/details/1003/the-dfg-pitch-winner-announced |title=The DFG Pitch - Winner Announced |publisher=DFG |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2013-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006130117/http://thedfg.org/news/details/1003/the-dfg-pitch-winner-announced |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Three Growing Up Down's|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03sc49m|website=BBC Three|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Times reviewed it as "William Jessop's fabulous documentary... a triumph for the cast, for BBC Three, and for everyone involved in this life-enhancing project."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11314">The '''''Book of Chivalry''''' (French: '''''Livre de chevalerie''''') was written by the [[knight]] [[Geoffroi de Charny]] (c.1306-1356) sometime around the early 1350s. The treatise is intended to explain the appropriate qualities for a knight, reform the behavior of the fighting classes, and defend the [[chivalric]] [[ethos]] against its critics, mainly in [[clergy|clerical]] circles.

==Author and context==

Geoffroi de Charny was intensely involved in the first phase of the [[Anglo]]-[[French people|French]] conflict known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The first record of his [[military campaign|campaigns]] against the [[English people|English]] appear in 1337, and despite being captured twice, Charny grew in prestige from a minor member of the [[nobility]] to one of the most respected knights in France, especially under the kingship of [[Jean II of France]].  Jean created the Company of the Star in 1352, intending the [[chivalric order]] to outshine that of his rival, [[Edward III]] of England, who had shortly before created the [[Order of the Garter]]. Charny was promptly made a member of the Company of the Star, and it is believed that he wrote his ''Book of Chivalry'' in this context.  However, the Company began to lose members immediately due to losses on the battlefield, both in [[civil wars]] and against the English.  In 1356, Jean II was captured during the [[Battle of Poitiers]], leading to the complete breakdown of the order. It was in this same [[battle]] that Charny, along with many other French knights, died exemplifying the chivalric ethos that he described in his [[treatise]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaeuper, Richard and Elspeth Kennedy.  ''The "Book of Chivalry" of Geoffroi de Charny: Text, Context, and Translation''.  Philadelphia:  University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996. P. 3–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==

Charny’s book is unique in its focus. Unlike earlier works such as [[Vegetius]]' ''De Re Militari'', or later ones such as [[Christine de Pizan|Christine de Pizan's]] ''The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry'', Charny’s ''Book of Chivalry'' is not intended as a manual for how to conduct [[military]] operations. He approaches his subject from a [[concept]]ual basis, explaining the qualities associated with worthy knights. Moreover, although he does touch upon issues of [[courtliness]], he is more preoccupied with the maintenance of knightly hardiness and war-readiness. For Charny, the essence of knighthood is prowess, and all of his various [[theme (narrative)|themes]] solidify the importance of this concept.&lt;ref&gt;Kaeuper, Richard.  Introduction to ''A Knight's Own Book of Chivalry'' by Geoffroi de Charny.  Translated by Elspeth Kennedy.  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of worthiness===

Charny is unwilling to dismiss even slight displays of chivalry, but does insist on prioritizing deeds of arms. The worthiness of these deeds is assessed by the degree of [[risk|danger]], [[pain]], and [[suffering]] that they entail. Thus, Charny begins his work by describing feats performed in [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and [[jousts]], staged conflicts that could still be quite violent.  Charny notes “Indeed they are worthy of praise; nevertheless, he who does more is of greater worth.”&lt;ref&gt;Charny, Geoffroi de.  ''A Knight's Own Book of Chivalry''.  Translated by Elspeth Kennedy.  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005.  P. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  (This is a [[refrain]] repeated in various formats throughout the book.)  Charny follows this section by describing feats done in real [[war]], then arguing that the added danger gives such feats more intrinsic worth. A similar theme emerges throughout the book: those feats that involve less danger or are performed for shallow reasons are still chivalrous and worthy of honor, but deeds involving great peril and done for pure motives bring a knight greater glory and renown.

===Responsibilities of rulers and great men===

Charny is intensely concerned that the most powerful members of [[society]] set a positive example for the lower orders, and especially for young knights.  After acknowledging that knights of higher social standing—the “valiant [[lord]]s” of society—may receive greater renown than worthier poor knights, he defends this feature of chivalry by explaining that it is because a noble lord can patronize, inspire, and cultivate other knights in the ways of [[courage|valor]]. Nevertheless, Charny emphasizes that such lords have greater demands upon their [[behavior|deportment]] because their fame ensures that any scandal associated with their names will produce more notoriety than with a lesser-known knight. Thus, the great lords in particular must be temperate in their eating habits, avoid [[gambling]] and greed, indulge only in honorable pastimes such as jousting and maintaining the company of ladies, keep any [[romance (love)|romantic]] liaisons secret, and—most importantly—only be found in the company of worthy men.&lt;ref&gt;Charny 2005, p. 61-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

If Charny emphasizes the high moral standard expected of “great men,” his ideal [[monarch]] has an even higher caliber of [[morality]] to attain. In a section full of repetitive [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelisms]], Charny argues that the [[ancestors]] of contemporary rulers were chosen from among the people, not for a life of ease and corruption, but for service, nobility, and [[piety]].&lt;ref&gt;Charny 2005, p. 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chivalric reform===

Charny's advice for rulers and great men is one facet of a wider push for knightly [[reform]]. In particular, Charny criticizes what he sees as the growth in [[laziness|indolence]] and love of luxury. Many of his passages warn against the [[atrophy]]ing power of a pleasurable lifestyle, as well as the spiritual and physical advantages of a more spartan regime. Thus, he advises that knights be temperate in their eating habits, seek hard lodgings rather than soft beds at night, and most importantly, avoid luxurious cloths. In fact, he spends a lengthy section mocking at nobles who all but bared their private parts by wearing tight leggings under tunics that did not fully cover the offending areas. This “shameful” dress is exacerbated in Charny's view by an excessive love of jewels and fine cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Charny 2005, p. 68-70, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of women===

Although he shows a lack of interest when it comes to [[courtly love]], Charny does not entirely ignore the role of [[women]], analyzing their effect upon and reception of knightly conduct. One of the primary roles he assigns to [[ladies]] is the ability to inspire great feats of arm in the knights who have pledged themselves to their love. Charny is convinced that such great ladies share the chivalric values of their men. Thus, a lady will feel pride when her lover is showered with praise and honor by his peers, but shame if he has not performed any great deeds. In fact, Charny argues that a noble lady should abandon any lover who fails in prowess, and that the unfortunate knight has no cause to resent this treatment, since it is his own fault. Lastly, Charny emphasizes that women have no recourse to chivalry in order to achieve [[honor]], arguing the necessity for them to adorn themselves with the jewels and fine clothes so inappropriate for men. Only by dressing beautifully and behaving gracefully can women achieve social respect comparable to that of a chivalrous knight.&lt;ref&gt;Charny 2005, p.52-53, 66-68, 103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knighting ceremony===

Charny's treatise also contains one of the most detailed and straightforward descriptions of a [[accolade|dubbing]] ceremony. The day before the ceremony, a knight should make his [[confession (religion)|confession]], followed by a long bath and a short repose in a bed of clean white sheets. Afterward, he is to be dressed by other knights: new, clean white linens, followed by a red [[tunic]], black hose, white belt, and a red [[cloak]]. The knight will keep [[vigil]] until the following morning, when he hears [[mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and receives [[Eucharist|Communion]]. He then receives two gilded spurs and a double-edged [[sword]]. Finally, the knights in charge of dubbing him receive him with a kiss and a ''collee'' (a light blow).&lt;ref&gt;Charny 2005, p. 91-93.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these stages are imbued with religious symbolism, adding a [[Christianity|Christianizing]] layer to an essentially secular ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Maurice.  ''Chivalry''  New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaeuper, Richard W. ''Chivalry and Violence in Medieval Europe''.  Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orders of society===

Charny also considers the role of knighthood within the larger context of society, discussing three other “orders” in Christendom: the order of [[marriage]], [[monastic orders]], and the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]]. In discussing both the order of marriage and the monastic world, Charny follows his traditional formula of good-better-best when describing the relative worthiness of those entering into each state.  It is good for a man to enter either order late in life, bad for him to enter the order in his middle years, but ideal for him to enter into it as a youth, since those who do so are more likely to be sincere in their commitment. One’s motives for entering each state also affect the worthiness of the calling.&lt;ref&gt;Charny 2005, p.93-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The order of priesthood Charny holds in rather higher esteem than the first two, claiming that those entering this order must learn its service in detail in their youth so that they can perform it faithfully.  This office is so noble that priests should be entirely exempt from other offices.&lt;ref&gt;Charny 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knightly virtue and salvation===

Despite praising other orders of society, Charny considers knighthood to be the greatest of these orders. Drawing upon medieval [[ascetical theology|ascetic]] ideals, Charny presents the life of the knight as a sort of [[passion (Christianity)|passion]] of suffering and danger. He claims that the trials associated with the knight’s lifestyle outshine even the harshest [[penances]] imposed upon [[monks]], thus making it of greater spiritual worth. Moreover, the knight’s life is full of peril and the possibility of dying any time, any place. Thus, Charny concludes his book by pointing out that awareness of their own [[death|mortality]] forced knights, more than any other sector of society, to be prepared at any moment to meet their Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Charny 2005, p. 95-103, 105-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Inspiration Awards''' (BIAs) are a set of industry awards celebrating achievement in the [[creative industries]] of the United Kingdom, organised by David Yarnton, the UK managing director for [[Nintendo]]. The inaugural awards took place at a ceremony in London on 23 April 2010. The awards, in the shape of a gold statue of [[Boudica]], were presented in a number of categories including art, design, entertainment, fashion and science. All proceeds of the awards are to be donated to various charities.

==History==
With the UK in a recession in the late 2000s, and with a steadily declining manufacturing industry and little natural resources, the creative sector was believed to be the basis for future growth, and was as of 2010 was estimated to already contribute £110billion to the economy per annum, contribute two million jobs, and number over businesses classed as creative.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt;

The BIAs were initiated by David Yarnton, the UK managing director for [[Nintendo]].&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt; He was of the opinion that "The UK is the creative capital of the World" and it was "about time that the UK creative sector was recognised for its achievements".&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt; He was of the belief that, although a world leader in the creative industries, Britain had a tendency to understate its achievements, and thus sought to correct that.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt; The BIAs were therefore created to recognise those who have already contributed to Great Britain's "economic, social and artistic development through creative endeavor", and highlight the opportunities Britain offered in the creative industries.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BIAHome/&gt;

On the eve of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]] campaign, on 16 March 2010 the BIAs attracted the support of the Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], Conservative Party leader [[David Cameron]] and Liberal Democrat Party leader [[Nick Clegg]].&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewStatesman8Apr2010/&gt; The inaugural BIAs were to be presented in a daytime ceremony at The Brewery near [[Barbican Centre]] in London on 23 April 2010 ([[St George's Day]]).&lt;ref name=BIAEvent/&gt; The nominees in each category were announced on 14 April 2010.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010PrintEdition/&gt;

Attendees of the ceremony, hosted by [[Richard Madeley]], included nominees David Arnold, Michael Eavis and Gareth Pugh, as well as [[Phillip Schofield]], [[Ant and Dec]], [[Helen Skelton]] and [[Andy Akinwolere]].&lt;ref name=AttendeesWireImages/&gt;

==The Award==
The BIA is given "In recognition of an individual, company or groups contribution to the Creative Economy of Great Britain and the Inspiration that they give to others".&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; Individual awards are to be presented in categories for the Film; Television; Music; Fashion; Arts; Design; Innovation, Enterprise and Industry; Science and Technology; and Interactive Entertainment industry sectors, as well as a Special Recognition award.&lt;ref name=BIACategories/&gt;

The BIAs use the symbol of [[Boudica]] as their logo and award. Described by the BIA organisers as a "forward looking woman who inspired others around her",&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; Boudica was a queen of the ancient tribe of the [[Iceni]] of present-day [[Norfolk]], who in AD 60 or 61 led them and neighbouring tribes in a revolt against the authority of [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], the [[Governors of Roman Britain|Roman Governor of Britain]], before ultimately being defeated.

The award itself is a gold statue of the stylised version of Boudica depicted in the BIA logo.&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; The logo shows this stylistic representation of Boudica moving forward using four shades of colour, symbolising England, [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] "moving forward together as one."&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt;

'''Campana reliefs''' (also '''Campana tiles''') are [[Ancient Roman art|Ancient Roman]] [[terracotta]] [[relief]]s made from the middle of the first century BC until the first half of the second century AD. They are named after the Italian collector [[Giampietro Campana]], who first published these reliefs (1842).

The reliefs were used as [[frieze]]s at the top of a wall below the roof, and in other exterior locations, such as ridge tiles and [[antefix]]es, but also as decoration of interiors, typically with a number of sections forming a horizontal frieze. They were produced in unknown quantities of copies from moulds and served as decoration for temples as well as public and private buildings, as cheaper imitations of carved stone friezes. They originated in the terracotta tiled roofs of the [[Etruscan temple]]s. A wide variety of motifs from mythology and religion featured on the reliefs as well as images of everyday Roman life, landscapes and ornamental themes. Originally they were painted in colour, of which only traces of this occasionally remain. They were mainly produced in the region of [[Latium]] around the city of [[Rome]], and their use was also largely limited to this area. Five distinct types were produced. Today examples are found in almost all major museums of [[Roman art]] worldwide.

== History of research ==
With intensified excavation in the [[Mediterranean]] in the nineteenth century, terracotta reliefs increasingly came to light in and around Rome, from which original architectural contexts were determined. Metal and marble objects had previously been the most sought by excavators, scholars and collectors, but at this time artefacts in other materials received wider interest, beginning with the late-18th century appreciation of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] which when they first appeared were thought to represent [[Etruscan pottery]].

[[File:Giampietro Campana.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of Giampietro Campana (c.1857/58)]]
The first collector to make the tiles items of interest was marchese Giampietro Campana. His influence and contemporary reputation in archaeology  was so great that he was named an honorary member of the [[German Archaeological Institute|Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica]]. He published his collection in 1842 in ''Antiche opere in plastica'' ("Ancient works in plastic arts"), in which his findings on the reliefs were first laid out in a scholarly fashion. Thus the tiles became known as ''Campana reliefs''. Afterwards Campana was sentenced to imprisonment for embezzlement: in 1858 he lost his honorary membership in the ''Istituto di corrispondenza archeologica'' and his collection was pawned and sold. The terracotta reliefs owned by him are now in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]], the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] and [[Hermitage Museum|the Hermitage]] in [[St Petersburg]].

Other collectors, such as [[August Kestner]], also collected the reliefs and fragments of them in greater numbers. Today examples are found in most larger collections of Roman archaeological finds, though the majority of the reliefs are in Italian museums and collections.

[[File:Campana collection in 1851.jpg|thumb|View of the display of Campana's collection in the second edition of his ''Antiche opere in plastica'' (1851). The "Campana reliefs" are on long sequences on the walls.]]
Despite Campana's research, for a long time the reliefs were rather neglected. They were viewed as handicrafts, thus inherently inferior, and not art, like marble sculptures. The idea that they should be treated as important sources for the craftwork of the period, for decorative fashions, and for their [[iconography]] only achieved prominence in the early years of the twentieth century. In 1911 [[Hermann von Rohden]] and [[Hermann Winnefeld]] published ''Architektonische Römische Tonreliefs der Kaiserzeit'' ("Roman Architectural Clay Reliefs of the Imperial Period") with a volume of images in [[Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz]]'s series ''Die antiken Terrakotten''. This was the first attempt to organise and classify the reliefs according to the emerging principles of [[Art history]]. The two authors first distinguished the main types, discussed their use and considered their development, style, and iconography. The book remains fundamental. Thereafter, apart from the publication of new finds, interest flagged for more than fifty years. In 1968 [[Adolf Heinrich Borbein]]'s [[thesis]] ''Campanareliefs. Typologische und Stilkritische Untersuchungen'' ("Campana Reliefs: Typological and Stylistic Investigations") brought these archaeological finds to wider attention. In his work, Borbein was able to establish the development of the Campana reliefs from their origins among Etruscan-Italiote terracotta tiles. He also dealt with the use of motifs and templates derived from other media and pointed out that the artisans thereby produced creative new works.

Since Borbein's publication, researchers have mainly devoted themselves to chronological aspects or the preparation of catalogues of material from recent excavations and publications of old collections. In 1999 Marion Rauch produced an iconographic study ''Bacchische Themen und Nilbilder auf Campanareliefs'' ("Bacchic Themes and Nile Images in Campana Reliefs") and in 2006 Kristine Bøggild Johannsen described the usage contexts of the tiles in [[Roman villa]]s on the basis of recent archaeological finds. She showed that the reliefs were among the most common decorations of Roman villas from the middle of the first century BC until the beginning of the second century AD, both in the country houses of the nobility and in the essentially agricultural ''[[Villa rustica|villae rusticae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;On the history of scholarship on the Campana reliefs, see: Anne Viola Siebert: ''Geschichte(n) in Ton. Römische Architekturterrakotten''. Schnell + Steiner, Regensburg 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-7954-2579-1}} (Museum Kestnerianum&amp;nbsp;16), p.&amp;nbsp;19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material, technique, production, and painting ==
The quality of the ceramic product depended principally on the quality and processing of the clay. Particular importance attached to the tempering, when the clay (of uniform consistency) had various additives mixed in: sand, chopped straw, crushed brick, or even volcanic  [[pozzolan]]. These additives minimised the contraction of the tile as it dried so that it retained its shape and did not develop cracks. These additives can be recognised as little red, brown, or black flecks, especially noticeable when crushed brick is used. Through the investigation of closed collections in the archaeological collection of [[Heidelberg University]]&lt;ref&gt;Rita Perry: ''Die Campanareliefs''. von Zabern, Mainz 1997, {{ISBN|3-8053-1827-8}} (Katalog der Sammlung antiker Kleinkunst des Archäologischen Instituts der Universität Heidelberg, Band&amp;nbsp;4), p.&amp;nbsp;52–53&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum August Kestner]] in [[Hannover]]&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt; gradations in the fineness of the structure were determined.

[[File:Hannoveraner Campanrelief 1338 bemalt.jpg|thumb|Satyrs harvesting grapes on a ridge tile in the Museum August Kestner, Hannover: Coloured reconstruction]]
&lt;div class="tright" style="clear:none"&gt;[[File:Hannoveraner Campanrelief 1338.jpg|thumb|Satyrs harvesting grapes on a ridge tile in the Museum August Kestner, Hannover: Original]]&lt;/div&gt;
The tiles were not individually made as unique artworks but as series. From an original relief (the punch) a mould in the shape of a negative was produced. Then the moist clay was pressed into these moulds. Probably the image and the framing decoration were formed separately, since framing decoration is seen which has been applied to various designs. After they had dried, the tiles were removed from the mould and possibly lightly reworked. Then they were fired. After firing and cooling, the terracotta was painted,&lt;ref&gt;On the painting, see  von Rohden and Winnefeld 1911, p.&amp;nbsp;26–29&lt;/ref&gt; though sometimes the paint was applied before firing. Usually the reliefs received a coating, which acted as a surface for painting. This could be white paint or grey-yellow paint in [[Augustus|Augustan times]] but it could also be [[stucco]]. 
 
At present, no canonical, prescribed use of colours can be detected, except that at least from Augustan times the background was usually in light blue regardless of the scenes and motifs, but it could include two or more other colours as well. The colour of human skin was usually in something between dark red and hot pink. In [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] scenes, skin could also be painted a reddy-brown. In Augustan times light yellow was not unusual for skin. At Hannover, violet-brown, reddy brown, purple, red, yellow, yellow-brown, turquoise-green, dark bown, pink, blue, black, and white can all be identified.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the paint is lost in almost all cases and only residual traces can be recognised.

== Distribution and dating ==
[[File:Satyr Campana plaque Louvre Cp3894.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Relief with Dionysiac imagery: an ecstatic [[satyr]] ([[Louvre Museum]])]]
Nearly all Campana reliefs are from Central Italy, especially [[Latium]]. The largest and most important workshops seem to have been in Latium, especially in the neighbourhood of the city of Rome. Outside Latium the tiles are found mostly in [[Campania]] and in the former [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] sphere. At the end of the 1990s Marion Rauch compiled the reliefs with [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]]-[[Bacchus|Bacchic]] themes and was able to confirm this range for the motifs she was investigating. [[Nile]] scenes&lt;ref&gt;The most famous example of this genre is the [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina]].&lt;/ref&gt; are found only in Latium. No pieces have been found in the [[Magna Graecia|Greek areas of southern Italy]] or in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Rauch 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;202, 269&lt;/ref&gt; An example from the [[Akademisches Kunstmuseum]] in [[Bonn]], showing a [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] killing a bull was allegedly found in [[Hagia Triada|Agia Triada]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Inventory # D 205; [[Harald Mielsch]]: ''Römische Architekturterrakotten und Wandmalereien im Akademischen Kunstmuseum Bonn''. Mann, Berlin 1971, {{ISBN|3-7861-2195-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;Nr.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Some stuccoed examples derive from the western part of the Roman empire, the ancient regions of [[Hispania]] and [[Gaul]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[France]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rauch 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Campana reliefs were made in the middle of the first century BC, during the final period of the [[Roman Republic]], and they were most common in the first quarter of the first century AD. At this time, the reliefs experienced not only their greatest extent but also their greatest variety of motifs. The final reliefs derive from about two hundred years later - production and use stopped in the time of [[Hadrian]]. While this general dating is largely viewed as secure, the exact date of the individual pieces can rarely be given. A relative chronology might be determined on the basis of comparison of motifs and styles. Iconographic research is unhelpful for this purpose because the motifs derive from a traditional repertoire, which was used largely without variation over a long period of time. Motifs from daily life are more helpful, however, since some of them depict datable building work such as the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Capitoline Temple]], which was built in AD 82 and is depicted on a relief from the [[Louvre Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;Inventory number 3839&lt;/ref&gt; providing a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' for that tile.

[[File:Curetes.png|thumb|Sketch of a relief with the [[Korybantes|Curetes]] dancing around baby Zeus in [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|Roscher's]] ''[[Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie]]'']]
A better aid to dating is the quality of the clay. Over time their consistency became coarser, looser, more granular, and also lighter. The ornamental trimmings of the tiles are also useful: because they were the same for whole series of motifs, so one can reconstruct their relationships in the workshops and suggest contemporaneity. Very common motifs like the [[Ionian order|Ionian]] [[cymatium]] and [[palmette]]s are of only limited use, because these were used by a wide variety of workshops, even at the same time. Finally, sixe comparisons can also help with dating. Moulds were not only made from the original punch, but also often from tiles themselves. This leads to a natural "shrinkage" of the new tiles' dimensions. Because the moulds were sometimes reused for long periods of time, there are sometimes noticeable changes in the size of the tiles. For the motif depicting the [[Korybantes|Curetes]] performing a weapon dance around the baby Zeus, the moulds can be traced over a period of 170 years. In the process, the tiles lost about 40% of their size as a result of the repeated reuse of completed tiles as moulds. Therefore, in tiles which share a motif, the smaller can be identified as the younger. The motif also lost clarity through repeated remoulding.

Even when it is known exactly where a relief tile was found, there is no absolute certainty because to this day no tiles have been found in the place of their original use. Scholars largely agree that the tiles served decorative and practical functions, although it is uncertain exactly which part of the building they were placed on.&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Bøggild Johannsen, "Campanareliefs im Kontext. Ein Beitrag zur Neubewertung der Funktion und Bedeutung der Campanareliefs in römischen Villen," ''Facta'' 22 (2008), p.&amp;nbsp;15–38&lt;/ref&gt; Their origin in Etruscan-Italiote temple architecture is clear and certain, but it can nevertheless be assumed that temples were not the primary usage context at least in the tiles' later phases. On account of their consistently modest scale, the reliefs were more suitable for close viewing, which implies use on smaller buildings.  Whereas their Etruscan and Italiote precursors served to cover wooden temple roofs and protect them from weathering, the Campana reliefs seem to have been used far more in secular contexts. There they lost their protective functions and became wall decorations. For a time both forms of use were found side by side on temples, until finally the Campana reliefs lost their older use. On account of their fragility, the bricks must have been replaced often - it is suggested that this would have occurred once every twenty-five years or so. At first they were replaced with copies of the previous decorative tiles, but later newer motifs were substituted also. Increasingly from the first century stone temples replaced earlier buildings in wood, and Campana reliefs were only used in restorations.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;24–26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannoveraner Campanrelief 1339.jpg|thumb|Two [[griffin]]s facing each other from a [[Sima (architecture)|Sima]] in the Museum August Kestner, Hannover]]
[[File:Hannoveraner Campanrelief 1445.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antefix]] in the Museum August Kestner in Hannover: Front view of a [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]] with outstretched wings]]
Campana reliefs can be arranged on five bases: chronology, geography, iconography, shape and use.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt; The most productive system is classification based on the shape of the tile. The categories used are cladding tiles, ridge tiles, [[sima (architecture)|sima]] tiles, crowning tiles and [[antefix]]es.
* ''Cladding tiles'': On the upper border, where the tile forms a smooth edge, there was decoration with an [[egg and dart]] pattern and the lower border is decorated with [[Nelumbo nucifera|Lotus]], palmettes, and [[anthemion|anthemia]]. The lower edge follows the contour of the decorative pattern. There were three or four holes in each tile, through which tiles were tied to the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Sima'' and ''Crowning tiles'' belong together. They were connected by use of the [[Tongue and groove]] method. On top of the sima was a tongue which was inserted into the underside of the crowning tile. The sima joined the cladding tile with an egg and dart pattern, a smooth strip was left on the underside. Waterspouts could be incorporated into the sima. The crowning tiles usually feature ornamental, floral patterns. They were equipped with slots on the underside, into which the sima was inserted. Together, the two tile types found use as the eaves of the roof.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;24–25&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ridge tiles''' were decorated with the same reliefs as the cladding tiles. They were finished on the upper side by a palmette and anthemion pattern and shared their shape, but lacked holes. On the lower side they were equipped with slots like the crowning tiles. These tiles were intended for interior decoration, where they could form longer friezes.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Antefixes'' sat on or above the [[eave]]s, the lowest row of tiles and closed off the front opening. They were composed of two parts. The curved tile was placed over the bricks of the eave, while the front portion closed the roof cavity off with a vertical tile. These tiles can be decorated and were often painted.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

These terracotta tiles had parallels in their development with the marble decorative reliefs of the "neo-Attic form" of the Late Republic and Early Empire, though their dissimilar shapes were not necessarily mutually dependent. Both had their own unique types and themes. In production and presentation, the marble reliefs were single works, while the Campana reliefs were made in series and once place in a united frieze did not operate as a single work.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motifs ==
[[File:Hannoveraner Campanrelief 1443.jpg|thumb|upright|Remains of a waterspout of a [[Sima (architecture)|Sima]] in the Museum August Kestner in Hannover: mask with light damage]]
The Campana reliefs show great diversity in their motifs. However, the images can be grouped into four large categories:

* ''Mythological themes'': in turn divisible into three categories. Firstly, the [[Homeric epic]]s with the [[Trojan War]] and the events which followed (such as the [[Odyssey]]. Secondly, the deeds of [[hero]]es, especially [[Heracles]], but also [[Theseus]] and others. Thirdly, Dionysiac themes.
* ''Landscapes'', especially scenes of the [[Nile]]
* ''Daily life'': depictions of day-to-day Roman life as well as less frequent events like [[Roman triumph|Triumph]]s. They include depictions of the [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], the [[palaestra]], the [[circus]] and even prisoners.
* ''Ornamental images'' including not just completely ornamental designs, such as vines, but also [[Greek drama#Masks|masks]] and [[gorgon]] heads.

The [[Egypt]]ian elements in many tiles are of particular interest, such as the cladding tiles held in the British Museum&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=418512&amp;partid=1&amp;IdNum=1805%2c0703.316&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database%2fmuseum_no__provenance_search.aspx Fragment of terracotta Campana relief: imitation Hieroglyphs, Egyptian-style figure to left]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Museum August Kestner in Hannover, which include crude imitations of [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s - rarely encountered in Roman art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian E. Loeben]]: ''Ein außergewöhnlicher Typ. Ägyptisches auf einer Terrakottaplatte'' in Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;68–73&lt;/ref&gt; They are also of great interest for study of ancient buildings and art, such as the aforementioned Capitoline temple.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;74&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Christ between Four Angels and the Instruments of the Passion''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Vittore Carpaccio]], executed in 1496 and now housed in the Civici musei e gallerie di storia e arte of [[Udine]], northern [[Italy]].

The work was painted for the church of St. Peter Martyr of Udine. It was acquired by the Austrians after the Napoleonic Wars, and assigned to the Hofmuseum in [[Vienna]] in 1838. It was given back to Italy in 1919.

==Description==
The work is signed and dated ''VICTORIS CHARPATJO / VENETI OPVS / 1496'' on a [[cartouche]] attached to the basement. It is contemporary of Carpaccio's cycle of the [[Legend of Saint Ursula]] and shows some influences of  [[Giovanni Bellini]].

It depicts Christ standing on a double basement, keeping the Cross. Behind him is a [[damask]] cloth held by two angels and, at the sides, a landscape inspired to the [[Veneto|Venetian hills]]; the castle on the right is similar to that of Udine. In the foreground are four angels with the [[Instruments of the Passion]]: from the left, the [[Holy Lance]], the nails from the cross, the sticks of the [[Flagellation of Christ|Flagellation]] and the [[Holy Sponge]]. On the cross is the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the inscription  "INRI". Blood rays spring up from Christ's wounds, ending in the [[Holy Chalice]] and turning themselves into  the [[sacramental bread]].

The sacrifice of Christ is also alluded to by the deer which is being slaughtered by a leopard on the lawn on the right.

The '''Courtauld Institute of Art''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɔər|t|əʊ|l|d|}}), commonly referred to as '''The Courtauld''', is a self-governing college of the [[University of London]] specialising in the study of the [[history of art]] and [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]]. It is among the most prestigious institutions in the world for these disciplines and is widely known for the disproportionate number of directors of major museums drawn from its small body of alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaplin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Sociology and Visual Representation|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415073626|pages=53-56}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spect/&gt; 

The art collection of the Institute is known particularly for its [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings and is housed in the [[Courtauld Gallery]]. 

The Institute and the Gallery are both in [[Somerset House]], in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[London]].

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1932 through the philanthropic efforts of the industrialist and art collector [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], the diplomat and collector [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Lord Lee of Fareham]], and the art historian Sir [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Robert Witt]]. 

Originally the Courtauld Institute was based in [[Home House]], a [[Robert Adam]]-designed townhouse in London's [[Portman Square]].  The Strand block of Somerset House, designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] from 1775–1780, has housed the Courtauld Institute since 1989. The Courtauld celebrated its 75th anniversary during the 2007–08 academic year.

==Academic profile==
The Courtauld Institute of Art is the major centre for the study of the history and conservation of art and architecture in the United Kingdom. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate teaching to around 400 students each year.&lt;ref name=court2/&gt; Degrees are awarded by the University of London.

The Courtauld was ranked first in the United Kingdom for History and History of Art in ''[[The Guardian]]'' 's 2011 University Guide and was confirmed in this rank for research quality in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=ref/&gt; [[The Independent]] has called it "probably the most prestigious specialist college for the study of the history of art in the world."&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

The Courtauld was ranked, again, first in the United Kingdom for History and History of Art in ''[[The Guardian]]''’s 2017 University Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2016/may/23/university-league-tables-2017#S345|title=University University league tables 2017 – the full rankings|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

According to the 2014 [[Research Excellence Framework]], the Courtauld hosts the highest proportion of the UK's world-leading and internationally excellent research out of all higher education institutions with 95% of research rated in the top two categories (4*/3*), 56% of which was rated in the 4* category, tied for highest in the UK with [[London Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/dec/18/university-research-excellence-framework-2014-full-rankings|title=University Research Excellence Framework 2014 – the full rankings|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate study===
The only undergraduate course offered by the Courtauld is a BA in the History of Art. This is a full-time course designed to introduce students to all aspects of the study of western art.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Postgraduate study===

Several taught courses are offered at postgraduate level: [[master's degrees]] in history of art, [[curator|curating]] the [[art museum]], the history of [[Buddhist art]], and the [[conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of [[mural|wall painting]] are taught alongside diploma courses in the conservation of easel paintings and the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courtauld.ac.uk/study/postgraduate|title=Postgraduate Taught Courses|work= The Courtauld Institute of Art|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the history of art master's programme have to choose a specialisation ranging from antiquity to early modern to global contemporary artwork. Special options are taught in small class sizes of 5–10 students, allowing an optimal discussion between faculty members and students.

===Study resources===
The Courtauld has two photographic libraries which started as the private collections of two benefactors: the Conway Library, covering [[architecture (built environment)|architecture]], architectural drawings, sculpture and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, named after the [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Lord Conway of Allington]] and the Witt Library, after [[Robert Witt (art historian)|Sir Robert Witt]], covering paintings, drawings and [[engraving]]s and containing over two million reproductions of works by over 70,000 artists.&lt;ref name=court3/&gt; In 2009, it was decided that the Witt Library would not continue to add new material to the collection.&lt;ref name=artlyst/&gt; The book library is one of the UK's largest archives of art history books, periodicals and exhibition catalogues. There is a slide library which also covers films, and an IT suite.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

An online image collection provides access to more than 40,000 images, including paintings and drawings from the Courtauld Gallery, and over 35,000 photographs of architecture and sculpture from the Conway Library.&lt;ref name=artandarch/&gt; Two other websites and sell high resolution digital files to scholars, publishers and broadcasters, and photographic prints to a wide public audience.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;&lt;ref name=prints/&gt;

The Courtauld uses a [[virtual learning environment]] to deliver course material to its students.&lt;ref name=vle/&gt; Since 2004, the Courtauld has published an annual research journal, [[immediations]], edited by current members of the research student body. Each cover of the journal has been commissioned by a leading contemporary artist.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Courtauld Gallery==
{{main|Courtauld Gallery}}

The art collection of the Institute is housed in the Courtauld Gallery. The collection was begun by the founder of the Institute, [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], who presented an extensive collection of mainly [[Impressionism|French Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] paintings in 1932. It was enhanced by further gifts in the 1930s and a bequest in 1948, and has since received many significant donations and bequests. The Gallery contains some 530 paintings and over 26,000 drawings and prints.&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt;

The Courtauld Gallery is open to the public. Since 1989 it has been housed in the Strand block of Somerset House, which was the first home of the [[Royal Academy]], founded in 1768. In April 2013 the Head of the Courtauld Gallery was [[Ernst Vegelin]].

A '''dandy''', historically, is a man who places particular importance upon [[physical appearance]], refined language, and leisurely hobbies, pursued with the appearance of nonchalance in a cult of [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;"One who studies ostentatiously to dress fashionably and elegantly; a [[fop]], an exquisite." (''[[OED]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dude, n. U.S.A name given in ridicule to a man affecting an exaggerated fastidiousness in dress, speech, and deportment, and very particular about what is æsthetically 'good form'; hence, extended to an exquisite, a dandy, 'a swell'. | publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cult de soi-même'', [[Charles Baudelaire]], "Le Dandy", noted in Susann Schmid, "Byron and Wilde: The Dandy in the Public Sphere" in Julie Hibbard ''et al.'' , eds. ''The Importance of Reinventing Oscar: versions of Wilde during the last 100 years'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt; A dandy could be a self-made man who strove to imitate an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] lifestyle despite coming from a [[middle-class]] background, especially in late 18th- and early 19th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Previous manifestations of the ''petit-maître'' (French for "small master") and the [[Muscadin]] have been noted by John C. Prevost,&lt;ref&gt;''Le Dandysme en France (1817–1839)'' (Geneva and Paris) 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary 1790s, both in [[London]] and in [[Paris]]. The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist [[George Meredith]], himself no dandy, once defined [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] as "intellectual dandyism". Some took a more benign view; [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' that a dandy was no more than "a clothes-wearing man". [[Honoré de Balzac]] introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in ''[[La fille aux yeux d'or]]'' (1835), a part of ''[[La Comédie Humaine]]'', who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy.

[[Charles Baudelaire]] defined the dandy, in the later "metaphysical" phase of dandyism,&lt;ref&gt;See Prevost 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; as one who elevates [[æsthetics]] to a living religion,&lt;ref&gt;Baudelaire, in his essay about painter [[Constantin Guys]], "The Painter of Modern Life".&lt;/ref&gt; that the dandy's mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class: "Dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to [[stoicism]]" and "These beings have no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and thinking .... Dandyism is a form of Romanticism. Contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe, dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance. For the perfect dandy, these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind."

The linkage of clothing with political protest had become a particularly English characteristic during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Aileen Ribeiro, "On Englishness in dress" in ''The Englishness of English Dress'', Christopher Breward, Becky Conekin and Caroline Cox, ed., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Given these connotations, dandyism can be seen as a political protest against the levelling of [[egalitarian]] principles, often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre-industrial values, such as the ideals of "the perfect gentleman" or "the autonomous aristocrat". Paradoxically, the dandy required an audience, as Susann Schmid observed in examining the "successfully marketed lives" of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Lord Byron]], who exemplify the dandy's roles in the public sphere, both as writers and as ''personae'' providing sources of gossip and [[scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmid 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nigel Rodgers]] in ''The Dandy: Peacock or Enigma?'' questions Wilde's status as a genuine dandy, seeing him as someone who only assumed a dandified stance in passing, not a man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the word is uncertain. ''Eccentricity'', defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes, began to be applied generally to human behavior in the 1770s;&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro 2002:20, under the subheading "Eccentricity, Extremes, and Affectation".&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, the word ''dandy'' first appears in the late 18th century:  In the years immediately preceding the American Revolution, the first verse and chorus of "[[Yankee Doodle]]" derided the alleged poverty and rough manners of American-citizen colonists, suggesting that whereas a fine horse and gold-braided clothing ("[[Maccaroni (fashion)|mac[c]aroni]]") were required to set a dandy apart from those around him, the average American-citizen colonists means were so meager that ownership of a mere pony and a few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as a "dandy" by comparison to and/or in the minds of his even less sophisticated Eurasian compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/apr19.html#yankee "Yankee Doodle"]; [[Maccaroni (fashion)|Maccaroni]].&lt;/ref&gt; A slightly later [[Border ballad|Scottish border ballad]], circa 1780,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1989 | url=http://dictionary.oed.com |quote=dandy 1.a. One who studies above everything to dress elegantly and fashionably; a beau, fop, 'exquisite'.  c1780 Sc. Song (see [[Notes and Queries|N. &amp; Q.]] 8th Ser. IV. 81), I've heard my granny crack O' sixty twa years back When there were sic a stock of Dandies O; Oh they gaed to Kirk and Fair, Wi' their ribbons round their hair, And their stumpie drugget coats, quite the Dandy O.  | publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; also features the word, but probably without all the contextual aspects of its more recent meaning. The original, full form of 'dandy' may have been ''jack-a-dandy''.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[vogue word]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In that contemporary slang, a "dandy" was differentiated from a "[[fop]]" in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober than the fop's.

In the twenty-first century, the word ''dandy'' is a jocular, often sarcastic adjective meaning "fine" or "great"; when used in the form of a noun, it refers to a well-groomed and well-dressed man, but often to one who is also self-absorbed.

== Beau Brummell and early British dandyism ==
[[File:BrummellDighton1805.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Beau Brummell]] by [[Richard Dighton]] (1805).]]
The model dandy in British society was [[Beau Brummell|George Bryan "Beau" Brummell]] (1778–1840), in his early days, an undergraduate student at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] and later, an associate of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]].  Brummell was not from an aristocratic background; indeed, his greatness was "based on nothing at all," as [[Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly|J.A. Barbey d'Aurevilly]] observed in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Barbey d'Aurevilly, "Du dandisme et de George Brummell," (published 1845, collected in ''Oeuvres complètes'' 1925:87–92).&lt;/ref&gt; Never unpowdered or unperfumed, immaculately bathed and shaved, and dressed in a plain dark blue coat,&lt;ref&gt;"In Regency England, Brummel's fashionable simplicity constituted in fact a criticism of the exuberant French fashions of the eighteenth century" (Schmid 2002:83),&lt;/ref&gt; he was always perfectly brushed, perfectly fitted, showing much perfectly starched linen, all freshly laundered, and composed with an elaborately knotted [[cravat]]. From the mid-1790s, Beau Brummell was the early incarnation of "the celebrity", a man chiefly famous for ''being'' famous.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

By the time [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|taxed hair powder]] in 1795 to help pay for the war against France and to discourage the use of flour (which had recently increased in both rarity and price, owing to bad harvests) in such a frivolous product, Brummell had already abandoned wearing a wig, and had his hair cut in the Roman fashion, "à la Brutus". Moreover, he led the transition from [[breeches]] to snugly tailored dark "[[Trousers|pantaloons]]," which directly led to contemporary trousers, the sartorial mainstay of men's clothes in the Western world for the past two centuries. In 1799, upon coming of age, Beau Brummell inherited from his father a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, which he spent mostly on costume, gambling, and high living. In 1816 he suffered bankruptcy, the dandy's stereotyped fate; he fled his creditors to France, quietly dying in 1840, in a [[lunatic asylum]] in [[Caen]], just before age 62.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Men of more notable accomplishments than Beau Brummell also adopted the dandiacal pose: [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron]] occasionally dressed the part, helping reintroduce the frilled, lace-cuffed and lace-collared "[[poet shirt]]". In that spirit, he had his portrait painted in Albanian costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/byron-portrait|title=Portrait of Lord Byron in Albanian Dress, 1813|website=The British Library|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent dandy of the period was [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel d'Orsay]], the Count d'Orsay, who had been friends with Byron and who moved in the highest social circles of London.

In 1836 [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;A Dandy is a clothes-wearing Man, a Man whose trade, office and existence consists in the wearing of Clothes. Every faculty of his soul, spirit, purse, and person is heroically consecrated to this one object, the wearing of Clothes wisely and well: so that the others dress to live, he lives to dress ... And now, for all this perennial [[Martyrdom]], and Poesy, and even [[Prophecy]], what is it that the Dandy asks in return? Solely, we may say, that you would recognise his existence; would admit him to be a living object; or even failing this, a visual object, or thing that will reflect rays of light...&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Carlyle]], "The Dandiacal Body", in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the mid-19th century, the English dandy, within the muted palette of male fashion, exhibited minute refinements—"The quality of the fine woollen cloth, the slope of a pocket flap or coat revers, exactly the right colour for the gloves, the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes, and so on. It was an image of a well-dressed man who, while taking infinite pains about his appearance, affected indifference to it. This refined dandyism continued to be regarded as an essential strand of male Englishness."&lt;ref&gt;Ribeira 2002:21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dandyism in France ==
[[File:Murat2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Joachim Murat]], the French [[King of Naples]], was dubbed the "Dandy King" because of his highly groomed appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZbjtGC48-8C&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247 |title=10,000 Famous Freemasons from K to Z |publisher=Books.google.com |date=30 September 2004 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The beginnings of dandyism in France were bound to the politics of the [[French revolution]]; the initial stage of dandyism, the [[jeunesse dorée|gilded youth]], was a political statement of dressing in an aristocratic style in order to distinguish its members from the [[sans-culottes]].

During his heyday, [[Beau Brummell]]'s ''dictat'' on both fashion and etiquette reigned supreme. His habits of dress and fashion were much imitated, especially in France, where, in a curious development, they became the rage, especially in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] quarters. There, dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms: self-created men of consciously designed personality, radically breaking with past traditions. With elaborate dress and idle, [[decadence|decadent]] styles of life, French bohemian dandies sought to convey [[contempt]] for and superiority to bourgeois society. In the latter 19th century, this fancy-dress bohemianism was a major influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in French literature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

[[Baudelaire]] was deeply interested in dandyism, and memorably wrote that a dandy aspirant must have "no profession other than elegance... no other status, but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons... The dandy must aspire to be sublime without interruption; he must live and sleep before a mirror." Other French intellectuals also were interested in the dandies strolling the streets and [[boulevard]]s of Paris. [[Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly]] wrote ''[[On Dandyism and George Brummell]]'', an essay devoted, in great measure, to examining the career of Beau Brummell.&lt;ref name=Walden&gt;[[George Walden]], ''Who's a Dandy? – Dandyism and Beau Brummell'', Gibson Square, London, 2002. {{ISBN|1903933188}}.

== Later dandyism ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Montesquiou, Robert de - Boldini.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert de Montesquiou]] (1855–1921) portrait by [[Giovanni Boldini]]]]
The literary dandy is a familiar figure in the writings, and sometimes the self-presentation, of [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Saki|H.H. Munro]] (Clovis and Reginald), [[P.G. Wodehouse]] ([[Bertie Wooster]]) and [[Ronald Firbank]], writers linked by their subversive air.

The poets [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Walter Pater]], the American artist [[James McNeill Whistler]], the Spanish artist [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], and [[Max Beerbohm]] were dandies of the [[Belle Époque]], as was [[Robert de Montesquiou]] — [[Marcel Proust]]'s inspiration for the Baron de Charlus. In Italy, [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and [[Carlo Bugatti]] exemplified the artistic bohemian dandyism of the [[fin de siecle]]. Wilde wrote that, "One should either be a work of Art, or wear a work of Art."

At the end of the 19th century, American dandies were called [[dude]]s. [[Evander Berry Wall]] was nicknamed the "King of the Dudes".

[[George Walden]], in the essay ''Who's a Dandy?'', identifies [[Noël Coward]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Quentin Crisp]] as modern dandies.&lt;ref name=Walden/&gt; The character [[Psmith]] in the novels of [[P. G. Wodehouse]] is considered a dandy, both physically and intellectually. Agatha Christie's Poirot is said to be a dandy.

The artist [[Sebastian Horsley]] described himself as a "dandy in the underworld" in his [[eponymous]] autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200610160054 Beautiful and damned], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 16 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, dandyism became a [[Lolita Fashion#Ōji (Boystyle)|fashion subculture]] during the late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In Spain during the early 19th century a curious phenomenon developed linked to the idea of dandyism. While in England and France individuals from the middle classes adopted aristocratic manners, the Spanish aristocracy adopted the fashions of the lower classes, called [[majos]]. They were characterized by their elaborate outfits and sense of style as opposed to the modern Frenchified "[[afrancesados]]", as for their cheeky arrogant attitude.
Some famous dandies in later times were amongst other the [[Duke of Osuna]], Mariano Tellez-Girón, artist [[Salvador Dalí]] and poet [[Luis Cernuda|Luís Cernuda]].

== Later thought ==
[[Albert Camus]] said in ''[[The Rebel (book)|L'Homme révolté]]'' (1951) that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The dandy creates his own unity by aesthetic means. But it is an aesthetic of negation. "To live and die before a mirror": that according to Baudelaire, was the dandy's slogan. It is indeed a coherent slogan. The dandy is, by occupation, always in opposition. He can only exist by defiance. Up to now, man derived his coherence from the Creator. But from the moment that he consecrates his rupture from Him, he finds himself delivered over to the fleeting moment, to the passing days, and to wasted sensibility. Therefore he must take himself in hand. The dandy rallies his forces and creates a unity for himself by the very violence of his refusal. Profligate, like all people without a rule of life, he is only coherent as an actor. But an actor implies a public; the dandy can only play a part by setting himself up in opposition. He can only be sure of his own existence by finding it in the expression of others' faces. Other people are his mirror. A mirror that quickly becomes clouded, it's true, since human capacity for attention is limited. It must be ceaselessly stimulated, spurred on by provocation. The dandy, therefore, is always compelled to astonish. Singularity is his vocation, excess his way to perfection. Perpetually incomplete, always on the fringe of things, he compels others to create him, while denying their values. He plays at life because he is unable to live it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Albert|last=Camus|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt]]|date=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307827838|page=51|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_3yQrhdxwUC&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=11 October 2014|chapter=II Metaphysical Rebellion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jean Baudrillard]] said that dandyism is "an aesthetic form of nihilism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-xviii-on-nihilism/ |title=Jean Baudrillard – Simulacra and Simulations – XVIII. On Nihilism |publisher=Egs.edu |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419220351/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/simulacra-and-simulations-xviii-on-nihilism/ |archivedate=19 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlos Espartaco said about the Argentinian philosopher and poet Eduardo Sanguinetti:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Only the dandy, last heir of the stoic tentative, has imposed himself in the world of appearance as a thing and has evaded fashion in the name of a "mode" that would be inseparable of him. Actually, it is necessary to summon the void in itself, to conqueror the cool way that qualifies the dandy, which is "thousand of kilometers farther from immediate sensations". And for Eduardo Sanguinetti this means, in terms of the multiple strategics he will use in the passages from "anti-fashion" to "look" a radical self-emptying that emancipates from time, but that does not reject the effort that has to do to register the emerging novelty. Obtaining this space resembles a landscape, where, in accordance with Baudelaire "carries Hercules upon his shoulders".&lt;ref&gt;Espartaco Carlos 1989 "Eduardo Sanguinetti: The Experience of Limits" pag.98, 99 (Ediciones de Arte Gaglianone, first published 1989) {{ISBN|950-9004-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER--&gt;

== Quaintrelle ==
[[File:Dandizette.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1819 Dandizette]]
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2008}}
The female counterpart is a quaintrelle, a woman who emphasizes a life of passion expressed through personal style, leisurely pastimes, charm, and cultivation of life's pleasures.

In the 12th century, ''cointerrels'' (male) and ''cointrelles'' (female) emerged, based upon ''coint'',&lt;ref&gt;Old English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; a word applied to things skilfully made, later indicating a person of beautiful dress and refined speech.  By the 18th century, ''coint'' became ''quaint'',&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Early English&lt;/ref&gt; indicating elegant speech and beauty.  Middle English dictionaries note ''quaintrelle'' as a beautifully dressed woman (or overly dressed), but do not include the favorable personality elements of grace and charm.  The notion of a quaintrelle sharing the major philosophical components of refinement with dandies is a modern development that returns quaintrelles to their historic roots.

Female dandies did overlap with male dandies for a brief period during the early 19th century when ''dandy'' had a derisive definition of "fop" or "over-the-top fellow"; the female equivalents were ''dandyess'' or ''dandizette''.  Charles Dickens, in ''All the Year Around'' (1869) comments, "The dandies and dandizettes of 1819–1820 must have been a strange race. ''Dandizette'' was a term applied to feminine devotees to dress and their absurdities were fully equal to those of the dandy." In 1819, the novel ''Charms of Dandyism'' was published "by Olivia Moreland, chief of the female dandies"; although probably written by Thomas Ashe, "Olivia Moreland" may have existed, as Ashe did write several novels about living persons. Throughout the novel, dandyism is associated with "living in style".  Later, as the word ''dandy'' evolved to denote refinement, it became applied solely to men.  ''Popular Culture and Performance in the Victorian City'' (2003) notes this evolution in the latter 19th century: "...or ''dandizette'', although the term was increasingly reserved for men."

Its title translates as '''''On Democracy in America''''', but English translations are usually simply entitled '''''Democracy in America'''''. In the book, Tocqueville examines the democratic revolution that he believed had been occurring over the previous several hundred years.

In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville and [[Gustave de Beaumont]] were sent by the French government to study the American [[prison]] system.  In his later letters Tocqueville indicates that he and Beaumont used their official business as a pretext to study American society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johri|first=Vikram|title='Alexis de Tocqueville': the first French critic of the US|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0410/p15s01-bogn.html|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They arrived in [[New York City]] in May of that year and spent nine months traveling the United States, studying the prisons, and collecting information on American society, including its religious, political, and economic character. The two also briefly visited Canada, spending a few days in the summer of 1831 in what was then [[Lower Canada]] (modern-day [[Quebec]]) and [[Upper Canada]] (modern-day [[Ontario]]).

After they returned to France in February 1832, Tocqueville and Beaumont submitted their report, ''Du système pénitentiaire aux États-Unis et de son application en France'', in 1833. When the first edition was published, Beaumont, sympathetic to social justice, was working on another book, ''Marie, ou, L'esclavage aux Etats-Unis'' (two volumes, 1835), a social critique and novel describing the separation of races in a moral society and the conditions of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]].  Before finishing ''Democracy in America'', Tocqueville believed that Beaumont's study of the United States would prove more comprehensive and penetrating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tocqueville|first=Alexis de|title=Democracy in America|year=2000|work=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-80532-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
He begins his book by describing the change in social conditions taking place. He observed that over the previous seven hundred years the social and economic conditions of men had become more equal.  The [[aristocracy]], Tocqueville believed, was gradually disappearing as the modern world experienced the beneficial effects of equality.  Tocqueville traced the development of equality to a number of factors, such as granting all men permission to enter the [[clergy]], widespread economic opportunity resulting from the growth of trade and commerce, the royal sale of titles of nobility as a monarchical fundraising tool, and the abolition of [[primogeniture]].&lt;ref name="Tocqueville 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tocqueville|first=Alexis de|title=Democracy in America|year=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-80532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tocqueville described this revolution as a "providential fact"&lt;ref name="Tocqueville 2000"/&gt; of an "irresistible revolution," leading some to criticize the [[determinism]] found in the book.  However, based on Tocqueville's correspondences with friends and colleagues, Marvin Zetterbaum, Professor Emeritus at [[University of California Davis]], concludes that the Frenchman never accepted democracy as determined or inevitable.  He did, however, consider equality more just and therefore found himself among its partisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zetterbaum|first=Marvin|title=Tocqueville and the problem of democracy|year=1967|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the social state that was emerging, Tocqueville believed that a "new political science" would be needed, in order to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]nstruct democracy, if possible to reanimate its beliefs, to purify its motives, to regulate its movements, to substitute little by little the science of affairs for its inexperience, and knowledge of its true instincts for its blind instincts; to adapt its government to time and place; to modify it according to circumstances and men: such is the first duty imposed on those who direct society in our day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tocqueville|first=Alexis de|title=Democracy in America|year=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-80532-8|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The remainder of the book can be interpreted as an attempt to accomplish this goal, thereby giving advice to those people who would experience this change in social states.

==Main themes==
{{Prose|section|date=September 2011}}

===The Puritan Founding===
Tocqueville begins his study of the U.S. by explaining the contribution of the [[Puritans]].  According to him, the Puritans established the U.S. democratic social state of equality. They arrived equals in education and were all middle class.  In addition, Tocqueville observes that they contributed a synthesis of religion and political liberty in America that was uncommon in Europe, particularly in France. He calls the Puritan Founding the "seed" of his entire work.

===The Federal Constitution===
Tocqueville believed that the Puritans established the principle of sovereignty of the people in the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]].  The [[American Revolution]] then popularized this principle, followed by the [[Constitutional Convention of 1787]], which developed institutions to manage popular will. While Tocqueville speaks highly of the U.S. Constitution, he believes that the mores, or "habits of mind" of the U.S. people play a more prominent role in the protection of freedom. These include:

* Township democracy
* Mores, laws, and circumstances
* [[Tyranny of the majority]]
* Religion and beliefs
* The family
* Individualism
* Associations
* Self-interest rightly understood
* Materialism

===Situation of women===
Tocqueville was one of the first social critics to examine the situation of U.S. women and to identify the concept of [[Separate Spheres]].&lt;ref name="kerber1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kerber |first1= Linda K. |last2= |first2= |year= 1988 |title= Separate Spheres, Female Worlds, Woman's Place: The Rhetoric of Women's History |journal= The Journal of American History |volume= 75 |issue= 1 |pages= 9–39|publisher= University of North Carolina Press|doi= 10.2307/1889653|url= |accessdate= }} Full text available [http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/separate_spheres.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; The section ''Influence of Democracy on Manners Properly So Called'' of the second volume is devoted to his observations of women's status in U.S. society. He writes: "In no country has such constant care been taken as in America to trace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes and to make them keep pace one with the other, but in two pathways that are always different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |authorlink1= Alexis de Tocqueville |title= Democracy in America|year= 1840 |publisher= Saunders and Otley |location= London | chapter = Chapter XII: How the Americans understand the Equality of the sexes | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPSjMel_-kC&amp;pg=PA101 |page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that the collapse of [[aristocracy]] lessened the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] rule in the family where fathers would control daughters' marriages, meaning that women had the option of remaining unmarried and retaining a higher degree of independence. Married women, by contrast, lost all independence "in the bonds of matrimony" as "in America paternal discipline [by the woman's father] is very relaxed and the conjugal tie very strict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |authorlink1= |title= Democracy in America|year= 1840 |publisher= Saunders and Otley |location= London | chapter = Chapter X: The young Woman in the Character of a Wife | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPSjMel_-kC&amp;pg=PA79 |pages= 79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his own view that a woman could not act on a level equal to a man, he saw a woman as needing her father's support to retain independence in marriage.  Consistent with this limited view of the potential of women to act as equals to men, as well as his apparently missing on his travels seeing the nurturing roles that many men in the United States played, particularly in the [[Delaware Valley]] region of cultures where there was a lot of influence by [[Society of Friends]] as well as a tradition of male and female equality, Tocqueville considered the separate spheres of women and men a positive development, stating:&lt;ref name="kerber1988"/&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for myself, I do not hesitate to avow that although the women of the United States are confined within the narrow circle of domestic life, and their situation is in some respects one of extreme dependence, I have nowhere seen women occupying a loftier position; and if I were asked, ... to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of that people ought mainly to be attributed, I should reply,—to the superiority of their women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |authorlink1= |title= Democracy in America|year= 1840 |publisher= Saunders and Otley |location= London | chapter = Chapter XII: How the Americans understand the Equality of the sexes | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPSjMel_-kC&amp;pg=PA106 |page= 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Summary==
The primary focus of ''Democracy in America'' is an analysis of why [[republic]]an [[representative democracy]] has succeeded in the United States while failing in so many other places. Tocqueville seeks to apply the functional aspects of democracy in the United States to what he sees as the failings of democracy in his native France.&lt;ref&gt;L. Jaume, ''Tocqueville'', Fayard 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Tocqueville speculates on the future of democracy in the United States, discussing possible threats ''to'' democracy and possible dangers ''of'' democracy.  These include his belief that democracy has a tendency to degenerate into "[[soft despotism]]" as well as the risk of developing a [[tyranny of the majority]].  He observes that the strong role religion played in the United States was due to its [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation]] from the government, a separation all parties found agreeable. He contrasts this to France where there was what he perceived to be an unhealthy antagonism between democrats and the religious, which he relates to the connection between church and state. 
Tocqueville also outlines the possible excesses of passion for equality among men, foreshadowing the totalitarian states of the twentieth century.

Insightful analysis of [[political society]] was supplemented in the second volume by description of [[Civil society#Modern history|civil society]] as a sphere of private and civilian affairs mirroring [[Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Tocqueville observed that social mechanisms have paradoxes, as in what later became known as the [[Tocqueville effect]]: "social frustration increases as social conditions improve".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swedberg |first=Richard |date=2009 |title=Tocqueville's Political Economy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnzS-8X0UeQC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=tocqueville+effect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4DQN9PHB2c&amp;sig=bQz1-LAuwDEIPUtAJtr8IghTv1s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KHiIVaDPHMvoywOJ3Y3wAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tocqueville%20effect&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=260 |isbn=9781400830084}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that this growing hatred of social privilege, as social conditions improve, leads to the state concentrating more power to itself.

Tocqueville's views on the United States took a darker turn after 1840, however, as made evident in Aurelian Craiutu's ''Tocqueville on America after 1840: Letters and Other Writings''.

==Impact==
''Democracy in America'' was published in two volumes, the first in 1835 and the other in 1840. It was immediately popular in both Europe and the United States, while also having a profound impact on the French population. By the twentieth century, it had become a classic work of [[political science]], [[social science]], and [[history]]. It is a commonly assigned reading for [[undergraduate]]s of American universities [[academic major|majoring]] in the political or social sciences, and part of the introductory political theory syllabus at Cambridge, Oxford, Princeton and other institutions.  In the introduction to his translation of the book, Harvard Professor [[Harvey Mansfield|Harvey C. Mansfield]] calls it "at once the best book ever written on democracy and the best book ever written on America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tocqueville|first=Alexis de|title=Democracy in America|year=2000|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-80532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tocqueville's work is often acclaimed for making a number of astute predictions. He anticipates the potential acrimony over the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of [[slavery]] that would tear apart the United States and lead to the [[American Civil War]] as well as the eventual [[superpower]] rivalry between the United States and Russia, which exploded after [[World War II]] and spawned the [[Cold War]].

Noting the rise of the industrial sector in the American economy, Tocqueville, some scholars have argued, also correctly predicted that an industrial aristocracy would rise from the ownership of labor. He warned that ' ... friends of democracy must keep an anxious eye peeled in this direction at all times', observing that the route of industry was the gate by which a newfound wealthy class might potentially dominate, although he himself believed that an industrial aristocracy would differ from the formal aristocracy of the past.

On the other hand, Tocqueville proved shortsighted in noting that a democracy's equality of conditions stifles literary development. In spending several chapters lamenting the state of the arts in America, he fails to envision the literary Renaissance that would shortly arrive in the form of such major writers as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[Walt Whitman]]. Equally, in dismissing the country's interest in science as limited to pedestrian applications for streamlining the production of material goods, he failed to imagine America's burgeoning appetite for pure scientific research and discovery.

According to Tocqueville, democracy had some unfavorable consequences: the tyranny of the majority over thought, a preoccupation with material goods, and isolated individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4662">[[File:Giorgio ghisi, mantova, scudo da parata, 1554, 01.JPG|thumb|The Ghisi Shield, Waddesdon Bequest, British Museum, London]]

The '''Ghisi Shield''' is a piece of [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] [[parade armour]] made by the Italian goldsmith and engraver [[Giorgio Ghisi]], signed and dated 1554.  It is part of the [[Waddesdon Bequest]], held by the [[British Museum]] in London since 1898.

The shield is made from a single plate of hammered steel, with its rim turned over a wire.  The decoration on the outer face is [[damascening|damascened]] in gold and partially plated with silver.  It is {{convert|55.8|cm}} in diameter, {{convert|7|cm}} deep, and weighs {{convert|3.8|kg}}.  An inscription on the front of the shield reads, "GEORGIVS DE GHISYS MNTVANZ FA M.D.LIIII".  

Ghisi was an artisan from [[Mantua]], but he was in the Netherlands from about 1550 to about 1555, and the shield was probably made in [[Antwerp]], then under the rule of the [[Habsburg]]s.  It is one of only two surviving pieces of damascened metalwork known to have been made by Ghisi. (The other item is a damaged sword hilt, dated 1570, and now in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in Budapest.)

The intricately decorated shield, damascened with gold and silver, was intended for display, not for use in battle.  It is [[Repoussé and chasing|embossed]] with [[repoussé]] and [[chased]] work in [[high relief]], with a framed central circular scene of battling horseman, surrounded by four [[strapwork]] cartouches containing [[allegory|allegorical]] female figures ([[Victory]], Fame, [[Courage|Fortitude]], [[Prudence]]).  The frames around the five main scenes themselves incorporate detailed images on a much smaller scale, taken from the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ancient mythology, inlaid in gold.  Further imagery of birds, foliage, [[putti]], [[satyr]]s and other figures, fills the field between the frames.

The shield may have been designed by a Netherlandish artist, not Ghisi himself: other shields made in the Netherlands in the late 16th century have survived with similar decoration, but none of them demonstrate the accomplished decorative skills of Ghisi.  For example, an iron shield held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna has similar strapwork and embossed imagery with scenes of [[Jason and the Golden Fleece]]; and a similar gilded shield or [[rondache]] at the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in St Petersburg has four allegorical figures (Prudence, Fortitude, Fame, [[Envy]]) arranged in circular cartouches around a circular image of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].   

The Ghisi Shield was sold for £1,000 at the Allègre sale in Paris in 1863, and then sold in the sale of the [[Demidov Collection]] in Paris in 1870, shortly before the death of [[Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato]], for 1,600,000 francs (about £6,400).  It was bought at the Demidov sale by Baron [[Anselm von Rothschild]], and later inherited by his son Baron [[Ferdinand de Rothschild]], who left it to the [[British Museum]] after his death in 1898 as part of the [[Waddesdon Bequest]].

==Production==
In December 2014, director [[Thulasidas]] announced that he would make a bilingual Malayalam and Tamil horror thriller titled ''Girls'' featuring actress [[Iniya]] in the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiaglitz.com/thulasidas-is-back-with-a-horror-film-malayalam-news-121667.html&lt;/ref&gt; Initially titled ''Ini Varum Naatkal'' in Tamil, seven more actresses, [[Anusree]], [[Aparna Nair]], Archana, [[Muktha (actress)|Muktha Bhanu]], [[Subiksha]] and Seetha Lekshmi were signed in January 2015 to play other roles, with the shoot beginning thereafter in Wagomon.&lt;ref name="indiatimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Aparna-Nair-will-feature-in-ThulasidasGirls/articleshow/45704579.cms|publisher=The Times of India|title=Aparna Nair will feature in Thulasidas’Girls&amp;nbsp;— Times of India|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cinespot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cinespot.net/2015/01/girls-a-new-horror-thriller-by-thulasidas/|publisher=news.cinespot.net|title=Girls, a new Horror thriller by Thulasidas: &amp;#124; cinespot.net|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the film progressed, some actresses dropped out and were replaced by actresses including Reshma, Sabitha, [[Sajitha Madathil]] and [[Neena Kurup]], while [[Nadhiya]] also joined in late 2015 to play a significant character.&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/thulasidas-easier-to-handle-100-male-actors-over-10-female-actors-but-nadia-an-exception/1/518146.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The Times of India gave the Tamil version of the film a negative review, citing "the pre-release buzz around ''Thiraikku Varaadha Kadhai'' has mostly centred around a lesbian angle in the film, but that proves to be counter-productive", adding that "the film is also irresponsible in a way because it furthers the negative stereotyping of LGBTs as persons with low moral values and murderers".&lt;ref name="indiatimes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie-reviews/Thiraikku-Varaadha-Kadhai/movie-review/55109022.cms|publisher=The Times of India|title=Thiraikku Varaadha Kadhai Movie Review, Trailer, &amp;amp; Show timings at Times of India|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, The New Indian Express stated "it was a knot that had the potential to turn into a riveting thriller, but it’s opportunity lost here".&lt;ref name="newindianexpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/review/2016/oct/29/thiraikku-varaadha-kadhai-review-a-frayed-knot-of-a-thriller-1532795.html|publisher=newindianexpress.com|title=Thiraikku Varaadha Kadhai review: A frayed knot of a thriller- The New Indian Express|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Malayalam version garnered similar reviews, with a reviewer noting "Thulasidas is a veteran who has directed around 25 films as well as some long running popular serials. So he is not short on experience but his latest bi-lingual offering, ''Girls'', seems an amateurish attempt by someone in the initial days of his directing career".&lt;ref name="deccanchronicle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/mollywood/061116/movie-review-girls-all-women-mishmash.html|publisher=deccanchronicle.com|title=Movie review 'Girls': All-women mishmash|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdesteFidelesLilyPhil.png|thumb|350px|[[Homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Lilypond-screenshot-adeste.mid|Play}}]]

A '''hymn tune''' is the [[melody]] of a [[musical composition]] to which a [[hymn]] text is sung. Musically speaking, a hymn is generally understood to have [[four-part harmony|four-part (or more) harmony]], a fast [[harmonic rhythm]] (chords change frequently), and no [[refrain]] or chorus.

From the late sixteenth century in England and Scotland, when most people were not musically literate and learned melodies [[Rote learning|by rote]], it was a common practice to sing a new text to a hymn tune the singers already knew which had a suitable [[meter (hymn)|meter]] and character.

There are many hymn tunes which might fit a particular hymn:  a hymn in [[Long Metre]] might be sung to any hymn tune in Long Metre, but the tunes might be as different as those tunes that have been used for centuries with hymns such as ''[[Te lucis ante terminum]]'', on one hand, and an arrangement of the [[Calypso music|calypso]] tune used with ''[[Jamaica Farewell]]'', on the other.

==Hymnal editors==

Editors bring extensive knowledge of [[theology]], [[poetry]], and [[music]] to the process of compiling a new hymnal.   They seek texts that are capable of communicating complex theological concepts to lay people, and they strive to partner those texts to tunes which are singable by the non-professional [[musician]]s of a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]].  "Ideally, a hymn is set out in clear, unambiguous language.  Although it deals with profound thoughts, a hymn states them so simply and directly that 'he who runs may read' and understand.  Simplicity, which is the servant of clarity, is the first characteristic of hymnic expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When editors choose a text for the planned collection, it may already be paired to a [[Melody|tune]] that supports its meaning, catches its spirit, and allows for congregational participation.  This pairing may be used elsewhere, even ecumenically recognized, appearing in many other hymnals.  However, if a hymn has been linked to a tune the editors think is not the best partner for it, they can arrange a new pairing.  Partnerships of texts and tunes can give special attention to the interpretive opportunities in a text by providing artistic support of the message through its musical setting.  Editors must consider whether the important words in the text fall on [[Stress (music)|stressed notes]], whether climax points in the ideas correspond with musical climaxes, and whether the [[tempo]] for the music matches the style of the text.

==Pairing texts to tunes ==

Often the author of a text has not composed a setting of that text or otherwise paired the text to a particular tune.  It then becomes the editor's challenge to complement that text with a tune for [[publication]].  Where the [[Meter (hymn)|meter]] of a text is regular, editors can choose an existing tune of the meter that fits the text.  Often there is more than just one good possible partner available.  The editors may marry a text "X" to a tune they feel is best, with which it appears on the hymnal page, and they may also suggest singing text "X" to an alternative tune that appears elsewhere in the hymnal (sometimes with a different text).  If one refers to the hymnal's [[metrical index]], more possible tunes may be found, of the same meter, which might be used for singing text "X".

In ''The Anatomy of Hymnody'', Austin C. Lovelace explores the relevance of the meter to a text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Lovelace
 | first = Austin C.
 | title = The Anatomy of Hymnody

 | year = 1965
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A meter of few [[syllable]]s, perhaps with a [[trochaic]] stress pattern, fits best an exhortive or forceful declamation of ideas.  A stirring, motivating text will fit this meter well.  Using a more lyrical meter suggests a more expansive or introspective treatment of ideas.  An author may have superb ideas but may have chosen a meter which exhorts when it should be expansive, or is solid when it should be [[Introspection|introspective]].  In such cases the editor is challenged to achieve an overall fit which doesn't distract from the message of the text.

Editorial skills are evident in the complex credits of some hymns.  For the well-loved and great hymn, "[[All Creatures of Our God and King]]", the words were written by [[William Henry Draper (hymnwriter)|William H. Draper]] and first published in 1919, based on a 13th-century text by [[Francis of Assisi]], with further adaptations made in 1987.  It is wedded to the tune ''[[Lasst uns erfreuen]]'',  first printed in the ''Geistliches Kirchengesangbuch'', dated 1623, and is presented with a harmonization by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], dated 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some texts become associated with several tunes.  For different reasons, some tunes set numerous texts. Tunes which are very singable and easy for a [[local church|congregation]] to pick up, and do not have musical demands which would interfere with understanding and assimilating the ideas of a text, can be used to set two or three texts in a hymnal, when the editors see that as advantageous.  ''Wareham'' LM, melody William Knapp (1698–1768), alt., harm. ''Hymns Ancient and Modern'', 1875, after [[James Turle]] (1802–1882), sets three texts in ''Hymnal 1982''.  It has supported more than 20 texts in various hymnals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
The practice of naming hymn tunes developed to help identify a particular tune.  The name was chosen by the compiler of the tune book or hymnal or by the composer. The majority of names have a connection with the composer and many are place names. Most [[hymnals]] provide a hymn tune index by name (alphabetical) and a hymn tune index by meter.

In some instances a particular text and tune have an almost exclusive partnership with each other, such as [[Reginald Heber]]'s text "[[Holy, Holy, Holy|Holy, Holy, Holy!]]" and [[John Bacchus Dykes]]'s tune ''Nicaea''.  In other instances a text may be used with a variety of tunes, such as "[[O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing]]" sung to any of ''Lyngham'', ''Oxford New'', ''Arden'', ''Lydia'', ''Richmond'', ''Azmon'', or ''University''.  In yet other instances a tune may partner several texts, such as ''Dix'' for "[[As with Gladness Men of Old]]", "[[Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies]]", "[[God of Mercy, God of Grace]]",  "[[Lord, to You Immortal Praise]]", and "[[For the Beauty of the Earth]]".

By contrast, in Germany and Scandinavia, tune names were not typically used even when a hymn tune was used for more than one text. The custom in such cases was to use part of the first line of the first text with which the tune was associated as a name for the tune: for example ''Lasst Uns Erfreuen'' ("Let us rejoice" / [[All Creatures of Our God and King]]), ''Gelobt Sei Gott'' ("[May] God be praised" / [[Gelobt sei Gott im höchsten Thron|Good Christian men, rejoice and sing]]) and ''Was lebet, was schwebet'' ([[O Worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness]]). Renaming of tunes occurs from time to time, when a tune is chosen to be printed in a hymnal. When chorales were introduced in England during the eighteenth century, these tunes were sometimes given English-style tune names.

The Ravenscroft Psalter of 1621 was the first English book which specified, by name, which tune should set each text.  This followed the procedure used for the first time in the 1616 Scottish Psalter. In this early time of defining [[Hymns and hymn tunes|text/tune marriages]], editors of different psalters were apt to use different names for the same tune.  For example, ''The French Tune'', in the Scottish Psalter (1564), was the same tune as ''Dundee'' in the Ravenscroft Psalter.&lt;ref name="routley1980"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common practice nowadays is for the composer of  a tune to name it.

==Performance==

Typically, worship services in churches and synagogues include hymns which are sung by the congregation, accompanied by organ, or piano, and/or sometimes by guitars or other instruments. Details of performance vary depending on the designated style of the service, or by the hymns themselves. Some hymns specify unison singing, and other hymns are sung in parts (usually soprano, alto, tenor, bass). It is common practice for a congregation to sing all the hymns in unison, but in some traditions part singing is encouraged.

Sometimes, especially on longer texts, variety in the performance is introduced.  Varied performance practices may include:

* varied [[Harmony|harmonization]] for a stanza
* [[descant]] added by sopranos, above the melody
* "[[Fauxbourdon]]" with the melody sung by tenors, and the harmonies sung by the other parts
* a [[modulation]] (usually for the last stanza) into the next higher key

Other possibilities for varied performance can be invited through explanation either in the service bulletin or through verbal instruction by the pastor or the minister of music. Combining some or all of these and can add interest to singing while enhancing the sense of the text.  For example:

* a stanza sung only by the choir
* a stanza sung only by the congregation
* a stanza sung only by men
* a stanza sung only by women
* a stanza sung only by the left half of the sanctuary
* a stanza sung only by the right half of the sanctuary, etc.

Some hymn tunes lend themselves to being sung in canon.

==History==

===Origins===
The [[Book of Psalms]] has sometimes been called the first hymn book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladden|first=Washington|title=Who Wrote the Bible?|year=2007|publisher=Echo Library|isbn=978-1-4068-6208-9|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Binder|first1=Abraham Wolf|last2=Heskes|first2=Irene|title=Studies in Jewish music: collected writings of A.W. Binder|year=1971|publisher=Bloch Publishing Co.|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delitzsch|first=Franz|title=Biblical commentary on the Psalms, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFktAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1871|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some psalms are headed with instructions relating to their musical performance, music to which they were "married," even though no music is included with the texts. [[Psalter]]s contained [[Metrical psalter|metrical versifications of the psalms]]. Using a regular meter, authors would translate the psalms into the vernacular, and create versions which could be set to music for the people to sing.

[[St. Paul]] encourages Christians to "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord" ({{bibleverse|Col.|3:16|KJV}}), "[s]peaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord." ({{bibleverse|Eph.|5:19|KJV}}). In 313 AD, the [[Emperor Constantine]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]], which "... gave the Christians the right to practice religion openly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | page=548
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time the language of the people was Latin. Use of Latin continued in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] long after it ceased to be the vernacular. By the time of [[Martin Luther]] in the early 16th century, the singing was still in Latin but was done by choirs of priests and monks, although the choirs sometimes included a few lay musicians as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hymnals evolved from psalters, in that hymns are songs for the congregation and choir to sing, but go beyond metrical recasting of only psalm texts. In early hymnals, only texts were printed. By the mid 18th century, hymnal editors began marrying particular tunes, by name, to individual texts. A century later, in the 1861 (first) edition of the English ''[[Hymns Ancient and Modern]]'', for the first time, the music was printed with its text on the hymnal page. Many marriages from that book became and remain ecumenically endorsed, including those where a tune was composed and appeared in print for the first time in that 1861 edition. [[Reginald Heber|Heber]]'s text, "[[Holy, Holy, Holy]]" had first appeared in ''Selection of Psalms and Hymns for the Parish Church of Banbury'', 3rd edition, 1826. ''Nicaea'' (1861) was written by [[J. B. Dykes]] to set it "for the first edition of ''Hymns A &amp; M''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===The Reformation===

As part of his efforts at reform, after Martin Luther prepared a version of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in Latin, he prepared [[Deutsche Messe|a version in German]], adapting parts of the liturgical texts of the Mass as [[chorale]]s in the vernacular which could be sung and understood by the congregation. Luther arranged the music for some of these by adapting the music of existing [[plainsong]] melodies; he set other texts to newly composed tunes composed by others, or by himself. An example of the latter is the tune he composed for his German paraphrase of [[Psalm 46]], "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" ("[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]"). [[Nicholas Temperley]] wrote in ''The Hymn Tune Index'' that Luther "wished his congregations to take part in the singing, but
in general they failed to do so" and "It was the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], or 'Reformed', branches of Protestantism
that succeeded in establishing congregation hymn singing in worship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Luther (1483–1546) posted his theses against Roman Church practices, particularly "indulgences", in 1517, which signalled the start of the Reformation, "...but six or seven years passed after the inception of his Reformation before he gave his thought to hymns.... Luther wished to refine the worship of the Church by excluding what he thought were needless complications while retaining, through the use of music, the essential spirit of Christian devotion as enshrined in the church's tradition.... The year 1524 saw the first official Luther hymnals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Luther wanted the congregation to participate in singing, with German texts sung to tunes straightforward enough for ordinary people to sing. "Luther himself wrote many new religious texts to be used with well-known German folk songs. ''Vom Himmel hoch'' is one of these."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Luther was a gifted and well-trained musician. He composed and found hymn tunes which were accessible for ordinary people to sing, and "... at the same time he encouraged church choirs to continue the tradition of polyphonic motets within the Lutheran Mass. He used various textures and styles of music in ways which were most appropriate and effective for each."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Luther also adapted the music of existing plainsong melodies as hymn tunes. Families enjoyed singing hymns in parts in their homes, for the family's enjoyment and edification, but unison singing was the custom in church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Reformed Church and the (French) [[Genevan Psalter]] were the result of work by [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564). His profound reverence for the biblical text "...caused him to insist that public praise in church should be confined to the language of the Bible, adapted to the minimum extent required for congregational singing. He was "... the architect of the tradition of metrical psalmody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | page=28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Calvin heard Lutheran hymn singing while he served Minister of the Reformed Church of Strasbourg (1538–41). In fact, Routley says, "[M]etrical psalmody was really born [in Strasbourg] rather than in Geneva."&lt;ref name="routleyp29"&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | page=29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Clement Marot (c. 1497–1544) was a French Court poet in Strassbourg, who had begun setting psalms in metrical versions before Calvin met him. Although Marot remained a Catholic, Calvin included Marot's psalm versions in the Psalter. The first Genevan Psalter, 1542, contained six psalms by Calvin and 30 by Marot.&lt;ref name="routleyp29"/&gt;
The Genevan Psalter of 1562 contained all 150 psalms, and included the works of Calvin's successor, Theodore de Beza (1509–1565).

Calvin did not approve of free religious texts (hymns) for use in church; the Bible was the only source of texts he approved ([[exclusive psalmody]]). Calvin endorsed only singing of metrical psalm texts, only in unison, only ''a cappella'', with no harmonization and no accompanying instruments of any kind. Tunes for the metrical psalm versions came from several men, including Louis Bourgeois (c. 1501 – c. 1561), and Claude Goudemil (c. 1525–1572). There were 110 different meters used for the texts in Calvin's Psalter, and 125 different tunes to set them. The music was very difficult; the long tunes were hard for ordinary people to grasp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | at=Section 5, The Psalmody of Calvin's Geneva
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But later adaptations (and simplifications) of these tunes have added to current day hymn tunes repertoire.

===English hymnody===
The earliest English [[psalter]]s included a few tunes in regular meters, which could be used to sing all the psalms in the psalter. Which tune was sung was determined by the fit of the meter. The ''[[Ravenscroft Psalter]]'' of 1621 was the first English book which "married," specified by name, which tune should set each text.&lt;ref name="routley1980"/&gt;
In that early time of defining text/tune marriages, editors of different psalters sometimes used different names for the same tune. For example, ''The French Tune'', in the ''[[Scottish Psalter]]'' (1564), is the same tune as ''Dundee'' in the ''Ravenscroft Psalter''.

Routley states that metrical psalmody was actually the first English Protestant hymnody. [[English Reformation|England's Reformation]] began when King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] separated the English church from the Catholic Church in Rome in 1532. King Henry's heir was King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], who ascended to the throne in 1547. Thomas Sternhold (d. 1549), Groom of the Royal Wardrobe at the end of Henry VIII's reign and during Edward VI's, "...began metricizing psalms for the edification of the young new king (ten years old when he came to the throne in 1547: sixteen when he died in 1553)." Sternhold's work paralleled Marot's efforts in the French Court; Sternhold's "...strong puritan strain moved him to replace with sacred songs the trivial secular music that was the Court's normal entertainment; this led him to versify certain Psalms in the ballad metre that would enable them to be sung to tunes already known." (''Forest Green'', ''Kingsfold'', etc.). The ballad meter, "which Sternhold used very nearly without variation," had 4 iambic lines of 14 syllables, which breaks down to 8686 8686 (our Double Common Meter DCM or CMD). Also, a simpler "half length" tune evolved, now described as common meter (CM = 8686). The English aimed at a Psalter of all 150 psalms, virtually all in ballad meter. Sternhold started the task, writing a total of 37 by the time he died, when John Hopkins took over the work. .... In the year of [Sternhold's] death, a little book without music containing 44 psalms was published, of which 36 were by Sternhold and eight by his collaborator John Hopkins (d. 1570).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | page=35
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress on the Psalter was interrupted when King Edward died in 1553, and his elder half sister [[Mary I of England|Mary]] ("Bloody Mary") became queen. She tried to reinstate Catholicism as the State religion. Churchmen whose lives were threatened fled to the Continent, some ending up in Geneva, where they encountered the 1551 Genevan Psalter and the congregational singing which it supported. When Elizabeth I ascended the throne after her sister's death in 1558, the exiled churchmen returned to England, bringing them an Anglo-Genevan Psalter containing all the psalms plus a few tunes to set them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | pages=36–37
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with their desire to add congregational singing to church services. At that point work continued with the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter, adding psalms to it from the Anglo-Genevan Psalter. The Complete Psalter was published in 1562 by John Daye. "It is at this point important to remember that all these versions of the Psalter, up to and including 1562, were published for private use. There was not, by 1562, strictly a 'Church of England' that could authorize the use of it in church." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Routley
 | title=The Music of Christian Hymns
 | page=38
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The question of "authorization" of the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter for use in church services is discussed at length in John Julian's ''Dictionary of Hymnology''; actually, the psalter was used in church whether it was ever officially authorized or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Later developments===

Books did not print the music with hymns in hymnals, until the middle 19th century. Tunes were printed separately in tune books. Some of those printed in America in the 19th century (for example, Lowell Mason's, or George Root's) use four staff systems. The tune name, but no composer credit, appears above each tune. The melody of the tune appears in the tenor (fauxbourdon), often with the first stanza words, printed above the tenor staff.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

During the decade 1791–1800, more than 8,000 hymn tunes were printed in [[Great Britain]] and between 7,000 and 8,000 were printed in the United States; during the decade 1801–1810, about 11,000 hymn tunes were printed in Great Britain, while more than 15,000 were printed in the United States. The total number of hymn tunes published with English-language texts in publications from 1535 up to and including 1820 is recorded as 159,123.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Many early hymnals were published in editions which contained only texts. The early [[Methodism|Methodist movement]] provides an example. The co-founders, [[John Wesley]] and his brother [[Charles Wesley]], published several text-only collections, culminating in ''A Collection of Hymns, for the Use of the People Called Methodists'', in 1780. John Wesley published [[tune book]]s separately, culminating in ''Sacred Harmony'', in 1780. In 1786, with the fifth edition of the text-only ''Collection,'' Wesley indicated at the head of each hymn the tune to which he intended it to be sung. Among the tunes in ''Sacred Harmony'' that are still in use are ''Derby'', ''Helmsley'', and ''Savannah''. Accompanists to hymn singing had a tune book, a volume which a collection of tunes, most without words, the exception being the occasional lyric when underlay of words to the music was ambiguous. An example of this was ''The Bristol Tune Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Alfred|year=1891|title=The Bristol Tune Book|edition=Third|location=London, UK, New York, NY|publisher=Novello, Ewer &amp; Co.|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more people became musically literate, it became more common to print the melody, or both melody and harmony in hymnals. Contemporary practice in the U.S. and Canada is to print hymn tunes so that lyrics underlie the music; the more common practice in the UK is to print the hymn tunes on one page, and the hymn text either below, or on facing pages.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Among twentieth-century developments was the publishing of ''The [[English Hymnal]]'' in 1906 under the music editorship of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. More recently, ethnic hymns and tunes have been included, descants have been added for some hymns, freer song-like styles have been accepted, and accompaniments by guitar and/or other instruments have been notated.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">The '''ikob - Museum of Contemporary Art''', founded in 1993 by Francis Feidler (director of the ikob until December 2012), is a museum of contemporary art in the German-speaking city of [[Eupen]] in [[Belgium]], nearby the German and Dutch borders.Its program focuses on emerging and leading contemporary art through the constitution of a significant collection – in progress – and temporary exhibitions – in Dialog. Thus, functioning as a discursive platform for contemporary art with a multidisciplinary and thematic exhibition program, concerned with critical and socio-political issues, the ikob attempts to reflect the matter of frontier.

Since January 2013, the ikob - Museum of Contemporary Art is directed by Dr. Maïté Vissault. 

==Exhibitions and collection==
The IKOB's sculpture exhibitions "Concept 93" (1993) and especially "Full Barns" (1997)  gained international attention because, the former [[Documenta]] organizer [[Manfred Schneckenburger]]  committed known European artists, such as [[Tony Cragg]], [[Wolfgang Nestler]], [[Maik and Dirk Löbbert]] or [[Marie Jo Lafontaine]] .

Since 2000, the IKOB organizes an international programme of exhibitions in new galleries and adding to its own collection.

==Arts funding==
The IKOB Art Award is awarded every three years to young artists since 2005. The jury, chaired by [[Jan Hoet]], selected the German artist Stefanie Klingemann as the first winner. The award is endowed with 5,000 €.

The following artists were nominated for the IKOB Art Award 2011: [[Tatjana Gerhard]], [[Brigitte Reisz]], [[Vera Hilger]], [[Judith Krebbekx]], [[Kati Heck]]. An international jury selected [[Kati Heck]] as the winner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">'''Ideal town''' was a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] concept developed by Italian [[polymath]] [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404{{ndash}}1472), author of ten books of treatises on modern architecture  titled ''De Re Aedificatoria'' written about 1450 with additions made until the time of his death in 1472. Alberti's architectural theories concerned the planning and building of an entire town as opposed to individual [[edifice]]s for private patrons or ecclesiastical purposes. 
[[File:Braun and Hogenberg Zamość.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zamość]] in the 17th century]]
Alberti insisted on choosing the location of the town first, followed by careful setting up of the size and direction of streets, then location of bridges and gates, and finally a building pattern ruled by perfect symmetry.&lt;ref name="Blunt"&gt;Anthony Blunt, [http://www.nehawu.org.za/images/18023,%20Anthony%20Blunt,%20Alberti,%201959,%20and%20Spinoza.pdf  From "Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450‐1660".

NEHAWU Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more prominent examples of a town modelled on this theory was [[Zamość]] founded in the 16th century by the chancellor [[Jan Zamoyski]].

{{quote|The ideal town was seen as a utopia to be achieved by disregarding the reasonably regular planimetrics of real, historic towns for standards – geometric, aesthetic or otherwise – of ideal perfection. Therefore the debate about ideal towns has become isolated from the debate about real, historic towns. In fact, there has often been the temptation to superimpose and identify this debate with one about utopia and those town models often linked to the utopian concept. &lt;ref name="Educativo"&gt;[http://win.liceogalilei.org/deure/Comenius/Intro-CdRomEng.html  European Educational Project: ''What city for man.''] Progetto Educativo Europeo

[[File:Johann Lucas Kracker - St. Francis of Solano Baptizing Indians - WGA12268.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Francis Solanus|Saint Francis of Solano]] Baptizing the Indians (1770); in the Bishopric Seminary, Eger]]
'''Johann Lucas Kracker''', also '''Jan Lukáš Kracker''' or '''János Lukács Kracker''' (3 March 1717, [[Vienna]] - 1 December 1779, [[Eger]]) was an Austrian-Czech painter of the late [[Baroque art|Baroque]] period. His work consisted mostly of ceiling or wall [[fresco]]es and altarpieces.

== Life ==
His family originally came from [[Bohemia]] and his father, Josef Kracker (1683–1733), was a sculptor. He received his first training with Anton Hertzog (1692–1740) and continued at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] after 1738, where his teachers included [[Paul Troger]] and [[Michelangelo Unterberger]].&lt;ref name="N"&gt;{{NDB|12|632|632|Kracker, Johann Lucas|Klára Garas|122638417}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first frescoes, created for the Schlosskirche St. Martin ([[Graz]]) in 1742, have not survived.

Initially, he was employed at a workshop in [[Brno]], later becoming independent and working throughout [[Moravia]], briefly settling in [[Znojmo]], where he got married. He then moved on to [[Upper Hungary]] in 1754, where he worked in [[Šaštín-Stráže|Šaštín]] and [[Prešov]] (both now in [[Slovakia]]).&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; From 1760 to 1761, he was in Prague where, despite objections from the Prague Painters' Guild, he executed frescoes at the Church of St. Nikolaus in [[Malá Strana]]. From 1762 to 1764, he painted at the Monastery and the [[Premonstratensians|Premonstratensian]] Church in [[Jasov]].&lt;ref name="N" /&gt;

In 1767, he settled in Eger. Bishop {{ill|Karl von Esterhazy|hu|Eszterházy Károly}} commissioned him to do work for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Eger|Diocese of Eger]] and at the Bishop's properties. Three years later, he created the altarpiece for the "Minoritenkirche" ([[Franciscan|Franciscan Church]]) and in 1777 he produced his masterpiece depicting the [[Council of Trent]] at the Líceum.&lt;ref name="N" /&gt; He remained in the Bishop's service for the rest of his life, although he occasionally travelled to execute small commissions elsewhere.

'''Katherine "Kat" Alexandra Meoz''' (born July 27, 1988) is a Venezuelan-American singer-songwriter, composer, soundtrack and record producer.  As producer of the soundtrack [[The Dust Storm (2015 film)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theduststormfilm.com|title=Home|website=The Dust Storm|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; she renewed interest in indie-rock music. Three of Meoz's original songs in the film were performed by actor [[Colin O'Donoghue]], [[Once Upon a Time (TV series)]].
[[File:Kat Meoz for Blackstar and D'Angelico Guitars.jpg|thumb|Kat Meoz is endorsed by Blackstar Amplification and D'Angelico Guitars]]
As a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, Meoz is best known as the founder and principal songwriter for the self-titled [[garage rock]] [[blues]] project, Kat Meoz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/kat-meoz/id441742523|title=Kat Meoz on Apple Music|website=iTunes|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;(f.k.a. GRIT). Her debut EP ''LA Don't Love You'' was released by indie label Bodan Kuma Recordings ([[The Subways]], EFG, Detroit Rebellion) in June 2017.

The first feature film Sheridan directed was 2001's ''[[Disco Pigs]]'', [[Enda Walsh]]'s screen adaptation of his own play, starring [[Cillian Murphy]] and [[Elaine Cassidy]]&lt;ref name="IMDb" /&gt; as teenagers in a lifelong, obsessive, antisocial friendship.&lt;ref name="Close-UpFilm" /&gt; ''The Guardian'' described the independent film as a "stylised, hyperkinetic drama&amp;nbsp;... that combines kitchen-sink realism and vicious fight scenes with highly stylised fantasy sequences".&lt;ref name="Guardian pig" /&gt; ''Disco Pigs'' earned Sheridan nominations for best director at the [[British Independent Film Awards]] and the [[IFTA Awards|Irish Film &amp; TV Academy Awards]], as well as prizes at the Castellinaria Youth Film Festival, the Giffoni Film Festival, the Young European Cinema Film Festival and the Ourense Film Festival.&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt;

== [http://www.printedweb.org ''Printed Web''] (publication) ==
''Printed Web'' is an artists' publication devoted to web-to-print art and discourse, published by Paul Soulellis / Library of the Printed Web. The project began in 2014 as a way to present new work by artists included in Soulellis’ Library of the Printed Web. Artists are invited to submit new or existing network-based work for the printed page. In the spirit of Seth Siegelaub, each issue is curated as a group exhibition for the printed page. Printed Web circulates primarily as print-on-demand publications, but also includes PDFs, ZIPs, GIFs, and server directories. More than 180 artists and writers have contributed to the project through issue #4. Individual issues are widely held in special artists’ publications collections and libraries, including Museum of Modern Art NY, Yale University, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Walker Center, and NY Public Library.

''Printed Web 2'' was included in the exhibition "Aerial Imagery in Print, 1860 to Today" at [[Museum of Modern Art]], organized by MoMA Library, featuring a project by [[James Bridle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1663?locale=en|title=Aerial Imagery in Print, 1860 to Today {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Printed Web 3'' was an open call and launched on the front page of [[Rhizome]] and at Offprint London in May 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2015/may/18/printed-web-3/|title=Poor Media on Demand: All the files of Printed Web 3|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring work by 147 artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.rhizome.org/Printed_Web_3/|title=Index of /Printed_Web_3|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Printed Web 4'' was a co-publication with [[International Center of Photography]] and featured in the exhibition "Public, Private, Secret," curated by [[Charlotte Cotton]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicprivatesecret.org/|title=Public, Private, Secret|website=Public, Private, Secret|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text "Folding the Web" by Michael Connor, artistic director of [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome]], was included in ''Printed Web 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rhizome.org/editorial/2016/jun/16/folding-the-web/|title=Folding the Web|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dances that make up the '''list of DanceSport dances''' are performed competitively at amateur and professional levels throughout the world. Ten international style [[ballroom dance]]s&amp;mdash;five Standard and five Latin&amp;mdash;are defined by the '''[[World Dance Council]]''' (WDC), which has world-wide membership of all countries taking part in ballroom competitions. 

The WDC incorporates various groupings and former titles, such as  the [[World Dance and DanceSport Council]] (former title). The WDC is the governing body for international professional and amateur DanceSport. The [[World DanceSport Federation]] is, to some extent, a rival body which issues rules for amateur competitions.&lt;ref&gt;See the linked pages for details.&lt;/ref&gt; The list is supplemented by nine American style dances&amp;mdash;four Smooth and five Rhythm&amp;mdash;which are defined by United States dance organizations, such as USA Dance, (formerly USABDA, the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association).&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Besides determining which dances are performed, these organizations specify many other aspects of their competitions, for instance, the [[tempo]] of music allowed and the duration of each competition round.

== WDC International style dances==
Within World Dance Council international competitions are two categories of dances, ''Ballroom'' (also called Standard or Modern) and ''Latin''.&lt;ref&gt;This is the present WDC terminology.&lt;/ref&gt; In England (e.g. at the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]]), the categories are traditionally called Ballroom and Latin American dances respectively. In the Ballroom dances, men typically wear [[Formal wear|evening dress]] (coattails, waistcoats and [[White tie|white bow ties]]), while women wear gowns. Partners remain in [[closed position]] throughout the dance, and movements tend to be elegant and sweeping. The ballroom dances are progressive, moving anti-clockwise round the floor. 

The Latin dances are more overtly sensual, with skimpy costumes for women and tight-fitting ones for men.&lt;ref&gt;Originally, 1930&amp;ndash;1960, clothing for latin dance was similar to ballroom, with at least dinner jackets and black tie for men, and simple dress for women, with skirts shorter than the ballroom gowns.&lt;/ref&gt; More variation in movement is allowed than in the Standard dances. Close, semi-open and open figures are danced. [[Choreography]] is now extremely important. Hip action - Latin technique is required; and athletic and balletic maneuvers are incorporated which makes it into a DanceSport. Two Latin dances are progressive going counter clockwise  (samba and paso doble), but there is no obligation to consistently move round the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Picart, 89-90, 92-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==American style==

The Smooth and Rhythm categories of American style DanceSport roughly correspond to the Standard and Latin categories of International style. In Smooth, dancers wear costumes not greatly dissimilar to those worn by their counterparts in Standard---Standard dresses often have prominent floats embellishing the arms and fuller skirts which are typically absent in Smooth, due to the open movement and changing arm positions requiring less restriction on the body; however, the dances themselves are significantly different as a result of influence by dancers like [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Arthur Murray]] in the years following [[World War II]].  While elegance and flow remain the goal, as in International Standard, dancers do not remain in [[closed position]] exclusively, instead breaking away from each other periodically and experimenting with open footwork.  The Rhythm dances were also influenced by American dancers of the post-World War II era, but the differences between it and International Latin are more subtle.  Costumes are similar, and while step patterns are not identical, movements are as free and explicitly sensual as in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Picart, 90-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his works on paper, Podwal’s artistry has been employed in an array of diverse projects, including the design of a series of decorative plates for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]: ''Passover Plate'', ''Zodiac Platter'' (Met Bestseller), and  ''Life Cycle'' (Met Bestseller).  His work has been animated for public television in ''A Passover Seder with Elie Wiesel'' (Time Warner), engraved on a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] presented by President Reagan to Elie Wiesel, and woven into an Aubusson tapestry that adorns the ark in the main sanctuary of [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York]].  Moreover, he designed sixteen kiln cast glass panels for the United Jewish Appeal Federation Headquarters in New York. Podwal collaborated with Academy Award winning filmmaker Allan Miller on the documentary [http://www.houseoflifefilm.com ''House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague''], narrated by Claire Bloom.  In 2009 and 2010, the film was broadcast on PBS.  Podwal's portraits of Mozart in costumes from his operas were published as a boxed set of greeting cards by the [[Metropolitan Opera]].

In conjunction with the [[Anti-Defamation League]], Podwal began ''The Jerusalem Sky Project'', a program that fosters tolerance and awareness by bringing together young children from the Jewish, Islamic, and Christian communities.  Participating religious schools study Podwal's ''Jerusalem Sky'' in their classrooms, and then encourage their students to illustrate their own depictions of Jerusalem.  Amidst the learning, the children of each school write to or meet with their counterparts at a school of another faith and begin to learn about each other's religion and culture.  After a few weeks, the program culminates with an exhibition of all of the drawings from each of the schools.  At the opening of the exhibition, the children meet to enjoy each other's art and company.  In a 2005 article called "Three Faiths, One Lesson", the ''New York Times'' covered the completion of the program at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in Brooklyn, NY.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/20/arts/design/20mosa.html "Three Faiths, One Lesson"]&lt;/ref&gt; The project has since also been carried out in Los Angeles, CA, and Binghamton, NY.

In 2011, Podwal received commissions to illustrate a new Passover ''[[Haggadah]]'' for the Central Conference of American Rabbis Press; to design new embroidered textiles for Prague's 700-year-old [[Old New Synagogue|Altneuschul]]; to create a limited edition print for the Metropolitan Opera's production of ''Nabucco''; and to design ''[[Hanukkah]]'' cards for the Metropolitan Museum and the Metropolitan Opera. Also in 2011, he received the Jewish Cultural Achievement Award from the [[Foundation for Jewish Culture]].

In 2014, the Terezin Ghetto Museum exhibited Podwal’s cycle ''All This Has Come Upon Us'', a series of 42 paintings and drawings created especially for that venue.&lt;ref name="Kestenbaum"&gt;Kestenbaum, Gloria (October&amp;nbsp;23, 2014). "[http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/an-illustrated-saga-of-the-diaspora/ An Illustrated Saga of the Diaspora]". ''[[The Jewish Week]]''. jewishweek.timesofisrael.com. Retrieved November&amp;nbsp;24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
The works, which span Jewish history from the destruction of the two temples in Jerusalem, through the history of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and persecution in Europe, culminating in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], have been described by the artist as offering "a disturbing reminder of how Europe’s extensive history of 'Jew-hatred' laid the groundwork for Terezin and Auschwitz".&lt;ref name="Kestenbaum"/&gt; The series has been published as a portfolio of archival pigment prints,&lt;ref name="Kestenbaum"/&gt; which has been acquired by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Library of Congress, Yad Vashem, the Bodleian Library, the British Library, the Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University, Yale University, [[Princeton University Library]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All This Has Come Upon Us|url=https://graphicarts.princeton.edu/2014/10/08/all-this-has-come-upon-us/|website=Graphic Arts Collection, Rare Books and Special Collections, Firestone Library|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University, Hebrew University, and the National Library of Israel, among many others.

In 2015, Mark Podwal was commissioned to design new textiles for the restored synagogue in the Czech city of [[Brno]]. At Prague's [[Clementinum|Klementinum]], Podwal's series ''Mozart and Prague'' was exhibited along with Mozart's handwritten manuscripts.

In 2016, Glitterati Inc. published a 374-page monograph on his work, ''Reimagined: 45 Years of Jewish Art''.

'''Neoclassicism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] νέος ''nèos'', "new" and [[Latin]] ''classicus'', "of the highest rank")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=neo-classical| title=Etymology of the English word "neo-classical"| accessdate=2016-05-09| publisher=myetymology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to Western [[Cultural movement|movements]] in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[classical antiquity]]. Neoclassicism was born largely thanks to the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], at the time of the rediscovery of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their [[Grand Tour]] and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1189&amp;dq=neoclassicism+originated+in.Rome&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCl9eT0cLVAhVLDcAKHSy7B1cQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=neoclassicism%20originated%20in.Rome&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2010/978 The road from Rome to Paris. The birth of a modern Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt; The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.

European Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each "neo"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765–1830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The "Rococo" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, "corrected" and "restored" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.

==History==
Neoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book |title = Neoclassicism A&amp;I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher =  Phaidon Press|year = 1997 | pages = | isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt; While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], demonstrates this especially well.&lt;ref&gt;A recurring theme in Clark: 19-23, 58-62, 69, 97-98 (on Ingres); Honour, 187-190; Novotny, 86-87&lt;/ref&gt; The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.&lt;ref name=Lingo&gt;{{cite book |title = François Duquesnoy and the Greek ideal| last=Lingo| first=Estelle Cecile| publisher = Yale University Press; First Edition|year = 2007| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wlq67ikF0OEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Winckelmann+Neoclassicism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zGxFT-GiPMHWiAKY_dypDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Winckelmann%20Neoclassicism&amp;f=false 161]| isbn=978-0-300-12483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Savannah: fine &amp; decorative arts, 1800-1840| last=Talbott | first=Page| publisher = University of Georgia Press |year = 1995| pages = 6| isbn=978-0-8203-1793-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|left|250|Johann Joachim Winckelmann, often called "the father of archaeology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Culture and values: a survey of the humanities| last=Cunningham, Reich| first= Lawrence S., John J. | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing; 7 edition|year = 2009| pages = 104 | isbn=978-0-495-56877-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' ("History of Ancient Art", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at "noble simplicity and calm grandeur",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find "not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: "The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotes from the first pages of "Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Neoclassicism" in each art implies a particular canon of a "classical" model.

In English, the term "Neoclassicism" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and "Neoclassicism" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]], ''[[Judgement of Paris]]'', c. 1757, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio]]

The term "Neoclassical" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as "the true style", "reformed" and "revival"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 11, 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.

Neoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much "Neoclassical" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally the winning side.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 43-62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting and printmaking==
[[File:(20) Flaxman Ilias 1795, Zeichnung 1793, 194 x 338 mm.jpg|thumb|Print of a drawing by [[John Flaxman]] of a scene in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', 1795]]

It is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as "insipid" and "almost entirely uninteresting to us"—some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)&lt;/ref&gt; by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as "the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once "fired the artistic youth of Europe" but are now "neglected",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 14&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having "an unctuous softness and tediousness" by [[Fritz Novotny]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. 
[[File:David-Oath of the Horatii-1784.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784]]

The work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of "noble simplicity and calm grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' ("Imaginary Prisons") whose "oppressive cyclopean architecture" conveys "dreams of fear and frustration".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the "Gothic" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.

Neoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt;

David's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Canova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|thumb|260px|''Hebe'' by [[Canova]] (1800–05), in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
If Neoclassical painting suffered from a lack of ancient models, Neoclassical sculpture tended to suffer from an excess of them, although examples of actual Greek sculpture of the "classical period" beginning in about 500 BC were then very few; the most highly regarded works were mostly Roman copies.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Neoclassical sculptors enjoyed huge reputations in their own day, but are now less regarded, with the exception of [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], whose work was mainly portraits, very often as busts, which do not sacrifice a strong impression of the sitter's personality to idealism. His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378–379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 379-384&lt;/ref&gt; All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.

An early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 384-385&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 388-389&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive "character heads" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 390-392&lt;/ref&gt; Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.

Since prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,&lt;ref&gt;Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].

Neoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.

A second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the "Louis XVI style", and the second in the styles called "Directoire" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}

In the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built "[[United States Capitol|capitol]]" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and "black basaltes" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.

Indoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,&lt;ref name="Gontar"&gt;Gontar&lt;/ref&gt; with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most "Roman" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appeatrance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Camaïeu|en camaïeu]]'' ("like cameos"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of "Pompeiian red" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Goût grec]]'' ("Greek style"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the "Louis XVI" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: "Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 110–111, 110 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Château de Malmaison - Appartement de Joséphine 003.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Joséphine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]

From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Gontar"/&gt; the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] "so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171–184, 171 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and "Louis Seize", or Louis XVI, in France.

Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s —, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.

Gothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, "romantic" appearance.

==Neoclassical gardens==
In England, Augustan literature had a direct parallel with the Augustan style of landscape design. The links are clearly seen in the work of [[Alexander Pope]]. The best surviving examples of Neoclassical English gardens are [[Chiswick House]], [[Stowe House]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Turner|title=British gardens: history, philosophy and design, Chapter 6 Neoclassical gardens and landscapes 1730-1800|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415518789|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassicism and fashion==

In fashion, Neoclassicism influenced the much greater simplicity of women's dresses, and the long-lasting fashion for white, from well before the French Revolution, but it was not until after it that thorough-going attempts to imitate ancient styles became fashionable in France, at least for women. Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette Récamier]], [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], [[Thérésa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: "''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''" ("One could not be more sumptuously undressed"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.

Very light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.

Neoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien Régime]]. Even when David designed a new French "national costume" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.

The trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.

Classically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French "à la Titus" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[François-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 243&lt;/ref&gt; and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that "more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''à la Titus''.&lt;ref&gt;Rifelj, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later "Neoclassicisms"==
[[File:NatGal.jpg|thumb|The West building (1941) of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, with the East Building (1978) and the [[United States Capitol]] visible behind and to the left]]
{{Classicism}}
In American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890–1917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.

Conservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as "reactionary", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked "progressive". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts Décoratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann|É.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis Süe|Süe]] &amp; [[André Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].

There was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)

This literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.

===In music===
[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music | Classical]] and [[baroque music | Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music | Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed "classical" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]]. 

The 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino | Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound the Neoclassicists aspired to. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.

=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===
[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]
In 1905–1914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&amp;brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]

With the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.

Neoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including "exported" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.

===Architecture in the 21st century===
{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}
[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]

After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.

As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.

For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] – ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.

In Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2072">In the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the belief in nature spirits, called ''ngesh'' or ''mingeh'', is widespread. Ngesh are believed to possess human characteristics, live near water sources in forests or villages, and may be encountered at any time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mack, John. "Animal Representations in Kuba Art: An Anthropological Interpretation of Sculpture" in ''Oxford Art Journal'', Vol. 4, No. 2, Sculpture (Nov., 1981), pp. 50-56. Published by: Oxford University PressArticle Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1360140&lt;/ref&gt; Community residents know the name of local ''ngesh'' and their offspring. ''Ngesh'' impose themselves on various human affairs, including the control of harvest and the fertility of women.&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binkley|first=David A|title=Kuba|year=2009|publisher=5 Continents Edition|location=Milan|author2=Patricia Darish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''ngesh ''is named and distinguished from one another; the Kuba invest each ''ngesh'' with its own particular temperament, the likes and dislikes of which set off its volatile nature. The ''ngesh ''have their own individual character.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ngesh and Kuba masquerade==
Origin stories for some [[Kuba masquerade]] traditions describe how the mask's creator first encountered an ''ngesh'' in the forest and, after a period of disorientation, returns home to carve a likeness of the ''ngesh''. While ''ngesh ''are rarely represented by figurative sculpture, they are thought to be personified in masquerade figures, which are in turn empowered by these nature spirits.

The potential for masked performers to become aggressive is a fundamental part of [[Kuba masquerade]],and it is a reflection of the influence of the unpredictable nature of ngesh on Kuba masked dancers. The association between ''ngesh'' and masquerade is also underscored by the strict rule that forbid spectators from touching the masks or coming to close to a masked dancer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12419">The '''Nunnehi''' are a race of immortal spirit people in [[Cherokee mythology]]. In the [[Cherokee language]], ''Nunnehi'' literally means "The People Who Live Anywhere", but it is often translated into English as "The People Who Live Forever", or simply "The Immortals". The Cherokee believed the Nunnehi to be a type of [[supernatural]] human being, completely distinct from [[ghosts]] and [[nature spirits]], as well as from [[gods]]. In this sense, the Nunnehi (along with the ''Yunwi Tsunsdi'', or "Little People" in the Cherokee language) are the Cherokee equivalent of [[fairies]] in traditional [[European folklore]]. The belief in fairy-like beings is universal among all ethnicities, including all [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] [[Tribe (Native American)|tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Cherokee [[folklore]], the Nunnehi had many underground townhouses throughout the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], and they were particularly fond of high mountain peaks where no timber ever grew. Hunters would often hear the Nunnehi in the mountains, singing and dancing and beating drums, but when they would go toward the sound, it would shift about and suddenly seem to be coming from behind them or from some other direction, so that the person hearing the sound would never be able to find where it was coming from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judson|first=Katherine B.|title=Native American Legends of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley|year=2000|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|location=Dekalb|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Dance at Nottely ==
The Nunnehi only appeared to humans when they allowed themselves to be seen. When they did appear, they looked and acted just like other Cherokee. The Nunnehi were very fond of music and dancing, as are the Cherokee. One of the stories about the Nunnehi tells about four Nunnehi women who came to a town called Nottely and danced with the young men there for hours. Nobody knew that they were Nunnehi women; everyone thought they were just women from another village or town. As the women were leaving the dance, a group of men standing outside the townhouse watched the women walk down an open trail to the [[Nottely River]]. When the women reached the river they suddenly disappeared, with no apparent hiding place. It was then that the men realized that the women were Nunnehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yahula ==
The Nunnehi were very friendly to the Cherokee and often helped lost wanderers, especially during the winter. The Nunnehi would take the person into their warm townhouses until the person was rested and ready to return home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Randy|title=Mountain Ghost Stories and Curious Tales of Western North Carolina|year=1988|publisher=John F. Blair, Publisher|location=North Carolina|pages=59|author2=Janet Barnett }}&lt;/ref&gt; if the person chose to do so. A well-known story tells about a man named Yahula, who had become separated from a hunting party. His friends searched for him for a long time but eventually gave up and returned to their village, grieving for Yahula, whom they believed was dead. The Nunnehi found Yahula and brought him back to their townhouse to live with them. Yahula became immortal and lived with the Nunnehi for a long time until he began to miss his friends and family. One night Yahula went back to his village to see his friends and family, and he told them what had happened. When they asked Yahula to eat dinner with them, he said he could not, for he had eaten the food of the Nunnehi and could never again eat human food. He told them he had only come back to visit and that he would soon be returning to the Nunnehi. His friends and family begged him to stay, but he refused, telling them he could not choose death with his own people over immortality with the Nunnehi. Yahula then returned to the Nunnehi, but he continued to visit the Cherokee often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi Protect the Cherokee Before the Removal in 1838 ==
The Nunnehi often warned the Cherokee of impending danger and protected them in times of need. One of the most well-known stories about the Nunnehi tells how they helped the Cherokee before the [[Cherokee removal|Removal]] in 1838, when the Cherokee were forced to leave their homeland and resettle in [[Oklahoma]]. According to the story, the Nunnehi came to a Cherokee village and told the people to pack up their belongings and to be prepared to leave in seven days to come live with the Nunnehi, for a great catastrophe was about to happen, worse than anything that had ever before happened to the Cherokee. After seven days, the Nunnehi returned for the Cherokee and led them to a large stone deep into the mountains. As the Cherokee watched, the stone rolled away, revealing an entrance into the mountain. Inside the mountain was the most beautiful place the Cherokee had ever seen, and many families rushed into the mountain without ever looking back. However, some of the people refused to enter, and instead chose to stay outside and face whatever was about to happen to them. The people who remained outside were later forced to leave their homes and resettle in Oklahoma. The people who chose to live with the Nunnehi escaped the fate of their fellow Cherokee. According to the story, it is from this group of Cherokee that the small number of modern Cherokee who still live on their native land is descended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Barbara|title=Living Stories of the Cherokee|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Removed Townhouse ==
There are also other similar stories that tell about how the Nunnehi invited Cherokee people to come live with them in order to avoid war and misfortune. One well-known story tells about a time long before the time of the Removal, when the Nunnehi told a group of Cherokee that they would return in seven days to carry away the townhouse along with anyone inside it. The Nunnehi warned the people not to shout or make any sound as the townhouse was being carried away. On the seventh day there was a sound like thunder that grew louder and louder as it approached the village. Despite the Nunnehi's warning to the Cherokee to remain quiet, some of the people became frightened and screamed when the ground began to shake as the Nunnehi lifted the townhouse off the ground. Some of the Nunnehi were startled by the scream and dropped a part of the townhouse, which fell to the ground and became the [[mound]] at a village called Setsi. The Nunnehi steadied themselves and carried off the remaining part of the townhouse, with the people still in it, to a mountain called Lone Peak, where it was changed to solid rock and the people inside it became invisible and immortal like the Nunnehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi of Hiwassee River ==
In another story, the Nunnehi invited a group of Cherokee to come live with them, and after the seven days had passed, they returned and took the people to live with them underneath [[Hiwassee River]], near the area where Shooting Creek comes in. The Cherokee who went to live with the Nunnehi under the river would sometimes catch the fish-drags of their kinsmen because they did not want to be forgotten. On warm summer days, when the wind ripples the surface of the water, their voices could sometimes be heard by those floating by on the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi Warriors of Nikwasi ==
The Nunnehi sometimes assisted the Cherokee in times of war. One of the most well-known stories about the Nunnehi tells about how they fought alongside the Cherokee when their land was invaded by a powerful, unknown tribe of American Indians from the southeast. [[Nikwasi]] was the most ancient settlement of the Cherokee. the invading tribe attacked Nikwasi one morning just before daybreak. The warriors of Nikwasi fought back but were eventually overpowered. A stranger then appeared and told the Nikwasi chief to retreat and that he himself would fight the enemy. The chief did as he was instructed, believing the stranger to be a chief from another village who had come with reinforcements. The mound at Nikwasi then opened up and hundreds of Nunnehi warriors poured out and began to approach the battlefield. When the Nunnehi warriors reached the invading tribe they became invisible and slaughtered all but a few who had surrendered and begged for mercy. The Nunnehi told the invading tribe that they got what they deserved for attacking a peaceful tribe, and then sent them back to where they came from so they could deliver the news to their people and warn them to never again attack Nikwasi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi Defend Franklin, North Carolina ==
During the [[American Civil War]], by which time Nikwasi had become known as [[Franklin, North Carolina]], a group of [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers approached Franklin with the intention of burning it to the ground. A group of scouts returned to their commanding officers and warned them not to attack the town because it was heavily guarded by soldiers on every corner. However, the town was defenseless, as every able-bodied person had already left to fight in the war. Unaware of this fact, the Union soldiers then changed their course toward [[Atlanta, Georgia]], burning every town in their path. According to the Cherokee, it was the Nunnehi that had protected Franklin from the Union soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Barbara|title=Living Stories of the Cherokee|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Abandoned Nunnehi Townhouse ==
There is a story that tells about how some of the Nunnehi eventually decided to leave their home. Near the Cherokee town of [[Tugaloo]] there was a circular depression in the ground, the size of a townhouse. The inside of the depression was waist-deep and was always clean as though it had been cared for by unknown hands. Travelers passing by would often throw rocks and logs into the depression, but when they returned the logs and rocks would always be lying far from the depression. The Cherokee believed the place to be a Nunnehi townhouse, and so they always avoided the place out of respect. Eventually, some logs had been thrown into the depression and were allowed to remain there, and the Cherokee concluded that the Nunnehi had become annoyed by the presence of the white men and had abandoned their townhouse forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nunnehi in Cherokee Folklore After The Removal in 1838 ==
After the Removal in 1838, when the Cherokee were forced to leave their homeland and resettle in Oklahoma, one of their greatest regrets was that they were forced to leave behind forever their relatives who had gone to live with the Nunnehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mooney|first=James|title=Myths of the Cherokee|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storytelling]] always has been and is still an important tradition in Cherokee [[culture]], and the Nunnehi remain a popular subject of many stories. There are even some Cherokee still living in their native land that claim to have had encounters with the Nunnehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duncan|first=Barbara|title=Living Stories of the Cherokee|year=1998|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=183–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Premio Ruido''' (Spanish for "''Noise Prize''") was set up in October 2015 as a yearly single-category award for the best music album produced in Spain. The first ceremony to present the award took place in January 2016, after the nominees had been announced in November of the previous year.

In terms of the process followed and rules, Premio Ruido bears a close similarity to the Mercury Prize in the UK, and the intention is to recognise artistic quality over sales success, in contrast to previously existing awards. However, whilst the Mercury Prize is awarded by a mixed panel that includes both musicians and figures of the music industry, as well as members of the media and journalists, and was established by the [[British Phonographic Industry]], Premio Ruido was established by [[Periodistas Asociados de Música]] (the Spanish Association of Music Journalists) and it is their members who take part in the selection. The company Virtual Contenidos SL manages and produces the annual awards, while PAM's Board of Directors conducts and ratifies the voting process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://premioruido.es/bases]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the initial stage, PAM members vote for their favourite national records launched that year. This is so as to draw a stylistically  diverse shortlist of twelve nominated albums. A recording is deemed "''national''" if at least half of the artists taking part are Spanish nationals or else have permanent residency in Spain. At the final stage, the associates vote for just one of the nominees. The winning artist is presented with a trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://premioruido.es/bases]&lt;/ref&gt;

El [[Niño de Elche]] was the inaugural winner with the album "''Voces del extremo''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2016/01/27/actualidad/1453855057_109224.html | title = La voz extrema de Niño de Elche conquista el primer Premio Ruido de la crítica| access-date = 17 May 2016| publisher = El País}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Patriarchal Cathedral Basilica of Saint Mark''' ({{lang-it|Basilica Cattedrale Patriarcale di San Marco}}), commonly known as '''Saint Mark's Basilica''' ({{lang-it|Basilica di San Marco}}; {{lang-vec|Baxéłega de San Marco}}), is the [[cathedral]] church of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice]], northern [[Italy]]. It is the most famous of the city's churches and one of the best known examples of Italo-[[Byzantine architecture]]. It lies at the eastern end of the [[Piazza San Marco]], adjacent and connected to the [[Doge's Palace]]. Originally it was the chapel of the Doge, and has been the city's cathedral only since 1807, when it became the seat of the [[Patriarch of Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 1&lt;/ref&gt; archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice]], formerly at [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|title =Basilica di San Marco|date =|access-date =10 February 2016|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150305102304/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|archivedate =5 March 2015|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its opulent design, gold ground [[mosaic]]s, and its status as a symbol of Venetian wealth and power, from the 11th century on the building has been known by the nickname '''Chiesa d'Oro''' (Church of gold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7ZNOt6-N0MC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=Chiesa+d'Oro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hh_lT4X7BYyk8ATCy_WaAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Chiesa%20d'Oro&amp;f=false|title=Fodor's Italy 2011 |publisher= Random House Digital, Inc.|date= May 31, 2011|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Earliest construction===
[[File:San Marko (reconstruction).JPG|thumb|Original [[facade]] of St. Mark's Basilica]]
[[File:1911 Britannica-Architecture-St Mark’s.png|thumb|Plan diagram, showing different phases of construction]]
The first St Mark's was a building next to the [[Doge's Palace]], ordered by the doge in 828, when Venetian merchants stole the supposed relics of [[Mark the Evangelist]] from [[Alexandria]], and completed by 832; from the same century dates the first [[St Mark's Campanile]] (bell tower). The church was burned in a rebellion in 976, when the populace locked [[Pietro IV Candiano]] inside to kill him, and restored or rebuilt in 978.  Nothing certain is known of the form of these early churches.  From perhaps 1063&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|title=Navigation path|website=www.basilicasanmarco.it|accessdate=10 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305102304/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|archivedate=5 March 2015|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the present [[basilica]] was constructed.  The consecration is variously recorded as being in 1084&amp;ndash;85, 1093 (the date most often taken), 1102 and 1117, probably reflecting a series of consecrations of different parts.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:San Marco cathedral in Venice.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the gable showing Venice's patron apostle St. Mark with angels. Underneath is a winged lion, the symbol of the saint and of Venice.]]
In 1094 the supposed body of Saint Mark was rediscovered in a [[Column|pillar]] by [[Vitale Faliero]], [[Doge of Venice|doge]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/storia_societa/sanmarco_ritrovamento.bsm?cat=2&amp;subcat=1 |title=Recovery |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233823/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/storia_societa/sanmarco_ritrovamento.bsm?cat=2&amp;subcat=1 |archive-date=4 October 2013 |work=basilicasanmarco.it |access-date=28 July 2013 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building also incorporates a low tower (now housing St Mark’s Treasure), believed by some to have been part of the original Doge's Palace.  The [[Pala d'Oro]] ordered from Constantinople was installed on the [[high altar]] in 1105.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1106 the church, and especially its mosaics, were damaged by a serious fire in that part of the city; it is not entirely clear whether any surviving mosaics in the interior predate this, though there is some 11th-century work surviving in the main porch.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;  The main features of the present structure were all in place by then, except for the [[narthex]] or porch, and the [[facade]].

The basic shape of the church has a mixture of Italian and Byzantine features, notably "the treatment of the eastern arm as the termination of a basilican building with main apse and two side chapels rather than as an equal arm of a truly centralized structure".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 13th century the narthex and the new facade were constructed, most of the mosaics were completed and the [[dome]]s were covered with second much higher domes of lead-covered wood in order to blend in with the [[Gothic architecture]] of the redesigned Doge's Palace.—

===Later construction===
The basic structure of the building has not been much altered. Its decoration has changed greatly over time, though the overall impression of the interior with a dazzling display of gold ground mosaics on all ceilings and upper walls remains the same. The succeeding centuries, especially the period after the Venetian-led conquest of Constantinople in the [[Fourth Crusade]] of 1204 and the fourteenth century, all contributed to its adornment, with many elements being [[spolia]] brought in from ancient or Byzantine buildings, such as mosaics, [[column]]s, [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], or [[frieze]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, the exterior [[brickwork]] became covered with [[marble]] cladding and [[Stone carving|carvings]], some much older than the building itself, such as the statue of the Four Tetrarchs (below).
The latest structural additions include the closing-off of the Baptistery and [[Isidore of Chios|St Isidor's]] Chapel (1300s), the carvings on the upper facade and the Sacristy (1400s), and the closing-off of the Zen Chapel (1500s).

===Function and administration===
During the 13th century the emphasis of the church's function seems to have changed from being the private chapel of the Doge to that of a "state church", with increased power for the procurators.  It was the location for the great public ceremonies of the state, such as the installation and burials of Doges, though as space ran out and the demand for grander tombs increased, from the 15th century [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]] became the usual burial place. The function of the basilica remained the same until 1807, after the end of the [[Venetian Republic]], when the basilica finally became subject to the local [[bishop]], the [[Patriarch of Venice]], though from the 12th century he had had a throne there, opposite the doge's.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of the see was ordered by [[Napoleon]] during his period of control of Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 68&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this, Venice's cathedral from 1451 was the much less grand [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]].

The ''procurators'', an important organ of the [[Republic of Venice]], were in charge of administration; their seats were the [[Procuratie]], in St Mark’s Square. All building and restoring works were directed by the ''protos'': great [[architect]]s such as [[Jacopo Sansovino]] and [[Baldassarre Longhena]] held the office. The doge himself appointed a special group of clergy led by the ''primicerio''.  Procurators and protos still exist and perform the same tasks for the Patriarchate.

==Exterior==
[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3341.jpg|thumbnail|St. Mark's, from the north side of the piazza ([[Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives]] - [[:c:Category:Photographs from the Goodyear Archival Collection|the Goodyear Archival Collection]]).]]
The exterior of the west facade of the basilica is divided in three registers: lower, upper, and [[dome]]s.
In the lower register of the façade, five round-arched [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], enveloped by polychrome marble columns, open into the narthex through bronze-fashioned doors.

The upper level of mosaics in the lunettes of the lateral ogee arches has scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] (all post-Renaissance replacements) culminating in a 19th-century replacement ''[[Last Judgment]]'' lower down over the main portal that replaced a damaged one with the same subject (during the centuries many mosaics had to be replaced inside and outside the basilica, but subjects were rarely changed).

Mosaics with scenes showing the history of the relics of Saint Mark from right to left fill the [[lunette]]s of the lateral portals; the first on the left is the only one on the façade still surviving from the 13th century. The formal subject is the ''Deposition of the Relics'', but it is probably depicted as the crowd leaving San Marco after the ceremonial installation of a new doge. The four bronze horses are shown in their place on the façade. We can for once get a good idea of the original compositions of the mosaics from paintings and other depictions, especially [[Gentile Bellini]]'s very large ''Procession in Piazza San Marco'' in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 183-187&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone sculpture is relatively limited at the lower level, where a forest of columns and patterned marble slabs are the main emphases. It includes relatively narrow bands of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] work on the portals, richly carved borders of foliage mixed with figures to the ogee arches and other elements, and large shallow [[relief]] saints between the arches. Along the roofline, by contrast, there is a line of statues, many in their own small pavilions, culminating in Saint Mark flanked by six angels in the centre, above a large gilded winged lion (his symbol, and that of Venice).

In the upper register, from the top of ogee [[arch]]es, statues of [[Theological virtues|Theological]] and [[Cardinal virtues|Cardinal Virtues]], four [[Military saint|Warrior Saints]], [[Constantine X Doukas|Constantine]], [[Demetrius]], [[George the Hagiorite|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodosius]] and St Mark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/basilica_scult/coronamento_appr.bsm# |title=The Gothic Crowning|publisher=basilicasanmarco.it |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; watch over the city. Above the large central window of the façade, under St Mark, the Winged Lion (his symbol) holds the book quoting ''“Pax Tibi Marce Evangelista Meus” (Peace to you Mark my evangelist) ''.  In the centre of the balcony the famous bronze horses face the square.

===Horses of Saint Mark-Lysippos===
[[File:Veneza38.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|The replica horses]]
The [[Horses of Saint Mark]] were installed on the balcony above the portal of the basilica in about 1254. They date to [[Classical Antiquity]], though their date remains a matter of debate, and presumably were originally the team pulling a [[quadriga]] chariot, probably containing an emperor. By some accounts they once adorned the Arch of [[Trajan]]{{clarify|date=November 2016 |reason=Which one?}}.

The horses were long displayed at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], and in 1204 Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] sent them back to Venice as part of the loot [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacked from Constantinople]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].

They were taken to Paris by [[Napoleon]] in 1797 but returned to Venice in 1815. After a long restoration, since the 1970s the originals have been kept in St Mark’s Museum inside the basilica and the horses now on the facade of the cathedral are bronze replicas.

[[File:Venice – The Tetrarchs 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs]] {{3d alt|4 Tetrarchs.jpg}}]]

===The Tetrarchs===
In an attempt to stabilise the Roman Empire after the crisis of the third century, the Emperor [[Diocletian]] imposed a new Imperial office structure: a four co-emperor ruling plan called The [[Tetrarchy]]. The famous [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] statue [[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|of the Four Tetrarchs]] represents the interdependence of the four rulers. It was taken from [[Constantinople]], during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, and set into the south-west corner of the basilica (the above-mentioned low tower) at the level of the Piazza San Marco. Part of the missing foot of one of the figures was discovered in Istanbul (near the [[Bodrum Mosque]]) in the 1960s, where it is still on display, clarifying the original location of the work.

===Narthex or porch===
By the 13th century, the [[narthex]] or porch embraced the western arm of the basilica on the three sides; when it was first built is uncertain but was probably the 13th century. Later the southern part was closed to obtain the Baptistery (14th century) and the Zen Chapel (16th century).&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The narthex prepares the visitors’ eyes for the atmosphere of the gilded interior, just as the [[Old Testament]] stories represented in its 13th-century mosaic ceiling prepare them for the New Testament decoration in the interior.  The main subjects are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the life of [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], Joseph, and [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;  It has long been recognised that the compositions are very close to those of the [[Cotton Genesis]], an important 4th- or 5th-century Greek luxury [[illuminated manuscript]] copy of the Book of Genesis, now in the [[British Library]], though very badly damaged in a fire of 1731.  About a hundred of the 359 miniatures in the manuscript are used. It is presumed that this reached Venice after the Fourth Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

On the wall above and at the sides of the main doorway are the [[Four Evangelists]] and saints, 11th-century mosaics, the oldest in the building, that decorated the old facade to St Mark’s even before the narthex was built.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
[[File:Veneto Venezia2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|View from the main crossing dome to the eastern apse]]
The interior is based on a Greek cross, with each arm divided into three naves with a dome of its own as well as the main dome above the crossing. The dome above the crossing and the western dome are bigger than the other three. This is based on Constantine's Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople.

The marble floor (12th century, but underwent many restorations) is entirely tessellated in geometric patterns and animal designs. One particular panel in the pavement shows two [[rooster|cock]]s carrying a trussed-up fox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/39911172@N08/3715513816/|title=Venice Basilica San Marco interior 07 Mural 2 cocks carrying a fox|publisher=[[Flickr]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been interpreted politically by some, as a reference to the French conquest of [[Milan]] in the [[Italian Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaHt76Uk2m8C&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=church+two+cocks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C3HEdx-atB&amp;sig=Gni4XJfAcPBUCS4P4y-OpdVhUao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QJCuTcSJAYLBtgeszcHdAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=cocks|title=Venice: A Documentary History, 1450-1630|first=David|last=Sanderson|last2=Chambers|first2=Jennifer|last3=Fletcher|first3=Brian S. Pullan|publisher=Renaissance Society of America|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others see it as a sacred symbol of the faithful wish for immortality, with the victory of the cross, and "analogous to the hope of resurrection, the victory of the soul over death".&lt;ref&gt;The Theme of Cockfighting in Burgundian Romanesque Sculpture, Ilene H. Forsyth&amp;nbsp;– Speculum: A Journal of Medieval Studies Vol. 53, No. 2 (Apr., 1978), pp. 252–282&amp;nbsp;– Publisher: Medieval Academy of America&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques used were [[opus sectile]] and [[opus tessellatum]].

The lower register of walls and [[Column|pillars]] is completely covered with polychrome [[marble]] slabs. The transition between the lower and the upper register is delimited all around the basilica by passageways which largely substituted the former galleries.

===Mosaics===
The upper levels of the interior are completely covered with bright [[mosaic]]s covering an area of about 8000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The great majority use the traditional background of [[gold glass]] [[tesserae]], creating the shimmering overall effect.  Unfortunately, the Doge retained a workshop of mosaicists until the late 18th century, and in the 19th century contracted a mosaic workshop run by the [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]] glassmaking firm, and the majority of the medieval mosaics have been "restored" by removing and resetting, usually with a considerable loss of quality, so that "only about one-third of the mosaic surface can be regarded as original".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6-11, 10 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving work, in the main porch, perhaps dates to as early as 1070, and was probably by a workshop that had left Constantinople in the mid-11th century and worked at [[Torcello Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;  They are in "a fairly pure Byzantine style" but in succeeding phases of work Byzantine influence reflecting the latest style of the capital was reduced by stages, disappearing altogether by about the 1130s, after which the style was Italian in essentials, reflecting "a change from a colonial to a local art".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 37-38, 189 (quoted)&lt;/ref&gt;  The main period of decoration was the 12th century, a period of deteriorating relations between Venice and Byzantium, but very little is known about the process or how it was affected by politics.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Veneza118.jpg|thumb|Overview of mosaics, looking east]]
[[File:Mosaico traslazione San Marco Venezia.JPG|thumb|Mosaic of the translation of the body of Saint Mark]]
[[File:Part of the Entrance to St Mark's Basilica in Venice.jpg|250px|thumb|Part of the mosaic at the entrance to St Mark's Basilica.]]
The main work on the interior mosaics was apparently complete by the 1270s, with work on the atrium continuing into the 1290s. After that the St Marks workshop seems to have been disbanded, so that when a fire in 1419 caused serious damage, the only Venetian capable of the work had just died and the [[Signoria of Florence]] had to be asked for help; they sent [[Paolo Uccello]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the restorations tried to retain the medieval compositions and replicate a medieval style, but from 1509 the policy changed and further work was in contemporary styles. From the 1520s a series of Venetian painters were able to get commissions for the replacement of undamaged areas in what was considered to be superior modern style, until from 1610 a number of conservation-minded decrees attempted to restrain the process.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The large and complicated programme of the decoration centres on the seated large [[Christ Pantocrator]] in the main apse (now a 15th-century recreation) above patron saints of Venice. The East dome over the high altar has a bust of Christ in the centre surrounded by standing prophets and the Virgin Mary, with the [[Four Evangelists]] in the [[pendentive]]s. A large and comprehensive cycle of the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] occupies much of the roof, with usually extensive coverage for the Middle Ages of his miracles, originally shown in 29 scenes in the transepts. It includes the [[Ascension of Christ]] in the central dome and [[Pentecost]] in the west dome.  The centre is an [[etimasia]] ("empty throne") with book and dove, with the [[twelve apostles]] seated round the outer rims, with flames on their heads and rays connecting them to the central throne. Below the apostles pairs of figures representing the "nations", with ''tituli'', stand between the windows.  Similar images are found in the [[Chludov Psalter]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 55-57, and plate 13; also Parani, 196. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAUMM3cU_UoC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA240&amp;ots=hD-45Z7Svh&amp;dq=Hetoimasia%20Hagia%20Sophia&amp;pg=RA1-PA241#v=onepage&amp;q=Hetoimasia%20Hagia%20Sophia&amp;f=false here] for further details]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the miracles the transepts contain cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]] before and during the Infancy of Christ.  As well as many saints, church fathers, virtues and angels, there are scenes from the lives of Saints Mark, Clement, Peter, and John (with many scenes in post-Renaissance versions). The west wall has a 13th-century [[deesis]] below a [[Last Judgement]] in the vault, and a huge [[Tree of Jesse]] was added to the end wall of the north transept in 1548.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 10-11 for summary, full coverage in later chapters.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the [[iconography]] of the Old Testament cycle in the porch in the Cotton Genesis manuscript has been described above; similar relationships have been traced for parts of the interior mosaics, in particular with the cycle of the Life of the Virgin and Infancy of Christ sharing a common Byzantine model with a [[fresco]] cycle in the cathedral at the [[Mirozhsky Monastery]] in [[Pskov]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, restorations and replacements were often necessary thereafter, or done even when not necessary, and great painters such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Jacopo Tintoretto]] and his son [[Domenico Tintoretto|Domenico]] were among those who produced the designs for the mosaicists. [[Titian]] and the [[Padovanino]] prepared the [[cartoon]]s for the sacristy, built in the late 15th century. Other mosaics decorate the Baptistery, the Mascoli Chapel, St Isidor Chapel and the Zen Chapel, which has scenes from the life of St Mark, perhaps from the 1270s, and among the latest work of the original programme to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 179-182&lt;/ref&gt;

===The presbytery===
[[File:Meister der Ikone des Erzengels Michael 001 adjusted.jpg|thumb|10th-century gold and enamel Byzantine [[icon]] of [[St Michael]], in the treasury]]

The eastern arm has a raised [[presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] with a [[crypt]] beneath. The presbytery is separated by an  [[Rood screen|altar screen]] formed by eight red marble columns crowned with a high Crucifix and statues by [[Pier Paolo Dalle Masegne|Pier Paolo]] and  [[Jacobello Dalle Masegne]], masterpiece of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] sculpture (late 14th century). Behind the screen, marble banisters with Sansovino's bronze statues of the Evangelists and [[Girolamo Paliari|Paliari]]'s of the Four Doctors mark the access to the high [[altar]], which contains St Mark’s relics. Above the high altar is a canopy (“[[ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]]”) on columns decorated with fine [[relief]]s. The [[altarpiece]] is the famous [[Pala d'Oro]], a masterpiece of Byzantine craftsmanship, originally designed for an [[antependium]].This masterpiece incorporates 1,300 pearls, 300 sapphires, 300 emeralds, and 400 garnets. They are all original and highly polished, unfaceted gems. The original altar frontal is now in the treasury.  The choir stalls are embellished with inlay by Fra [[Sebastiano Schiavone]], and above them on both sides are three [[relief]]s by Sansovino.

Behind the presbytery are the [[sacristy]] and a 15th-century church consecrated to [[Theodore of Amasea|St Theodore]] (the first patron saint of Venice) where is displayed a painting (Child’s Adoration) by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].

===The treasury===
The treasury contains what is now a unique collection of Byzantine portable objects in metalwork, enamel and [[hardstone carving]], most looted from Constantinople after the Fourth Crusade (although there was a serious fire in the treasury in 1231), with probably a new influx after the "Franks" were expelled in 1261.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 65-66, 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter most objects were made locally, though there are also important Islamic works, especially in [[rock crystal]], and some from Northern Europe. Selections have toured internationally.

Most of the church plate was ordered to be surrendered to the state immediately after the end of the Venetian Republic in 1797, and was melted down for coining; there were only 141 objects in an inventory ordered by the Austrians in 1816, many in materials that could not be recycled for cash.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 67&lt;/ref&gt; The group of Byzantine hardstone vessels in various semi-precious stones is by the most important to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; A glass [[situla (vessel)|situla]] or bucket carved with [[Dionysus|Bacchic]] figures been dated to either the 4th or 7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th-century "throne-reliquary" in rather crudely carved [[alabaster]], the ''Sedia di San Marco'', was moved from the high altar to the Treasury in 1534.  It would only fit a bishop with a slight figure, and has a large compartment for relics below the seat. It may have functioned as a "throne-lectern" or resting place for a [[gospel book]], making actual the [[hetoimasia]] ("empty throne") images with open books that are found in art of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 98-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasury "now houses the best single collection of Byzantine metalwork, and particularly of enameling, that survives", including two imperial chalices of antique [[sardonyx]] with Byzantine gold and enamel mounts, marked "Romanos", the name of four emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 105&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3345.jpg|thumbnail|St. Mark's, interior looking diagonally to the left transept (Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives - the Goodyear Archival Collection).]]

===Right transept===
On the right of the screen is the platform from which the newly elected doge appeared. In the left aisle are [[Clement of Metz|St Clement]]’s chapel and the Holy Host altar. Here is the pillar where St Mark’s relics were rediscovered in 1094, as depicted in the interesting mosaics of the right aisle (where the entrance to St Mark’s Treasure is)..

===Left transept===
On the left of the screen is the platform for readings from Scripture; on the right aisle are [[St Peter]]’s chapel and the [[commons:File:Nicopeia.jpg|Madonna Nicopeia]], a venerated Byzantine icon. On the northern side are St Isidor’s chapel and the Mascoli chapel.

==Music==
[[File:Venice SMarco Vault2.jpg|thumb|Dome with [[Pentecost]] and [[pendentive]]s with angels]]
{{main|Cappella Marciana}}
The spacious interior of the building with its multiple choir lofts was the inspiration for the development of a [[Venetian polychoral style]] among the composers appointed [[maestro di cappella]] at the [[Cappella Marciana|choir of St Mark's]]. The style was first developed by a foreigner, [[Adrian Willaert]], and was continued by Italian organists and composers: [[Andrea Gabrieli]], his nephew [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]. Their music took advantage of the spacious architecture and led to the development of [[polychoral]] and [[antiphonal]] textures. An example of this technique is found in [[In Ecclesiis]] by Giovanni Gabrieli.

==In scientific discourse==
One of the most well-known and widely cited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?cites=8886524888381702203&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en|title=Google Scholar|publisher=Scholar.google.ca|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; papers in biology is "The [[Spandrel]]s of San Marco and the [[Panglossian]] Paradigm: A Critique of the [[Adaptationist]] Programme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=S.J.|author2=Lewontin, R.C. |authorlink2=Richard Lewontin|authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould|title=The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: A critique of the adaptationist programme|year=1979|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=205|issue=1161|pages=581–598|doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086|pmid=42062|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on an analogy between the beautifully decorated spandrels spaced around the domes in the basilica, which sit on four arches (technically, the structures are [[pendentive]]s rather than spandrels), and various biological traits and features. The authors, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]], argue that the spandrels are the inevitable spaces that exist when a dome is placed above arches rather than design elements and that many biological traits are similarly the side effects of functional traits rather than adaptive traits in themselves.

'''The Dazzle Dancers''' are a performance group founded in 1996 in New York City's [[Tompkins Square Park]] during Wignot (the first year that [[Wigstock]] didn't happen in the park) by artist Mike Albo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/19468/Mike_Albo/index.aspx HarperCollins author biography, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; (aka Dazzle Dazzle) and Grover Guinta&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-07-23/columns/ny-mirror The ''Village Voice'', by [[Michael Musto]], July 23, 2002, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; (aka Vinnie Dazzle). The male and female dancers appear in spare costumes or [[nude]] at festivals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dazzledancers.com/press/artforum-artparade2006.jpg ''artforum'' magazine, September 9, 2006, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; night clubs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dazzledancers.com/press_nypress.html New York Press, Sept.25-Oct. 1, 2002, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipster]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dazzledancers.com/press/penthouse.jpg ''Penthouse'', December 2006, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/n_8671/index2.htm ''New York Magazine', May 5, 2003, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-08-19/nyc-life/dancing-naked-in-the-dark/1 ''The Village Voice'', August 19, 2003, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dazzle Dancers have performed nationally at many late-night clubs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/gossip/archives/2002/10/20021009_nude+dudes.htm New York Post, October 9, 2002, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coney Island]] Amusement Park,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dazzledancers.com/press/nypost-coney.jpg New York Post, March 15, 2007, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dazzledancers.com/press/metro-coney.jpg New York Metro, March 15, 2007, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://licktheweb.com/articles/reviews/dazzledancers.html Long Island ''Community Konnection'', accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wigstock]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-08-16/nyc-life/angel-headed-hipsters-get-ready-for-wigstock/ The ''Village Voice'', August 16, 2005, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Burning Man]] Festival in Nevada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mccullagh.org/theme/dazzle-dancers.html Declan McCullagh Photography, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and onstage with the band [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] to a crowd of 20,000 people at the Millennium New Year's Eve Celebration in Miami, Florida.
 
In 2005 the Dazzle Dancers were a central theme in a feature film, the romantic gay comedy ''[[Adam &amp; Steve]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamandstevemovie.com/oldsite/castcrew.htm Official movie site, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamandstevemovie.com/oldsite/castcrew.htm ''OutUK'' accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372122/ IMDB, accessed July 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their costume designer is Matthew Flower, better known as Machine Dazzle, who has noted in an interview with [http://www.imaginefashion.com/ Imagine Fashion] that his designs are like sacred objects to him and believes in the transformative quality of costumes.&lt;ref name="ImagineFashionMachineDazzle"&gt;[http://www.imaginefashion.com/ladies-gentlemen/sacred-objects-machine-dazzle ''Sacred Objects'']: Imagine Fashion interview with designer Machine Dazzle (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Englishman's Library''''' was an English book series of the 1840s, a venture of the publisher [[James Burns (publisher)|James Burns]]. It ran eventually to 31 volumes.

The title had been used already in 1824, for ''The Englishman's library'', edited by E. H. L., published by [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Englishman|title=The Englishman's Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdgGAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1824}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was announced in ambitious fashion in the ''[[British Critic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Critic, Quarterly Theological Review, and Ecclesiastical Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUUDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1839|publisher=C. &amp; J. Rivington, and J. Mawman|pages=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started by [[William Gresley (divine)|William Gresley]] and [[Edward Churton]], with propagandistic aims; the works are still a source for the "[[condition of England]]" debate of the time. Gresley wrote six novels for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Sutherland|title=The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzJ3yNVVqtUC&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=6 January 2013|date=1 November 1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1842-4|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
According to its prospectus, the Library aimed to "unite a popular style with sound Christian principles". The announced authors did not in fact all contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Henry Newman|title=Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman: Littlemore and the parting of friends May 1842-October 1843|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_SWAJPBo5wC&amp;pg=PA300|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925458-3|page=300 note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those behind the series were younger [[High Church]] men who wished to imitate some of the success of the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]''. They were less hostile to the Tractarians than older, more orthodox members of the [[Hackney Phalanx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter B.

'''''The Great White Hope''''' is a 1970 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Romance film|romantic]] [[drama film]] written and [[Film adaptation|adapted from]] the [[Howard Sackler]] [[The Great White Hope|play of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/theater/76934977.pdf|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1968-10-04|author=[[Clive Barnes]]|title=Theater: Howard Sackler's 'Great White Hope'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E5D91E3EE034BC4A52DFB667838B669EDE|date=1970-10-12|title='Great White Hope' Brought to Screen|author=[[Vincent Canby]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sackler | first=Howard  | title=The Great White Hope, A Play | location=New York, NY | publisher=The Dial Press, Inc | year=1968 | oclc=451597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was directed by [[Martin Ritt]], starring [[James Earl Jones]], [[Jane Alexander]], [[Chester Morris]], [[Hal Holbrook]], [[Beah Richards]] and [[Moses Gunn]]. Jones and Alexander, who also appeared in the same roles in the stage versions, both received [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for their performances.

The film and play is based on the true story of [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and his first wife, Etta Terry Duryea, and the controversy over their marriage and Duryea's death by suicide in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/knockout/women.html Unforgivable Blackness] accessed 11/5/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set between 1910 and 1915, the story follows Jack Jefferson, patterned after real-life boxer, [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], going on a hot streak of victories in the boxing ring as he defeats every white boxer around. Soon the press and racists announce the search for a "great white hope", a boxer who will defeat Jefferson for the heavyweight title. Meanwhile, Jefferson prepares for a few more matches, but he lets his guard down by courting the beautiful, and very white, Eleanor Bachman, and when everyone, including Jack's black "wife", discover this, the tensions grow to fever pitch. Jack's close black friends become scared over his pushing the envelope of success and the white authorities conspire to frame him with unlawful sexual relations with Eleanor and thereby take away his title. It leads to jealousy, a run from the law, and finally, disaster.

==Cast==
* [[James Earl Jones]] as Jack Jefferson
* [[Jane Alexander]] as Eleanor Bachman
* [[Chester Morris]] as Pop Weaver
* [[Hal Holbrook]] as Al Cameron
* [[Beah Richards]] as Mama Tiny
* [[Moses Gunn]] as Scipio
* Lou Gilbert as Goldie
* [[Robert Webber]] as Dixon

==Reception==
The film opened to positive responses from both audiences and critics. They especially loved the performances of both [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Jane Alexander]], who were in the original stage play: they won [[Tony award|Tonys]] for the play. Jones would get bigger roles after this film, and Alexander made a debut here. Jones later contributed commentary to a documentary about Jack Johnson that would sum up this film, saying: "To know the story of Jack Johnson is to know that it is a study in [[hubris]]."

However, critical opinion of the film has declined in recent years. ''The Great White Hope'' currently maintains a 43% "Rotten" approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 7 reviews, indicating mixed-to-negative reviews. Critic Vincent Canby referred to the film as "One of those liberal, well-meaning, fervently uncontroversial works that pretend to tackle contemporary problems by finding analogies at a safe remove in history" while critic Emanuel Levy wrote "The movie is too theatrical and every idea is spelled out for the audience."

'''''The Lost Letter''''' ({{lang-uk|Пропала Грамота|Propala Hramota}}, {{lang-ru|Пропавшая грамота|Propavshaya gramota}}) is a 1972 Soviet musical-[[tragicomedy]] film by [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]] in [[Kiev]]. The movie is considered a pearl of Ukrainian cinema. The film is based on the novella ''[[The Lost Letter: A Tale Told by the Sexton of the N...Church]]'' by [[Nikolai Gogol]] from cycle ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]''.

== Synopsis ==
Cossack Vasyl ([[Ivan Mykolaichuk]]) prepares himself for a mounted voyage to [[Saint Petersburg|Peterburg]], the capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. Vasyl carries a hramota (sealed official document) given to him by the [[hetman]] through his secretary, Pereverny-Kruchenko, that is rumored to cost ten [[Pood]]s of gold. Vasyl's wife sews the hramota into his hat and his father ([[Vasyl Symchych]]) gives him magic tobacco to repel evil and an advice to find a good co-journeyman. 

The film depicts the adventures of Vasyl in sequences that are filled with [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian culture]], and shows [[Ukrainian cuisine]], costumes, traditions, mystical and comedy-filled situations, anecdotes, and a plethora of obstacles which Vasyl must overcome. On his way together with an evil servant ([[chort]]) he comes to a river crossing where a ferry carries people from one side to another. There he finds his partner in arms, Andriy, a [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|zaporozhian cossack]]. Further along the way, something happens to the papers when they stop at an inn to rest. When Vasyl and Andriy arrive in St. Petersburg, they hand over the hramota to the baroness ''von Likhtenberg'' who passes them to the empress. The documents do not carry any information and Vasyl has to leave without results. 

On the way home, both of them decide to shoot each other. As they are saying in [[unison]] the [[Nicene Creed]] (Apostles' Creed) they hear a voice that identifies itself as Kudz coming from a nearby rock, saying he was the same chort and the witch turned him into a rock after he helped Vasyl. Kudz asks them to throw him in a nearby marsh so as not to cause any further harm to random travelers on the road. As Vasyl arrives with his friend near their village, [[Dykanka]], they meet a little boy who asks them to let him go to see the cossack, Vasyl who had supposedly returned from having seen the empress. Then they arrive and are met by the rest of the village population. Moments later, everybody awaits Vasyl again by his house to tell the story of his rendezvous with the empress. In the last scene, he wishes the little boy to have a loyal horse, an open field, and always be at people's service. The scene is accompanied by the triumphant ''Cossack march'' of the Ukrainian folkloric song about [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny|Sahaidachny]].

== Cast ==
* [[Ivan Mykolaichuk]] - cossack Vasyl
* [[Lidia Vakula]] - cossack's wife, the empress
* [[Fedir Stryhun]] - [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|zaporozhets]], cossack's partner
* [[Zemfira Tsakhilova]] - Odarka, baroness von Likhtenberg
* [[Mykhailo Holubovych]] - evil man (the role voiced actor [[Pavel Morozenko]])
**He's seen on the background of the photo as the owner of the inn ({{lang-uk|корчмар}}, ''korchmar'') in the episode.
* [[Volodymyr Hlukhyi]] - weird man
* [[Vasyl Symchych]] - cossack's father
* [[Anatoliy Barchuk]] - cossack Ivan

==Administrative issues==
The film was supposed to be directed by Viktor Hres, featuring [[Anatoly Papanov]] in the lead role. However, when Hres became suddenly ill, he offered it to Borys Ivchenko. The latter agreed on the condition that the main role would be given to [[Ivan Mykolaychuk]]. The script was remade and the movie was filmed in 1972 at the [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]]. However, Soviet censors banned it from being screened. Nevertheless, in 1973 the Bureau of Soviet Cinematography Propaganda in Moscow published 50 thousand pamphlets with images of Ivan Mykolaychuk in role of Cossack Vasyl. 

The movie was finally released after the fall of the Soviet Union. It received the [[Golden Pagoda Award]] during the movie festival in [[Bangkok]] (see [[Cinema of Thailand]]). All the songs in the movie were contributed by Ivan Mykolaychuk, who also helped [[Ivan Drach]] write the movie's script.

'''The Prince Eugen Culture Prize''' is named after the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke|Prince Eugén]] (1865&amp;ndash;1947),who had a close connection to [[Norway]] and dedicated his life to strengthen the Swedish-Norwegian relations.

Through his position as royalty, the artistic prince was well-connected to the Norwegian public and cultural life, which he carefully followed while giving support to young artists. He was also involved in the Norwegian and Swedish musical scene and was a member of the committee of the construction of Stockholm Concert Hall. He was well known in the Scandinavian literature circles, and was an active reader of fiction, history and politics.

The Prince Eugen Culture Prize was founded to celebrate the 100 year mark of the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian union in 1905 after an initiative from the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Stockholm, in cooperation with Crown Princess Märtha's Church Council in Stockholm and Princess Märtha Louise's Culture Fund. The Prince Eugen Culture Prize is awarded to one Norwegian and one Swedish artist who through their work have contributed to strengthen Swedish-Norwegian relations. The award consists of a diploma and 50 000 Swedish crowns.

Through the years, the award has been presented by [[Queen Sonja of Norway]], [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Crown Princess Victoria]] and [[Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland|Princess Madeleine of Sweden]].

'''''The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things''''' is a painting attributed to [[Hieronymus Bosch]]&lt;ref&gt;Silva Maroto, Pilar (ed.) (2016). El Bosco. La exposición del V centenario. Madrid: Museo Nacional del Prado. {{ISBN|978-84-848-0316-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Garrido and R. Van Schoote (2001). Bosch At The Museo Del Prado: a technical Study. Aldeasa, Madrid. {{ISBN|978-8480032650}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to a follower of his,&lt;ref&gt;Ilsink, Matthijs; Koldeweij, Jos (2016). Hieronymus Bosch: Painter and Draughtsman – Catalogue raisonné. Yale University Press. p. 504. {{ISBN|978-0-300-22014-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; completed around 1500 or later. Since 1898 its authenticity has been questioned several times. In 2015 the Bosch Research Conservation Project claimed it to be by a follower, but scholars at the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]], where the painting hangs, dismissed this argument. The painting is oil on wooden panels and is presented in a series of circular images.

Four small circles, detailing the [[four last things]] — [[Death]], [[Divine judgment|Judgment]], [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], and [[Christian views on hell|Hell]] — surround a larger circle in which the [[seven deadly sins]] are depicted: [[anger|wrath]] at the bottom, then (proceeding clockwise) [[envy]], [[Seven deadly sins#Greed|greed]], [[gluttony]], [[sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]], extravagance (later replaced with [[lust]]), and [[pride]], using scenes from life rather than [[allegorical]] representations of the sins.&lt;ref name=BoschBruegel&gt;{{cite book|year=1980|author=Claudia Lyn Cahan and Catherine Riley|isbn=0-517-30373-6|title=Bosch~Bruegel and the Northern Renaissance|publisher=Avenal Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of the large circle, which is said to represent the [[Eye of Providence|eye of God]], is a "pupil" in which [[Jesus|Christ]] can be seen [[Resurrection of Jesus|emerging from his tomb]]. Below this image is the [[Latin]] inscription ''Cave cave d[omi]n[u]s videt'' ("Beware, Beware, The Lord Sees").

Above and below the central image are inscription in Latin of [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] [[Song of Moses|32:28–29]], containing the lines "For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them", above, and "O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!" below.

==Disputed authorship and dating==
In 1560, [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote about a pupil of Bosch, an unnamed ''discipulo'' (pupil), who was as good as his master and even signed his works with his master's name.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe de Guevara (1560), ''Commentarios de la Pintura''.  English summary and commentary in: Stechow, Wolfgang, (1966), ''Northern Renaissance Art 1400-1600: Sources and Documents'' (paperback 1989, pp. 19-20).&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after this, and without starting a new paragraph, Guevara refers to the painting of the ''Seven Deadly Sins'' as characteristic of his style. This led some scholars, as early as Dollmayr (1898) and most vocally Stechow (1966), to ascribe the work to this pupil. 

Most experts have argued since, however, that given the highly ambiguous nature of the passage, Guevara had probably returned to a description of the works of Bosch himself. Furthermore, the accuracy and authority of Guevara is suspect: when in 1570 Guevara's heirs sold a copy of ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]'' to [[Phillip II of Spain]], it was made clear that Guevara had regarded that work as the original painted by Bosch himself, whilst nowadays it is known that his was a copy (displayed in [[El Escorial]]), of the original hanging in [[Prado]]. [[Phillip II of Spain]] himself purchased the work (prior to 1560, probably from a monastery art sale) in the belief that ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' was a Bosch original, and he always regarded it as such. It was his favourite Bosch painting and it hung in his own bedroom in [[El Escorial]]. When he donated the painting to [[El Escorial]] in 1574, it was cataloged as being a Bosch original; Silva Maroto argued that it is hard to believe that Guevara would question the authorship of Phillip's favourite Bosch {{clarify |text=in an ambiguous manuscript that remained unpublished until 1788.|reason=Antecedent unclear. Was the unpublished letter written by Silva Maroto or Guevara? Please give evidence within the reference tags, including page numbers.|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Silva Maroto, Pilar (ed.) (2016). ''El Bosco. La exposición del V centenario''. Madrid: [[Museo Nacional del Prado]]. {{ISBN|978-84-848-0316-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged poor quality of the drawing had led to the incorrect belief it dates from Bosch's early period. The attribution to the ''discipulo'' was revived in the catalogue of the 2001 Bosch exhibition in [[Rotterdam]], by Vermet and Vandenbroeck, who also suggested that several of the costumes suggest a much later date, around 1500, so that the awkward drawing and execution cannot be attributed to youthful imperfection. They also noted that the painting is not on oak, adding to their doubts about the attribution to Bosch.&lt;ref&gt;Koldeweij, J., P. Vandenbroeck, J. and Vermet, B. (2001), ''Jheronimus Bosch: The complete paintings and drawings'', [[Harry N. Abrams]], {{ISBN|978-0810967359}}, pp. 93 and 178.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nowadays, most art historians agree that the costumes point at a date in between 1505 and 1510; it is argued that the key characteristics of the underlying drawing, the way the pictorial surface was developed, and the variety of strokes are entirely consistent with Bosch's later paintings. Furthermore, the theme, symbolism and the composition itself is profoundly original, which would make it extremely unlikely that an unknown pupil could have painted it.&lt;ref&gt;C. Garrido and R. Van Schoote (2001). ''Bosch At The Museo Del Prado: A Technical Study''. Aldeasa, Madrid. {{ISBN|978-8480032650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ed Hoffman argued for the work being a copy, perhaps ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]] after the original had been damaged. In his view, the amateurish style, the plump figures, the lack of white highlights and the fact that the wooden panel is not oak but poplar (which can't be dated with [[dendrochronology]]). An argument for the authenticity, or at least originality, of the work could be found in the [[pentimenti]] of the underpainting, which indicate it could not have been a simple faithful reproduction. In addition, there is no question signature in the painting is that of Bosch himself, and not a [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman2005"&gt;Ed Hoffman, 2005, "Een echte 'Jheronimus Bosch'? : Tien aandachtspunten", ''Bossche Bladen'' '''3''': 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, the Bosch Research and Conservation Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boschproject.org/|title=Bosch Research and Conservation Project |website=boschproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been responsible, since 2007, for technical research on most of Bosch's paintings, rejected the attribution to Bosch and deemed it to be made by a follower, most likely the ''discipulo''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2066164-twee-beroemde-werken-toch-niet-van-jeroen-bosch.html Twee beroemde werken toch niet van Jeroen Bosch], NOS, 31 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Prado Museum stated that they still consider the piece to be authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferrer|first1=Isabel|title=¿Pintó El Bosco los ‘pecados’ de El Prado?|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2015/10/31/actualidad/1446299443_830382.html|work=[[El País]]|date=1 November 2015|quote=El Museo del Prado, de Madrid, por el contrario, cree que la tabla sí es del artista, y sus propias conclusiones aparecerán en mayo, cuando la exposición viaje a Madrid. [The Museo del Prado, Madrid, by contrast, believes that the table itself is by the artist, and their own conclusions appear in May when the exhibition travels to Madrid.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Each panel in the outer circle depicts a different sin. Clockwise from top (Latin names in brackets):

# [[Gluttony]] (''gula''): A drunkard swigs from a bottle while a fat man eats greedily, not heeding the plea of his equally obese young son.
# [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] (''acedia''): A lazy man dozes in front of the fireplace while Faith appears to him in a dream, in the guise of a nun, to remind him to say his prayers.
# [[Lust]] (''luxuria''): Two couples enjoy a picnic in a pink tent, with two clowns (right) to entertain them.
# [[Pride]] (''superbia''): With her back to the viewer, a woman looks at her reflection in a mirror held up by a demon.
# [[Wrath]] (''ira''): A woman attempts to break up a fight between two drunken peasants.
# [[Envy]] (''invidia''): A couple standing in their doorway cast envious looks at a rich man with a hawk on his wrist and a servant to carry his heavy load for him, while their daughter flirts with a man standing outside her window, with her eye on the well-filled purse at his waist. The dogs illustrate the Flemish saying, “Two dogs and only one bone, no agreement”.
# [[Greed]] (''avaricia''): A crooked judge pretends to listen sympathetically to the case presented by one party to a lawsuit, while slyly accepting a bribe from the other party.

The four small circles also have details. In Death of the Sinner, death is shown at the doorstep along with an angel and a demon while the priest says the sinner's last rites, In Glory, the saved are entering Heaven, with Jesus and the saints, at the gate of Heaven an Angel prevents a demon from ensnaring a woman. Saint Peter is shown as the gatekeeper. In Judgment, Christ is shown in glory while angels awake the dead, while in the Hell demons torment sinners according to their sins.

[[Toilet paper]] when used with a [[toilet roll holder]] with a horizontal [[axle]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the floor and also parallel to the wall has two possible orientations: the toilet paper may hang ''over'' (in front of) or ''under'' (behind) the roll; if perpendicular to the wall, the two orientations are right-left or near-away. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. In surveys of US consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60–70 percent of respondents prefer ''over''.

Some people hold strong opinions on the matter; advice columnist [[Ann Landers]] said that the subject was the most responded to (15,000 letters in 1986) and controversial issue in her column's history. Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, the ease of detaching individual sheets, and compatibility with setting specifics such as [[recreational vehicle]]s or having pets. Some writers have proposed connections to age, sex, or political philosophy, and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;For pros and cons, including RVs and cats, see [[#Arguments|Arguments]]; for celebrities and experts, including Ann Landers, see [[#Noted preferences|Noted preferences]]; for theories, see [[#Themes|Themes]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Solutions range from compromise, to using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms entirely, or simply ignoring the issue altogether. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation, and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.&lt;ref&gt;The enthusiast, Bill Jarrett, and the inventor, Curtis Batts, are described in [[#Solutions|Solutions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Motivations for study}}Context and relevance==
In the article "Bathroom Politics: Introducing Students to Sociological Thinking from the Bottom Up",{{sfn|Burns|2003}} [[Eastern Institute of Technology]] [[sociology]] professor Edgar Alan Burns describes some reasons toilet paper politics is worthy of examination. On the first day of Burns' introductory course in sociology, he asks his students, "Which way do you think a roll of toilet paper should hang?"{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=111}} In the following fifty minutes, the students examine why they picked their answers, exploring the [[social construction]] of "rules and practices which they have never consciously thought about before".{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=113}} 

Burns' activity has been adopted by a [[social psychology]] course at the [[University of Notre Dame]], where it is used to illustrate the principles of [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]]'s 1966 classic ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.{{sfn|Collett|2008}} 

[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], classifies the choice of toilet paper orientation under "tastes, preferences, and interests" as opposed to either [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] or "attitudes, traits, norms, and needs". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests are an important part of [[identity (social science)|identity]]; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's "sense of uniqueness". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls "the 'get a life' folks among us" who elevate interests into moral issues.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pp=173–175}}

[[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a [[chest of drawers]] to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that [[neuroimaging]] experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from [[mental rotation]] and [[facial expression]]s to grocery shopping and [[tickling]]—must strive to avoid such [[cultural bias]] and [[stereotype]]s.{{sfn|Gernsbacher|2007}}

In his book ''[[Conversational Capital]]'', Bertrand Cesvet gives toilet paper placement as an example of [[ritual]]ized behavior—one of the ways designers and marketers can create a memorable experience around a product that leads to [[word-of-mouth]] momentum. Cesvet's other examples include shaking a box of [[Tic Tac]]s and dissecting [[Oreo]] cookies.{{sfn|Cesvet|Babinski|Alper|2008|p=68}}

Broadcaster [[Jim Bohannon]] has said that such issues are good for [[talk radio]]: "It is an interactive medium, a certain kind of clash, it doesn't have to be a violent clash, but at least a disagreement would certainly be at the top of the list. It has to be something that's of general interest."{{sfn|Voice of America|2004}}

==Arguments for over or under==

[[File:ToiletPaper Boo WrongWay.jpg|thumb|Paper mounted ''under'' with upside-down images and text]]
The main reasons given by people to explain why they hang their toilet paper a given way are ease of grabbing and habit.{{sfn|Progressive Grocer|2010}} Some particular advantages cited for each orientation include:
* ''Over'' reduces the risk of accidentally brushing the wall or cabinet with one's knuckles, potentially transferring grime and germs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}: "The Kimberly-Clark company cites three advantages for rolling over: perforation control, viewing advantage and wall avoidance."; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Over'' makes it easier to visually locate and to grasp the loose end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Over'' gives hotels, cruise ships, office buildings, public places and homeowners with guest bathrooms the option [[hotel toilet paper folding|to fold over the last sheet]] to show that the room has been cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lind|1992}}; "The Grand Princess cruise ship replaces its toilet paper with the leading edge over the front, so that it can be folded as is done in five-star hotels. (Yes, someone really did ask this question.)" {{harv|Carpenter|1999}}; {{harvnb|Rosencrans|1998}}; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Over'' is generally the intended direction of viewing for the manufacturer's branding, so patterned toilet paper looks better this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1991b}}; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}; {{harvnb|Mitchell|Sugar|2005a}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Under'' provides a tidier appearance, in that the loose end can be more hidden from view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toilet Paper Orientation Re: Brandweek 2009| url=http://plumbersshrewsbury.co.uk/toilet-paper-orientation-brandweek-2009/ |accessdate=2015-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Under'' reduces the risk that a toddler or a house pet, such as a dog or cat, will completely unroll the toilet paper when batting at the roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darbo|2007}}; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}; {{harvnb|O'Connor|2005|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Under'' in a [[recreational vehicle]] may reduce unrolling during driving.{{sfn|Nerbas|2009}}

Partisans have claimed that each method makes it easier to tear the toilet paper on a [[perforated]] sheet boundary, depending on the direction of pulling and the use of a second hand to stabilize the roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}; {{harvnb|Weingarten|2008}}; {{harvnb|Keeran|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (A traveller from the U.S. to China in 1991 noted a different setup: non-perforated paper with a metal cutter above the roll, which obliges the ''over'' direction.){{sfn|Downey|Harrison|1993}}

It is unclear if one orientation is more economical than the other. The ''[[Centralian Advocate]]'' attributes a claim that ''over'' saves on paper usage to [[Planet Green]].{{sfn|McNatt|2010}}

In the academic field of [[evaluation]], [[Michael Scriven]] writes that the question of the correct way to insert toilet paper is a "one-item aptitude test" for measuring one's evaluation skills. These skills include the evaluative attitude, practical logical analysis, empathy, teaching, and being a quick study. To prove one's competence, one may either derive the "one right answer" or prove that the test is or is not culturally biased.{{sfn|Scriven|1991|loc="Evaluation Thesaurus", pp. 151–153, especially p. 153 for the quotations}}

===Survey results===
The question "Do you prefer that your toilet tissue unwinds over or under the spool?" is featured on the cover of Barry Sinrod and Mel Poretz's 1989 book ''The First Really Important Survey of American Habits''. The overall result: 68 percent chose over.{{sfn|Rubin|1989}} Sinrod explained, "To me, the essence of the book is the toilet paper question ... Either people don't care, or they care so much that they practically cause bodily injury to one another."{{sfn|Oldenburg|1989}} Poretz observed, "The toilet-paper question galvanizes people almost like the [[Miller Lite]] tastes-great/less-filling commercial."{{sfn|Mark Wolf Scripps Howard News Service|1990}}

In Bernice Kanner's 1995 book ''Are You Normal?'', 53 percent of survey respondents prefer ''over'', while "a fourth" prefer ''under'' and 8 percent do not know or care.{{sfn|Kanner|1995|pp=56, 120}}

''Sitting Pretty: The History of the Toilet'', a [[travelling exhibition]] that tours Canadian museums, asks visitors to register their preferred roll direction. When the exhibition reached [[Huntsville, Ontario]], in June 2001, 13,000 visitors had taken the survey, with 67 percent preferring ''over''.{{sfn|Ladan|2001}} At the [[Saint Boniface Museum]] in [[Winnipeg]] in February 2005, a voting machine registered 5,831 ''over'' versus 5,679 ''under'', or 51 percent ''over''. Saint Boniface's director noted, "I think there's been some cheating, though."{{sfn|Nestruck|2005}}

[[Georgia-Pacific]] commissioned a survey of Americans' bathroom habits in 1993 to launch its new [[Quilted Northern]] brand, and more surveys followed:&lt;ref&gt;The 1996 report, which may not have contained this question, was the fourth annual report: {{harv|McCarthey|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1993 Practices and Preferences of Toilet Paper Users: 73 percent ''over'' out of 1,200 respondents. The press release claims, "A first-of-its-kind survey has settled, once and for all, the great toilet paper debate."{{sfn|PR Newswire|1993}}
* 1994 Toilet Paper Report: 59 percent ''over'',{{sfn|Ortega|1995}} out of 1,000 respondents; conducted by KRC Research and Consulting{{sfn|Ciancio|1994}}
* 1995 Bathroom Tissue Report: 59 percent ''over'' versus 29 percent ''under'',{{sfn|Ciancio|1995}} out of 1,000 respondents; conducted by KRC Research and Consulting{{sfn|Ortega|1995}}
* 2001 Bathroom Confidential: 63 percent ''over'' out of 1,001 respondents; conducted by Impulse Research{{sfn|Dickson|2001}}
* 2004 Bathroom Confidential: 72 percent ''over''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ebenkamp|2004}}; {{harvnb|Pierson|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[American Standard Brands]] conducted a poll of "designers, contractors, dealers, distributors and other bath and kitchen reps"{{sfn|Toronto Star staff and news services|1993}} at the [[Kitchen/Bath Industry Show &amp; Conference]] in [[Atlanta]]. The question: "What is the correct and only way to hang the toilet paper – under or over?"{{sfn|Stark|1993}} ''Over'' won 59 percent of the vote, 1,826 to 1,256.{{sfn|Toronto Star staff and news services|1993}} American Standard spokeswoman Nora Monroe observed, "The bathroom is a territorial place. You'd be surprised how many people have definite opinions on this issue."{{sfn|Clark|1993}} In 2008, American Standard commissioned the 2008 Bathroom Habits Survey, a more traditional format conducted by [[Opinion Research Corporation]] with 1,001 respondents. This time, "three-quarters" answered ''over''.{{sfn|American Standard Press|2008}}

In 1995, a survey by [[Scott Paper Company]]'s "Cottonelle College of Freshness Knowledge" had "most Americans over 50" preferring ''over''.{{sfn|Harden|1995}} In another [[Cottonelle]] survey in 1999, 68 percent of respondents preferred ''over'' to 25 percent ''under''. Columnist Bonnie Henry hypothesizes of the others: "Meanwhile, 7 percent – no doubt bored beyond belief at this point by the inane questioning – had slipped into a deep, irreversible coma."{{sfn|Henry|1999}}

On January 27, 2010, the 100th anniversary of [[Thomas Crapper]]'s death,{{sfn|Progressive Grocer|2010}} Cottonelle launched a "Great Debate" advertising campaign, inviting American consumers to vote their preference at a [[Kimberly-Clark]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cottonellerollpoll.com/ CottonelleRollPoll.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The result was announced during the [[82nd Academy Awards]]: 72 percent had voted ''over''.{{sfn|Ode|2010}} In a more traditional preliminary survey of 1,000 Americans, Cottonelle found that "overs" are more likely than "unders" to notice a roll's direction (74 percent), to be annoyed when the direction is incorrect (24 percent), and to have flipped the direction at a friend's home (27 percent).{{sfn|PR Newswire|2010}}

The book does not note the number of respondents in each segment, so it is difficult to say whether any of the deviations are [[statistically significant]], but there does not seem to be a difference between men's and women's preferences. Nonetheless, such a difference has been claimed by other authors, in both directions. The American Standard conference poll concluded: "Many men voted for over, saying it made the paper easier to reach."{{sfn|Clark|1993}} Inventor Curtis Batts arrives at a different conclusion from his personal experience: "Women like it over, and men like it under. I think it bugs women when it touches the wall."{{sfn|Floyd|1999}} Advice columnist Ms Maud of ''[[The Press]]'' asserts that women prefer ''over'' because they are "logical thinkers".{{sfn|Ms Maud|2002}}

A Cottonelle survey indicated that men were more likely than women to notice, and become annoyed with, a toilet roll hung against their preference.{{sfn|Kimberly-Clark|2010}}

A [[popular-culture]] occurrence of a gender theory is found in the ''[[Weekly World News]]'', a [[supermarket tabloid]] that runs outlandish stories for comedic effect. In the 2003 story ''North Korea Shocker!'', the ''WWN'' claimed that North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]] was [[Passing (gender)|secretly female]]. As supporting evidence, Kim supposedly watched the [[Home Shopping Network]], is a member of [[Oprah's Book Club]], and "Yells at staffers who leave the toilet seat up and hang toilet paper rolls outward instead of inward."{{sfn|LaForte|2003}}

According to ''W. C. Privy's Original Bathroom Companion, Number 2'', "By more than 4 to 1, older folks prefer to have their toilet paper dispense over the front."{{sfn|Barrett|Mingo|2003|p=400}} The same claim is made by James Buckley's ''The Bathroom Companion'' for people older than 50.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=106}}

====Class and politics====
Sinrod observed of his survey, "60 percent of those who earn $50,000 or more prefer it to be over and 73 percent of those who earn less than $20,000 prefer under".{{sfn|Oldenburg|1989}} On what that proves: "I don't know, but it's sure interesting."{{sfn|Rubin|1989}}

In one [[local election]] in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], new [[voting machine]]s were given a trial run by asking the question, "Are you in favor of toilet paper in all public washrooms being installed with the loose end coming up and over the front of the roll?" The answer was yes: 768 to 196, or 80 percent ''over''. It was thought to be a question "which carried no political association".{{sfn|Landers|1998}} Yet one teenager's [[science project]] at the Southern Appalachian Science and Engineering Fair, and a favorite of the fair's coordinator, was a survey concluding that [[liberalism|liberals]] roll over while [[conservatism|conservatives]] roll under.{{sfn|Keim|1997}}

===Noted preferences===

Advice columnist [[Ann Landers]] ([[Eppie Lederer]]) was once asked which way toilet paper should hang. She answered ''under'', prompting thousands of letters in protest; she then recommended ''over'', prompting thousands more.{{sfn|Marelius|1987}} She reflected that the 15,000 letters made toilet paper the most controversial issue in her column's 31-year history,{{sfn|Toronto Star|1986}} wondering, "With so many problems in the world, why were thousands of people making an issue of tissue?"{{sfn|Marelius|1987}}

In November 1986, Landers told the [[Canadian Commercial Travellers Association]] that "Fine-quality toilet paper has designs that are right side up" in the ''over'' position.{{sfn|Toronto Star|1986}} In 1996, she explained the issue on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', where 68 percent of the [[studio audience]] favored ''over''; [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] suggested that ''under'' uses more paper.{{sfn|The Oprah Winfrey Show|1996}} In 1998, she wrote that the issue "seems destined to go on forever", insisting, "In spite of the fact that an overwhelming number of people prefer the roll hung so that the paper comes over the top, I still prefer to have the paper hanging close to the wall."{{sfn|Landers|1998}} On the day of her last column in 2002, Landers wrote, "P.S. The toilet paper hangs over the top."{{sfn|Landers|2002}} Her published commentary on the issue has even continued after her death. 2005 saw the premiere of a one-woman play written by [[David Rambo]]: a character study of Ann Landers titled ''The Lady with All the Answers''. Toilet paper comes up once again, and the actress surveys the audience for their opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welsh|2005}}; {{harvnb|Rawson|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article in ''Teaching Sociology'', Burns writes that the toilet paper hanging exercise is valuable in part because "[the] subject matter is familiar to everybody; everyone is an expert, and everyone has an opinion."{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=116}} Many entertainers, celebrities and businesspeople have publicized their opinion on the topic.

==Social consequences==
Toilet paper orientation is often mentioned as a hurdle for married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1999|pp=74–75}}; {{harvnb|Hogan|Hogan|2000|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue may also arise in businesses and public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lui|2009}}; {{harvnb|Grant|1991a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at the [[Amundsen–Scott Research Station]] at the [[South Pole]], complaints have been raised over which way to install toilet paper. During the six-month-long [[polar night]], a few dozen residents are stuck living together, and while many of the headaches of modern life are far away, food and hygiene are not. Despite the challenges posed by the hostile [[Antarctic climate]], "It is in the more mundane trials of everyday life that personality clashes are revealed."{{sfn|Daily Express|1999|p=39}}

==Solutions==

Some of the proposed solutions to this problem involve more or better technology, while others concentrate on human behavior.

===Mechanical===
The Tilt-A-Roll is a swiveling toilet paper dispenser invented by Curtis Batts in 1996, a [[Dallas]]-native [[industrial engineer]].{{sfn|Floyd|1999}} His patents on the invention, summarize its design as "An adjustable angle coupling secures the yoke to the mounting assembly and permits rotation of the yoke about an axis directed orthogonally through the spindle such that the paper roll can be oriented to unroll paper either from over or from under the roll as desired."&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|5588615}} and {{patent|US|5690302}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inventor named Rocky Hutson demonstrated a similar device he called the T.P. Swivel to the producers of the television program ''[[PitchMen]]'' in late 2009. {{sfn|Zayas|2009}}

Another solution is to install two toilet paper dispensers, as is more common in public restrooms and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|1999}}; {{harvnb|Marelius|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A reader of the ''[[Annie's Mailbox]]'' column recommends using a holder large enough to fit two rolls, noting that the roll mounted ''over'' is more popular. Another reader sidesteps the issue by foregoing the holder, instead piling five or six rolls in a big wicker basket.{{sfn|Mitchell|Sugar|2005b}} Even using separate bathrooms can help.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkins|1994}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions include vertical holders.

===Behavioral===
Toilet paper orientation has been used rhetorically as the ultimate issue that government has no business dictating, in letters to the editor protesting the regulation of [[noise pollution]]{{sfn|Ratzlaff|2009}} and stricter requirements to get a divorce.{{sfn|Wuthrich|2006}} In 2006, protesting [[New Hampshire]]'s [[List of smoking bans in the United States#New Hampshire|ban on smoking]] in restaurants and bars, representative Ralph Boehm ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]&amp;ndash;[[Litchfield, New Hampshire|Litchfield]]) asked "Will we soon be told which direction the toilet paper must hang from the roll?"{{sfn|Saunders|2006}}

David O'Connor's 2005 book ''Henderson's House Rules: The Official Guide to Replacing the Toilet Paper and Other Domestic Topics of Great Dispute'' aims to solve disagreements with a minimum of debate or compromise by offering authoritative, reasonable rules.{{sfn|O'Connor|2005|pp=2–3}} The "House Rule" for toilet paper is ''over and out'', and a full page is dedicated to a diagram of this orientation. But O'Connor writes that "if a female household member has a strong preference for the toilet paper to hang over and in, against the wall, that preference prevails. It is admittedly an odd preference, but women use toilet paper far more often than men—hence the rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|2005|pp=63–64}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edgar Degas - Waiting - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|380px|''Waiting'', 1880&amp;ndash;82. 48.2 cm x 61 cm. Norton Simon Museum at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], Los Angeles.]]
__NOTOC__
'''''Waiting''''' is a [[pastel]] on paper by the French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] [[Edgar Degas]], completed between 1880&amp;ndash;82. It is an early example of the more than 200 pastels, paintings, mixed media drawings and sculptures of [[ballerina]]s depicted by Degas from the early 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 2&lt;/ref&gt; This work is regarded for its vibrant colouring and steep perspective.

The ballerina series follows his earlier studies of both lower and middle class women, where he looked at the moment when they let their public face drop, and pretense gave way to an awareness of the reality of both themselves and their surrounding. With ballerinas he was primarily interested in the contrast between their beauty and grace on stage and the reality of the physical and physiological toil such artifice took on the performers. Of the more than 200 works,&lt;!--how many--&gt; only 50 show the dancers performing on stage, the rest are set in rehearsals or capture fleeting, private moments like this.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 169-170&lt;/ref&gt; ''Waiting'' is an empathetic example, depicting a ballerina accompanied by her [[chaperone (social)|chaperone]], bent over ostensibly to massage her foot but whose body language indicates a person racked with anticipation before she takes stage.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, vi&lt;/ref&gt;

The background is formed from a wide variety of oranges, browns and blacks, while the younger woman is portrayed in pink, blue, and creamy tones which highlight her softness compared to the severity of the older woman. The work is executed with an innovative mixture of subtle (the woman's feet), slashed (the bench) and [[hatching|hatched]] (the younger woman's dress) strokes.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=829 Waiting]". Display caption; [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]. Retrieved 27 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas 024.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''Three Dancers in an Exercise Hall'', 1880, Degas, Oil on canvas]]
Degas was taken by the peripheral world of the dancers, the rehearsals and backstage moments,&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 171&lt;/ref&gt; a world to which he did not have access to until 1885; he only became interested in the ballet in 1870, and backstage was strictly limited to long term patrons. His removal from the moment reflected in the image is highlighted by the unusually steep perspective; the viewer seems to be positioned far above the two women; looking down as if seated in a box above the auditorium.
[[File:Degas - Erschöpfte Tänzerin.jpg|200px|thumb|''Dancer Stretching'', c 1882-85., Degas, Pastel on paper. 46.7 x 29.7 cm. [[Kimbell Art Museum]], [[Fort Worth]], Texas]]

Degas was aware from an early point in his studies of the exhaustion of the girls, and the extent to which they pushed the limits of their bodies for fleeting moments of elegance.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 169-171&lt;/ref&gt; He was further conscious of the brevity of a ballerina's career, and the positioning of the older chaperone–more than likely an ex-dancer herself–in this work adds to its poignancy; the younger woman representing what her forlorn looking companion once was. Degas, mindful of this, presents an interesting irony - while the young woman waits to make her entrance the older woman waits for her to leave. The tip of the chaperone's umbrella points in the direction the dancer must take; towards the stage and away from her guardian.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the dichotomy of the series, Rilke wrote in 1898 of Degas' pictures of "ballerinas full of [[sequin]]ed rubbish and stage lighting. They surprise us with their ugliness, these girls, whose whole life gradually descends into their legs, so that on their low, twilight brows nothing remains except a dull memory of things never known, and that will soon be lost in the acquired smile..."&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 182-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is jointly owned by the Norton Simon Art Foundation, Pasadena and the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.

The '''''Wall of the Sun''''' and '''''Wall of the Moon''''' are a pair of [[mural]]s made of ceramics and designed by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist [[Joan Miró]] for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris. The works were carried out by the ceramicist [[Josep Llorens Artigas]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=Dupin&gt;{{cite book|last=Dupin|first=Jacques|title=Miró|date=2004|publisher=Éditions Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=2-0803-0450-X|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the walls were installed on the Place de Fontenoy in Paris, but afterwards were enclosed in a building that was constructed in order to protect them from damage caused by acid rain.&lt;ref name=Unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wall of the Sun|url=http://www.unesco.org/visit/uk/notices/miro1.htm|publisher=UNESCO website|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Llorens Artigas]] met in 1910 at the school of art of the artist [[Francesc Galí]] (1880–1965), in Barcelona. Since the 1940s, Miró and Josep Llorens Artigas started an artistic duo that spawned objects and large ceramic murals such as one at the [[Unesco]] building in Paris or the ceramic wall of the [[Barcelona–El Prat Airport|Barcelona Airport]]. These works fused Miró lexicon with the essential qualities of the arts of earth and fire.&lt;ref name=artigas&gt;{{Cite web | title= Joan Gardy Artigas, Spanish (1938 - )|url=http://rogallery.com/Artigas_Joan_Gardy/artigas-biography.html| editor = rogallery.com| accessdate= 28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Joan Miró was contacted by the heads of UNESCO to ask if he want to take part of the team of artists that decorated the future headquarters of the institution that is located in Paris.&lt;ref name=runner93&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corredor-Matheos|first=Josep|title=The Miró-Artigas Murals|journal=Catalonia Culture|date=October 1993|pages=34–37|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once agreed, they granted the exterior walls of the building conferences, two perpendicular walls of three meters high and seven meters long and fifteen, respectively. Miró proposed to make a ceramic mural in collaboration with Llorens Artigas.

In 1956, Miró began working on the mural in his studio in [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]]. The following year he went to the [[Cave of Altamira|Caves of Altamira]] in with Llorens Artigas inspired to carry on the work,&lt;ref name="Mink2000"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Janis |last=Mink|title=Joan Miró, 1893-1983|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDW3HgIw7aYC&amp;pg=PA93|year=2000|editor=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-5975-9|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preckler2003"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ana María |last=Preckler|title=Historia del arte universal de los siglos XIX y XX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ_edWCq2UoC&amp;pg=PA236|date= 1 January 2003|editor=Editorial Complutense|isbn=978-84-7491-707-9|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt; by seeing "the first mural in the world".&lt;ref name=BYN59&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miró|first=Joan|title=Como hice los murales para la UNESCO|journal=Blanco y Negro|date=6 July 1959|volume=2457|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also visit the [[Colegiata y Claustro de Santa Juliana]] and the romanesque collection of the Museum of Art of Catalonia, the current [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]].&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt;

=== Construction ===
Once inspired, Miró moved to [[Gallifa]], at the workshop of Artigas, to proceed to prepare the tile mural. It took 35 batches, 25 tons of wood, 4 tons of sandstone and 200 kilos of enamel.&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt; Once finished, the pieces were transported to Paris. Although he had worked in large formats, he had never done ceramics. Beside the ceramist Josep Llorens Artigas, they failed to find technical feasibility for baking pottery in a way that allows to obtain a background textures similar to the paintings of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Rebull, Melania (1994) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided that the composition was on the subjects of "Sun" and "Moon".&lt;ref&gt;Malet, Rosa M. (1992) pg. 107-112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inauguration ===
The two mosaic murals were assembled ''in situ'' by a team of technicians under the direct supervision of Miró and Llorens Artigas.&lt;ref name=caca/&gt; The works were inaugurated in 1958, as same as the building, and received rave reviews. Even one of the murals, the ''Wall of the Sun'' won the Biennial Prize of Guggenheim Foundation.&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt;&lt;ref name=caca/&gt; Miró later return to work for UNESCO, designing the UNESCO Medal for [[Pablo Picasso]].

=== Conservation ===
Initially, the walls were outdoors, but later moved inside the building to protect them from damage caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name=caca /&gt;

[[File:Alliantiewapen Nassau Loon-Heinsberg - Alliance coat of arms of Nassau Loon-Heinsberg - Wapenboek Nassau-Vianden - KB 1900 A 016, folium 20r.jpg|thumb|Alliance arms of [[Maria of Loon-Heinsberg]]. Arms of women were usually depicted on lozenges. Here, her family arms are impaled with those of her husband, [[Jan IV of Nassau]]. ]]

Due to the differing role of women in past society, special rules grew relating to the [[blazon]]ing of arms for women. The rules for women and heraldry developed differently from place to place and there is no one single rule that applies everywhere. In general, arms of women were most likely depicted not on shields but on [[Lozenge_(heraldry)|lonzeges]] or ovals. Different rules exist that depend on the woman's marital status and a married woman would also often make use of her husband's arms in addition to those from her family. In both the English&lt;ref name="ukcollege1"/&gt; and the Scottish&lt;ref name="hersocscot"/&gt; systems of heraldry these differences remain active.

==Characteristics==
===Escutcheons, crests, and other heraldic elements===
Heraldry has its origins from associations with warfare and the age of chivalry. The traditional shield was also associated with war and so women did not usually display familial arms on [[Escutcheon_(heraldry)|escutcheons]]. Rather, they could display these on various other shapes: more commonly the [[Lozenge_(heraldry)|lozenge]], an oval, or a [[Cartouche_(design)|cartouche]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]–a device that sits atop the shield on an [[armorial achievement]]–likewise was not accorded to heraldic devices of women as these had associations with warfare.

===Transmission===
In many heraldic traditions, arms generally are passed patrilineally. In other nations, in Canadian heraldry for example,  women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers (if any). Women in Canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs, regardless of gender.{{refn|This system of equality for men and women is a result of provisions in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which guarantee, among other things, freedom from discrimination under the law on the basis of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterofrights.ca/en/17_00_01 |title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – Equality Rights |publisher=6074332 Canada Inc., in association with SailorJones Media Inc. |accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[English heraldry|English]], [[Scottish Heraldry|Scottish]] and [[Northern Irish heraldry]], a [[woman]] may bear arms by inheritance from her father&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies1"&gt;{{ Citation | last=Fox-Davies | first=Arthur | lastauthoramp=yes | title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry | publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. | place= | volume= | edition= | year=2007 | quote=Every woman is entitled to bear upon a lozenge in her own lifetime the arms, quarterings, and difference marks which belonged to her father. | page=546 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSeEWjQCTIAC&amp;lpg=PA546&amp;dq=heraldic%20heiress&amp;pg=PA546#v=onepage&amp;q=heraldic%20heiress&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by grant to herself.  When unmarried, she displays her arms on a [[lozenge]] (a diamond shape) or on an oval or oval-like shape. Traditionally, a woman does not display her arms on a shield, as the shield originated with [[knights]] and warfare, and is thus viewed as fitting for a man, but not a woman.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
[[image: Coat of Arms of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.svg|thumb|left|The arms of the [[Duchess of Cambridge]] (right) impaled with those of her husband, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] (left)]] When married, a woman has the option of uniting her arms with those of her husband in what are called marital arms; their arms are [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]], meaning they are placed side by side in the same shield, with those of the man on the dexter (left, as seen from the front) and those of his wife on the sinister (right, as seen from the front).&lt;ref name="Boutell1"&gt;{{ Citation | last1=Beddoe | first1=Alan | last2=Galloway | first2=Strome  | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Beddoe's Canadian heraldry | publisher=Mika | place= | volume= | edition= | year=1981 | quote=If her husband is an armiger her arms leave the female lozenge and share her husband's shield, ie, are 'impaled' with his arms, his to the dexter (right) and hers to the sinister (left). | page=171 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QE5mAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=armigerous+women+shield&amp;dq=armigerous+women+shield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1aDjT4-2C8Xe0QHD39jfCQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one spouse belongs to the higher ranks of an [[British honours system#Current orders of chivalry|order of chivalry]], and is thereby entitled to surround his or her arms with a circlet of the order, it is usual to depict them on two separate shields tilted towards one another, this is termed "accollé".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:Coat of Arms of Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester.svg|thumb|Coat of Arms of [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester]] who is a heraldic heiress. Depicting her father's arms imposed over those of [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], her husband.]]
A married woman may also bear either her own arms or her husband's arms alone on a shield with the shield charged with a small lozenge to distinguish her from her husband.&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite book|author=Slater,  Stephen|title=The  Complete  Book  of  Heraldry|year=2004|publisher=Anness  Pub.  Co.|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widowed woman usually displays the impaled arms on a lozenge-shaped shield, unless she is a heraldic heiress (see below).&lt;ref name="Fearn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fearn, Jacqueline|title=Discovering Heraldry|year=1980|publisher=Shire|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heraldic Heiresses====
If the woman is an [[heraldic heiress]], her arms are shown on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon of pretence]], which is a small shield in the centre of her husband's arms. When widowed, instead of showing the impaled arms on a lozenge, she continues to use her marital arms, but placed on a lozenge or oval.&lt;ref name="Fearn"/&gt; In England and Northern Ireland, if there is more than one surviving daughter, each transmits her father's arms on equal terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFriar1993|Friar 1993]], p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland however, only the eldest surviving daughter transmits her father's undifferenced arms to her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBurnett1997|Burnett 1997]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian Heraldry===
{{main|Canadian heraldry}}
 
In [[Canadian heraldry]], women and men are treated equally for heraldic purpose, reflecting Canadian equality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charterofrights.ca/en/17_00_01 |title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - Equality Rights |publisher=6074332 Canada Inc., in association with SailorJones Media Inc. |date= |accessdate= June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore common to display the arms of women on shields, rather than on a lozenge or oval, but a woman may still choose to have her arms displayed on a traditional shape.

In many systems of heraldry, the arms of each living person must be unique. English heraldry has used armorial variants to distinguish the arms of brothers from their father's arms and from each other since the thirteenth century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Boutell |title=The handbook to English heraldry |others=[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ed |year=1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xdMAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Boutell%20Fox%20Davies&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Chapter XII}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is now normally done by the system of marks or ''brisures'' set up by the early Tudor herald [[John Writhe]].&lt;ref name="ukcollege1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/12.htm|title=The Law of Arms: The descent of arms|date=2004-04-10|publisher=College of Arms|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada adds a unique series of brisures for use by female children who inherit arms. As in other heraldic systems, these cadency marks are not always used;&lt;ref name="Royal Heraldry Society of Canada-Cadency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.heraldry.ca/course_canadian.htm|publisher=Royal Heraldry Society of Canada|title=Heraldry Examination|accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in any case, when the heir succeeds (in Canada, the first child, whether male or female, according to strict [[primogeniture]]), the mark of cadency is removed and the heir uses the plain coat of arms.&lt;ref name="hersocscot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html |title=Beginners Heraldry, The Heraldry Society of Scotland – UK Heraldry |publisher=The Heraldry Society of Scotland |date=2005-04-17 |accessdate=2008-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013201010/http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Štěpán Zavřel''' (26 December 1932 – 25 February 1999) was a Czech painter, fresco creator, graphic artist, writer and one of the most influential man in the field of the children's book illustration in the 20th century.

He lived and studied in [[Czechoslovakia]] until 1959, then he emigrated to Italy. There he studied at [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma]]. Afterwards he traveled through whole Europe, during this time he arranged exhibitions of his own works. In 1968 he finally settled in [[Sarmede|Rugolo]], small village in the region [[Veneto]] in [[Italy]], where he lived until his death in 1999. In 1971, he co-founded the Zurich-based publishing house Bohem Press with Otakar Božejovský.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarmedemostra.it/ita/zavrel.html Sarmede: Štěpán Zavřel: l'artista] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orik.cz/content/stepan-zavrel Orik.cz: Štěpán Zavřel biography] (in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; Štěpán Zavřel founded there The International School of Illustration which exists till now.

==Legacy==
In 2009, on the tenth anniversary of his death, a collection of accounts by those who knew him was published in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/books/the-magical-world-of-childrens-book-illustrator-stepan-zavrel Czech Radio: The magical world of children's book illustrator Štěpán Zavřel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the Museo Artistico Štěpán Zavřel of Spazio Brazzà (Udine - Italy) was established dedicated to his life and works.

Wanted by Štěpán's friend Corrado Pirzio-Biroli, with the approval of Zavřel's family, the museum researches on the production of the artist and catalogues his works, including the ones donated by private persons. It also contains the heredity of the family of the artist, that is more than 3.000 originals among them unpublished xylographs from the beginning of 60's, studies, pictures and films for animation cinema, advertising graphics, sketches, storyboards and original figures of all his illustrated books for children from The Magic Fish of 1964, carried out in Brazzà Castle, to his last great work, the Bible for adults and children, Mit Gott unterwegs, Die Bibel für Kinder und Erwachsene neu erzählt of 1996

The 'Centro Internazionale di Studi per la Cultura dell'Infanzia Štěpán Zavřel' of Spazio Brazzà creates and promotes cultural projects at the local level, in collaboration with other international organizations and institutions with particular attention to the picture book and the different forms of art directed to the child. The Centre in addition to doing research on the artist, in fact, promotes the planning of museum activities as a result of proposals arising from field research, in collaboration with experts in the field; among other projects the one of republishing or editing from scratch in collaboration with the historic Bohem Press publishing house founded by Štěpán Zavřel in the seventies, winning many awards and international recognitions for the environmental and the beauty of the images shown, guiding and supporting them with special projects especially aimed at schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castellodibrazza.com/spazio-brazza/il-museo-artistico-stepan-zavrel Castello di Brazza: Museo Artistico Štěpán Zavřel page]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the theatre performance 'Venice: Town of Hope', from Zavrel's book 'Sotto la laguna di Venezia' has been held at the prestigious Ivan's Franko National Drama Theatre in Kiev, a collaboration between the Centro Internazionale di Studi per la Cultura dell'Infanzia Štěpán Zavřel' of Spazio Brazzà, the Structural Subdivision of the German - Polish - Ukrainian Society and The Centre for Children in Need 'Our Kids' in Kiev.
