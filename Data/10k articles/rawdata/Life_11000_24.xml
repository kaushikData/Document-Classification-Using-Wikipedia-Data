===Brawl===
During the post game celebration Memphis players ran towards the BYU sideline to celebrate with their fans sitting behind the BYU bench (due to the bizarre baseball stadium field layout, most of the people in attendance could only sit on the BYU side of the field).  Some bumping and shoving occurred and one Memphis player was pushed in the back by a BYU player that was allegedly also being pushed from behind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i905.photobucket.com/albums/ac257/A380038/shove.jpg Koroma Shoved? 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdnxfV-CJP8|title=BYU Memphis fight - Koroma's Push|date=22 December 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Memphis player he pushed then turned around and (using both hands) punched/shoved the BYU player in the back of the head.  As the BYU player turned his attention back to the attacker in an apparent attempt to retaliate he threw a punch and he was attacked by 3-4 Memphis players and an all out, bench-clearing brawl ensued.  Punches and kicks were thrown by many players on both sides, one Memphis player even used a helmet as a weapon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--pHmvoCYV--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/ifswjsayev4vgnugsv16.gif Johnson Uses Helmet in Brawl]&lt;/ref&gt; and when it was over, numerous players walked off the field bloody and bruised.  As the brawl was dying down a BYU player (Kai Nacua) can be seen coming into view and sucker punching a Memphis player (Alan Cross), who was not wearing a helmet, from behind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--e1lvJ4nw--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/dmppvr7h5dqzsulqvt5b.gif Nacua Sucker Punches Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;  As the BYU player turned toward the camera's view, a bloodied bruise could be clearly seen from a punch he received while attempting to defend himself from another Memphis player earlier in the brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s1078.photobucket.com/user/cougarcoug/media/Nacua1_zps9cfoxx5y.gif.html|title=Nacua1_zps9cfoxx5y.gif gif by cougarcoug - Photobucket|work=Photobucket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====

Tom Holmoe, BYU's athletic director, apologized to BYU fans stating, "We expect better of our athletes, even in the face of a difficult loss. We intend to fully review this matter. I apologize to Cougar Nation." Memphis said in a statement via AAC commissioner Mike Aresco that they are displeased with the Miami Beach Bowl brawl, and that, "The university will respond accordingly following this detailed review. Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed that this happened, as we expect the highest standard of conduct from our student-athletes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelerstoday.com/articles/16927/20141225/miami-beach-bowl-brawl-disappoints-aac-commish-school-ads-what.htm|title=Miami Beach Bowl Brawl Disappoints AAC Commish, School Ads, What Started The Fight? [VIDEO]|work=TravelersToday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2015, The University of Memphis announced the completion of an internal review of the incident and expected punishments to be levied against twelve members of the team.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite news |title=Memphis Completes Review of Football Altercation |url=http://www.gotigersgo.com/genrel/012015aaa.html |date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BYU also took action to punish their players. Kai Nacua, Trey Dye, Sione Takitaki, and Tomasi Laulile were all suspended for BYU's season opener against Nebraska.

'''Abortion-rights movements''', also referred to as '''pro-choice movements''', advocate for [[abortion law|legal]] access to induced [[abortion]] services.  The issue of induced abortion remains divisive in public life, with [[abortion debate|recurring arguments]] to liberalize or to restrict access to legal abortion services. Abortion-rights supporters themselves are frequently divided as to the types of abortion services that should be available and to the circumstances, for example different periods in the pregnancy such as [[Late termination of pregnancy|late term abortions]], in which access may be restricted.

==Terminology==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}
Many of the terms used in the debate are [[Framing (social sciences)|political framing]] terms used to validate one's own stance while invalidating the opposition's.  For example, the labels "pro-choice" and "pro-life" imply endorsement of widely held values such as [[liberty]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], while suggesting that the opposition must be "anti-choice" or "anti-life" (alternatively "pro-coercion" or "pro-death").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Constructionist Research |author=Holstein |author2=Gubrium |last-author-amp=yes |publisher= Guilford Press |year=2008 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views do not always fall along a binary; in one [[Public Religion Research Institute]] poll, seven in ten Americans described themselves as "pro-choice", while almost two-thirds described themselves as "pro-life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/06/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/ |publisher=Public Religion Research Institute |title=Committed to Availability, Conflicted about Morality: What the Millennial Generation Tells Us about the Future of the Abortion Debate and the Culture Wars |date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] favors the terms "abortion rights" and "anti-abortion" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Norm, ed.

==Early history==
Feminists of the late 19th century were often opposed to the legalization of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Sarah Barringer.

Anthony]], an anonymous contributor signing "A" wrote in 1869 about the subject, arguing that instead of merely attempting to pass a law against abortion, the root cause must also be addressed.

Simply passing an anti-abortion law would, the writer stated, "be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains. [...] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; But oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime."&lt;ref name="Schiff" /&gt;&lt;ref name=prolifequakers&gt;{{cite web| title=Marriage and Maternity | url=http://www.prolifequakers.org/susanb.htm | work=[[The Revolution (newspaper)|''The Revolution'']] | publisher=[[Susan B.

===Britain===
[[File:Stella Browne.gif|thumb|right|[[Stella Browne]] was a pioneering feminist who campaigned for the liberalization of abortion law.]]
The movement towards the liberalization of abortion law emerged in the 1920s and '30s in the context of the victories that had been recently won in the area of [[birth control]]. Campaigners including [[Marie Stopes]] in England and [[Margaret Sanger]] in the US had succeeded in bringing the issue into the open, and birth control clinics were established which offered family planning advice and contraceptive methods to women in need.

In 1929, the [[Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929|Infant Life Preservation Act]] was passed in Britain, which amended the law ([[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]) so that an abortion carried out in good faith, for the sole purpose of preserving the life of the mother, would not be an offence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard|HL Deb]]. Vol 72. [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1928/nov/22/preservation-of-infant-life-bill-hl|Col 269].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stella Browne]] was a leading birth control campaigner, who increasingly began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced by the work of [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Edward Carpenter]] and other [[sexologists]].&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Lesley|title=The Life and Times of Stella Browne: Feminist and Free Spirit|year=2011|pages=27–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Greta. "Women and eugenics in Britain: The case of Mary Scharlieb, Elizabeth Sloan Chesser, and Stella Browne." ''[[Annals of Science]]'' 52 no. 5 (1995):481-502&lt;/ref&gt; In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowbotham|first=Sheila|title=A New World for Women: Stella Browne, social feminist|year=1977|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s Browne began a speaking tour around England, providing information about her beliefs on the need for accessibility of information about birth control for women, women’s health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman’s right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929 she brought forward her lecture “The Right to Abortion” in front of the [[World Sexual Reform Congress]] in London.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women’s right to decide to have an [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt;

[[File:Aleck bourne trial.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleck Bourne]] was acquitted for performing an abortion on a rape victim in 1938, a landmark case in the movement for abortion rights.]]
Other prominent feminists, including [[Frida Laski]], [[Dora Russell]], [[Joan Malleson]] and [[Janet Chance]] began to champion this cause - the cause broke dramatically into the mainstream in July 1932 when the [[British Medical Association]] council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; On 17 February 1936, [[Janet Chance]], Alice Jenkins and [[Joan Malleson]] established the [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] as the first [[advocacy]] organisation for abortion liberalization. The association promoted access to [[abortion in the United Kingdom]] and campaigned for the elimination of legal obstacles.&lt;ref name="HindellSimms"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hindell|first=Keith|author2=Madeline Simms|title=How the Abortion Lobby Worked|year=1968|journal=[[The Political Quarterly]]|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year ALRA recruited 35 members, and by 1939 had almost 400 members.&lt;ref name="HindellSimms"/&gt;

The ALRA was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA’s Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. [[Joan Malleson]], a progenitor of the ALRA.&lt;ref name="HindellSimms"/&gt; This case gained a lot of publicity, however once the war began, the case was tucked away and the cause again lost its importance to the public.

In 1938, [[Joan Malleson]] precipitated one of the most influential cases in British abortion law when she referred a pregnant fourteen-year old [[rape]] victim to [[gynaecology|gynaecologist]] [[Aleck Bourne]]. He performed an abortion, then illegal, and was put on trial on charges of procuring abortion. Bourne was eventually acquitted in ''Rex v. Bourne'' as his actions were "...an example of disinterested conduct in consonance with the highest traditions of the profession".&lt;ref&gt;R v Bourne [1939] 1 KB 687, [1938] 3 All ER 615, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt; This court case set a precedent that doctors could not be prosecuted for performing an abortion in cases where pregnancy would probably cause "mental and physical wreck".

The [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] continued its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought the issue of abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s. President of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] [[John Peel (gynaecologist)|John Peel]] chaired the committee advising the [[British Government]] on what became the [[1967 Abortion Act]], which allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks.&lt;ref name="Commons 1967"&gt;House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee.

In America an abortion reform movement emerged in the 1960s. In 1964 [[Gerri Santoro]] of Connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal abortion and her photo became the symbol of the pro-choice movement. Some women's rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an example, in Chicago, a group known as "[[Jane Collective|Jane]]" operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find "Jane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwluherstory.org/something-real-jane-and-me-memories-and-exhortations-of-a-feminist-ex-abortionist.html|title=Something Real: Jane and Me.

In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion. The forerunner of the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] was formed in 1969 to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwhn.org/content/index.php?pid=106 National Women's Health Network | A Voice For Women, A Network For Change&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1973 NARAL became the National Abortion Rights Action League.

The landmark judicial ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]]. The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being in the decision [[Doe v. Bolton]], delivered concurrently.

From the 1970s, and the spread of [[second-wave feminism]], abortion and [[reproductive rights]] became unifying issues among various [[feminism|women's rights]] groups in Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, Norway, France, Germany, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;LeGates, Marlene.

[[Abortion in South Africa|South Africa]] allows abortion on demand under its [[Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act]]. Most African nations, however, have abortion bans except in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk. A number of abortion-rights international organizations have made altering abortion laws and expanding [[family planning]] services in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[developing world]] a top priority.

==== Republic of Ireland ====
Abortion is illegal in the [[Republic of Ireland]] except when the woman's life is threatened by a medical condition (including risk of suicide), since [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|a 1983 referendum (aka 8th Amendment)]] amended the [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]]. Subsequent [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendments]] in 1992 (after the [[X Case]]) – the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|fourteenth]] – guaranteed the right to travel abroad (for abortions) and to distribute and obtain information of "lawful services" available in other countries. Two proposal to remove suicide risk as a ground for abortion were rejected by the people, [[Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1992|in a referendum in 1992]] and [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland Bill 2002|in 2002]]. Thousands of women get around the ban by privately travelling to the other European countries (typically Britain and the Netherlands) to undergo termination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6639673.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Irish teen wins abortion battle|date=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by ordering [[Medical abortion|abortion pills]] from [[Women on Web]] online and taking them in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/fall-in-seizures-of-drugs-that-induce-abortion-1.1407015|title=Fall in seizures of drugs that induce abortion|date=27 May 2013|first=Fiona|last=Gartland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[death of Savita Halappanavar]] in 2012, there has been a renewed campaign to [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland#Repeal the Eighth|repeal the eighth amendment]] and legalize abortion. {{Asof|2017|1}}, the Irish government has set up a [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|citizens assembly]] to look at the issue. Their proposals, broadly supported by a cross-party Oireachtas committee, include repeal of the 8th Amendment, unrestricted access to abortion for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and no-term limits for special cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/The-Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution/Final-Report-on-the-Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution/|title=Final Report on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution - The Citizens' Assembly|website=www.citizensassembly.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/32/eighth-amendment-constitution/|title=Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution|date=2018-01-24|website=beta.oireachtas.ie|language=en-ie|others=Houses of the Oireachtas|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Abortion in Northern Ireland}}
Despite being part of the [[United kingdom]], abortion is also illegal in Northern Ireland, except in cases when the woman is threatened by a medical condition, physical or mental.&lt;ref&gt;''Rex v Bourne'' [1939] 1 KB 687, [1938] 3 All ER 615, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Abortion in Northern Ireland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1386450.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=December 9, 2011|date=June 13, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Abortion in the United Kingdom}}
In the United Kingdom, the [[Abortion Act 1967]] legalized abortion on a wide number of grounds, except in [[Northern Ireland]]. In Great Britain, the law states that pregnancy may be terminated up to 24 weeks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7412118.stm | work=BBC News | title=MPs reject cut in abortion limit | date=2008-05-21 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; if it:

#puts the life of the pregnant woman at risk
#poses a risk to the mental and physical health of the pregnant woman

However, the criterion of risk to mental and physical health is applied broadly, and ''de facto'' makes abortion available on demand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/297.html R v British Broadcasting Corporation, ex parte ProLife Alliance] [2002] EWCA Civ 297 at [6], [2002] 2 All ER 756 at 761, CA&lt;/ref&gt; though this still requires the consent of two [[National Health Service]] doctors. Abortions in Great Britain are provided at no out-of-pocket cost to the patient by the NHS.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] are predominantly pro-abortion-rights parties, though with significant minorities in each either holding more restrictive definitions of the right to choose, or subscribing to an anti-abortion analysis. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is more evenly split between both camps and its former leader, [[David Cameron]], supports abortion on demand in the early stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/20th-june-2008/3/david-cameron-supports-abortion-on-demand David Cameron supports abortion on demand], [[Catholic Herald]], 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal abortion is now allowed if the mother's life is in danger, and also in cases of fetal abnormalities that makes it not viable after birth (such as anencephaly) or produce difficulties for mother to take care of it after birth, such as major [[thalassemia]] or bilateral polycystic kidney disease.

Abortion-rights advocacy in the United States is centered in the [[United States pro-choice movement]].

===Japan===
{{main article|Abortion in Japan}}
Chapter XXIX of the [[Penal Code of Japan]] makes [[abortion]] illegal in Japan. However, the [[:ja:母体保護法|Maternal Health Protection Law]] allows [[:ja:母体保護法指定医師|approved doctors]] to practice abortion with the consent of the mother and her spouse, if the pregnancy has [[Pregnancy from rape|resulted from rape]], or if the continuation of the pregnancy may severely endanger the maternal health because of physical reasons or economic reasons. Other people, including the mother herself, trying to abort the [[fetus]] can be punished by the law. People trying to practice abortion without the consent of the woman can also be punished, including the doctors.

When he drowned in a ferry accident on [[Lake Victoria]] in 1996, he was the head of al-Qaeda's African presence and second in command of the whole organization, below [[Osama bin Laden]].

==History==
{{rquote|right|It is as if 100 years were added to my life when I came to Afghanistan|Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, Laura. "His Own Words", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Al-Banshiri was born in May 1950 in [[Cairo]], and served as a policeman in [[Egypt]] before joining the anti-Soviet effort in [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name="gsecAU"/&gt; fighting alongside [[Ahmed Shah Massoud]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Jason. "al-Qaeda, the true story of radical Islam", p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother had participated in the [[Assassination of Anwar El Sadat|assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat]].  [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], head of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], introduced al-Banshiri to [[Osama Bin Laden]], who was so favorably impressed that he made al-Banshiri military commander of the [[Afghan Arabs]].  Al-Bashiri's second in command was [[Mohammed Atef]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Wright]], ''The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11'', Vintage, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-4000-3084-2}}, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; He was shot in the leg during the 1987 [[Battle of Jaji]].&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], "The Osama bin Laden I Know', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

While still in Afghanistan, in August 1988, he attended the founding meeting of al-Qaeda, along with bin Laden, [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], and others.&lt;ref name="founders"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/founders_meet_and_form_al-qaeda.htm Global Security database] on the founding of al-Qaeda&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Kenya and Tanzania he was known by the aliases Adel Habib, Karim, and Jalal.&lt;ref name="idc"/&gt; He married a Kenyan woman and set up a business in [[Nairobi]] importing automobiles from the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name="sacredcows"&gt;Benjamin, Daniel &amp; Steven Simon. "The Age of Sacred Terror", 2002. pp. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point al-Banshiri acquired either [[Netherlands|Dutch]] citizenship&lt;ref name="gsecAU"/&gt; or forged Dutch papers.&lt;ref name="idc"/&gt; Prior to 1996, al-Bashiri, [[Mohammed Atef]] and Yaseen al-Iraqi aided [[Enaam Arnaout]] in purchasing [[AK-47]]s and mortar rounds from a Pashtun tribesman named Hajjji Ayoub, and they were subsequently delivered in large trucks to the Jawr and [[Jihad Wahl training camp]]s.&lt;ref name="arnie"&gt;Fitzgerald, Patrick J. United States of America v. Enaam M. Arnaout, "[http://news.findlaw.com/wsj/docs/bif/usarnaout10603prof.pdf Governments Evidentiary Proffer Supporting the Admissibility of Co-Conspirator Statements]", before Hon. Suzanne B. Conlon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
When the news broke that the ferry {{MV|Bukoba}} had sunk in Lake Victoria, al-Qaeda sent [[Fazul Abdullah Mohammed]] and [[Wadih el-Hage]] to the scene, to verify that al-Banshiri had drowned, and had not been murdered.&lt;ref name="day6"&gt;[http://www.911investigations.net/IMG/pdf/doc-1337.pdf Transcript of testimony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510123223/http://www.911investigations.net/IMG/pdf/doc-1337.pdf |date=2007-05-10 }} in the trial of El Hage and others&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Banshiri was succeeded as al-Qaeda's "military" commander by another Egyptian ex-policeman, [[Mohammed Atef]], who had been considered his inseparable friend. Al-Banshiri's senior role in East Africa was taken over, at least in part, by [[Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah]].&lt;ref name="idc"/&gt;

A poem entitled "Tears in the Eyes of Time" was written about al-Banshiri, commemorating him among the greatest of the "fallen mujahideen". al-Zawahiri recited the poem in his January 2006 internet broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;Atwan, Abdel Bari. "The Secret History of al-Qaeda", p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan IV''' (born circa 1063; died 13 October 1119) was [[Duke of Brittany]] from 1084 until his abdication in 1112. He was also [[Count of Nantes]] (from c. 1103) and [[Count of Rennes]]. His parents were [[Hawise, Duchess of Brittany|Duchess Hawise]] and [[Hoel II, Duke of Brittany|Duke Hoel II]]. He is also known as '''Alan Fergant'''. Through his father, he was of the Breton House of Cornouaille dynasty ([[Breton language|Breton]]: ''Kerne'' dynasty). He was the last [[Breton language|Breton-speaking]] Duke of Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;Gwenno Piette, ''A concise History of Brittany'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2008), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norman Conflict==
A traditional rivalry between [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] continued at the close of the 11th century. The Breton-Norman war of 1064–1065 was the result of [[William I of England|William the Bastard]], Duke of Normandy (later to become known as William the Conqueror) support of rebels in Brittany against Alan's maternal uncle, [[Conan II, Duke of Brittany|Conan II]].

Conan II died in late 1066 during a campaign in Anjou, and was succeeded by Alan's parents, Conan's sister Hawise and her husband Hoel II. Hoel ruled as regent from Hawise's death in 1072 until Alan reached his majority in 1084.{{sfn|Following medieval examples given in Bailey et al., Alan may have been twenty-one years of age at that time}}

To prevent further hostilities during his invasion of England, William I married his daughter [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]] to the new duke Alan in 1087.&lt;ref name="Everard10"&gt;J. A. Everard, ''Brittany and the Angevins: Province and Empire 1158–1203'', (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ceremonies may have taken place in [[Bayeux]] in Normandy. [[William of Malmesbury]] wrote that Constance was unpopular at the Breton court because of her "severe and conservative" manner.
However, [[Orderic Vitalis]] wrote that as duchess Constance did all she could to further the welfare of the Bretons, who grieved deeply at her death in 1090.

In 1092 Alan IV donated property to the [[Redon Abbey|abbey of Redon]] by charter, and by 1093 married [[Ermengarde of Anjou (d. 1146)|Ermengarde of Anjou]], as a political alliance with [[Fulk IV of Anjou]] to counter Anglo-Norman influence.  
[[File:Redon - Abbatiale Saint-Sauveur et Mairie - Cylindrique - 20090704.jpg|thumb|left|Redon Abbey, Final resting place of Alan IV]]

Duke Alan IV's cousin Geoffrey I Boterel (eldest brother of Alan Rufus) died on 24 August 1093 in battle at Dol while in rebellion against the Duke.

Between 1101 and 1104, Alan's younger brother, Count [[Matthew II of Nantes]], died without issue and his county passed to Alan.

Alan IV abdicated as duke in 1112. The former duke retired to the monastery of Redon, where he died in 1119.

==Crusader==
In 1098 Alan went on the [[First Crusade]],&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Everard, ''Brittany and the Angevins: Province and Empire 1158–1203'', 12.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Army of Robert Curthose on the First Crusade|army of Robert Curthose]], leaving Ermengarde as his regent, and returned in 1101.

==Family==

Alan IV married [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]] in 1087. Constance died in 1090. They had no children.

Alan's second marriage was to [[Ermengarde of Anjou (d. 1146)|Ermengarde of Anjou]] in 1093.&lt;ref name="Everard10" /&gt; With Ermengarde he had three children:
*Geoffrey - died young;
* [[Conan III, Duke of Brittany|Conan]] - his successor as Duke of Brittany&lt;ref name="Everard10" /&gt;
* Hawise - she married Count [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]], also known as ''Hawise Fergant.'' They divorced and had no issue.

Alan and Ermengarde were separated upon his abdication as duke in 1112.

He had two illegitimate sons, [[Brian Fitzcount]]&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Warren, ''Henry II'', (University of California Press, 1974), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and Guihomar.&lt;ref&gt;Orderic Vital, Auguste Le Prevost [https://books.google.fr/books?id=zn9WAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=Guiumar+Brito+filius+Alanni+comitis&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE4dji3aLXAhVoDcAKHSTBB7cQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Guiumar%20Brito%20filius%20Alanni%20comitis&amp;f=false Historiae ecclesiasticae], Libris tredecim, Tomus IV, pp 428-429.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Succession==
Alan IV died in 1119 at the monastery of Redon, where he had retired after his abdication in 1112, and separation from his wife Ermengarde. His only surviving son, [[Conan III, Duke of Brittany|Conan III]] succeeded him.

[[NASA]] launched three satellites named '''Biosatellite 1, 2 and 3''' between 1966 and 1969.

NASA's Biosatellite program was a series of three satellites to assess the effects of spaceflight, especially radiation and weightlessness, on living organisms. Each was designed to reenter and be recovered at the end of its mission.

The Biosatellite 1, also known as abbreviated '''Biosat 1''' and as '''Biosatellite A''', was a first artificial satellite unmanned U.S. belonging to Biosatellite program for biological research. It was released on December 14, 1966 by a rocket [[Delta (rocket)|Delta G]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] of the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://astronautix.com/craft/biollite.htm Biosatellite]. Encyclopedia Astronautica. Retrieved 2016-16-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The Biosatellite 1 was the first series Biosatellite satellites. It was released in an initial orbit of 296&amp;nbsp;km perigee 309&amp;nbsp;km apogee and 33.5 degrees of orbital inclination, with period 90.5 minutes.

The Biosatellite 1 was carrying several specimens for the study of the effects of the space environment on biological processes. The capsule was returning to land separated from the vehicle properly, but its rocket did not work, leaving it stranded in a slowly decaying orbit. It re-entered and disintegrated on February 15, 1967.

==Biosatellite 2==

The Biosatellite 2, also known as abbreviated as '''Biosat 2''' and as '''Biosatellite B''', was a second artificial satellite unmanned U.S. belonging to Biosatellite program for biological research. It was released on September 7, 1967 by a rocket Delta G Launch Complex 17B of the Air Force from [[Cape Canaveral]] station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/biosat.htm Biosat 1, 2, 3 (Bios 1, 2, 3)]. Gunter's Space Page. Retrieved 2016-16-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biosatellite 2 carried thirteen biological experiments involving insects, frog eggs, plants and microorganisms. The capsule returned early due to a tropical storm threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/b/biosatellite.html Biosatellite 2]. Mark Wade, ''Astronautix''.  Accessed 14 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosatellite 3==

The Biosatellite 3, also known as abbreviated '''Biosat 3''' and as '''Biosatellite D''', was a third artificial satellite unmanned U.S. belonging to Biosatellite program for biological research.

Despite the seeming failure of the mission's scientific agenda, Biosatellite 3 was influential in shaping the life sciences flight experiment program, pointing to the need for centralised management, realistic goals and substantial pre-flight experiment verification testing. The mission objective was to investigate the effect of space flight on [[brain]] states, behavioural performance, cardiovascular status, fluid and [[electrolyte]] balance, and metabolic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/mission/miss.aspx?mis_index=56|title=Mission information:  Biosatellite III|work=[[NASA]]|accessdate=25 May 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological capsule reentered in 7 September 1969.

[[File:Brawling, 喧嘩, PA160113aaa.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[yakuza]]'s fight by festival of Japan]]

'''Brawling''' (probably connected with German language ''brüllen'', to roar, shout), in law, was the offence of quarrelling, or creating a disturbance in a [[church (building)|church]] or churchyard. Brawling was covered in [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastic courts]] until 1860. It has rarely been prosecuted since then.

==History==
During the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in England religious controversy too often became converted into actual disturbance, and the ritual lawlessness of the [[Wikt:parochial|parochial]] [[clergy]] very frequently provoked popular violence. To repress these disturbances the [[Brawling Act 1551]] was passed in 1551, by which it was enacted: "that if any person shall, by words only, quarrel, chide or brawl in any church or churchyard, it shall be lawful for the ordinary of the place where the same shall be done and proved by two lawful witnesses, to suspend any person so offending, if he be a layman, from the entrance of the church, and if he be a clerk, from the ministration of his office, for so long as the said ordinary shall think meet, according to the fault."&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Brawling |volume=4 |page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Act of 1553 added the punishment of imprisonment until the party should repent. The Brawling Act 1551 was partly repealed in 1828 and wholly repealed as regards laymen by the [[Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860]]. Under that Act, which applies to [[Ireland]] as well as to England, persons guilty of riotous, violent or indecent behaviour, in churches and chapels of the Church of England or Ireland, or in any chapel of any religious denomination, or in England in any place of religious worship duly certified, or in churchyards or burial-grounds, were liable on conviction before two justices to a penalty of not more than £5, or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two months. This enactment applied to clergy as well as to laity, and a clergyman of the Church of England convicted under it could also be dealt with under the [[Clergy Discipline Act 1892]] (''Girt v. Fillingham'', 1901, L.R. Prob. 176).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

When Mr [[John Kensit|J. Kensit]] during an ordination service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] "objected" to one of the candidates for ordination, on grounds which did not constitute an impediment or notable crime within the meaning of the ordination service, he was held to have unlawfully disturbed the [[bishop]] of [[London]] in the conduct of the service, and to be liable to conviction under the Act of 1860 (''Kensit'' v. ''Dean and Chapter of St Paul's'', 1905, L.R. 2 K.B. 249). The public worship of [[Protestant]] Dissenters, [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Jews]] in England had before 1860 been protected by a series of statutes beginning with the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Toleration Act]] of 1689, and ending with the [[Liberty of Religious Worship Act 1855]]. These enactments, though not repealed, were for practical purposes superseded by the summary remedy given by the Act of 1860. In Scotland disturbance of public worship is punishable as a [[breach of the peace]] (''Dougall'' v. ''Dykes'', 1861, 4 Irvine 101).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In the British Empire===
In British possessions abroad, interference with religious worship was usually dealt with by legislation, and not as a common-law offence. In [[India]] it was an offence voluntarily to cause disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies (Penal Code, s. 296). Under the [[Queensland Criminal Code]] of 1899 (s. 207) penalties were imposed on persons who wilfully and without lawful justification or excuse (the proof of which lies on them) disquiet or disturb any meeting of persons lawfully assembled for religious worship, or assault any forces lawfully officiating at such meeting, or any of the persons there assembled.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In the United States===
In the United States disturbance of religious worship is treated as an offence under the [[common law]], which is in many states supplemented by legislation (see Bishop, ''Amer. Crim. Law,'' 8th ed. 1892, vol. i. s. 542, vol. ii. ss. 303-305; California Penal Code, s. 302; ''Revised Laws of Massachusetts'', 1902, chap. 212, s. 30.).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

(Dissenting correction to the above)

==Modern case==
In 1998, [[Peter Tatchell]] of [[OutRage!]] was prosecuted for interrupting the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s Easter sermon with a short gay rights speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/easter%20sunday.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924202506/http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/easter%20sunday.htm |archivedate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1860 legislation (which transferred jurisdiction away from the ecclesiastic courts) was used to try him; his defense focused on the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. He was convicted and fined £18.60 (referring to the 1860 legislation) plus court costs.

== Description ==
''Byford Dolphin'' drilling rig is an Enhanced [[Aker Solutions|Aker]] H-3 design which was built by [[Aker Group]] at the Aker Verdal shipyard in 1974.&lt;ref name=rigzone1&gt;{{Cite web | title=Rig Data: ''Byford Dolphin'' | publisher=Rigzone | url=http://www.rigzone.com/data/rig_detail.asp?rig_id=102 | accessdate =2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1974 and 1978, it was named '''''Deep Sea Driller'''''.&lt;ref name=dnv1/&gt;

''Byford Dolphin'' has a length of {{convert|108.2|m|ft}}, breadth of {{convert|67.4|m|ft}} and depth of {{convert|36.6|m|ft}}. It has a maximum drilling depth of {{convert|6100|m|ft}}, and it could operate at a water depth of {{convert|460|m|ft|-2}}.&lt;ref name=olsen&gt;{{Cite web|title=Byford Dolphin |publisher=[[Fred.

=== ''Deep Sea Driller'' accident ===

On 1 March 1976, the rig ran aground during transit from a block in the North Sea to [[Bergen]]. All crew were evacuated in the life boats, but six people died when they fell from their life boat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Deep_Sea_Driller-ulykken Deep Sea Driller-ulykken] Store norske leksikon. Retrieved 29 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diving bell accident ===
On 5 November 1983 at 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., while drilling in the [[Frigg gas field]] in the Norwegian sector of the [[North Sea]], four divers were in a [[diving chamber]] system attached by a trunk (a short passage) to a [[diving bell]] on the rig. The divers were Edwin Coward (British, 35 years old),  Roy Lucas (British, 38),  Bjørn Giæver Bergersen (Norwegian, 29) and Truls Hellevik (Norwegian, 34). They were assisted by two dive tenders, Crammond and Saunders.&lt;ref name="pmid3381801"/&gt;

Hellevik was about to close the door between the chamber system and the trunk when the chamber [[explosive decompression|explosively decompressed]] from a pressure of nine [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] to one atmosphere. One of the tenders, 32-year-old William Crammond of Great Britain, and all four of the divers were killed instantly; the other tender, Saunders, was severely injured.&lt;ref name="Limbrick"&gt;{{cite book|title=North Sea Divers - a Requiem|last=Limbrick|first=Jim|pages=168–170|location=[[Hertford]]|publisher=Authors OnLine|year=2001|isbn=0 7552 0036 5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lPp68NAoUF0C&amp;pg=PA168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Byford Dolphin Accident.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The decompression chamber at the moment the accident occurred. D1–D4 are divers; T1 and T2 are dive tenders. The trunk is the section that joins chamber 1 to the diving bell.&lt;ref name="pmid3381801"/&gt;]]
The situation just before this accident was as follows: Decompression chambers 1 and 2 were connected via a trunk to a diving bell. This connection was sealed by a clamp operated by two tenders, who were themselves experienced divers. A third chamber was connected to this system but was not involved. On this day, Coward and Lucas were resting in chamber 2 at a pressure of 9 atm. The diving bell with Bergersen and Hellevik had just been winched up after a dive and joined to the trunk. Leaving their wet gear in the trunk, the divers climbed through the trunk into chamber 1.

'''The normal procedure would have been:'''

# Close the bell door.
# The diving supervisor would then slightly increase the bell pressure to seal this door tightly.
# Close the door between the trunk and chamber 1.
# Slowly depressurize the trunk to 1 atmosphere.
# Open the clamp to separate the bell from the chamber system.

The first two steps had been completed when, for an unknown reason, one of the tenders (Crammond) opened the clamp before Diver 4 (Hellevik) could close the door to the chamber. This resulted in the explosive decompression of the unsealed chamber. Air rushed out of the chamber with tremendous force, jamming the interior trunk door and pushing the bell away, striking the two tenders. The tender who opened the clamp was killed while the other was severely injured.&lt;ref name="pmid3381801"/&gt;&lt;!-- Note for future editors: Hellevik, Diver 4, did not explode as a result of pressure gradient, contrary to popular myth. Please do not edit the text to indicate that he did. The cited text in the Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology, although worded poorly, indicates only that the organs were expelled in conjunction with and as a result of being torn in half below the belly button as he passed through the narrow door opening while also being dismembered by the passage. That is the extent of the article's content and assertions. --&gt;

==== Medical findings ====
Medical investigations were carried out on the four divers' remains. The most conspicuous finding of the [[autopsy]] was large amounts of fat in large [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s and in the [[Heart|cardiac chambers]], as well as intravascular fat in organs, especially the [[liver]].&lt;ref name="pmid3381801"/&gt; This fat was unlikely to be [[embolism|embolic]], but must have [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] from the blood ''[[in situ]]''. It is suggested the rapid bubble formation in the blood [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] the [[lipoprotein]] complexes, rendering the [[lipid]]s insoluble.&lt;ref name="pmid3381801"/&gt; Death of the three divers left intact inside the chambers would have been extremely rapid as circulation was immediately and completely stopped. The fourth diver was dismembered and mutilated by the blast forcing him out through the partially blocked doorway and would have died instantly.&lt;ref name="pmid3381801"/&gt;

Coward, Lucas, and Bergersen were exposed to the effects of [[explosive decompression]] and died in the positions indicated by the diagram. Subsequent investigation by [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologists]] determined that Hellevik, being exposed to the highest pressure gradient and in the process of moving to secure the inner door, was forced through the {{convert|60|cm|in}} [[diameter]] opening created by the jammed interior trunk door by escaping air and violently dismembered, including bisection of his thoracoabdominal cavity, which further resulted in expulsion of all of the internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of his chest and abdomen, except the trachea and a section of small intestine, and of the thoracic [[vertebral column|spine]]. These were projected some distance, one section later being found {{convert|10|m|ft|-1}} vertically above the exterior pressure door.&lt;ref name="pmid3381801" /&gt;
==== Investigation ====
The committee investigating the accident concluded that it was caused by human error on the part of the dive tender who opened the clamp. It is not clear whether the tender who opened the clamp before the trunk was depressurized did so by order of his supervisor, on his own initiative, or because of miscommunication. At the time, the only communication the tenders on the outside of the chamber system had was through a [[bullhorn]] attached to the wall surface; with heavy noise from the rig and sea, it was hard to listen in on what was going on. Fatigue from many hard hours of work also took its toll among the divers, who often worked 16-hour shifts. {{fact|date=June 2018}}

This incident was also attributed to engineering failure. The obsolete ''Byford Dolphin'' diving system, dating from 1975, was not equipped with [[fail-safe]] hatches, outboard pressure gauges, and an interlocking mechanism, which would have prevented the trunk from being opened while the system was under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Norges offentlige utredninger NOU 1984: 11 Dykkerulykken på Byford Dolphin {{ISBN|82-00-70889-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the accident, [[Det Norske Veritas|Norske Veritas]] had issued the following rule for certification: "Connecting mechanisms between bell and chambers are to be so arranged that they cannot be operated when the trunk is pressurized,"&lt;ref&gt;'Rules for certification of diving systems Sec 3 B305, 1982'&lt;/ref&gt; therefore requiring such systems to have fail-safe seals and interlocking mechanisms. One month after the accident, Norske Veritas and the Norwegian oil directorate made the rule final for all bell systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Among others, former crew members of ''Byford Dolphin'' and NOPEF (a Norwegian oil and petro-chemical union) have come forward and claimed the investigation was a [[cover-up]]. They claimed that the commission investigating the accident did not mention in their report the irresponsible dispensations on vital equipment requested by [[Compagnie maritime d'expertises|Comex]] and authorized by the diving section to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, which played a vital role in the accident's occurrence. They also alleged the accident was due to a lack of proper equipment, including clamping mechanisms equipped with interlocking mechanisms (which would be impossible to open while the chamber system was still under pressure), outboard pressure gauges, and a safe communication system, all of which had been held back because of dispensations by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.&lt;ref name="dagbladet"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/tekstarkiv/artikkel.php?id=5001080047056&amp;tag=item&amp;words=byford%3Bdolphin |title=Historiens verste dykkerulykke |trans-title=History's worst diving accident |last=Ringheim |first=Gunnar |date=22 March 2008 |publisher=Dagbladet.no |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-investigation ====

The conclusions of the investigation were disputed, and a group of divers gathered evidence with the intention of "find[ing] justice for all of the crew of ''Byford Dolphin''."&lt;ref name="nsda-bd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pioneerdivers.org/index.php?/en/article/byford_dolphin_05111983/ |title=Byford Dolphin Disaster |last=Wingen |first=Tom |work=Pioneer Divers in the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea |publisher=North Sea Divers Alliance |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727175024/http://www.pioneerdivers.org/index.php?%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fbyford_dolphin_05111983%2F |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group formed the North Sea Divers Alliance in the early 1990s and now{{when|date=January 2018}} campaigns for compensation for divers killed or injured in the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea.&lt;ref name="nsda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pioneerdivers.org/index.php?/en/ |title=Norwegian Sector Divers - Fighting the Norwegian Government over Human Rights Abuses |last=Wingen |first=Tom |work=Pioneer Divers in the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea |publisher=North Sea Divers Alliance |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103101013/http://www.pioneerdivers.org/index.php?%2Fen%2F |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subsequent lawsuit ====

The North Sea Divers Alliance, formed by early North Sea divers and the relatives of those killed, continued to press for further investigation and, in February 2008, obtained a report that indicated the real cause was faulty equipment. Clare Lucas, daughter of Roy Lucas, said: "I would go so far as to say that the Norwegian Government murdered my father because they knew that they were diving with an unsafe decompression chamber."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lister |first=David |title=Families of British divers killed in North Sea oil boom sue Norway |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3613778.ece | work=The Times |accessdate=2009-11-18 | location=London | date=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families of the divers eventually received compensation for the damages from the Norwegian government 26 years after the incident.&lt;ref name=cdiver&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff writers |url=http://cdiver.net/news/norwegian-government-finally-pays-out-for-1983-byford-dolphin-diver-death/#more-3678 |title=Norwegian government finally pays out for 1983 ''Byford Dolphin'' diver death |work=cDiver| date=20 October 2009 | accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other incidents ===
On 17 April 2002, a 44-year-old Norwegian worker on the rig was struck on the head and killed in an [[industrial injury|industrial accident]]. The accident resulted in ''Byford Dolphin'' losing an exploration contract with [[Statoil]], which expressed concerns with the rig's operating procedures. The incident cost the company millions of dollars in lost income.&lt;ref name=cdiver/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2968">'''Cleanliness suitability''' describes the suitability of operating materials and ventilation and air conditioning components for use in cleanrooms where the air cleanliness and other parameters are controlled by way of technical regulations. Tests are carried out to determine this.&lt;ref&gt;VDI 2083, Part 9.1: Cleanroom technology – Compatibility with required cleanliness and surface cleanliness&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VDI 2083, Part 17: Cleanroom technology – Cleanroom and cleanliness suitability of materials&lt;/ref&gt;

Trends such as the miniaturization of structures as well as increased levels of reliability in technology, research and science require controlled “clean” manufacturing environments. The task of such environments is to minimize influences which could damage the products concerned. The cleanroom environments created by filtering the air were originally developed for the fields of microelectronics and microsystem technology but are now used in a wide range of other high technology sectors such as photovoltaics and the automotive industry.

Depending upon the industry and process concerned, different factors may have a damaging influence on a product, e.g.:
# Particles, in microelectronics such as the semiconductor industry and especially biotic particles in life science industries such as pharmaceutics, bio-engineering and medical technology ([[cleanroom suitability]]) 
# Molecular contamination (outgassing), especially in microelectronics such as the semiconductor industry
# Electrostatic discharge phenomena (ESD), especially in microelectronics such as the semiconductor industry
# Resistance to cleaning and disinfection agents, especially  in life science industries such as pharmaceutics
# Surface interaction, especially in life science industries such as pharmaceutics, bio-engineering and medical technology 
# Cleanability, especially in life science industries such as pharmaceutics, bio-engineering and medical technology 
# Microbicidity, especially in life science industries such as pharmaceutics, bio-engineering and medical technology

The following factors may be responsible for contamination:
# The cleanroom itself: Staff, although this is becoming less relevant as more and more staff are banned from working in critical areas, 
# The use of manufacturing equipment, which is increasing as more and more automated solutions are being implemented. 
# Often in direct contact with the product, manufacturing equipment and the materials used in their construction form a further important contamination factor in a clean production environment.

'''Computational law''' is a branch of [[legal informatics]] concerned with the [[mechanization]] of legal reasoning (whether done by humans or by computers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://complaw.stanford.edu/|title=Computational Law - The Cop in the Backseat|first=Michael|last=Genesereth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It emphasizes explicit behavioral constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct.  Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing.

Philosophically, computational law sits within the [[legal formalism|Legal Formalist]] school of [[jurisprudence]].  Given its emphasis on rigorously specified laws, computational law is most applicable in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] settings, where laws are taken more or less literally.  It is less applicable to legal systems based on [[common law]], which provides more scope for unspecified normative considerations.  However, even in common law systems, computational law still has relevance in the case of categorical statutes and in settings where the handling of cases has resulted in [[de facto]] rules.

From a pragmatic perspective, computational law is important as the basis for computer systems capable of doing useful legal calculations, such as compliance checking, legal planning, regulatory analysis, and so forth.  Some systems of this sort already exist.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[TurboTax]] is a good example.  And the potential is particularly significant now due to recent technological advances – including the prevalence of the [[Internet]] in human interaction and the proliferation of [[embedded computer system]]s (such as [[smart phones]], [[self-driving cars]], and [[robot]]s).

== History ==
Speculation about potential benefits to legal practice through applying methods from computational science and AI research to automate parts of the law date back at least to the middle 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;18 Rocky Mntn. L. Rev. 378 (1945-1946) Does the Law Need a Technological Revolution; Kelso, Louis O.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Artificial intelligence and law|AI and law]] and computational law do not seem easily separable, as perhaps most of AI research focusing on the law and its automation appears to utilize computational methods. The forms that speculation took are multiple and not all related in ways to readily show closeness to one another. This history will sketch them as they were, attempting to show relationships where they can be found to have existed.

By 1949, a minor [[academic field]] aiming to incorporate [[Data storage|electronic]] and [[computational]] methods to legal problems had been founded by American legal scholars, called [[jurimetrics]].&lt;ref&gt;33 Minn. L. Rev. 455 (1948-1949) Jurimetrics--The Next Step Forward; Loevinger, Lee&lt;/ref&gt; Though broadly said to be concerned with the application of the "methods of science" to the law, these methods were actually of a quite specifically defined scope. Jurimetrics was to be "concerned with such matters as the quantitative analysis of judicial behavior, the application of communication and information theory to legal expression, the use of mathematical logic in law, the retrieval of legal data by electronic and mechanical means, and the formulation of a calculus of legal predictability".&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, Lee. "Jurimetrics: The methodology of legal inquiry." ''Law and Contemporary Problems'' (1963): 5-35. At 8.&lt;/ref&gt; These interests led in 1959 to the founding a journal, ''Modern Uses of Logic in Law'', as a forum wherein articles would be published about the applications of techniques such as mathematical logic, engineering, statistics, etc. to the legal study and development.&lt;ref&gt;"About Jurimetrics." ''About the Journal''. American Bar Association Section of Science &amp; Technology Law and the Center for Law, Science &amp; Innovation, n.d. Web. 26 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.law.asu.edu/jurimetrics/JurimetricsJournal/AbouttheJournal.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, this Journal was renamed as ''[[Jurimetrics (journal)|Jurimetrics]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid,''&lt;/ref&gt;'' ''Today, however, the journal and meaning of jurimetrics seems to have broadened far beyond what would fit under the areas of applications of computers and computational methods to law. Today the journal not only publishes articles on such practices as found in computational law, but has broadened jurimetrical concerns to mean also things like the use of social science in law or the "policy implications [of] and legislative and administrative control of science".&lt;ref name="ibid."&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently in 1958, at the Conference for the Mechanization of Thought held at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in [[Teddington]], Middlesex, UK, the French jurist Lucien Mehl presented a paper both on the benefits of using computational methods for law and on the potential means to use such methods to automate law for a discussion that included AI luminaries like [[Marvin Minsky]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958''. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1959. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niblett, Bryan. ''Computer Science and the Law: Inaugural Lecture of the Professor of Computer Science Delivered at the College on January 25, 1977''. Swansea, Wales: U College of Swansea, 1977. 7-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mehl believed that the law could by automated by two basic distinct, though not wholly separable, types of machine. These were the "documentary or information machine", which would provide the legal researcher quick access to relevant case precedents and legal scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;"Automation in the Legal World." ''Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958''. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1959. 755-87. Print. At 759.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "consultation machine", which would be "capable of answering any question put to it over a vast field of law".&lt;ref&gt;"Automation in the Legal World." ''Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958''. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1959. 755-87. Print. At 768-769.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter type of machine would be able to basically do much of a lawyer's job by simply giving the "exact answer to a [legal] problem put to it".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid. ''768.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970, Mehl's first type of machine, one that would be able to retrieve information, had been accomplished but there seems to have been little consideration of further fruitful intersections between AI and legal research.&lt;ref&gt;Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning
Bruce G. Buchanan and Thomas E. Headrick, ''Stanford Law Review'', Vol. 23, No. 1 (Nov., 1970), pp. 40-62. At p. 40.
&lt;/ref&gt;  There were, however, still hopes that computers could model the lawyer's thought processes through computational methods and then apply that capacity to solve legal problems, thus automating and improving legal services via increased efficiency as well as shedding light on the nature of legal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning

Bruce G. Buchanan and Thomas E. Headrick

''Stanford Law Review'',Vol. 23, No. 1 (Nov., 1970), pp. 40-62. At p. 51-60.
&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, computer science and the affordability of computer technology had progressed enough that the retrieval of "legal data by electronic and mechanical means" had been achieved by machines fitting Mehl's first type and were in common use in American law firms.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Decisions and Information Systems. Jon Bing and Trygve Harvold. Oslo, Norway: Universitets Forlaget; 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niblett, Bryan. ''Computer Science and Law''. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1980. 7-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, research focused on improving the goals of the early 1970s occurred, with programs like ''Taxman'' being worked on in order to both bring useful computer technology into the law as practical aids and to help specify the exact nature of legal concepts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., L. Thorne McCarty, ''Reflections on Taxman: An Experiment in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning, ''90 Harv. L. Rev. 837-895 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, progress on the second type of machine, one that would more fully automate the law, remained relatively inert.&lt;ref&gt;''Supra'', Niblett, p. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Research into machines that could answer questions in the way that Mehl's consultation machine would picked up somewhat in the late 1970s and 1980s. A 1979 convention in [[Swansea]], Wales marked the first international effort solely to focus upon applying artificial intelligence research to legal problems in order to "consider how computers can be used to discover and apply the legal norms embedded within the written sources of the law".&lt;ref&gt;B. Niblett, editor. Computer Science and Law: An Advanced Course. Cambridge University Press, 1980. This volume is a record of the proceedings of a workshop held at University College of Swansea, Wales, September 17–27, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, L. Thorne. "Artificial Intelligence and Law: How to get there from here." ''Ratio Juris'' 3.2 (1990): 189-200. At 189.&lt;/ref&gt; That said, little substantial progress seems to have been made in the following decade of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Though this is contestable. For an argument supporting, see McCarty, L. Thorne. "Artificial Intelligence and Law: How to get there from here." ''Ratio Juris'' 3.2 (1990): 189-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 review of Anne Gardner's book ''An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Legal Reasoning ''(1987), the Harvard academic legal scholar and computer scientist Edwina Rissland wrote that "She plays, in part, the role of pioneer; [[artificial intelligence]] ("AI") techniques have not yet been widely applied to perform legal tasks. Therefore, Gardner, and this review, first describe and define the field, then demonstrate a working model in the domain of contract offer and acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;Rissland, Edwina. "Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning: A Discussion of the Field and Gardner's Book." ''AI Magazine'' 9.3 (1988): 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years after the Swansea conference had passed, and still AI and law researchers merely trying to delineate the field could be described by their own kind as "pioneer[s]".

In the 1990s and early 2000s more progress occurred.

''Stanford Computational Law''. Stanford University, n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://complaw.stanford.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Computational methods in fact advanced enough that members of the legal profession began in the 2000s to both analyze, predict and worry about the potential future of computational law and a new academic field of computational legal studies seems to be now well established. As insight into what such scholars see in the law's future due in part to computational law, here is quote from a recent conference about the "New Normal" for the legal profession:

:"Over the last 5 years, in the fallout of the Great Recession, the legal profession has entered the era of the New Normal. Notably, a series of forces related to technological change, globalization, and the pressure to do more with less (in both corporate America and law firms) has changed permanently the legal services industry. As '''one article''' put it, firms are cutting back on hiring "in order to increase efficiency, improve profit margins, and reduce client costs." Indeed, in its recently noted cutbacks, Weil Gotshal's '''leaders remarked''' that it had initially expected old work to return, but came "around to the view that this is the ‘new normal.’"The New Normal provides lawyers with an opportunity to rethink—and reimagine—the role of lawyers in our economy and society. To the extent that law firms enjoyed, or still enjoy, the ability to bundle work together, that era is coming to an end, as clients unbundle legal services and tasks. Moreover, in other cases, automation and technology can change the roles of lawyers, both requiring them to oversee processes and use technology more aggressively as well as doing less of the work that is increasingly managed by computers (think: electronic discovery). The upside is not only greater efficiencies for society, but new possibilities for legal craftsmanship. The emerging craft of lawyering in the New Normal is likely to require lawyers to be both entrepreneurial and fluent with a range of competencies that will enable them to add value for clients. Apropos of the trends noted above, there are emerging opportunities for "legal entrepreneurs" in a range of roles from legal process management to developing technologies to manage legal operations (such as overseeing automated processes) to supporting online dispute resolution processes. In other cases, effective legal training as well as domain specific knowledge (finance, sales, IT, entrepreneurship, human resources, etc.) can form a powerful combination that prepares law school grads for a range of opportunities (business development roles, financial operations roles, HR roles, etc.). In both cases, traditional legal skills alone will not be enough to prepare law students for these roles. But the proper training, which builds on the traditional law school curriculum and goes well beyond it including practical skills, relevant domain knowledge (e.g., accounting), and professional skills (e.g., working in teams), will provide law school students a huge advantage over those with a one-dimensional skill set."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Future of Law School Innovation (Conference @ColoradoLaw)."Computational Legal Studies''. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://computationallegalstudies.com/2014/04/17/the-future-of-law-school-innovation-conference-coloradolaw/&gt;.''&lt;/ref&gt;''
Many see perks to oncoming changes brought about by the computational automation of law. For one thing, legal experts have predicted that it will aid legal self-help, especially in the areas of contract formation, enterprise planning, and the prediction of rule changes.&lt;ref name="ibid."/&gt; For another thing, those with knowledge about computers see the potential for computational law to really fully bloom as eminent. In this vein, it seems that machines like Mehl's second type may come into existence. [[Stephen Wolfram]] has said that:

:"So we're slowly moving toward people being educated in the kind of computational paradigm. Which is good, because the way I see it, computation is going to become central to almost every field. Let's talk about two examples—classic professions: law and medicine. It's funny, when Leibniz was first thinking about computation at the end of the 1600s, the thing he wanted to do was to build a machine that would effectively answer legal questions. It was too early then. But now we’re almost ready, I think, for computational law. Where for example contracts become computational. They explicitly become algorithms that decide what's possible and what's not.You know, some pieces of this have already happened. Like with financial derivatives, like options and futures. In the past these used to just be natural language contracts. But then they got codified and parametrized. So they’re really just algorithms, which of course one can do meta-computations on, which is what has launched a thousand hedge funds, and so on. Well, eventually one's going to be able to make computational all sorts of legal things, from mortgages to tax codes to perhaps even patents. Now to actually achieve that, one has to have ways to represent many aspects of the real world, in all its messiness. Which is what the whole knowledge-based computing of Wolfram|Alpha is about."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. "Talking about the Computational Future at SXSW 2013—Stephen Wolfram Blog." ''Stephen Wolfram Blog RSS''. N.p., 19 Mar. 2013. Web. 17 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/03/talking-about-the-computational-future-at-sxsw-2013/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Algorithmic law ===
There have also been many attempts to create a [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] or machine executable [[legal code]]. A machine readable code would simplify the analysis of legal code, allowing the rapid construction and analysis of databases, without the need for advanced text processing techniques. A machine executable format would allow the specifics of a case to be input, and would return the decision based on the case.

Machine readable legal code is already quite common.  METAlex,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalex.eu/]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[XML]]-based standard proposed and developed by the [[Leibniz Center for Law]] of the [[University of Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dare.uva.nl/record/1/425496|title=University of Amsterdam Digital Academic Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used by the governments of both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to encode their laws. In the United States, an executive order issued by President [[Barack Obama]] in the May 2013 mandated that all public government documentation be released in a machine readable format by default, although no specific format was mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;The White House. Office of the Press Secretary. ''Executive Order -- Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information''. N.p., 9 May 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine executable legal code is much less common. Notable among current efforts is the Hammurabi Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/mpoulshock/HammurabiProject|title=The Hammurabi Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt to rewrite parts of the United States legal code in such a way that a law can take facts as input and return decisions. The Hammurabi Project currently focuses on the aspects of law that lend themselves to this type of specification, such as [[tax law|tax]] or [[immigration law]]s, although in the long-term the developers of the Hammurabi Project plan to include as many laws as possible.

=== Empirical analysis ===
Many current efforts in computational law are focused on the empirical analysis of legal decisions, and their relation to legislation.  These efforts usually make use of [[citation analysis]], which examines patterns in citations between works. Due to the widespread practice of [[legal citation]], it is possible to construct [[citation indices]] and large [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] of legal precedent, called citation networks. Citation networks allow the use of [[graph traversal]] algorithms in order to relate cases to one another, as well as the use of various distance metrics to find mathematical relationships between them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fowler, J. H., T. R. Johnson, J. F. Spriggs, S. Jeon, and P. J. Wahlbeck. "Network Analysis and the Law: Measuring the Legal Importance of Precedents at the U.S. Supreme Court." ''Political Analysis'' 15.3 (2006): 324-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J., and Daniel M. Katz. "A Mathematical Approach to the Study of the United States Code." ''Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications'' 389.19 (2010): 4195-200. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J., Daniel Martin Katz, Jonathan L. Zelner, and James H. Fowler. "Distance Measures for Dynamic Citation Networks." ''Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications'' 389.19 (2010): 4201-208. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses can reveal important overarching patterns and trends in judicial proceedings and the way law is used.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There have been several breakthroughs in the analysis of judicial rulings in recent research on legal citation networks. These analyses have made use of citations in Supreme Court majority opinions to build citation networks, and analyzed the patterns in these networks to identify meta-information about individual decisions, such as the importance of the decision, as well as general trends in judicial proceedings, such as the role of [[precedent]] over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Fowler, James H., and Sangick Jeon. "The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent." ''Social Networks'' 30.1 (2008): 16-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses have been used to predict which cases the Supreme Court will choose to consider.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another effort has examined [[United States Tax Court]] decisions, compiling a publicly available database of Tax Court decisions, opinions, and citations between the years of 1990 and 2008, and constructing a citation network from this database. Analysis of this network revealed that large sections of the tax code were rarely, if ever, cited, and that other sections of code, such as those that dealt with "divorce, dependents, nonprofits, hobby and business expenses and losses, and general definition of income," were involved the vast majority of disputes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J. "Empirical Survey of the Population of US Tax Court Written Decisions, An." ''Va. Tax Rev.'' 30 (2010): 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has also been focused on [[hierarchical networks]], in combination with citation networks, and the analysis of [[United States Code]]. This research has been used to analyze various aspects of the Code, including its size, the density of citations within and between sections of the Code, the type of language used in the Code, and how these features vary over time. This research has been used to provide commentary on the nature of the Code's change over time, which is characterized by an increase in size and in interdependence between sections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Visualization ===
Visualization of legal code, and of the relationships between various laws and decisions, is also a hot topic in computational law. Visualizations allow both professionals and laypeople to see large-scale relationships and patterns, which may be difficult to see using standard legal analysis or empirical analysis.

Legal citation networks lend themselves to visualization, and many citation networks which are analyzed empirically also have sub-sections of the network that are represented visually as a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there are still many technical problems in [[network visualization]]. The density of connections between nodes, and the sheer number of nodes in some cases, can make the visualization incomprehensible to humans. There are a variety of methods that can be used to reduce the complexity of the displayed information, for example by defining semantic sub-groups within the network, and then representing relationships between these semantic groups, rather than between every node.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shneiderman, Ben, and Aleks Aris. "Network Visualization by Semantic Substrates." ''IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'' 12.5 (2006): 733-40. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the visualization to be human readable, but the reduction in complexity can obscure relationships. Despite this limitation, visualization of legal citation networks remains a popular field and practice.

'''Azaria Chamberlain''' (11 June 1980 – 17 August 1980) was an Australian 2-month-old baby girl who was killed by a [[dingo]] on the night of 17 August 1980 on a family camping trip to [[Uluru]] (formerly known as Ayers Rock) in the [[Northern Territory]]. Her body was never found. Her parents, [[Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton|Lindy]] and [[Michael Chamberlain]], reported that she had been taken from their tent by a dingo. Lindy Chamberlain was, however, tried for murder and spent more than three years in prison. She was released when a piece of Azaria's clothing was found near a dingo lair, and new inquests were opened. In 2012, 32 years after Azaria's death, the Chamberlains' version of events was officially supported by a coroner.

An initial [[inquest]] held in [[Alice Springs]] supported the parents' claim and was highly critical of the police investigation. The findings of the inquest were broadcast live on television—a first in Australia. Subsequently, after a further investigation and a second inquest held in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Lindy Chamberlain was tried for murder, convicted on 29 October 1982 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Azaria's father, Michael Chamberlain, was convicted as an [[accessory after the fact]] and given a suspended sentence. The [[Trial by media|media focus]] for the trial was unusually intense and aroused accusations of [[sensationalism]], while the trial itself was criticised for being unprofessional and biased. The Chamberlains made several unsuccessful appeals, including the final [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] appeal.

After all legal options had been exhausted, the chance discovery in 1986 of a piece of Azaria's clothing in an area full of dingo lairs led to Lindy Chamberlain's release from prison. On 15 September 1988, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously overturned all convictions against Lindy and Michael Chamberlain.&lt;ref name="austlii1988"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NTSC|64|1988|litigants=Reference Under s.433A of the Criminal Code by the Attorney-General for the Northern Territory of Australia of Convictions of Alice Lynne Chamberlain and Michael Leigh Chamberlain No. CA2 of 1988 Courts and Judges – Criminal Law – Statute |date=15 September 1988 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A third inquest was conducted in 1995, which resulted in an "open" finding.&lt;ref name="3rdinquestfindings"/&gt; At a fourth inquest held on 12 June 2012, Coroner Elizabeth Morris delivered her findings that Azaria Chamberlain had been taken and killed by a dingo.

Numerous books have been written about the case. The story has been made into a TV movie, a feature film, ''[[Evil Angels (film)|Evil Angels]]'' (released outside of Australia and [[New Zealand]] as ''A Cry in the Dark''), a TV miniseries, a play by Brooke Pierce, a concept album by Australian band [[The Paradise Motel]] and an opera, ''[[Lindy (opera)|Lindy]]'', by [[Moya Henderson]].

==Coroner's inquests==
The initial [[Coroner|coronial]] inquest into the disappearance was opened in Alice Springs on 15 December 1980 before [[magistrate]] Denis Barritt. On 20 February 1981, in the first live telecast of Australian court proceedings, Barritt ruled that the likely cause was a dingo attack. In addition to this finding, Barritt also concluded that, subsequent to the attack, "the body of Azaria was taken from the possession of the dingo, and disposed of by an unknown method, by a person or persons, name unknown".&lt;ref name="whodunit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&amp;inttype=1&amp;intid=884 |title=All the makings of a classic whodunnit |work=The Age |location=Australia |author=Brian Johnstone |date=30 October 1982 |accessdate=24 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904010038/http://150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&amp;inttype=1&amp;intid=884 |archivedate=4 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Northern Territory Police]] and prosecutors were dissatisfied with this finding. Investigations continued, leading to a second inquest in Darwin in September 1981. Based on [[Ultraviolet photography|ultraviolet photographs]] of Azaria's jumpsuit, [[James Cameron (scientist)|James Cameron]] of the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]] alleged that "there was an incised wound around the neck of the jumpsuit—in other words, a cut throat" and that there was an imprint of the hand of a small adult on the jumpsuit, visible in the photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rintoul|first=Stuart|title='Azaria's spirit can rest'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/azarias-spirit-can-rest/story-e6frg6z6-1226393519416|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this and other findings, the Chamberlains were charged with Azaria's murder.

In 1995, a third inquest was conducted which failed to determine a cause of death, resulting in an "open" finding.&lt;ref name = "3rdinquestfindings"/&gt;

In December 2011 the Northern Territory coroner, Elizabeth Morris, announced that a fourth inquest would be held in February 2012.&lt;ref name="Age third inquest"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Malcolm|title=NT coroner to hold new Azaria inquest 30 years on|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/nt-coroner-to-hold-new-azaria-inquest-30-years-on-20111217-1p0c3.html|accessdate=17 December 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June 2012 at a fourth coronial inquest into the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain, Morris ruled that a dingo was responsible for her death in 1980.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt; Morris made the finding in the light of subsequent reports of [[Dingo attacks in Australia#Attacks on humans|dingo attacks on humans]] causing injury and death. She stated, "Azaria Chamberlain died at Ayers Rock, on 17 August 1980. The cause of her death was as a result of being attacked and taken by a dingo."&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt; Morris offered her condolences to the parents and brothers of Azaria Chamberlain "on the death of [their] special and dearly loved daughter and sister" and stated that a [[death certificate]] with the cause of death had been registered.&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;

==Case against Lindy Chamberlain==
{{main|Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton}}
The Crown alleged that Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria's throat in the front seat of the family car, hiding the baby's body in a large camera case. She then, according to the proposed reconstruction of the crime, rejoined the group of campers around a campfire and fed one of her sons a can of baked beans, before going to the tent and raising the cry that a dingo had taken the baby. It was alleged that at a later time, while other people from the campsite were searching, she disposed of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/highcourt_project/Chamberlain%20Case%20rtf.rtf |title=Chamberlain Case (High Court Project) |date= |accessdate=13 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208054350/http://law.anu.edu.au/highcourt_project/Chamberlain%20Case%20rtf.rtf |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key evidence supporting this allegation was the jumpsuit, as well as a highly contentious forensic report claiming to have found evidence of [[foetal haemoglobin]] in stains on the front seat of the Chamberlains' 1977 [[Holden Torana|Torana]] hatchback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waterford|first=Jack|title=No safety from legal lynching|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/no-safety-from-legal-lynching-20120612-208gp.html|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foetal haemoglobin is present in infants six months and younger; Azaria was nine weeks old at the time of her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubert|first1=Lawrence|last2=Wainer|first2=Howard|title=A Statistical Guide for the Ethically Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wb6kIJhMeIC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=25 September 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-7368-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindy Chamberlain was questioned about the garments that Azaria was wearing. She claimed that Azaria was wearing a [[Infant cardigan|matinee jacket]] over the jumpsuit, but the jacket was not present when the garments were found. She was questioned about the fact that Azaria's [[Sleeveless shirt|singlet]], which was inside the jumpsuit, was inside out. She insisted that she never put a singlet on her babies inside out and that she was most particular about this. The statement conflicted with the state of the garments when they were collected as evidence.&lt;ref name="bluebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindychamberlain.com/files/Blue_Book.pdf |title="A Synopsis of the Identity of the Spray Material on the Dash Support Bracket in the Car of Mr &amp; Ms M L Chamberlain" by L.

In her defence, eyewitness evidence was presented of dingoes having been seen in the area on the evening of 17 August 1980. All witnesses claimed to believe the Chamberlains' story. One witness, a nurse, also reported having heard a baby's cry after the time when the prosecution alleged Azaria had been murdered.&lt;ref name = "umkc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Trial of Lindy and Michael Chamberlain ("The Dingo Trial"): A Trial Commentary|year=2012|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/chamberlain/chamberlainaccount.html|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|work=[[University of Missouri–Kansas City]]|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was also presented that adult blood also passed the test used for foetal haemoglobin, and that other organic compounds can produce similar results on that particular test, including mucus from the nose and chocolate milkshakes, both of which had been present in the vehicle where Azaria was allegedly murdered.{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}

Engineer Les Harris, who had conducted dingo research for over a decade, said that, contrary to Cameron's findings, a dingo's [[carnassial]] teeth can shear through material as tough as motor vehicle seat belts. He also cited an example of a captive female dingo removing a bundle of meat from its wrapping paper and leaving the paper intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Les|title=Report of Les Harris, Expert on Dingo Behavior, on the Propensity of Dingoes to Attack Humans|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/chamberlain/dingoreport.html|work=University of Missouri–Kansas City|accessdate=23 January 2014|date=December 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was also presented to the effect that a dingo was strong enough to carry a kangaroo and a report of the removal of a three-year-old girl by a dingo from the back seat of a tourist's motor vehicle at the camping area just weeks before, an event witnessed by the parents.{{Citation needed|date = June 2012}}

The defence's case was rejected by the jury. Lindy Chamberlain was convicted of murder on 29 October 1982 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Michael Chamberlain was found guilty as an accessory after the fact&lt;ref name="umkc"/&gt; and was given an 18-month suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/205869/michael-chamberlain-life-interrupted/ |title=Michael Chamberlain: Life, interrupted |author=Rosemarie Milsom |date=20 Jul 2012 |journal=Newcastle Herald |accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeals===
An unsuccessful appeal was made to the Federal Court in April 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|78|1983|litigants=Re Alice Lynne Chamberlain and Michael Leigh Chamberlain v R |date=29 April 1983 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the High Court of Australia were asked to quash the convictions on the ground that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. However,  in February 1984 the court refused the appeal by majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1984|litigants=Chamberlain v RE II High Court Verdict |date=22 February 1984 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and acquittal==
[[File:ABC Lindy Chamberlain Free.ogv|thumb|1986 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report of Lindy Chamberlain's release.]]
The final resolution of the case was triggered by a chance discovery. In early 1986, English tourist David Brett fell to his death from Uluru during an evening climb. Because of the vast size of the rock and the scrubby nature of the surrounding terrain, it was eight days before Brett's remains were discovered, lying below the bluff where he had lost his footing and in an area full of dingo lairs. As police searched the area, looking for missing bones that might have been carried off by dingoes, they discovered a small item of clothing. It was quickly identified as the crucial missing piece of evidence from the Chamberlain case, Azaria's missing matinee jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simper|first=Errol|title=Discovery of jacket vindicated Lindy|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/discovery-of-jacket-vindicated-lindy/story-e6frg6z6-1225905092032|accessdate=17 August 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]] ordered Lindy Chamberlain's immediate release and the case was reopened. On 15 September 1988, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously overturned all convictions against Lindy and Michael Chamberlain.&lt;ref name="austlii1988"/&gt; The exoneration was based on a rejection of two key points of the prosecution's case and of biased and invalid assumptions made during the initial trial.{{Citation needed|date = June 2012}}

The questionable nature of the forensic evidence in the Chamberlain trial, and the weight given to it, raised concerns about such procedures and about expert testimony in criminal cases. The prosecution had successfully argued that the pivotal haemoglobin tests indicated the presence of foetal haemoglobin in the Chamberlains' car and it was a significant factor in the original conviction. But it was later shown that these tests were highly unreliable and that similar tests, conducted on a "sound deadener" sprayed on during the manufacture of the car, had yielded virtually identical results.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Commission of Inquiry into Chamberlain Convictions, Report, Commonwealth Parliamentary Papers (1987), volume 15, paper 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after they were exonerated, the Chamberlains were awarded $1.3 million in compensation for wrongful imprisonment, a sum that covered less than one third of their legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fife-Yeomans|first=Janet|title=Northern Territory Government apology to Lindy and Michael Chamberlain unlikely|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/northern-territory-government-apology-to-lindy-and-michael-chamberlain-wont-happen/story-fnat7jnn-1226395003232#|accessdate=17 August 2013|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings of the third coroner's inquest were released on 13 December 1995; the coroner found "the cause and manner of death as unknown."&lt;ref name="3rdinquestfindings"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowndes|first=John|title=Inquest into the Death of Azaria Chamberlain|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/justice/courtsupp/coroner/findings/other/chamberlain_3.pdf|work=Coroners Court of the Northern Territory|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=13 December 1995|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010184939/http://www.nt.gov.au/justice/courtsupp/coroner/findings/other/chamberlain_3.pdf|archivedate=10 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media involvement and bias==
The Chamberlain trial was the most publicised in Australian history.&lt;ref name="whodunit"/&gt;{{Better source|reason=need a source later than 1982|date=May 2018}} Given that most of the evidence presented in the case against Lindy Chamberlain was later rejected, the case is now used as an example of how media and bias can adversely affect a trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationaltreasures.nla.gov.au/index/Treasures/item/nla.int-ex13-s9|title=Lindy Chamberlain|work=National Library of Australia|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public and media opinion during the trial was polarised, with "fanciful rumours and sickening jokes" and many cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/prisoners-of-a-nations-prejudices/2005/06/16/1118869038377.html|title=Prisoners of a nation's prejudices|date=17 June 2005|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chamberlain ("Dingo") Trial as Seen by Cartoonists|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/chamberlain/chamberlaincartoons.html|work=University of Missouri-Kansas City|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, antagonism was directed towards Lindy Chamberlain for reportedly not behaving like a "stereotypical" grieving mother.&lt;ref name = "RockOpera"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/11/1034222592161.html|title=Rock Opera|date=12 October 2002|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much was made of the Chamberlains' [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] religion, including false allegations that the church was actually a cult that [[Blood libel|killed infants]] as part of bizarre religious ceremonies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steel|first=Fiona|title=A Cry in the Night Part 1 of 3|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/chamberlain1/1.html|work=[[TruTV]]|publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks, Inc.|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the family took a newborn baby to a remote desert location, and that Lindy Chamberlain showed little emotion during the proceedings.{{Citation needed|date = June 2012}}

One anonymous tip was received from a man, falsely claiming to be Azaria's doctor in Mount Isa, that the name "Azaria" meant "sacrifice in the wilderness" (it actually means "God helped").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creswell|first1=Toby|last2=Trenoweth|first2=Samantha|title=1001 Australians You Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqtinbjO0oEC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Pluto Press Australia|isbn=978-1-86403-361-8|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others claimed that Lindy Chamberlain was a [[Witchcraft|witch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/13/cry.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419050130/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/13/cry.html|archivedate = 19 April 2008| title = A Cry in the Dark| publisher = sensesofcinema.com| accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The press appeared to seize upon any point that could be sensationalised. For example, it was reported that Lindy Chamberlain dressed her baby in a black dress. This provoked negative opinion, despite the trends of the early 1980s, during which black and navy cotton girls' dresses were in fashion, often trimmed with brightly coloured ribbon, or printed with brightly coloured sprigs of flowers.&lt;ref name="tongueswagging"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/the-dress-that-got-tongues-wagging-and-split-a-nation/2005/09/06/1125772520045.html|title=The dress that got tongues wagging and split a nation|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 September 2005|accessdate=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/azaria-chamberlains-dress|title=Azaria Chamberlain's dress|work=[[National Museum of Australia]]|publisher=Government of Australia|year=2005|accessdate=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events==
Since the Chamberlain case, proven cases of attacks on humans by dingoes have been discussed in the public domain, in particular dingo attacks on [[Fraser Island]] (off the Queensland coast), the last refuge in Australia for isolated pure-bred wild dingoes. In the wake of these attacks, it emerged that there had been at least 400 documented dingo attacks on Fraser Island. Most were against children, but at least two were on adults.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- not the best ref but ...--&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/fraser-island-dingo-attack-wont-affect-tourism/2007/04/19/1176696962750.html|title=Fraser Island dingo attack won't affect tourism|date=19 April 2007|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in April 1998, a 13-month-old girl was attacked by a dingo and dragged for about one metre (3&amp;nbsp;ft) from a picnic blanket at the Waddy Point camping area. The child was dropped when her father intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Long history of Fraser dingo attacks|url=http://www.igorilla.com/gorilla/animal/2001/dingo_attacks_fraser_island.html|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=The Age|date=30 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, Frank Cole, a Melbourne pensioner, claimed that he had shot a dingo in 1980 and found a baby in its mouth. After interviewing Cole on the matter, police decided not to reopen the case. He claimed to have the ribbons from the jacket which Azaria had been wearing when she disappeared as proof of his involvement. However, Lindy Chamberlain claimed that the jacket had no ribbons on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/06/1096949553799.html|title=Close Azaria case for good now: Lindy|date=6 October 2004|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|agency=AAP|accessdate=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole's credibility was further damaged when it was revealed he had made unsubstantiated claims about another case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frank Cole makes claims about another murder mystery|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/06/1094322711909.html|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 September 2004|agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, a 25-year-old woman named Erin Horsburgh claimed that she was Azaria Chamberlain, but her claims were rejected by the authorities and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' programme, which stated that none of the reports linking Horsburgh to the Chamberlain case had any substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A dingo ate their ethics|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1468444.htm|work=[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=26 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Holden Torana]] car that was tested for Azaria's blood in the original court case was used in the wedding of Aidan Chamberlain, Azaria's brother, who was six when his sister disappeared. His bride arrived at the ceremony in the car and his father, Michael Chamberlain, said that he was proud the couple had chosen to use the car which was the centrepiece of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Azaria Chamberlain blood car used in brother's wedding|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/azaria-blood-car-used-in-wedding/story-e6freuzi-1111115574857|accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The cause of Azaria Chamberlain's disappearance was determined and announced on 12 June 2012.

[[John Bryson (author)|John Bryson]]'s book ''Evil Angels'' was published in 1985, and in 1988, Australian film director [[Fred Schepisi]] adapted the book into a [[Evil Angels (film)|feature film of the same name]] (released as ''A Cry in the Dark'' outside of Australia and New Zealand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Cry in the Dark (1988) – Release Info|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094924/releaseinfo|work=[[IMDb]]|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It starred [[Meryl Streep]] as Lindy Chamberlain and [[Sam Neill]] as Michael Chamberlain. The film gave Streep her eighth [[Academy Award]] nomination and her first [[AACTA Awards|AFI award]].

In 2002, ''[[Lindy (opera)|Lindy]]'', an opera by [[Moya Henderson]], was produced by [[Opera Australia]] at the [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref name = "RockOpera"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moya Henderson|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/musicshow/moya-henderson/3524224#transcript|work=[[ABC Radio National]]|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=26 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was dramatised as a TV miniseries, ''Through My Eyes'' (2004), with [[Miranda Otto]] and [[Craig McLachlan]] as the Chamberlains. This miniseries was based on Lindy Chamberlain's book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/22/1100972318463.html|title=Trial by fury|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 November 2004|last=Enker|first=Debi|accessdate=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''death of Joe Cinque''' occurred in [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]] on 26 October 1997. Cinque's coffee was laced with [[rohypnol]], a sedative, at a dinner party, after which he was injected with a lethal dose of [[heroin]] by his girlfriend Anu Singh, who was a law student at the [[Australian National University]] at the time. 

Singh was convicted in 1999 of [[manslaughter]]. She was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, but was released early in 2001. Since her release, she has undertaken [[criminology]] research. 

The crime was portrayed in [[Helen Garner]]'s celebrated [[non-fiction]] book ''[[Joe Cinque's Consolation]]'' (2004), which was later adapted into a [[Joe Cinque's Consolation (film)|film of the same name]].

Cinque and Singh met in [[Newcastle, New South Wales]] in 1995. The following year, Singh and Cinque were living together in [[Canberra]] while she was a law student at the [[Australian National University]]. During the 1998 trial, one of Singh's friends testified that she had been highly obsessed with her [[self-image]], particularly her body, since 1991 and had briefly taken [[Syrup of ipecac|ipecac]] after Cinque mentioned it, something she was later angry with him for. Singh was reportedly obsessed with [[fad diet]]s and would spend hours working out at the gym—she had told friends "she'd rather be dead than fat".&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Joe Cinque's Consolation|year=2004|publisher=Picador|last=Garner|first=Helen|page=15|isbn=978-0-33-042178-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Cinque===
In May&amp;nbsp;1997 Singh told a friend that she wanted to kill several people, including Cinque, her ex-boyfriend Simon Walsh&lt;ref name="CourtTranscript"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Queen v Anu Singh [1999] ACTSC 32|work=netk.net.au|date=23 April 1999|accessdate=9 August 2017|url=http://netk.net.au/Australia/Singh.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armitage|first=Liz|title=Accused Spoke Of Rampage, Court Told|date=24 October 1998|work=[[The Canberra Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singh's close friend Madhavi Rao invited acquaintances to two dinner parties in October 1997 and told them that a crime would be committed.&lt;ref name="conspiretokill"&gt;{{cite news|title=ACT Law Students "conspire To Kill"|last=Armitage|first=Liz|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=5 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witness Sanjeeva Tennekoon reported that the first dinner party on 24 October was normal and that Singh and Cinque appeared loving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singh And Boyfriend Appeared To Be Happy Couple: Witness|last=Armitage|first=Liz|date=6 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another witness told the court that Rao had told her afterwards that Singh had tried to kill Cinque that evening but did not deliver a sufficient dose, and that the witness had threatened to go to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armitage|first=Liz|title=Witness Tells Court Of Murder Plan|date=7 November 1998|work=[[The Canberra Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the first dinner party, Singh and Rao went to a friend, Len Mancini, and told him they had given Cinque drugs the previous evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armitage|first=Liz|title=Accused Wanted To Kill Herself: Friend|date=11 November 1998|work=[[The Canberra Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinque died on 26 October 1997, the morning after the second dinner party. [[Toxicology]] reports showed high levels of [[heroin]] and [[rohypnol]] in his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armitage|first=Liz|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=31 December 1997|title=Passions Parade Before The Bench}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witness Ross Manley claimed that Singh bought more heroin from Manley's friend on the morning of 26 October.&lt;ref name="buyingheroin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Armitage|first=Liz|date=29 October 1998|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|title=Singh "nervous" Buying Heroin, Court Hears }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man's Death 'Not To Plan'|date=21 October 1998|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh called an [[ambulance]] for Cinque at 12:10pm on 26 October, and the ambulance officers found that he had had a [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="buyingheroin"/&gt; Singh made it difficult for the ambulance to respond quickly, giving a false address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=13 February 1998|last=Whittington|first=Josh|title=20-minute 000 call|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh told police at the scene that she had administered drugs to Cinque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armitage|first=Liz|title=Drug Death: Law Student To Stand Trial|date=23 April 1998|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|quote=And I had some heroin and I just kept pumping it into him.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police reported that when they arrived at the scene, Singh was hysterical and struggled with police and ambulance officers when they took her away from Cinque's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whittington|first=Josh|title=A Very Broad Smile: Officer Tells of Accused's Action|date=22 October 1998|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial ===
Singh first appeared in court on 28 October 1997, charged with murder. She had told police that she had injected Cinque with heroin so that he would not interfere with a suicide attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman On Murder Charge|date=28 October 1997|work=[[The Canberra Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rao was charged with [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to commit murder and released on bail on 5 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bail For Student Linked To Party Murder|last=Armitage|first=Liz|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=6 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor noted that both Singh and Rao had been indiscreet about their actions.&lt;ref name="conspiretokill"/&gt; Singh applied for bail in December, and a [[psychiatrist]] presented evidence of a [[personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murder Case Bail Decision Adjourned|date=5 December 1997|work=[[The Canberra Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution pinpointed Singh as someone who embodied strong [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] traits. 

Singh and Rao were tried jointly in October and November 1998, but this trial was aborted on 11 November, with [[Judge|Justice]] Ken Crispin saying that one of the pieces of evidence was problematic as it was unclear as to which of Singh or Rao it was admissible against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Law student trial aborted|date=12 November 1998|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second trial, Singh elected to stand trial by judge alone, forgoing a [[jury]]. Justice Crispin ruled that Singh and Rao should be tried separately in the interest of fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murder Accused To Face Trial By Judge|date=17 November 1998|work=[[The Canberra Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
Anu Singh was born in [[India]] on 3 September 1972 to [[Indian Australians|Indian Australian]] parents, Pradyumn "Paddy" and Surinder Singh, both doctors.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Crime week — Bright Young Things: Killer Anu Singh one-sided suicide pact with boyfriend Joe Cinque|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=6 May 2014|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/crime-week-bright-young-things-killer-anu-singh-onesided-suicide-pact-with-boyfriend-joe-cinque/story-fni0cx12-1226902559824|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family emigrated from India to [[Sydney]] in 1973, when Singh was a baby. They settled in the suburb of [[Strathfield, New South Wales|Strathfield]]. Singh attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic high school]] in Newcastle, where she was the [[dux]] of year 10 in 1988.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph" /&gt; She graduated high school in 1990 and moved to Canberra the following year to begin studying a double degree in Economics/Law at the [[Australian National University]]. Singh missed her life in Sydney, engaged in [[recreational drug use]] while living in Canberra, and frequently called home to her parents.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph" /&gt; As a result, she deferred her studies for one year to return to her family in Sydney.&lt;ref name="CourtTranscript" /&gt;

Singh's early life was relatively unremarkable, and her father remarked on her as a "happy-go-lucky child" ''albeit'' one with some attachment issues,&lt;ref name="CourtTranscript" /&gt; who gradually descended into mental illness in her twenties. According to Paddy Singh, Anu's problems escalated in 1995. It was around this time she had an affair with Joe Cinque. After Singh's break-up with an ex-boyfriend, Simon Walsh, as a result of her brief affair with Cinque, she began to use recreational drugs daily, developed [[insomnia]] and would pace the house at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Accused's conduct changed — father|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=7 April 1999|accessdate=17 May 2017|url=http://www.joecinque.com.au/crime-interview-with-anu-singhs-father}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh's break-up with Walsh was referred to as a "significant life event" in the court transcripts of her trial.

During her relationship with Cinque, she was dieting excessively and would obsess about her weight.&lt;ref name="CourtTranscript" /&gt; Singh's problems appeared to stabilise briefly during the early days of her relationship with Cinque, but soon returned after they moved in together. Her university attendance became sporadic, and on the rare occasion when she was seen by her peers, she appeared to be "dishevelled" and "poorly dressed"—in contrast to her earlier generally immaculate and prideful dress sense.&lt;ref name="CourtTranscript" /&gt; Singh's father took her to various [[psychologist]]s and psychiatrists for help, who opined Singh's problem was "psychological", not "physical", as she had indignantly believed.&lt;ref name="CourtTranscript" /&gt; In her teenage diary entries unearthed during the trial, Singh described herself as a "confirmed bitch, vain, materialistic, self-opinionated, lascivious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defendant vain, self-centred: expert witness|url=http://joecinque.com.au/crime-forensic-psychiatrist-states-anu-was-vain-and-self-centred|work=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=13 April 1999|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further wrote about the power she believed she had over men, which was used for her own gratification.

== In literature and other adaptations ==
The crime has been adapted into works by several authors and filmmakers. The most well-known example is [[Helen Garner]]'s 2004 book ''[[Joe Cinque's Consolation]]'', published in the same month as Singh's re-release from prison, which was a widely publicised account of Singh's crime and trial, together with the Cinque family's response to it. Singh gave interviews shortly after the release of the book, recounting her own memories of the killing and expressing regret at rejecting Garner's request for an interview.&lt;ref name="Wyndham" /&gt; She told interviewers that she wished to redress some of the book's imbalance towards her.&lt;ref name="LNL" /&gt;

In 2005, a documentary was being made about Singh by [[James Ricketson]] which covered her employment in Cabramatta. The documentary was reportedly to be called ''Atonement''.&lt;ref name="Australian" /&gt;

In 2012, it was announced that Garner's book would be turned [[Joe Cinque's Consolation (film)|into a film]] to be directed by Canberran Sotiris Dounoukos. Dounoukos was at ANU studying law at the same time as Singh;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sotiris Dounoukos|url = http://www.anu.edu.au/alumni/our-alumni/spotlight/sotiris-dounoukos|website = ANU|access-date = 26 October 2016|last = Preston|first = Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was "a friend of friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Joe Cinque's Consolation by Canberra filmmaker Sotiris Dounoukos highlights ambiguities|url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-life/joe-cinques-consolation-by-canberra-filmmaker-sotiris-dounoukos-highlights-ambiguities-20160922-grmoe5.html|website = Canberra Times|access-date = 26 October 2016|date = 23 September 2016|last = Freebury|first = Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would be partially funded by [[Screen Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Infamous Canberra killing to be made into film|url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/infamous-canberra-killing-to-be-made-into-film-20120515-1yo3m.html|website = Canberra Times|access-date = 19 January 2016|date = 15 May 2012|last = Kretowicz|first = Ewa|last2 = Macdonald|first2 = Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, also called ''Joe Cinque's Consolation'', was given a cinematic release on 13 October 2016 to generally positive critical attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Cinque's Consolation|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joe_cinques_consolation/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh was portrayed by actress Maggie Naouri.

'''Mark Duggan''', a 29-year-old [[British People|British]] man, was shot and fatally wounded by police in [[Tottenham]], North London, England, on 4 August 2011. The [[Metropolitan Police]] stated that officers were attempting to arrest Duggan on suspicion of planning an attack, and that he was in possession of a handgun. Duggan died from a gunshot wound to the chest. The circumstances of Duggan's death resulted in public protests in Tottenham,&lt;ref name=prasad /&gt; which led to conflict with police and escalated into [[2011 England riots|riots across London and other English cities]].&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt;

Duggan was under investigation by [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]], a subdivision of the Metropolitan Police. He was accused of carrying a BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun (a blank-firing replica of a [[Beretta 92]] converted to fire live rounds), given to him by Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, fifteen minutes before he was shot. A trial of Hutchinson-Foster in September–October 2012 yielded new evidence and reports on the case, but the jury failed to reach a verdict. At his re-trial, on 31 January 2013, Hutchinson-Foster was convicted of supplying Duggan with the gun. The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) has been investigating the case but has delayed release of its report for more than a year. A [[Inquests in England and Wales|public inquest]] on the Duggan death began on 16 September 2013, and ended on 8 January 2014 with an 8–2 majority concluding that Duggan's death was a [[lawful killing]].&lt;ref name="Inquest conclusion"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Duggan inquest latest|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25648913|accessdate=8 January 2014|newspaper=BBC Online|date=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official account of Duggan's death has undergone numerous changes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianconf" /&gt; drawing criticism and suspicion from his family, residents of Tottenham, and other supporters.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; These critics accuse police of [[Police misconduct|misconduct]] and of failing to cooperate with those investigating Duggan's death. Shortcomings in the police response have also been blamed for stoking the riots, and for fueling ongoing discontent, with Duggan's supporters stating "there can be no peace without justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-latest.com/tottenham-riot-there-can-be-no-peace-without-justice|title=Tottenham riot: There can be no peace without justice {{!}} The Latest - Citizen Journalism for All|website=www.the-latest.com|language=en|access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Mark Duggan ===
Mark Duggan was born on 15 September 1981&lt;ref name="G profile"/&gt; and grew up in [[Broadwater Farm]], north London.

Officers attached to [[Trident Gang Crime Command|Operation Trident]] had Duggan under surveillance; police stated that they suspected Duggan was planning to commit a crime in retaliation for the killing of his cousin, Kelvin Easton,&lt;ref name="lewis-code" /&gt; who was stabbed to death outside a bar in East London in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/neighbours_tributes_to_murdered_tottenham_rapper_everyone_loved_1_848129 |title=Neighbours' tributes to murdered Tottenham rapper 'everyone loved' |first=Emma |last=Youle |work=Tottenham&amp; Wood Green Journal |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823111728/http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/neighbours_tributes_to_murdered_tottenham_rapper_everyone_loved_1_848129# |archive-date=23 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan was described as having been increasingly paranoid&lt;ref name="moore-bridger-shootout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-minicab"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tottenham police shooting: Dead man was minicab passenger |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14423942|work=BBC  |date=5 August 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of his cousin's death.

After Duggan's death, he was described as a [[illegal drug trade|drug dealer]] by the police and others, an allegation denied by his family and friends.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Duggan's family said the allegations against Duggan were "disinformation", and that he was "not a gang member and he had no criminal record".&lt;ref name="townsend-trust" /&gt; But Duggan had been convicted of cannabis possession and [[handling stolen goods]].&lt;ref name="bbc2013-criminalrecord"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24210480|title=Duggan 'one of 48 most violent'|date=23 September 2013|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fiancée said he had spent time on remand.&lt;ref name="G profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/mark-duggan-profile-tottenham-shooting|title=Mark Duggan: profile of Tottenham police shooting victim|first1=Patrick|last1=Barkham|first2=Jon|last2=Henley|date=8 August 2011|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service stopped a [[minicab]] which was carrying Duggan as a passenger at about 18:15 BST on 4 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201108/3292491.htm?desktop|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701135847/http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201108/3292491.htm?desktop|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 July 2012|title=Fifth death in British riots|date=12 August 2011|work=australianetworknews.com|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no CCTV coverage of the place where they stopped the cab, and some witnesses allege that police chased away onlookers.&lt;ref name=ScottIPCCpowers&gt;Stafford Scott, "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/27/mark-duggan-shooting-ipcc-investigate Mark Duggan shooting: give the IPCC the powers it needs to investigate]", ''The Guardian'', 27 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an unnamed firearms officer at the trial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster in September 2012, Duggan pivoted out of the cab and pulled a selfloading pistol or handgun from his waistband.&lt;ref name=waistband&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19662526| date=20 September 2012|work=BBC|title=Mark Duggan 'pulled gun from waistband'}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the taxi driver, who was granted anonymity at the subsequent inquest, Duggan left the car and ran:

The taxi driver told the inquest that an armed officer had threatened to shoot him if he did not stop looking at where Duggan had fallen to the ground and was being handled "quite harsh[ly] and callous[ly]" by officers.

The police fired twice, hitting Duggan in the [[biceps]] and chest, killing him. A firearm was not found on Duggan after he had been shot.&lt;ref name=waistband /&gt; Paramedics from the [[London Ambulance Service]] and medical staff from [[London's Air Ambulance]] attended, but Duggan was pronounced dead at the scene at 18:41 BST.&lt;ref name="ipic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wound"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/09/london-riots-mark-duggan-inquest|title=London riots: Mark Duggan died of gunshot wound to chest, inquest told|date=9 August 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police who shot Duggan were part of the [[Specialist Firearms Command]] (CO19), accompanying officers from Operation Trident.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/mark-duggan-profile-tottenham-shooting|title=Mark Duggan: profile of Tottenham police shooting victim |author1=Patrick Barkham |author2=Jon Henley |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one eyewitness cited by ''[[The Independent]],'' Duggan "was shot while he was pinned to the floor by police"&lt;ref name="tpeck"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/a-death-at-the-hands-of-police-ndash-and-a-vigil-that-turned-to-violence-2333590.html "A death at the hands of police – and a vigil that turned to violence"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 8 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; – though evidence in the inquest since contradicts this. According to another eyewitness cited in ''The Telegraph'', a police officer had "shouted to the man to stop 'a couple of times', but he had not heeded the warning".&lt;ref name="telegraph-man-killed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man killed in shooting incident involving police officer |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8682655/Mark-Duggan-killed-in-shooting-incident-involving-police-officer.html |work=The Telegraph |date=4 August 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a witness cited by the [[BBC]], a police officer twice shouted: "Put it down" before Duggan was shot.&lt;ref name="witness-emerges"&gt;{{cite news|date=26 April 2012|accessdate=26 April 2012|title=Duggan shooting witness emerges|work=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17859958}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the taxi driver who was travelling with Duggan told the inquest the police shouted no warning before shooting.&lt;ref name=news_taxi_driver/&gt; A [[Metropolitan Police Federation]] representative asserted that the officer who killed Duggan had "an honest-held belief that he was in imminent danger of him and his colleagues being shot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8697208/UK-riots-Mark-Duggan-was-nephew-of-Manchester-gangster-Desmond-Noonan.html|title=UK riots: Mark Duggan was nephew of Manchester gangster Desmond Noonan|date=12 August 2011|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the officers who had surrounded Duggan was hit by a bullet, which had lodged in his radio. However, it had not been fired by Duggan but by the policeman identified only as V53, before it passed through Duggan's arm and hit the officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/08/mark-duggan-death-london-riots|title=Mark Duggan's death: two shots fired and two conflicting stories|first=Vikram|last=Dodd|date=8 January 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shot policeman was taken to a hospital and released the same evening.&lt;ref name=Pears&gt;Elizabeth Pears, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/man-shot-police-was-friends-nightclub-stab-victim Man 'Shot By Police' Was Friends With Nightclub Stab Victim]", ''The Voice'', 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent police actions ===
Police proceeded to move the taxi in which Duggan had been traveling.&lt;ref name=guardianconf/&gt; After some dispute over when the vehicle was moved, it was stated that police moved the taxi for examination and then returned it to the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Laville, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/24/mark-duggan-investigation-undermined Mark Duggan investigation undermined by 'inaccuracies']", ''The Guardian'', 24 November 2011.

An initial "short-form" report of the incident—filed by an officer identified as "W70"—did not say that Duggan had raised a gun. W70 filed another report 48 hours later which described Duggan drawing a gun from his waistband. (Officer W70 later testified that short-form reports are "deliberately brief".)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vikram Dodd, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/20/mark-duggan-had-gun-says-policeman Mark Duggan was shot after raising weapon, firearms officer tells court]", ''The Guardian'', 20 September 2012.

Police did not inform Duggan's family of his death until a day and a half after he was killed. The police later apologised for this delay.&lt;ref&gt;Akilah Russell, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/police-apologise-duggan-family Police Apologise To Duggan Family]", ''The Voice'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IPCC explanations ===

Initially, a spokesman of the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) stated that they "understand the officer was shot first before [Duggan] was shot;"&lt;ref name="telegraph-man-killed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore-bridger-shootout"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23975846-man-shot-dead-by-police-in-tottenham.do|title=Father dies and policeman hurt in 'terrifying' shoot-out|last=Moore-Bridger|first=Benedict|author2=Parsons, Rob|author3=Davenport, Justin|date=5 August 2011|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|location=UK|accessdate=9 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122031542/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23975846-man-shot-dead-by-police-in-tottenham.do|archivedate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; police later called this statement a mistake.&lt;ref name=guardianconf /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mirror12Dec11 /&gt; A bullet was found embedded in a radio worn by a policeman,&lt;ref name=Laville07 /&gt; and [[ballistics]] tests on the projectile indicate it was a "[[jacketed round]]", or police issue bullet fired from a [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]] semi-automatic carbine used by the police.&lt;ref name="ipic"/&gt; Its presence may have been due to a [[ricochet]] or [[overpenetration]].&lt;ref name=Laville07 &gt;{{cite news |title=Doubts emerge over Duggan shooting as London burns |author=Sandra Laville |author2=Paul Lewis |author3=Vikram Dodd |author4=Vikram Dodd |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/police-attack-london-burns |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabbatt"&gt;{{cite news |title=London disturbances – Sunday 7 August |author1=Adam Gabbatt |author2=Ben Quinn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-police-duggan-live#block-44 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Duggan's death was publicised quickly. Soon after Duggan was shot, an image was posted on Facebook showing police standing over a body that may have been his.

At about 17:30 BST on 6 August 2011, Duggan's relatives and local residents marched from [[Broadwater Farm]] to Tottenham Police Station. The demonstrators chanted "we want answers" and requested information from police about the circumstances of Duggan's death. They also made broader demands for "Justice", seeking to publicise ongoing poor relations with police in their community.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

A chief inspector spoke with the demonstrators, who demanded to see a higher-ranking officer. About 20:00 BST, a 16-year-old girl approached them and may have thrown a leaflet or a stone.

Duggan's family condemned the disorder. His older brother said, "We're not condoning any kind of actions like that at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/victims-family-condemn-riot-2333410.html|title=Victim's family condemn riot| work=The Independent| date= 7 August 2011| accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Duggan's shooting was perhaps the trigger for the violence, several other causes of the rioting have been suggested.&lt;ref name=Maurice&gt;Malcolm Maurice, [http://www.afro.com/sections/news/national/story.htm?storyid=72076 The London and UK Riots: 'It's Not Just Black Youths Involved'], ''The Afro'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] rejected a causal relationship between the death of Duggan and the subsequent looting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/uk-politics-14492789|title=Riots: David Cameron's Commons statement in full|publisher=BBC | date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media coverage ===
Duggan's death quickly became a major media story. Initially the media including the [[BBC]] incorrectly reported that one shot was 'discharged from an illegal firearm inside the car'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14423942 | work=BBC News | title=Tottenham police shooting: Dead man was minicab passenger | date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' it was the police themselves who had suggested this theory; the newspaper reported four days later: "a bullet found lodged in a police radio was a force-issue bullet, meaning Mr Duggan had not fired on officers as police suggested."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2023554/Tottenham-riot-2011-London-lockdown-David-Cameron-flies-home.html Tottenham riot 2011: London on lockdown as David Cameron flies home]. ''Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' stated on 8 January 2014: "The authorities wrongly said that he had been hit in an exchange of fire".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mark-duggan-inquest-was-he-really-armed-were-the-police-under-threat-all-the-key-evidence-9046789.html Mark Duggan inquest key evidence: Was he really armed? Were the police under threat?]. ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the media were criticized for portraying Duggan as a gangster, confused by his criminal record being reported as either extensive or non-existent by different outlets.&lt;ref name="bbc2013-criminalrecord" /&gt;&lt;ref name=voice2011&gt;"[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/how-media-shamefully-manipulated-mark-duggans-death How The Media Shamefully Manipulated Mark Duggan's Death]", ''The Voice'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The media was faulted for uncritically reporting the police's story that Duggan had shot first—also shown to be false.&lt;ref name=voice2011 /&gt;

The riots brought international attention to Duggan's death, which one Iranian official described as a "human rights violation".&lt;ref&gt;"Iran/United Kingdom: Iranian Legislator Condemns Blatant Violation of Human Rights in Britain", ''Asia News Monitor'', 12 August 2011; accessed [http://search.proquest.com/docview/889079191 via ProQuest].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funeral ===
Duggan's funeral took place at New Testament Church of God in [[Wood Green]] on 9 September 2011. The funeral procession was watched by thousands of onlookers. Police maintained a low profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands gather for Mark Duggan funeral|first= Peter|last=Walker |author2=Hugh Muir |author3=Alexandra Topping|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/09/mark-duggan-funeral-tottenham|date=9 September 2011|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigations ==

=== IPCC ===
The incident was immediately referred to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC),&lt;ref name=bbc2nd&gt;{{cite news |title=Man dead and police officer hurt in Tottenham shooting  |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14412752 |newspaper=BBC News   |date=5 August 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with standard practice when anyone dies or is seriously injured following police contact. Investigators distributed leaflets appealing for witnesses to come forward.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{Cite news| title =Mark Duggan death: IPCC appeals for witnesses  |work=BBC | location = London|date= 11 August 2011 | accessdate =11 August 2011| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14489165}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPCC officers also searched [[CCTV]] footage, [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] calls and radio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Appeal over death that sparked riot | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/appeal-over-death-that-sparked-riot-16035614.html | newspaper=Belfast Telegraph |date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August 2011 the IPCC announced that in the immediate aftermath of the incident they may have given misleading information to journalists to the effect that shots were exchanged between Duggan and the police. Although a bullet had been found lodged in a police radio, there was no evidence that it had come from the gun in Duggan's possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Release of information in early stages of Mark Duggan investigation|url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/Pages/pr_120811_Release-of-information-in-early-stages-of-Mark-Duggan.aspx|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to rumours that the killing of Duggan was an "execution",&lt;ref name="chan4-prevented"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/could-the-tottenham-riots-have-been-prevented|work=Channel 4| date=19 August 2011| accessdate=19 August 2011|title=Could the Tottenham riots have been prevented?}}&lt;/ref&gt; the IPCC announced: "Speculation that Mark Duggan was 'assassinated' in an execution style involving a number of shots to the head are categorically untrue."&lt;ref name="cerfontyne-shooting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement from IPCC on Mark Duggan shooting|first=Rachel|last=Cerfontyne|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=19 August 2011|work=IPCC|url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/Pages/pr070811_statement.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duggan's family stated that they did not trust the IPCC to conduct a fair and independent investigation of the killing and asked for an independent inquiry into the relationship between the Metropolitan Police and the IPCC. They sought to commission an independent second postmortem.&lt;ref name="townsend-trust"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Townsend|title=London riots: the family of Mark Duggan says it has no trust in the IPCC |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/14/mark-duggan-family-ipcc-met-police-tottenham-riots|work=The Guardian |date=14 August 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coroner [[Andrew Walker (barrister)|Andrew Walker]] scheduled an initial hearing for 12 December 2011.&lt;ref name="wound"/&gt;

In November 2011, two members of the public who were appointed{{By whom|date=June 2015}} to liaise with the IPCC, resigned from those posts. A third remained in post. One of those who left said that the IPCC work was "shoddy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian|title=Adviser quits Duggan inquiry with attack on 'shoddy investigation'|first=Vikram|last=Dodd|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/20/mark-duggan-shooting-watchdog-panel|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 February 2012 the IPCC upheld a complaint that the Metropolitan Police had not adequately informed Duggan's family of his death on 4 August 2011. The IPCC's inquiry expressly did not address the events of 6 August 2011 and afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/Pages/pr_290212_duggan.aspx|title=Loading site please wait...|website=www.ipcc.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh of the Metropolitan Police had already issued an apology (in August 2011) to the Duggan family for the manner in which police initially communicated with them,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Milmo| first = Cahal|author2=Rob Hastings|title = A dead man, a crucial question: should police have shot Mark Duggan?  | work=The Independent| location = London|date= 9 August 2011 | accessdate =11 August 2011| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/a-dead-man-a-crucial-question-should-police-have-shot-mark-duggan-2334133.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the IPCC had a responsibility to provide information to Duggan's family.&lt;ref name="dodd-apologise"&gt;{{cite news| first=Vikram|last=Dodd|title=Police apologise to Mark Duggan's family for failing to keep them informed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/police-apology-mark-duggan-shooting| work=The Guardian| location=London| date=8 August 2011|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2012 the IPCC indicated that the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] made it impossible for the organisation to reveal information obtained during its investigation into Duggan's death, making it doubtful if a public coroner's inquest into the killing could ever be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Malik| first = Shiv|author2=Sandra Laville| title = Mark Duggan death: IPCC says hands are tied over release of evidence| work = The Guardian| location = London| accessdate = 28 April 2012| date = 29 March 2012| url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/29/mark-duggan-death-ipcc-hands-tied-evidence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the BBC aired footage of the immediate aftermath of the shooting. The footage showed paramedics handling Duggan's body. The IPCC condemned the BBC for showing the footage without first consulting them.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/witness-films-scenes-after-mark-duggan-was-shot Witness Films Scenes After Mark Duggan Was Shot]", ''The Voice'', 27 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC was expected to release its report on the killing in summer of 2012. Because no report had been issued by January 2013, a planned inquest into the killing was delayed until September.&lt;ref name=Guard28Jan13 /&gt; The IPCC announced in March 2013 that it would issue a report in April, for delivery to the inquest in May.&lt;ref name=Guard25Mar13 /&gt; Referring to the officers who killed Duggan, an IPCC spokesperson announced on 2 August 2013 that "We have found no evidence to indicate criminality at this stage." The IPCC said its investigation had substantially ended and that a final report would be issued later in August.&lt;ref name=Guardian2Aug2013&gt;Vikram Dodd, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/02/mark-duggan-shooting-inquiry-evidence Mark Duggan police shooting: IPCC inquiry finds no evidence of criminality: Shooter declined to answer questions orally, instead submitting written answers later]"; ''The Guardian'', 2 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11 officers involved initially refused interviews with the IPCC. The officer who killed Duggan, now known as "V53", later submitted testimony in writing.&lt;ref name=Guardian2Aug2013 /&gt;

=== Metropolitan Police ===
Police stated that "no officer had done wrong" but announced that the person who shot Duggan would not remain on active firearms duty.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/officer-who-shot-mark-duggan-%E2%80%9Cwill-not%E2%80%9D-return-duty Officer Who Shot Mark Duggan 'Will Not' Return To Duty]", ''The Voice'', 8 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The firearms officer involved in the operation known only as V53 provided written statements to the IPCC but refused to be interviewed.&lt;ref name="witness-emerges" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ViDo26Apr2012" /&gt; [[David Lammy]], the MP for Tottenham, was critical of his refusal.&lt;ref name="v53"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9840073/Revealed-gang-rivalry-Mark-Duggan-and-the-unavenged-murder-behind-the-London-riots.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gordon | last=Rayner | title=Revealed: gang rivalry, Mark Duggan and the unavenged murder behind the London riots | date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ViDo26Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/26/mark-duggan-met-refuse-ipcc |title= Mark Duggan death: Met officers refuse IPCC interviews |last= Dodd |first= Vikram |date= 26 April 2012 |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 28 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC asked for the power to interview police officers even if they are not suspected of having committed a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=26 April 2012|accessdate=29 April 2012|title=IPCC seeks increased powers to investigate police|work=BBC|first=Simon|last= Cox|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17843690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster ===
In November 2011, the IPCC began an investigation into the "quality of the investigative response" by police to an incident on 29 July 2011, for which police charged Kevin Hutchinson-Foster with possession of a handgun, believing the gun may be the same found at the shooting of Mr. Duggan.&lt;ref name="bbc-gun" /&gt;

On 18 September 2012, Hutchinson-Foster's trial commenced in the Crown Court at Snaresbrook. The defendant was charged with supplying Duggan with the BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun, found near Duggan's car after his death.&lt;ref name="H-F"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19635639|date=18 September 2012 |work=BBC|title=Mark Duggan 'given loaded gun' before police shooting}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant denied the charge and gave his explanation for the presence of his DNA on the gun by alleging he had been beaten with the weapon by a gang that included Duggan.&lt;ref name=karma&gt;{{cite news|date= 28 September 2012| accessdate= 29 September 2012|title = Mark Duggan police shooting: Death was 'karma'|work=BBC| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19765652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, prosecutor [[Edward Brown (barrister)|Edward Brown QC]] of [[QEB Hollis Whiteman (chambers)|QEB Hollis Whiteman]] contended that Duggan travelled to Leyton to collect the gun from Hutchinson-Foster, before driving to Tottenham with it.&lt;ref name="H-F"/&gt; The police alleged that Duggan had received a gun from Hutchinson-Foster 12–15 minutes before he was shot.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20120919195453/http://voice-online.co.uk/article/duggan-was-%E2%80%98given-loaded-gun-minutes-being-killed%E2%80%99 Duggan Was 'Given Loaded Gun Minutes Before Being Killed]'", ''The Voice'', 18 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police testimony ====
The trial included testimony from seven police officers who were allowed to remain anonymous and use pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/police-keep-anonymity-duggan-gun-trial Police To Keep Anonymity In Duggan Gun Trial]", ''The Voice'', 27 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Police alleged that Duggan had pulled the gun from his waistband and pointed it at police before they shot him.&lt;ref name="contact"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19718245|title=Duggan 'in contact' with accused|date=25 September 2012|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holding-gun"&gt;{{cite news|first=Vikram|last=Dodd|title=Police marksman was 'absolutely certain' Mark Duggan was holding gun|work=The Guardian|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=27 September 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/26/mark-duggan-gun-crime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the evidence given by the cab driver and corroborated by one policeman present at the scene, Duggan got out of the taxi and ran in an attempt to escape.&lt;ref name="taxi-driver"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Duggan shooting: taxi driver tells court how police surrounded cab|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/mark-duggan-shooting-taxi-driver-evidence|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=27 September 2012|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver stated, "I saw that Mark Duggan got out and ran. At the same time, I heard firing from the front. I saw shots strike Mark Duggan. He fell to the ground."&lt;ref name="taxi-driver" /&gt; "Mark Duggan only got 2ft–3ft from my car when he was shot", the taxi driver later testified.&lt;ref name=news_taxi_driver/&gt;

====Pathologist testimony====
Dr Simon Poole, a pathologist who had performed a post-mortem on Duggan's body, testified in January 2013 at the retrial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster and asserted that the injuries Duggan sustained in the shooting were not consistent with the account of the incident that was given by the police officer who fired the lethal shot. Questioned by a barrister representing Hutchinson-Foster, Poole said that the police bullet had penetrated Duggan's body on the right side and travelled from right to left. Poole agreed with the barrister's statement: "So the scenario can't be right? The officer fires to his left and the bullet hits Mr Duggan in the chest and it should go from left to right – but it went right to left. Therefore the scenario can't be right?"&lt;ref name=BBC17Jan13&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21060194|title= Police account of Mark Duggan's injuries 'differs' from pathologist| work=BBC|date=17 January 2013|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poole also later agreed with the prosecution that the bullet's trajectory might be consistent with the same angle of firing if Duggan had turned to face the officer.&lt;ref name=BBC17Jan13 /&gt;

A December 2011 IPCC statement had cited Poole for discovering that a second bullet struck Duggan's arm.&lt;ref name=Mirror12Dec11&gt;"Mark Duggan inquiry: Police watchdog investigator admits 'mistake' over information that Duggan fired at officers first", ''Daily Mirror'', 12 December 2011; see "[http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/Pages/pr_12112011_duggan_statement.aspx?auto=True&amp;l1link=pages%2Fnews.aspx&amp;l1title=News%20and%20press&amp;l2link=news%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;l2title=Press%20Releases Statement intended to be read out to HM Coroner at pre-inquest hearing into death of Mark Duggan]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outcome ====
On 17 October 2012, the jury failed to reach a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19978769|date=17 October 2012|title=Mark Duggan: No verdict in Kevin Hutchinson-Foster gun trial|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-trial date was set for January 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 November 2012|accessdate=22 January 2013|title=Kevin Hutchinson-Foster retrial set for January| work=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20268713}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 31 January 2013 the defendant was convicted of supplying Duggan with the handgun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=31 January 2013 | accessdate=31 January 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21176207|title=Hutchinson-Foster guilty of supplying gun|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 2013, the defendant was sentenced to eleven years in prison; seven years for supplying the gun, four years for related offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Press Association |work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/26/man-gave-gun-mark-duggan|title=Man who gave gun to Mark Duggan jailed for 11 years|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hutchinson-Foster case did not resolve a number of significant unknown questions related to the Duggan killing.&lt;ref name=Guard31Jan13 /&gt;

== Reaction to official response ==
Following interviews in the Tottenham area, some residents have revealed that they do not trust police or investigators, and say that Duggan was executed by police.&lt;ref&gt;Alan White, "[http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/investigation-about-more-mark-duggan This investigation is about more than Mark Duggan]", ''New Statesman'', 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ScottStreet/&gt; A report due in summer of 2012 was announced delayed in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Vikram Dodd, "Mark Duggan shooting: police watchdog's report delayed further", ''The Guardian'', 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan's family and members of his community suggested that they did not consider the IPCC impartial and did not believe that its investigation was succeeding.&lt;ref name=guardianconf/&gt;

Frustration with the official investigation mounted in May 2012 when it was announced that the 31 police witnesses would not be required to answer questions—instead submitting written testimony.&lt;ref name=ScottIPCCpowers/&gt; [[David Lammy]], MP from Tottenham, stated: "It is unacceptable that the police officers have not made themselves available for interview, and it is unacceptable that the IPCC does not have the power to compel them to do so."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/fresh-controversy-over-mark-duggan-death Fresh Controversy Over Mark Duggan Death: Refusal from police officers to be interviewed by investigators is another blow to public trust]", ''The Voice'', 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duggan's family ===

Duggan's family did not believe that the police have been honest about the shooting, and have pressured the police and IPCC for greater transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Pears, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/we-want-justice-mark 'We Want Justice For Mark']", ''The Voice'', 14 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Taylor, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/05/mark-duggan-brother-justice-riots Brother of Mark Duggan demands justice over death that sparked riots]", ''The Guardian'', 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan's sister, Paulette Hall, has stated: "We want justice. We want them to come clean and tell us what happened. The police are human like us. If you kill someone, you should do the time, just like we would have to do." Hall has reiterated concerns about media portrayals, and produced her own film titled ''The Real Story of Mark Duggan''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Williams, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/mark-duggans-sister-urges-police-come-clean Mark Duggan's Sister Urges Police: 'Come Clean!']", ''The Voice'', 16 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duggan's mother, Pamela, has said: "We still don't have justice. I won't give up until I get justice for Mark. People need to be held to account for my son's death. There needs to be a full inquest, in front of a jury of ordinary men and women, to find out the truth."&lt;ref&gt;Trudy Simpson, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/duggans-mum-"i-won't-give-until-i-get-justice-mark Duggan's Mum: 'I Won't Give Up Until I Get Justice For Mark']{{dead link|date=October 2015}}",  ''The Voice'', 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Duggan has sought judicial review for the case, requesting oversight of the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO) and the IPCC. London's [[High Court of Justice]] rejected her application for judicial review on 18 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/mark_duggan_death_application_for_judicial_review_into_police_protocol_rejected_1_2241362 Mark Duggan death: application for judicial review into police protocol rejected]", ''Tottenham &amp; Wood Green Journal'', 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22954119 Mark Duggan death: Application for police collusion review rejected]", ''BBC'', 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voice18Jun13&gt;"[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/duggan-family-have-police-protocol-review-rejected Duggan Family Have Police Protocol Review Rejected: Pamela Duggan had called for an examination into how police collaborate on incident reports]", ''The Voice'', 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family have criticized the IPCC for delaying the investigation. Expecting an inquest to begin on 28 January and instead facing indefinite postponement, a barrister for the Duggan family commented: "It is absolutely shocking to find ourselves here today and to hear your counsel saying that there are further investigations, basic investigations, to be conducted such as a reconstruction and forensics."&lt;ref name=Guard28Jan13 /&gt;

=== Stafford Scott ===
Stafford Scott, originally appointed as an advisor to Operation Trident, resigned from the investigation because he felt that it was not being conducted fairly. Writing in ''The Guardian'', he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The IPCC has broken its own guidelines by giving out erroneous information to journalists regarding the "shoot-out" involving Duggan and police that didn't actually happen. And its investigation is flawed and in all probability tainted – so much so that we can never have faith in its final report.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Stafford Scott, "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/20/investigation-mark-duggan-tainted The investigation of Mark Duggan's death is tainted. I want no part in it]", ''The Guardian'', 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scott blames the police response to the Duggan shooting for the escalation of the 2011 riots.&lt;ref name=ScottIPCCpowers/&gt;&lt;ref name=ScottLessons&gt;Stafford Scott, "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/mark-duggan-lessons-police-learned Mark Duggan: the lessons the police haven't learned: A year after the killing of Mark Duggan, his family and community still feel ignored and marginalised]", ''The Guardian'', 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He later criticized authorities for treating the Hutchinson-Foster as a proxy for the Duggan investigation, while continuing to delay the official inquest on Duggan's death.&lt;ref&gt;Stafford Scott, "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/18/mark-duggan-family-kevin-hutchinson-foster Mark Duggan's family have had to endure yet again]", ''The Guardian'', 18 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that members of Duggan's community feel ignored and lied to by authorities,&lt;ref name=ScottLessons/&gt; writing in March 2012: "In August 2011 the word on the streets was that 'they executed Mark'. Seven months later the word is that the police had control of the gun or worse."&lt;ref name=ScottStreet&gt;Stafford Scott, "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/27/shooting-mark-duggan-ipcc-open-hearing The shooting of Mark Duggan must be investigated openly]", ''The Guardian'', 27 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Hutchinson-Foster trial, Scott criticized the Trident police for inaction, writing: "So it is now clear that the police had a golden opportunity to remove an identified gunman and a firearm off of the streets but somehow managed not to do so. And this is all the more shocking because the police have a special unit, Trident, established specifically to deal with gun crime in the black community."&lt;ref&gt;Stafford Scott, "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/27/gun-conviction-raises-questions-duggan-death Gun conviction only raises more questions over Mark Duggan's death: Hutchinson-Foster has been jailed for supplying a gun, but if police had done their duty, Duggan might still be alive]", ''The Guardian'', 27 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inquest ==

=== Preparations ===

At a pre-inquest hearing in June 2012, coroner [[Andrew Walker (barrister)|Andrew Walker]] said it was "quite extraordinary" that the IPCC refused to provide witness statements. He ordered the material to be disclosed within 28 days. Representing the Duggan family, [[Michael Mansfield]] QC said the IPCC's position was "utterly unacceptable", and warned them they would be in contempt if they refused the coroner's order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IPCC defies coroner over Duggan statements|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18625344|publisher=BBC News|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A public inquest on the killing had been scheduled for 28 January 2013. On 25 January,&lt;ref&gt;Bart Chan and Dionne Grant, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/mark-duggan%E2%80%99s-mother-leaves-court-hearing-death-details Mark Duggan's Mother Leaves Court On Hearing Death Details: Judge sets September date for full inquest into 29-year-old's death]", ''The Voice'', 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the inquest was declared indefinitely postponed because the IPCC had not yet released its report.&lt;ref name=Guard28Jan13 /&gt; Judge [[Keith Cutler]] later announced that the inquest would begin on 16 September 2013.&lt;ref name=Guard25Mar13&gt;Vikram Dodd, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/mar/25/ipcc-report-mark-duggan-shooting IPCC report on Mark Duggan shooting to be completed next month: Watchdog will finish report a year late into police shooting that sparked riots]", ''The Guardian'', 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voice28Jan13&gt;Bart Chan, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/full-inquiry-mark-duggan%E2%80%99s-death-set-september Full Inquiry Into Mark Duggan's Death Set For September]", ''The Voice'', 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest was expected to last for six to eight weeks.&lt;ref name=Voice28Jan13 /&gt; It was assigned the same group who were assigned to the inquest into the [[death of Azelle Rodney]].&lt;ref name=Guard31Jan13&gt;Vikram Dodd, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/31/mark-duggan-shooting-mystery-gun-arrest Mark Duggan shooting still a mystery despite gun supplier verdict: Kevin Hutchinson-Foster's guilt does little to clarify events that triggered Duggan being stopped and shot dead by police]", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government created a website for publicizing materials related to the inquest, and is considering live broadcast for some of the proceedings. Testimony from firearms officers will remain entirely anonymous.&lt;ref name=Guard28Jan13&gt;Vikram Dodd and Owen Bowcott, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/28/mark-duggan-inquest-live-internet Mark Duggan inquest could be shown live over the internet: Officials consider unprecedented move but testimony from firearms officers will not be broadcast]", ''The Guardian'', 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the inquest jury may also be kept anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Terri Judd, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mark-duggan-inquest-commission-investigating-police-shooting-that-sparked-summer-riots-not-fit-for-purpose-8548827.html Mark Duggan inquest: commission investigating police shooting that sparked summer riots 'not fit for purpose': Death in 2011 in Tottenham led to widespread rioting across London and England]", ''The Independent'', 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hearings ===
Inquest hearings began on 16 September 2013. The jury began with a visit to the street in Tottenham where Duggan was killed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Jermaine Haughton, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/inquest-jury-visits-mark-duggan-shooting-scene Inquest jury visits Mark Duggan shooting scene: Anonymous members of the court to get firsthand walkthrough of the places Duggan was before he was shot]", ''The Voice'', 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Police allegations ===

Police maintained that Duggan was a gang member linked to violent crime. "As well as gun crime, he was involved in supply of class A drugs and possession of ammunition", said Detective Inspector Mick Foote.&lt;ref&gt;Haroon Siddique, "
Mark Duggan was involved in gun crime, police officer tells inquest: Senior officer says Duggan, whose shooting by police triggered 2011 riots, was member of gang that included violent criminals", ''The Guardian'', 23 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foote denied making the claim that Duggan had fired at police, saying he was "surprised" that early reports of the incident described a "shoot out".&lt;ref&gt;Jermaine Haughton, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/senior-officer-said-mark-duggan-came-firing-police Senior officer 'said Mark Duggan came firing' at police]", ''The Voice'', 24 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC later conceded it had misled journalists shortly after the shooting by saying that shots were exchanged.&lt;ref name="belfasttelegraph peachey 20140108"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/mark-duggan-inquest-was-he-really-armed-were-the-police-under-threat-all-the-key-evidence-29900549.html | title=Mark Duggan inquest: Was he really armed? Were the police under threat? All the key evidence|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=8 January 2014|accessdate=9 January 2014|author=Peachey, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A police officer appearing in support of the IPCC, wrote in a statement that during informal briefings at the scene of death "officers had apparently thrown a firearm found in his [Duggan's] possession over a fence so that it was out of reach and it would no longer pose a threat to them". No other officer confirmed this.&lt;ref name="belfasttelegraph peachey 20140108" /&gt;

=== Manner of death ===

The jury learned that Duggan had been killed by a [[9mm parabellum]], [[hollow-point bullet]], travelling at 870&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="Halliday14Nov2013-2008"&gt;Josh Halliday, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/mark-duggan-inquest-shooting-arm-chest Mark Duggan marksman 'got it wrong' over account of shooting – pathologist: Professor Derrick Pounder contradicts armed police officer by concluding that Duggan was shot in the arm – then the chest]", ''The Guardian'', 14 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of bullet is designed to cause instant incapacitation.&lt;ref name="Halliday14Nov2013-1443"&gt;Josh Halliday, 
"[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/bullet-mark-duggan-authorised-use Bullet that killed Mark Duggan 'had only recently been authorised for use': Hollow-point 9mm bullet is designed to cause instant incapacitation and 'mushrooms' in body, inquest hears]", ''The Guardian'', 14 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathologist Derrick Pounder said that police had "simply got it wrong" in their accounts of the shooting. Pounder testified that Duggan was hit first by a non-fatal shot to the arm, then killed by a second shot to his chest.&lt;ref name="Halliday14Nov2013-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/mark-duggan-inquest-armed-police-%E2%80%98simply-got-it-wrong%E2%80%99 Mark  Duggan inquest: Armed police 'simply got it wrong: Pathologist professor gives evidence at inquest into death of Tottenham resident]", ''The Voice'', 14 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The gun ===

Lawyers for the Duggan family argued that police had planted the handgun found on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Jermaine Haughton, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/mark-duggan-inquest-hear-police-planted-gun-evidence Mark Duggan inquest to hear 'police planted gun' evidence The gun was found 20 feet away from where Duggan was shot dead by officers]", ''The Voice'', 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Two witnesses testified that they saw a police officer move something from the minicab to the place where the gun was found, 20 feet away from Duggan's body.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/new-evidence-backs-theory-police-planted-mark-duggan-gun New evidence backs theory police planted Mark Duggan gun Witness tells inquest jury officer 'ran from scene with object'"], ''The Voice'', 25 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; One witness ("Miss J") said she saw the officer pick up the gun, adding: "It will never leave me for the simple reason it's not often you see a gun in broad daylight." She said the officer "had an expression like he'd found gold."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Pettifor, "[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mark-duggan-inquest-key-witness-2460751 Mark Duggan inquest: Key witness claims police moved a gun AFTER the shooting]", ''Daily Mirror'', 16 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vikram Dodd, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/16/mark-duggan-officer-gun-car-gold Mark Duggan witness says she saw officer remove gun from car: Woman tells inquest she saw officer emerge from cab with expression 'like he had found gold' 10 minutes after shooting]", ''The Guardian, 16 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Miss J was standing 50 metres away from the scene (with a fence in between),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/mark_duggan_inquest_witness_saw_police_drag_duggan_from_cab_and_remove_gun_1_2886907|title=Mark Duggan inquest: Witness 'saw police drag Duggan from cab' and 'remove gun'|last=Moore|first=Stephen|date=17 October 2013|website=Tottenham &amp; Wood Green Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801032243/http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/mark_duggan_inquest_witness_saw_police_drag_duggan_from_cab_and_remove_gun_1_2886907|archive-date=1 August 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final IPCC report noted that there were, "many discrepancies between her accounts, which overall lessens the weight that can be attached to her observations, as they render her evidence unreliable and contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/page/mark-duggan-investigation-findings-and-recommendations|title=Loading site please wait...|website=www.ipcc.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driver of the minicab testified that he did not see a gun in Duggan's hand, nor did he see one fly through the air. He said Duggan was shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;Natricia Duncan, "'[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/police-shot-mark-duggan-back-says-taxi-driver Police shot Mark Duggan in back', says taxi driver: Minicab driver giving evidence at inquest claims officer who opened fire 'lost his senses']", ''The Voice'', 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Another witness said there was "definitely" a phone in Duggan's hand.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Moore, "[http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/mark_duggan_inquest_duggan_clutching_phone_when_shot_says_key_witness_1_3081071 Mark Duggan inquest: Duggan 'clutching phone' when shot, says key witness]", ''Tottenham Journal'', 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sam Jones, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/03/mark-duggan-was-holding-mobile-phone-when-shot Mark Duggan was holding phone as he was shot by police, inquest hears: Witness says Duggan, whose death in London sparked riots in 2011, had stopped and put his hands up before he was shot]", ''The Guardian'', 3 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During the inquest Ian Stern, counsel for the police, suggested that the same witness – the only one to actually see Duggan being shot – had earlier told a journalist that he (Duggan) had been holding a handgun. The witness denied ever making such statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25657206|title=Duggan did not need to die - witness|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=14 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"V53", the officer who shot and killed Duggan, testified that Duggan was still holding a gun after both of the shots were fired, saying his eyes were "glued to the gun." Military surgeon Jonathan Clasper testified that it would be difficult to imagine Duggan throwing his gun 20 feet after being hit by the two shots.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Halliday, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/18/duggan-inquest-police-evidence-gun Duggan inquest: police evidence 'fails to explain how gun was found 20ft away': Military surgeon tells inquest discovery of gun behind a wall was unexplained by evidence of officer who shot Duggan]", ''The Guardian'', 18 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the hearings, lawyer Leslie Thomas confronted the police officer "V59" with the possibility that a gun had been planted, saying: "I'm going to suggest to you, V59, that you knew where the gun was before the officers had gone round (the fence), because you, and all of your colleagues had planted it there." The officer replied: "I did not plant any gun at any scene. I find that highly offensive."&lt;ref&gt;Natricia Duncan, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/gun-plant-claims-highly-offensive-says-mark-duggan-officer Gun plant claims 'highly offensive' says Mark Duggan officer]", ''The Voice'', 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas also accused officer "W70" of inconsistencies and omissions in testimony.&lt;ref&gt;Vikram Dodd, "[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/23/officer-account-mark-duggan-killing Armed police officer admits his account of Mark Duggan killing changed: Officer told inquest Duggan was holding a gun when he was shot by police, something he omitted in initial account]", ''The Guardian'', 23 October 0213.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protests ===
[[File:Mark Duggan banner.jpg|thumb|Protesters with Mark Duggan banner, 26 October 2013]]

During the inquest, student protesters were heard chanting: "Who killed Mark Duggan? You killed Mark Duggan."&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Bastani, "[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/05/students-protests-police-repression-university-of-london Student protests are changing tack – and facing heavy police repression]", ''The Guardian'', 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December, students protested outside the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] while the inquest was underway.&lt;ref&gt;Robin De Peyer, "[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/protests-in-london-as-students-make-cops-off-campus-rallying-call--video-8998472.html Protests in London as students make 'cops off campus' rallying call]", ''London Evening Standard'', 11 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deliberation and verdict ===
The jury began deliberations on 10 December 2013, asked to render a verdict of [[unlawful killing]], [[lawful killing]], or [[open verdict]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Brunt, "[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/mark-duggan-inquest-jury-begin-deliberations-173107917.html#Jrd09y8 Mark Duggan Inquest: Jury Begin Deliberations]", ''SkyNews'', 11 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Cutler told the jury that he would accept a conclusion based on a majority agreement by 8 of the 10 jurors.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/18/mark-duggan-inquest-coroner-jury-majority Mark Duggan inquest coroner tells jury he will accept majority conclusion: Coroner tells panel of 10 jurors they may reach conclusions and findings on which at least eight of them are agreed]", ''The Guardian'', 18 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duncan19Dec2013&gt;Natricia Duncan, "[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/mark-duggan-inquest-adjourned-until-next-year Mark Duggan inquest adjourned until next year: Anonymous inquest jurors will return in January to decide verdict]", ''The Voice'', 19 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury interrupted deliberations over Christmas and resumed on 7 January 2014.&lt;ref name=Duncan19Dec2013 /&gt; They delivered their conclusions at approximately 16:00 on 8 January, concluding (by an 8–1 majority) that Duggan's death was a lawful killing.

=== Legal challenge and appeal ===
Following the inquest, a case was brought by Duggan's mother to the High Court seeking [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]], arguing that the coroner's directions to the jury were legally incorrect. The direction to the jury instructed them to determine whether or not the officer who shot Duggan was acting on an honest belief that Duggan was a threat, not whether his belief was reasonable. The case challenged the legal standard for self-defence as being incompatible with [[Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] which protects the right to life.

In October 2014, the High Court rejected this challenge. Leave was given to appeal the case to the civil division of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], but the appellate court also rejected the claims in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/judment-r-duggan-v-deputy-coroner-for-north-london/|title=R (Duggan) v Deputy Coroner for North London|website=www.judiciary.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/02/mark-duggan-shooting-court-considers-appeal-against-inquest-verdict|title=Mark Duggan shooting: court considers appeal against inquest verdict|last=Taylor|first=Diane|date=2 March 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 September 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-39428862|title=Mark Duggan's family lose inquest appeal|date=29 March 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=4 September 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metropolitan Police Service]] firearms specialist, 51 years old Anthony Hanley allegedly shot himself in the head after he turned suicidal, on Saturday, 30 January 2016, in spite of being deterred by fellow officers, near his home in [[Wallington, London]].

'''Ectomesenchyme''' has properties similar to [[mesenchyme]]. The origin of the ectomesenchyme is disputed. It is either like the mesenchyme, arising from [[mesoderm|mesodermic cells]], or conversely arising from [[neural crest cells]]&lt;ref name="pmid14699583"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weston JA, Yoshida H, Robinson V, Nishikawa S, Fraser ST, Nishikawa S |title=Neural crest and the origin of ectomesenchyme: neural fold heterogeneity suggests an alternative hypothesis |journal=Dev.

Ectomesenchyme plays a critical role in the formation of the hard and soft tissues of the head and neck such as bones, muscles, teeth, and, notably, the [[branchial arches]].

There were 75 [[Fire station|firehouses]] in which at least one member was killed. The FDNY also lost its [[Fire chief|department chief]], [[New York City Fire Commissioner|first deputy commissioner]], one of its [[Fire marshal|marshals]], one of its [[Chaplain#Fire departments|chaplains]], as well as other administrative or specialty personnel.

Operationally and geographically, the department is nominally organized into five borough commands for the five traditional [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs of New York]]. Within those borough commands exist nine divisions, each headed by a deputy chief. Within each division operate four to seven battalions, led by a battalion chief and typically consisting of 180–200 [[firefighter]]s and officers. Each battalion consists of four to eight companies, with a company being led by a captain. He commands three lieutenants and 16–42 firefighters. Last is the unit consisting of the members of the company on call during a given tour, consisting of a lieutenant or a captain plus a number of firefighters depending on the type of unit: three to four on an engine company, five on a ladder company (also known as a truck company), five for a rescue company, five for a squad company, four in a marine company, and six for the hazardous materials company.&lt;ref&gt;New York Fire Department, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, the battalion chief of Battalion 1 witnessed [[American Airlines Flight 11]] crash into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and immediately radioed a [[Multiple-alarm fire|multiple alarm]] incident. Over the course of the next three hours, 121 engine companies, 62 ladder companies and 27 fire officers were deployed to the scene. All off-duty firefighters were recalled — the first time the FDNY had issued a total recall in over 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/mck_report/fire_operations_response.pdf |title=FDNY Fire Operations response on September 11 |work=nyc.gov |publisher= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the regular [[fire apparatus]] and personnel assigned to the incident, the FDNY also deployed its only [[Dangerous goods|Haz-Mat]] unit, its mobile command center, its field communications unit, all its five rescue units, both of its high-rise units, six of its seven squad units, and one of its two tactical support units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/mck_report/x10_soc_deployment.pdf |title=Exhibit 10: Deployment of Fire Special Operations Units |work=nyc.gov |publisher= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WTC rescue efforts.jpg|thumb|upright|Rescue workers at the World Trade Center on September 14, 2001.]]

Within minutes of Flight 11's impact, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department]] (PAPD) began deploying officers from the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]], bridges, tunnels, and airport commands. The PAPD commanding officer on the scene ordered a full evacuation of the North Tower at 9 a.m., about three minutes before Flight 175 hit the South Tower. At the same time, the PAPD's two most senior officers, [[superintendent (police)|superintendent]] Ferdinand Morrone and Chief James Romito, both arrived separately at the World Trade Center.

Some officers were ordered into the towers to assist with stairwell evacuations, while others helped with evacuations in the plaza and subway station. Superintendent Morrone was last seen helping evacuate tenants on the 45th floor of the North Tower before it collapsed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegrouchygamer.com/?p=277#more-277 |title=Remembering Ferdinand "Fred" Morrone – 9/11/2001 |publisher=The Grouchy Gamer |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chief Romito was in the 31st-floor region with four colleagues helping firefighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/Sept11/Story.aspx?PersonID=146567 |title=Remembering September 11, 2001: James A.

[[File:September 11th NYPD TEMP HQ Burger King WTC New York City.jpg|thumb|right|Temporary NYPD headquarters at 106 Liberty St; set up near the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.]]
Several [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) officers saw Flight 11's impact with the North Tower and immediately reported it to dispatchers. Ten minutes after Flight 11's impact and seven minutes before Flight 175's impact, the NYPD chief of department was en route to the scene and raised the police mobilization to level 4, thereby sending around 22 lieutenants, 100 sergeants, and 800 police officers to the World Trade Center. NYPD personnel were primarily responsible for assisting in evacuations and helping injured civilians.

[[File:NYPD ESU at WTC.jpg|thumb|right|Two NYPD officers at the World Trade Center site five weeks after the attacks.]]
Three police helicopters were also deployed to report on conditions and assess the feasibility of a rooftop landing or of special rescue operations. Once Flight 175 had struck the South Tower, another level 4 mobilization was ordered, bringing to almost 2,000 the number of NYPD personnel at the scene. Some were ordered to enter the World Trade Center to assist with the FDNY's evacuations.

The 23 NYPD officers, including four sergeants and two detectives, who died at the scene were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afge171.org/news/911/POLICE.HTM |title=9/11 Victims – Police &amp; Port Authority |publisher=Afge171.org |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Euthanasia}}{{homicide}}
'''Euthanasia''' (from {{lang-el|εὐθανασία}}; "good death": εὖ, ''eu''; "well" or "good" – θάνατος, ''thanatos''; "death") is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve [[pain]] and [[suffering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quotation=Philosopher [[Helga Kuhse]]: "'Euthanasia' is a compound of two Greek words – eu and thanatos meaning, literally, 'a good death'.

There are different [[Legality of euthanasia|euthanasia laws in each country]]. The British [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on [[Medical Ethics]] defines euthanasia as "a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering".&lt;ref name="Harris-2001"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Harris | first1 = NM. | title = The euthanasia debate | journal = J R Army Med Corps | volume = 147 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–70 |date=October 2001 | pmid = 11766225 | doi=10.1136/jramc-147-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], euthanasia is understood as "termination of life by a doctor at the request of a patient".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/support/terminalillness_euthanasia.shtml Euthanasia and assisted suicide]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719071151/http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/support/terminalillness_euthanasia.shtml |date=19 July 2011 }} ''[[BBC]]''.

Euthanasia is categorized in different ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, or involuntary. [[Voluntary euthanasia]] is legal in some countries. [[Non-voluntary euthanasia]] (patient's consent unavailable) is illegal in all countries. [[Involuntary euthanasia]] (without asking consent or against the patient's will) is also illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/euthanasia/overview/volinvol.shtml Voluntary and involuntary euthanasia]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905055247/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/euthanasia/overview/volinvol.shtml |date=5 September 2011 }} ''[[BBC]]'' Accessed 12 February 2012.

Passive euthanasia (known as "pulling the plug") is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia however is legal or de facto legal in only a handful of countries (e.g. Belgium, Canada, Switzerland) and is limited to specific circumstances and the approval of councilors and doctors or other specialists. In some countries such as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, support for active euthanasia is almost non-existent.

==Definition==
Like other terms borrowed from history, "euthanasia" has had different meanings depending on usage. The first apparent usage of the term "euthanasia" belongs to the historian [[Suetonius]], who described how the Emperor [[Augustus]], "dying quickly and without suffering in the arms of his wife, Livia, experienced the 'euthanasia' he had wished for."&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Letellier, chapter: ''History and Definition of a Word,'' in ''Euthanasia: Ethical and Human Aspects'' By [[Council of Europe]]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "euthanasia" was first used in a medical context by [[Francis Bacon]] in the 17th century, to refer to an easy, painless, happy death, during which it was a "physician's responsibility to alleviate the 'physical sufferings' of the body." Bacon referred to an "outward euthanasia"—the term "outward" he used to distinguish from a spiritual concept—the euthanasia "which regards the preparation of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon: ''The Major Works by Francis Bacon,'' edited by Brian Vickers, p. 630.&lt;/ref&gt;

In current usage, euthanasia has been defined as the "painless inducement of a quick death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kohl | first = Marvin | year = 1974 | title = The Morality of Killing | publisher = Humanities Press | location = New York | page = 94 }}, quoted in Beauchamp &amp; Davidson (1979), p 294. A similar definition is offered by Blackburn (1994) with "the action of causing the quick and painless death of a person, or not acting to prevent it when prevention was within the agent's powers."&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is argued that this approach fails to properly define euthanasia, as it leaves open a number of possible actions which would meet the requirements of the definition, but would not be seen as euthanasia. In particular, these include situations where a person kills another, painlessly, but for no reason beyond that of personal gain; or accidental deaths that are quick and painless, but not intentional.&lt;ref name="BeauchampDavidson1979"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = Tom L. | authorlink1 = Tom Beauchamp | last2 = Davidson | first2 = Arnold I. | authorlink2 = Arnold Davidson | year = 1979 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | journal = [[Journal of Medicine and Philosophy]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 294–312 | doi=10.1093/jmp/4.3.294 | pmid=501249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Draper1998"&gt;{{cite book | last = Draper | first = Heather | year = 1998 | chapter = Euthanasia | editor = Chadwick, Ruth | title = Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics | volume = 2 | publisher = Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach incorporates the notion of [[suffering]] into the definition.&lt;ref name="BeauchampDavidson1979" /&gt; The definition offered by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] incorporates suffering as a necessary condition, with "the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or in an irreversible coma",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = euthanasia | work = Oxford Dictionaries | date = April 2010 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/euthanasia | accessdate = 26 April 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110821152342/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/euthanasia | archivedate = 21 August 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is included in Marvin Khol and Paul Kurtz's definition of it as "a mode or act of inducing or permitting death painlessly as a relief from suffering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kohl | first1 = Marvin | last2 = Kurtz | first2 = Paul | year = 1975 | chapter = A Plea for Beneficient Euthanasia | editor = Kohl, Marvin | title = Beneficient Euthanasia | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo, New York | page = 94 }}, quoted in Beauchamp &amp; Davidson (1979), p 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Counterexamples can be given: such definitions may encompass killing a person suffering from an incurable disease for personal gain (such as to claim an inheritance), and commentators such as [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[Arnold Davidson]] have argued that doing so would constitute "murder simpliciter" rather than euthanasia.&lt;ref name="BeauchampDavidson1979" /&gt;

The third element incorporated into many definitions is that of intentionality – the death must be intended, rather than being accidental, and the intent of the action must be a "merciful death".&lt;ref name="BeauchampDavidson1979" /&gt; Michael Wreen argued that "the principal thing that distinguishes euthanasia from intentional killing simpliciter is the agent's motive: it must be a good motive insofar as the good of the person killed is concerned."&lt;ref name="Wreen1988p639"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4 | pages = 637–53 [639] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Heather Draper speaks to the importance of motive, arguing that "the motive forms a crucial part of arguments for euthanasia, because it must be in the best interests of the person on the receiving end."&lt;ref name="Draper1998" /&gt; Definitions such as that offered by the [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on [[Medical Ethics]] take this path, where euthanasia is defined as "a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering."&lt;ref name="Harris-2001"/&gt; Beauchamp and Davidson also highlight [[Baruch Brody]]'s "an act of euthanasia is one in which one person&amp;nbsp;... (A) kills another person (B) for the benefit of the second person, who actually does benefit from being killed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brody  | first1 = Baruch | year = 1975 | chapter = Voluntary Euthanasia and the Law | editor = Kohl, Marvin | title = Beneficient Euthanasia | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo, New York | page = 94 }}, quoted in Beauchamp &amp; Davidson (1979), p 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Draper argued that any definition of euthanasia must incorporate four elements: an agent and a subject; an intention; a causal proximity, such that the actions of the agent lead to the outcome; and an outcome. Based on this, she offered a definition incorporating those elements, stating that euthanasia "must be defined as death that results from the intention of one person to kill another person, using the most gentle and painless means possible, that is motivated solely by the best interests of the person who dies."&lt;ref name="Draper1998p176"&gt;{{cite book | last = Draper | first = Heather | year = 1998 | chapter = Euthanasia | editor = Chadwick, Ruth | title = Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics | volume = 2 | publisher = Academic Press | page = 176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Draper, Beauchamp and Davidson had also offered a definition that includes these elements. Their definition specifically discounts [[fetus]]es to distinguish between abortions and euthanasia:&lt;ref name="BeauchampDavidson1979p303"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = Tom L. | authorlink1 = Tom Beauchamp | last2 = Davidson | first2 = Arnold I. | authorlink2 = Arnold Davidson | year = 1979 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | journal = [[Journal of Medicine and Philosophy]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 303| doi = 10.1093/jmp/4.3.294 | pmid=501249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wreen, in part responding to Beauchamp and Davidson, offered a six-part definition:

{{quote|"Person A committed an act of euthanasia if and only if (1) A killed B or let her die; (2) A intended to kill B; (3) the intention specified in (2) was at least partial cause of the action specified in (1); (4) the causal journey from the intention specified in (2) to the action specified in (1) is more or less in accordance with A's plan of action; (5) A's killing of B is a voluntary action; (6) the motive for the action specified in (1), the motive standing behind the intention specified in (2), is the good of the person killed."&lt;ref name="Wreen1988pp637-640"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4 | pages = 637–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wreen also considered a seventh requirement: "(7) The good specified in (6) is, or at least includes, the avoidance of evil", although as Wreen noted in the paper, he was not convinced that the restriction was required.&lt;ref name="Wreen1988p645"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4 | pages = 637–53 [645] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing his definition, Wreen noted the difficulty of justifying euthanasia when faced with the notion of the subject's "[[right to life]]". In response, Wreen argued that euthanasia has to be voluntary, and that "involuntary euthanasia is, as such, a great wrong".&lt;ref name="Wreen1988p645"/&gt; Other commentators incorporate consent more directly into their definitions. For example, in a discussion of euthanasia presented in 2003 by the European Association of Palliative Care (EPAC) Ethics Task Force, the authors offered: "Medicalized killing of a person without the person's consent, whether nonvoluntary (where the person in unable to consent) or involuntary (against the person's will) is not euthanasia: it is murder. Hence, euthanasia can be voluntary only."&lt;ref name="Materstvedt2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 2003 | title = Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide: a view from an EAPC Ethics Task Force |journal = [[Palliative Medicine (journal)|Palliative Medicine]] | volume = 17 | pages = 97–101 | doi = 10.1191/0269216303pm673oa | pmid = 12701848 |author1=Materstvedt, Lars Johan |author2=Clark, David |author3=Ellershaw, John |author4=Førde, Reidun |author5=Boeck Gravgaard, Anne-Marie |author6=Müller-Busch, Christof |author7=Porta i Sales, Josep |author8=Rapin, Charles-Henri | issue = 2| citeseerx = 10.1.1.514.5064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the EPAC Ethics Task Force argued that both [[non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]] and [[involuntary euthanasia]] could not be included in the definition of euthanasia, there is discussion in the literature about excluding one but not the other.&lt;ref name="Wreen1988p645" /&gt;

==Classification of euthanasia==
Euthanasia may be classified into three types, according to whether a person gives [[informed consent]]: voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Perrett RW |title=Buddhism, euthanasia and the sanctity of life |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=309–13 |date=October 1996 |pmid=8910785 |pmc=1377066 |doi=10.1136/jme.22.5.309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=LaFollette, Hugh |title=Ethics in practice: an anthology |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2002 |pages=25–26 |isbn=978-0-631-22834-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o5peQpgSTTIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA3-IA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a debate within the medical and bioethics literature about whether or not the non-voluntary (and by extension, involuntary) killing of patients can be regarded as euthanasia, irrespective of intent or the patient's circumstances. In the definitions offered by Beauchamp and Davidson and, later, by Wreen, consent on the part of the patient was not considered as one of their criteria, although it may have been required to justify euthanasia.&lt;ref name="BeauchampDavidson1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wreen1988"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | pages = 637–53 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others see consent as essential.

===Voluntary euthanasia===
{{see also|Right to die}}
[[Voluntary euthanasia]] is conducted with the consent of the patient. Active voluntary euthanasia is legal in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Passive voluntary euthanasia is legal throughout the US per ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]''. When the patient brings about his or her own death with the assistance of a physician, the term [[assisted suicide]] is often used instead. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the U.S. states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont.

===Non-voluntary euthanasia===
[[Non-voluntary euthanasia]] is conducted when the consent of the patient is unavailable. Examples include [[child euthanasia]], which is illegal worldwide but decriminalised under certain specific circumstances in the Netherlands under the [[Groningen Protocol]].

===Involuntary euthanasia===
[[Involuntary euthanasia]] is conducted against the will of the patient.

===Passive and active euthanasia===
Voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary types can be further divided into passive or active variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM197501092920206 |author=Rachels J |title=Active and passive euthanasia |journal=N.

While some authors consider these terms to be misleading and unhelpful, they are nonetheless commonly used. In some cases, such as the administration of increasingly necessary, but toxic doses of [[Analgesic|painkillers]], there is a debate whether or not to regard the practice as active or passive.&lt;ref name="Harris-2001"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787), depicting Socrates prepared to drink [[Conium|hemlock]], following his conviction for corrupting the youth of [[Athens]]]]
Euthanasia was practiced in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]: for example, [[Conium|hemlock]] was employed as a means of hastening death on the island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]], a technique also employed in [[Marseilles]]. Euthanasia, in the sense of the deliberate hastening of a person's death, was supported by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Seneca the Elder]] in the ancient world, although [[Hippocrates]] appears to have [[Hippocratic Oath|spoken against the practice]], writing "I will not prescribe a deadly drug to please someone, nor give advice that may cause his death" (noting there is some debate in the literature about whether or not this was intended to encompass euthanasia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mystakidou | first1 = Kyriaki | last2 = Parpa | first2 = Efi | last3 = Tsilika | first3 = Eleni | last4 = Katsouda | first4 = Emanuela | last5 = Vlahos | first5 = Lambros | year = 2005 | title = The Evolution of Euthanasia and Its Perceptions in Greek Culture and Civilization | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–98 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2005.0013 | pmid = 15681882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stolberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stolberg | first = Michael | year = 2007 | title = Active Euthanasia in Pre-ModernSociety, 1500–1800: Learned Debates and Popular Practices | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 20 | pages = 206–07 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1093/shm/hkm034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gesundheit | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Steinberg | first2 = Avraham | last3 = Glick | first3 = Shimon | last4 = Or | first4 = Reuven | last5 = Jotkovitz | first5 = Alan | year = 2006 | title=  Euthanasia: An Overview and the Jewish Perspective | journal = [[Cancer Investigation]] | volume = 24 | doi = 10.1080/07357900600894898 | pmid = 16982468 | issue = 6 | pages = 621–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
The term ''euthanasia'' in the earlier sense of supporting someone as they died, was used for the first time by [[Francis Bacon]]. In his work, ''Euthanasia medica'', he chose this ancient Greek word and, in doing so, distinguished between ''euthanasia interior'', the preparation of the soul for death, and ''euthanasia exterior'', which was intended to make the end of life easier and painless, in exceptional circumstances by shortening life. That the ancient meaning of an easy death came to the fore again in the [[early modern period]] can be seen from its definition in the 18th century [[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon Aller Wissenschafften und Künste|''Zedlers Universallexikon'']]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Euthanasia: a very gentle and quiet death, which happens without painful convulsions. The word comes from ευ, ''bene'', well, and θανατος, ''mors'', death.&lt;ref&gt;''Zedlers Universallexikon'', Vol. 08, p. 1150, published 1732–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of euthanasia in the sense of alleviating the process of death goes back to the medical historian, [[Karl Friedrich Heinrich Marx]], who drew on Bacon's philosophical ideas. According to Marx, a doctor had a moral duty to ease the suffering of death through encouragement, support and mitigation using medication. Such an "alleviation of death" reflected the contemporary ''[[zeitgeist]]'', but was brought into the medical canon of responsibility for the first time by Marx. Marx also stressed the distinction between the theological care of the soul of sick people from the physical care and medical treatment by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|16|327|328|Marx, Karl, Mediziner|Markwart Michler|116814357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helge Dvorak: ''Biographisches Lexikon der Deutschen Burschenschaft.'' Vol. I, Sub-vol. 4, Heidelberg, 2000, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euthanasia in its modern sense has always been strongly opposed in the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition. [[Thomas Aquinas]] opposed both and argued that the practice of euthanasia contradicted our natural human instincts of survival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000130 "Historical Timeline: History of Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide,"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120705164631/http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000130 |date=5 July 2012 }} Euthanasia – ProCon.org. Last updated on: 23 July 2013. Retrieved 4 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; as did Francois Ranchin (1565–1641), a French physician and professor of medicine, and Michael Boudewijns (1601–1681), a physician and teacher.&lt;ref name="stolberg"/&gt;{{rp|208}}&lt;ref name="Gesundheit2006p623"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gesundheit | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Steinberg | first2 = Avraham | last3 = Glick | first3 = Shimon | last4 = Or | first4 = Reuven | last5 = Jotkovitz | first5 = Alan | year = 2006 | title=  Euthanasia: An Overview and the Jewish Perspective | journal = [[Cancer Investigation]] | volume = 24 | doi = 10.1080/07357900600894898 | pmid = 16982468 | issue = 6 | pages = 621–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other voices argued for euthanasia, such as [[John Donne]] in 1624,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mannes | first = Marya | year = 1975 | title = Euthanasia vs. the Right to Life | journal = Baylor Law Review | volume = 27 | page = 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and euthanasia continued to be practised. In 1678, the publication of Caspar Questel's ''De pulvinari morientibus non-subtrahend'', ("''On the pillow of which the dying should not be deprived''"), initiated debate on the topic. Questel described various customs which were employed at the time to hasten the death of the dying, (including the sudden removal of a pillow, which was believed to accelerate death), and argued against their use, as doing so was "against the laws of God and Nature".&lt;ref name="stolberg"/&gt;{{rp|209–211}} This view was shared by others who followed, including Philipp Jakob Spener, Veit Riedlin and [[Johann Georg Krünitz]].&lt;ref name="stolberg"/&gt;{{rp|211}} Despite opposition, euthanasia continued to be practised, involving techniques such as bleeding, suffocation, and removing people from their beds to be placed on the cold ground.&lt;ref name="stolberg"/&gt;{{rp|211–214}}

Suicide and euthanasia became more accepted during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Gesundheit2006p623" /&gt; [[Thomas More]] wrote of euthanasia in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', although it is not clear if More was intending to endorse the practice.&lt;ref name="stolberg"/&gt;{{rp|208–209}} Other cultures have taken different approaches: for example, in Japan suicide has not traditionally been viewed as a sin, as it is used in cases of honor, and accordingly, the perceptions of euthanasia are different from those in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Otani | first = Izumi | year = 2010 | title = "Good Manner of Dying" as a Normative Concept: "Autocide", "Granny Dumping" and Discussions on Euthanasia/Death with Dignity in Japan | journal = International Journal of Japanese Society | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6781.2010.01136.x | pages = 49–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings of the contemporary euthanasia debate===
In the mid-1800s, the use of [[morphine]] to treat "the pains of death" emerged, with [[John Collins Warren|John Warren]] recommending its use in 1848. A similar use of [[chloroform]] was revealed by Joseph Bullar in 1866. However, in neither case was it recommended that the use should be to hasten death. In 1870 Samuel Williams, a schoolteacher, initiated the contemporary euthanasia debate through a speech given at the Birmingham Speculative Club in England, which was subsequently published in a one-off publication entitled ''Essays of the Birmingham Speculative Club'', the collected works of a number of members of an amateur philosophical society.&lt;ref name="Emanuel1994"/&gt;{{rp|794}} Williams' proposal was to use chloroform to deliberately hasten the death of terminally ill patients:

{{quote|That in all cases of hopeless and painful illness, it should be the recognized duty of the medical attendant, whenever so desired by the patient, to administer chloroform or such other anaesthetic as may by-and-bye supersede chloroform – so as to destroy consciousness at once, and put the sufferer to a quick and painless death; all needful precautions being adopted to prevent any possible abuse of such duty; and means being taken to establish, beyond the possibility of doubt or question, that the remedy was applied at the express wish of the patient.|Samuel Williams (1872) | ''Euthanasia'' Williams and Northgate: London.&lt;ref name="Emanuel1994"/&gt;{{rp|794}} }}

The essay was favourably reviewed in ''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'', but an editorial against the essay appeared in ''[[The Spectator]]''.&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Manchester University Press |isbn = 978-0-7190-6124-0 |title = Merciful Release |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL10531689M/Merciful_Release |author = Nick Kemp |date = 7 September 2002 |id = 0719061245 |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=== Early euthanasia movement in the United States ===
{{Main article|Euthanasia in the United States}}

[[Image:Felix-Adler-Hine.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]], circa 1913, the first prominent American to argue for permitting suicide in cases of chronic illness]]
The rise of the euthanasia movement in the United States coincided with the so-called [[Gilded Age]], a time of social and technological change that encompassed an "individualistic conservatism that praised laissez-faire economics, [[scientific method]], and [[rationalism]]", along with major [[Depression (economics)|depressions]], industrialisation and conflict between corporations and labour unions.&lt;ref name="Emanuel1994"/&gt;{{rp|794}} It was also the period in which the modern hospital system was developed, which has been seen as a factor in the emergence of the euthanasia debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pappas | first = Demetra | year = 1996 | title = Recent historical perspectives regarding medical euthanasia and physician assisted suicide | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 52 | pages = 386–87 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a011554 | pmid=8759237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]] argued for euthanasia, stating in 1894 that where someone is suffering from a terminal illness, such as terminal cancer, they should have a right to end their pain through suicide. [[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]] offered a similar approach, although, unlike Ingersoll, Adler did not reject religion. In fact, he argued from an [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]] framework. In 1891, Adler argued that those suffering from overwhelming pain should have the right to commit suicide, and, furthermore, that it should be permissible for a doctor to assist – thus making Adler the first "prominent American" to argue for suicide in cases where people were suffering from chronic illness.&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dowbiggin | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Dowbiggin | year = 2003 | title = A merciful end: the euthanasia movement in modern America | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-515443-6 | pages = 10–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Ingersoll and Adler argued for voluntary euthanasia of adults suffering from terminal ailments.&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin"/&gt; Dowbiggin argues that by breaking down prior moral objections to euthanasia and suicide, Ingersoll and Adler enabled others to stretch the definition of euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin2003p13"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dowbiggin | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Dowbiggin | year = 2003 | title = A merciful end: the euthanasia movement in modern America | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-515443-6 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to legalise euthanasia took place in the United States, when [[Henry Thomas Hunt|Henry Hunt]] introduced legislation into the [[Ohio General Assembly|General Assembly]] of [[Ohio]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="Appel2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Appel | first = Jacob | authorlink = Jacob M.

Hall]], a wealthy heiress who was a major figure in the euthanasia movement during the early 20th century in the United States. Hall had watched her mother die after an extended battle with [[liver cancer]], and had dedicated herself to ensuring that others would not have to endure the same suffering. Towards this end she engaged in an extensive letter writing campaign, recruited [[Lurana W. Sheldon|Lurana Sheldon]] and [[Maud Ballington Booth]], and organised a debate on euthanasia at the annual meeting of the [[American Humane Association]] in 1905 – described by [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] as the first significant public debate on the topic in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Appel2004"/&gt;{{rp|614–616}}

Hunt's bill called for the administration of an [[anesthetic]] to bring about a patient's death, so long as the person is of lawful age and sound mind, and was suffering from a fatal injury, an irrevocable illness, or great physical pain. It also required that the case be heard by a physician, required informed consent in front of three witnesses, and required the attendance of three physicians who had to agree that the patient's recovery was impossible. A motion to reject the bill outright was voted down, but the bill failed to pass, 79 to 23.&lt;ref name="Emanuel1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Emanuel | first = Ezekiel | authorlink = Ezekiel Emanuel | year = 1994 | title = The history of euthanasia debates in the United States and Britain | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 121 | page = 796 | issue = 10 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-121-10-199411150-00010 | url = http://annals.org/data/Journals/AIM/19818/0000605-199411150-00010.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.732.724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|796}}&lt;ref name="Appel2004"/&gt;{{rp|618–619}}

Along with the Ohio euthanasia proposal, in 1906 Assemblyman Ross Gregory introduced a proposal to permit euthanasia to the [[Iowa General Assembly|Iowa legislature]]. However, the Iowa legislation was broader in scope than that offered in Ohio. It allowed for the death of any person of at least ten years of age who suffered from an ailment that would prove fatal and cause extreme pain, should they be of sound mind and express a desire to artificially hasten their death. In addition, it allowed for infants to be euthanised if they were sufficiently deformed, and permitted guardians to request euthanasia on behalf of their wards. The proposed legislation also imposed penalties on physicians who refused to perform euthanasia when requested: a 6–12 month prison term and a fine of between $200 and $1,000. The proposal proved to be controversial.&lt;ref name="Appel2004"/&gt;{{rp|619–621}} It engendered considerable debate and failed to pass, having been withdrawn from consideration after being passed to the Committee on Public Health.&lt;ref name="Appel2004"/&gt;{{rp|623}}

After 1906 the euthanasia debate reduced in intensity, resurfacing periodically, but not returning to the same level of debate until the 1930s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Emanuel1994"/&gt;{{rp|796}}

Euthanasia opponent [[Ian Dowbiggin]] argues that the early membership of the [[Euthanasia Society of America]] (ESA) reflected how many perceived euthanasia at the time, often seeing it as a eugenics matter rather than an issue concerning individual rights.&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin"/&gt; Dowbiggin argues that not every eugenist joined the ESA "solely for eugenic reasons", but he postulates that there were clear ideological connections between the eugenics and euthanasia movements.&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin"/&gt;

===1930s in Britain===
The [[Voluntary Euthanasia Legalisation Society]] was founded in 1935 by [[Charles Killick Millard]] (now called Dignity in Dying). The movement campaigned for the legalisation of euthanasia in Great Britain.

In January 1936, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] was given a fatal dose of morphine and [[cocaine]] to hasten his death. At the time he was suffering from cardio-respiratory failure, and the decision to end his life was made by his physician, [[Bertrand Dawson, 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn|Lord Dawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ramsay | first = J H R | date = 28 May 2011 | title = A king, a doctor, and a convenient death | journal = [[British Medical Journal]] | volume = 308 | issue = 1445 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/308/6941/1445.1.full | accessdate = 2 August 2011 | pmid = 11644545 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.308.6941.1445 | page = 1445 | pmc = 2540387 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807054519/http://www.bmj.com/content/308/6941/1445.1.full | archivedate = 7 August 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this event was kept a secret for over 50 years, the death of George V coincided with proposed legislation in the [[House of Lords]] to legalise euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gurney | first = Edward | year = 1972 | title = Is There a Right to Die – A Study of the Law of Euthanasia | journal = Cumberland-Samford Law Review | volume = 3 | page = 237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 5,200 infants will eventually be killed through this programme".&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' noted that the killing of the disabled infant—whose name was [[Gerhard Kretschmar]], born blind, with missing limbs, subject to convulsions, and reportedly "an idiot"— provided "the rationale for a secret Nazi decree that led to 'mercy killings' of almost 300,000 mentally and physically handicapped people".&lt;ref name="casek1"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1443967/Named-the-baby-boy-who-was-Nazis-first-euthanasia-victim.html|title=Named: the baby boy who was Nazis' first euthanasia victim|author=Irene Zoech|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=4 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908201139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1443967/Named-the-baby-boy-who-was-Nazis-first-euthanasia-victim.html|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2003-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Kretchmar's killing received parental consent, most of the 5,000 to 8,000 children killed afterwards were forcibly taken from their parents.&lt;ref name="July24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="casek1"/&gt;

The "euthanasia campaign" of mass murder gathered momentum on 14 January 1940 when the "handicapped" were killed with gas vans and killing centres, eventually leading to the deaths of 70,000 adult Germans.&lt;ref name=January14&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/interactive/timelines/nazi_genocide_timeline/index_embed.shtml Genocide Under the Nazis Timeline: 14 January 1940] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805144040/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/interactive/timelines/nazi_genocide_timeline/index_embed.shtml |date=5 August 2011 }} ''[[BBC]]'' Accessed 23 July 2011. Quotation: "The 'euthanasia campaign' gathers momentum in Germany, as six special killing centres and gas vans, under an organisation code-named T4, are used in the murder of 'handicapped' adults. Over 70,000 Germans will eventually be killed in this act of mass murder – it is the first time poison bas will be used for such a purpose".&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Robert Jay Lifton]], author of ''The Nazi Doctors'' and a leading authority on the T4 program, contrasts this program with what he considers to be a genuine euthanasia. He explains that the Nazi version of "euthanasia" was based on the work of [[Adolf Jost]], who published ''The Right to Death'' (Das Recht auf den Tod) in 1895. Lifton writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jost argued that control over the death of the individual must ultimately belong to the social organism, the state. This concept is in direct opposition to the Anglo-American concept of euthanasia, which emphasizes the ''individual's'' 'right to die' or 'right to death' or 'right to his or her own death,' as the ultimate human claim. In contrast, Jost was pointing to the state's right to kill.&amp;nbsp;... Ultimately the argument was biological: 'The rights to death [are] the key to the fitness of life.' The state must own death—must kill—in order to keep the social organism alive and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Books 1986, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern terms, the use of "euthanasia" in the context of Action T4 is seen to be a [[wikt:euphemism|euphemism]] to disguise a program of [[genocide]], in which people were killed on the grounds of "disabilities, religious beliefs, and discordant individual values".&lt;ref name="Michalsen2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michalsen A, Reinhart K |title="Euthanasia": A confusing term, abused under the Nazi regime and misused in present end-of-life debate |journal=Intensive Care Med |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=1304–10 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16826394 |doi=10.1007/s00134-006-0256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the discussions of euthanasia that emerged post-war, the Nazi program may have been worded in terms that appear similar to the modern use of "euthanasia", but there was no "mercy" and the patients were not necessarily terminally ill.&lt;ref name="Michalsen2006" /&gt; Despite these differences, historian and euthanasia opponent [[Ian Dowbiggin]] writes that "the origins of Nazi euthanasia, like those of the American euthanasia movement, predate the Third Reich and were intertwined with the history of eugenics and Social Darwinism, and with efforts to discredit traditional morality and ethics."&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin"/&gt;{{rp|65}}

=== The 1949 New York State Petition for Euthanasia and Catholic opposition ===
On 6 January 1949, the Euthanasia Society of America presented to the [[New York State Legislature]] a petition to legalize euthanasia, signed by 379 leading Protestant and Jewish ministers, the largest group of religious leaders ever to have taken this stance. A similar petition had been sent to the New York Legislature in 1947, signed by approximately 1,000 New York physicians. [[Roman Catholic]] religious leaders criticized the petition, saying that such a bill would "legalize a suicide-murder pact" and a "rationalization of the fifth commandment of God, 'Thou Shalt Not Kill.'"&lt;ref name="Mercy Killing"&gt;[[The Moncton Transcript]]. "Ministers Ask Mercy Killing." 6 January 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; The Right Reverend Robert E. McCormick stated that
{{Quote|"The ultimate object of the Euthanasia Society is based on the Totalitarian principle that the state is supreme and that the individual does not have the right to live if his continuance in life is a burden or hindrance to the state. The Nazis followed this principle and compulsory Euthanasia was practiced as a part of their program during the recent war. We American citizens of New York State must ask ourselves this question: 'Are we going to finish Hitler's job?'"&lt;ref name="Mercy Killing"/&gt;}}
The petition brought tensions between the American Euthanasia Society and the Catholic Church to a head that contributed to a climate of anti-Catholic sentiment generally, regarding issues such as birth control, eugenics, and population control. However, the petition did not result in any legal changes.&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin"/&gt;

==Euthanasia debate==
Historically, the euthanasia debate has tended to focus on a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent [[Ezekiel Emanuel]], proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that people have a right to [[self-determination]], and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle–the [[doctrine of double effect]]–is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], and states like [[Oregon]], where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.

Similarly, Emanuel argues that there are four major arguments presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined with the use of effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a [[Euthanasia and the slippery slope|slippery slope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Times Books |isbn = 978-0-8129-2790-0 |location = New York |title = Forced Exit |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1006883M/Forced_exit |author = Wesley J.

Top reasons were a loss of dignity, and a fear of burdening others.&lt;ref name=usa151020&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/20/california-physician-assisted-suicide-belgium-netherlands-editorials-debates/74296214|title=The vulnerable will be the victims: Opposing view|website=Usatoday.com|accessdate=4 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909185538/https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/10/20/california-physician-assisted-suicide-belgium-netherlands-editorials-debates/74296214/|archivedate=9 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
{{globalize|section|date=November 2011}}
{{Main article|Legality of euthanasia}}
West's ''Encyclopedia of American Law'' states that "a 'mercy killing' or euthanasia is generally considered to be a criminal homicide"&lt;ref&gt;The legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com says: "If a person kills another person in order to end the other person's pain or suffering, the killing is considered a homicide. It does not matter if the other person is about to die or is terminally ill just prior to being killed; the law generally views such a killing as criminal. Thus, a "mercy killing", or act of Euthanasia, is generally considered a criminal homicide&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; and is normally used as a synonym of homicide committed at a request made by the patient.&lt;ref name="Tomas_Valiente_1997"/&gt;

The judicial sense of the term "[[homicide]]" includes any intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, even to relieve intractable suffering.&lt;ref name="Tomas_Valiente_1997"&gt;Carmen Tomás Y Valiente, La regulación de la eutanasia en Holanda, Anuario de Derecho Penal y Ciencias Penales – Núm.

A 2010 survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians found that 16.3% of physicians would consider halting life-sustaining therapy because the family demanded it, even if they believed that it was premature.

==Religious views==
{{main|Religious views on euthanasia}}
===Christianity===

====Broadly against====
The Roman Catholic Church strongly opposes and condemns euthanasia and assisted suicide as morally wrong. It states that, "intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator". Because of this, the practice is unacceptable within the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicity.com/vote/euthanasia.html|title=How to Vote Catholic: Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide|website=www.catholicity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orthodox Church in America]], along with other Eastern Orthodox Churches, also opposes euthanasia stating that it must be condemned as murder stating that, "Euthanasia is the deliberate cessation to end human life."&lt;ref name="orthodoxchristian.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/Euthanasia.htm|title=The Orthodox Christian view on Euthanasia|website=www.orthodoxchristian.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812133422/http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/Euthanasia.htm|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-Catholic churches in the United States take a stance against euthanasia. Among Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1991 opposing euthanasia and assisted suicide stating that it is "morally wrong and unacceptable to take a human life to relieve the suffering caused by incurable illnesses." &lt;ref name="orthodoxchristian.info"/&gt; Other Protestant churches which oppose euthanasia include:

===Islam===

Euthanasia is a complex issue in Islamic theology; however, in general it is considered contrary to [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic holy books|holy texts]]. Among interpretations of the [[Koran]] and [[Hadith]], the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide. The various positions on the cessation of medical treatment are mixed and considered a different class of action than direct termination of life, especially if the patient is suffering. Suicide and euthanasia are both crimes in almost all [[Muslim world|Muslim majority countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Islamic Perspectives, Euthanasia (Qatl al-raḥma). Abulfadl Mohsin Ebrahim.

===Judaism===

There is much debate on the topic of euthanasia in Judaic theology, ethics, and general opinion (especially in Israel and the United States). Passive euthanasia was declared legal by [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Israel's highest court]] under certain conditions and has reached some level of acceptance. Active euthanasia remains illegal, however the topic is actively under debate with no clear consensus through legal, ethical, theological and spiritual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Death and Euthanasia in Jewish Law: Essays and Responses.

[[File:Execution of Louis XVI.jpg|thumb|300px|"Day of 21 January 1793 the death of Louis Capet on the [[Place de la Concorde|Place de la Révolution]]" – French engraving.]]

The '''execution of Louis XVI''', by means of the [[guillotine]], a major event of the [[French Revolution]], took place on 21 January 1793 at the ''Place de la Révolution'' ("Revolution Square", formerly ''Place Louis XV'', and renamed ''[[Place de la Concorde]]'' in 1795) in Paris. The [[National Convention]] had convicted [[Louis XVI|the king]] (17 January 1793) in a near-unanimous vote (while no one voted "not guilty", several deputies abstained) and condemned him to death by a simple majority.

== Journey from the Temple prison to the Place de la Révolution ==

Louis XVI awoke at 5 o'clock and after dressing with the aid of his valet [[Jean-Baptiste Cléry]], went to meet with the non-juring Irish priest [[Henry Essex Edgeworth|Father Henry Essex Edgeworth de Firmont]] to make his confession. He heard his last Mass, served by Cléry, and received Communion. The Mass requisites were provided by special direction of the authorities. On Father Edgeworth's advice, Louis avoided a last farewell scene with his family. At 7 o'clock he confided his last wishes to the priest. His [[Royal seal]] was to go to the Dauphin and his wedding ring to the Queen. After receiving the priest's blessing, he went to meet [[Antoine Joseph Santerre]], Commander of the Guard. A green carriage was waiting in the second court. He seated himself in it with the priest, with two militiamen sitting opposite them. The carriage left the Temple at approximately 9 o'clock. For more than an hour the carriage, preceded by drummers playing to drown out any support for the King and escorted by a cavalry troop with drawn sabres, made its way through Paris along a route lined with 80,000 men at arms and soldiers of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] and [[sans-culottes]].

In the neighbourhood of the present ''rue de Cléry'', [[Jean, Baron de Batz|the Baron de Batz]], a supporter of the Royal family who had financed the [[flight to Varennes]], had summoned 300 Royalists to enable the King's escape. Louis was to be hidden in a house in the ''rue de Cléry'' belonging to the Count of Marsan. The Baron leaped forward calling "Follow me, my friends, let us save the King!", but his associates had been denounced and only a few had been able to turn up. Three of them were killed, but de Batz managed to escape.

At 10 o'clock, the carriage arrived at ''Place de la Révolution'' and proceeded to an area where a scaffold had been erected, in a space surrounded by guns and drums, and a crowd carrying pikes and bayonets.

==Execution==
After initially refusing to have his hands tied, Louis XVI relented when the executioner proposed to use his handkerchief instead of rope. After this his hair was cut and the collar of his shirt was removed. After being led upon the scaffold, Louis tried to give a speech but the noise of the drums made this difficult to understand. He was then laid on the bench, the collar closed over his neck and then the blade came down. According to reports the blade did not sever his neck but cut through the back of his skull and into his jaw.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Clarke (writer)|Stephen Clarke]], ''The French Revolution &amp; what went wrong'', Century, 2018, p.452, {{ISBN|9781780895512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witness quotes==
[[File:Louis XVI - Execution.jpg|thumb | right | 250px | "The Death of Louis XVI King of France from an English engraving, published 1798.]]

===Henry Essex Edgeworth===
{{further|Henry Essex Edgeworth}}
Edgeworth, Louis' Irish confessor, wrote in his memoirs:
{{quote|The path leading to the scaffold was extremely rough and difficult to pass; the King was obliged to lean on my arm, and from the slowness with which he proceeded, I feared for a moment that his courage might fail; but what was my astonishment, when arrived at the last step, I felt that he suddenly let go my arm, and I saw him cross with a firm foot the breadth of the whole scaffold; silence, by his look alone, fifteen or twenty drums that were placed opposite to me; and in a voice so loud, that it must have been heard at the Pont Tournant, I heard him pronounce distinctly these memorable words: "I die innocent of all the crimes laid to my charge; I Pardon those who have occasioned my death; and I pray to God that the blood you are going to shed may never be visited on France."&lt;ref&gt;From his Memoirs, published 1815.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Press of the day ===
The 13 February issue of the ''Thermomètre du jour'' ('Daily Thermometer'), a moderate Republican newspaper, described the King as shouting "I am lost!", citing as its source the executioner, [[Charles-Henri Sanson]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== Charles-Henri Sanson ===
[[Charles-Henri Sanson]] responded to the story by offering his own version of events in a letter dated 20 February 1793. The account of Sanson states:
{{quote|Arriving at the foot of the guillotine, Louis XVI looked for a moment at the instruments of his execution and asked Sanson why the drums had stopped beating. He came forward to speak, but there were shouts to the executioners to get on with their work. As he was strapped down, he exclaimed "My people, I die innocent!" Then, turning towards his executioners, Louis XVI declared "Gentlemen, I am innocent of everything of which I am accused. I hope that my blood may cement the good fortune of the French." The blade fell. It was 10:22&amp;nbsp;am. One of the assistants of Sanson showed the head of Louis XVI to the people, whereupon a huge cry of "Vive la Nation! Vive la République!" arose and an artillery salute rang out which reached the ears of the imprisoned Royal family.}}

In his letter, published along with its French mistakes in the ''Thermomètre'' of Thursday, 21 February 1793, Sanson emphasises that the King "bore all this with a composure and a firmness which has surprised us all. I remained strongly convinced that he derived this firmness from the principles of the religion by which he seemed penetrated and persuaded as no other man."

=== Henri Sanson ===
[[File:Hinrichtung Ludwig des XVI.png|thumb|250px|"Execution of Louis XVI" – German copperplate engraving, 1793, by [[Georg Heinrich Sieveking]]]]
In his [[Causerie]]s, [[Alexandre Dumas]] refers to a meeting circa 1830 with Henri Sanson, eldest son of Charles-Henri Sanson, who had also been present at the execution.

{{poemquote|text={{in5}}"Now then, you were saying you wanted something, Monsieur Dumas?"
{{in5}}"You know how much playwrights need accurate information, Monsieur Sanson. The moment may come for me to put Louis XVI on the stage. How much truth is there in the story of the wrestling bout between him and your father's assistants at the foot of the scaffold?"
{{in5}}"Oh, I can tell you that, Monsieur, I was there."
{{in5}}"I know, that's why it is you I'm asking."
{{in5}}"Well listen. The King had been driven to the scaffold in his own carriage and his hands were free. At the foot of the scaffold we decided to tie his hands, but less because we feared that he might defend himself than because we thought he might by an involuntary movement spoil his execution or make it more painful. So one assistant waited with a rope, while another said to him 'It is necessary to tie your hands'. On hearing these unexpected words, at the unexpected sight of that rope, Louis XVI made an involuntary gesture of repulsion. 'Never!' he cried, 'never!' and pushed back the man holding the rope. The other three assistants, believing that a struggle was imminent, dashed forward. That is the explanation of the moment of confusion interpreted after their fashion by the historians. It was then that my father approached and said, in the most respectful tone of voice imaginable, 'With a handkerchief, Sire'. At the word 'Sire', which he had not heard for so long, Louis XVI winced, and at the same moment his confessor had addressed a few words to him from the carriage,&lt;ref&gt;Father Edgeworth had reminded the King that on Good Friday Jesus had offered his hands to be tied.&lt;/ref&gt; said 'So be it, then, that too, my God!' and held out his hands."}}

Henri Sanson was family appointed Executioner of Paris from April 1793, and would later execute Marie Antoinette.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Leboucher===
Speaking to [[Victor Hugo]] in 1840, a man called Leboucher, who had arrived in Paris from Bourges in December 1792 and was present at the execution of Louis XVI, recalled vividly:
{{quote|Here are some unknown details. The executioners numbered four; two only performed the execution; the third stayed at the foot of the ladder, and the fourth was on the wagon which was to convey the King's body to the Madeleine Cemetery and which was waiting a few feet from the scaffold.

The executioners wore breeches, coats in the French style as the Revolution had modified it, and three-cornered hats with enormous tri-colour cockades.

They executed the King with their hats on, and it was without taking his hat off that Samson,{{sic}} seizing by the hair the severed head of Louis XVI., showed it to the people, and for a few moments let the blood from it trickle upon the scaffold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/victor_hugo/memoirs-of-hugo/2/|title=The Memoirs of Victor Hugo}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Louis-Sébastien Mercier===
In ''Le nouveau Paris'', [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier|Mercier]] describes the execution of Louis XVI in these words:
{{quote|... is this really the same man that I see being jostled by four assistant executioners, forcibly undressed, his voice drowned out by the drums, trussed to a plank, still struggling, and receiving the heavy blade so badly that the cut does not go through his neck, but through the back of his head and his jaw, horribly?}}

== Jacques de Molay ==
A popular but apocryphal legend associated with the execution states that as soon as the guillotine fell, an anonymous [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] leaped on the scaffolding, plunged his hand into the blood, splashed drips of it onto the crown, and shouted, "''[[Jacques de Molay]], tu es vengé!''" (usually translated as, "Jacques de Molay, thou art avenged"). De Molay (died 1314), the last [[Grand Master of the Knights Templar]], had reportedly cursed Louis' ancestor [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], after the latter had sentenced him to [[Death by burning|burn at the stake]] based on false confessions. The story spread widely and the phrase remains in use today to indicate the triumph of reason and logic over "religious superstition".&lt;ref name="DuQuette2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=DuQuette|first=Lon Milo|title=The Key to Solomon's Key: Secrets of Magic and Masonry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z15J8lgCqxYC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=20 August 2011|date=2006-04-01|publisher=CCC Publishing|isbn=978-1-888729-14-6|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Burial in the cemetery of the Madeleine ==
The body of Louis XVI was immediately transported to the old [[Church of the Madeleine]] (demolished in 1799), since the legislation in force forbade burial of his remains beside those of his father, the Dauphin [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis de France]], at Sens. Two curates who had sworn fealty to the Revolution held a short memorial service at the church. One of them, Damoureau, stated in evidence:
{{quote|Arriving at the cemetery, I called for silence. A detachment of [[Gendarme (historical)|Gendarmes]] showed us the body. It was clothed in a white vest and grey silk breeches with matching stockings. We chanted [[Vespers]] and the service for the dead. In pursuance of an executive order, the body lying in its open coffin was thrown onto a bed of [[quicklime]] at the bottom of the pit and covered by one of earth, the whole being firmly and thoroughly tamped down. Louis XVI's head was placed at his feet.}}

On 21 January 1815 Louis XVI and his wife's remains were re-buried in the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] where in 1816 his brother, King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], had a funerary monument erected by [[Edme Gaulle]].

== Today ==
The area where Louis XVI and later (16 October 1793) [[Marie Antoinette]] were buried, in the churchyard of St. Mary Magdaleine's, is today the "Square Louis XVI" greenspace, containing the classically self-effacing [[Chapelle expiatoire|Expiatory Chapel]] completed in 1826 during the reign of Louis's youngest brother [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. The crypt altar stands above the exact spot where the remains of the Royal couple were originally laid to rest. The chapel narrowly escaped destruction on politico-ideological grounds during the violently [[Anti-clericalism#Third Republic|anti-clerical period]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

In mathematics, a '''fractal''' is a detailed, recursive, and infinitely self-similar mathematical set whose [[Hausdorff dimension]] strictly exceeds its [[topological dimension]]. Fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature due to their tendency to appear nearly the same at different levels, as is illustrated here in the successively small magnifications of the [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek"/&gt; Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales,&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''expanding symmetry''' or '''unfolding symmetry'''; If this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the [[Menger sponge]],&lt;ref name="Gouyet" /&gt; it is called a [[self-similar]] pattern.

One way that fractals are different from finite [[geometric figures]] is the way in which they [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]]. Doubling the edge lengths of a [[polygon]] multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its [[volume]] scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in).

The mathematical [[#history|roots]] of fractals have been traced throughout the years as a formal path of published works, starting in the 17th century with notions of [[recursion]], then moving through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment of the concept to the study of [[Continuous function|continuous]] but not [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] functions in the 19th century by the seminal work of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=S.

Mandelbrot based it on the Latin ''[[wikt:fractus#Latin|frāctus]]'' meaning "broken" or "fractured", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional [[fractal dimension|dimensions]] to geometric [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical people : profiles and interviews|last1=Albers|first1=Donald J.|last2=Alexanderson|first2=Gerald L.|publisher=AK Peters|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56881-340-0|location=Wellesley, MA|page=214|chapter=Benoît Mandelbrot: In his own words|author2-link=Gerald L.

There is some disagreement amongst authorities about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as "beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mandelbrot|first=Benoit|title=24/7 Lecture on Fractals|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7HB5Oze4g#t=70|work=2006 Ig Nobel Awards|publisher=Improbable Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot stated that "A fractal is by definition a set for which the [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension]] strictly exceeds the [[topological dimension]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, B.B.: The Fractal Geometry of Nature. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1982); p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and expanded the definition to: "A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jens Feder|title=Fractals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgvyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4899-2124-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still later, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language: "...to use ''fractal'' without a pedantic definition, to use ''[[fractal dimension]]'' as a generic term applicable to ''all'' the variants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Edgar|title=Measure, Topology, and Fractal Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk2vruTv0_gC&amp;pg=PR7|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-74749-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Simple Fractals.png|thumb|right| A simple fractal tree created through javascript]]
The word "fractal" often has different connotations for laymen as opposed to mathematicians, where the layman is more likely to be familiar with [[fractal art]] than the mathematical concept. The mathematical concept is difficult to define formally, even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with little mathematical background.

The feature of "self-similarity", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the [[infinite regress]] in parallel mirrors or the [[homunculus]], the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head ...). The difference for fractals is that the pattern reproduced must be detailed.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|166; 18}}&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote" /&gt;

This idea of being detailed relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or [[fractal dimension]] greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric [[shapes]] are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 the length of the original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the Koch snowflake. It is also 1-dimensional for the same [[reason]] as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a fractal dimension greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The fractal curve divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its [[fractal dimension]].

This also leads to understanding a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are "nowhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot be measured in traditional ways.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; To elaborate, in trying to find the length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of [[rectifiable curve|measuring]] with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pickover, the mathematics behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when the mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] pondered [[recursion|recursive]] [[self-similarity]] (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the [[straight line]] was self-similar in this sense).&lt;ref name="Pickover"&gt;{{cite book |page=310 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=fractal+koch+curve+book#v=onepage&amp;q=fractal%20koch%20curve%20book&amp;f=false |first=Clifford A. |last=Pickover

One of the next milestones came in 1904, when [[Helge von Koch]], extending ideas of Poincaré and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the [[Koch snowflake]].&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when [[Wacław Sierpiński]] constructed his famous [[Sierpinski triangle|triangle]] then, one year later, his [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]]. By 1918, two French mathematicians, [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Gaston Julia]], though working independently, arrived essentially simultaneously at results describing what are now seen as fractal behaviour associated with mapping [[complex numbers]] and iterative functions and leading to further ideas about [[strange attractors|attractors and repellors]] (i.e., points that attract or repel other points), which have become very important in the study of fractals.&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Very shortly after that work was submitted, by March 1918, [[Felix Hausdorff]] expanded the definition of "dimension", significantly for the evolution of the definition of fractals, to allow for sets to have noninteger dimensions.&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], who, in his 1938 paper ''Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole'' described a new fractal curve, the [[Lévy C curve]].&lt;ref group="notes" name="levy note" /&gt;

Different researchers have postulated that without the aid of modern computer graphics, early investigators were limited to what they could depict in manual drawings, so lacked the means to visualize the beauty and appreciate some of the implications of many of the patterns they had discovered (the Julia set, for instance, could only be visualized through a few iterations as very simple drawings).&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gordon

One often cited description that Mandelbrot published to describe geometric fractals is "a rough or fragmented [[Shape|geometric shape]] that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole";&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt; this is generally helpful but limited.

According to Falconer, rather than being strictly defined, fractals should, in addition to being nowhere differentiable and able to have a [[fractal dimension]], be generally characterized by a [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] of the following features;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;

* Self-similarity, which may be manifested as:
:* Exact self-similarity: identical at all scales; e.g. [[#koch|Koch snowflake]]
:* Quasi self-similarity: approximates the same pattern at different scales; may contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms; e.g., the [[Mandelbrot set]]'s satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies.
:* Statistical self-similarity: repeats a pattern [[stochastic]]ally so numerical or statistical measures are preserved across scales; e.g., [[#random|randomly generated fractals]]; the well-known example of the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]], for which one would not expect to find a segment scaled and repeated as neatly as the repeated unit that defines, for example, the Koch snowflake&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;
:* Qualitative self-similarity: as in a time series&lt;ref name="time series"&gt;{{cite book | last=Peters | first=Edgar | title=Chaos and order in the capital markets : a new view of cycles, prices, and market volatility | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-471-13938-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Multifractal]] scaling: characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule
* Fine or detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. A consequence of this structure is fractals may have [[emergent properties]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=John |last1=Spencer |first2=Michael S.

* Irregularity locally and globally that is not easily described in traditional [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean geometric]] language.

As a group, these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain cases, such as those that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features. A straight line, for instance, is self-similar but not fractal because it lacks detail, is easily described in Euclidean language, has the same [[Hausdorff dimension]] as [[topological dimension]], and is fully defined without a need for recursion.&lt;ref name ="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;

[[File:Apophysis-100303-104.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[fractal flame]]]]
Fractal patterns have been modeled extensively, albeit within a range of scales rather than infinitely, owing to the practical limits of physical time and space. Models may simulate theoretical fractals or [[#fractals in nature|natural phenomena with fractal features]]. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for [[fractal analysis]]. Some specific applications of fractals to technology are listed [[#fractals in technology|elsewhere]]. Images and other outputs of modelling are normally referred to as being "fractals" even if they do not have strictly fractal characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal image that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display [[Artifact (error)|artifacts]] which are not characteristics of true fractals.

Modeled fractals may be sounds,&lt;ref name="music" /&gt; digital images, electrochemical patterns, [[circadian rhythm]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Fathallah-Shaykh | first1=Hassan M. | title=Fractal Dimension of the Drosophila Circadian Clock | doi=10.1142/S0218348X11005476 | journal=Fractals | volume=19 | issue=4 | pages=423–430 | year=2011 | pmid= | pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
Fractal patterns have been reconstructed in physical 3-dimensional space&lt;ref name="medicine" /&gt;{{rp|10}} and virtually, often called "[[in silico]]" modeling.&lt;ref name="modeling vasculature" /&gt; Models of fractals are generally created using [[fractal-generating software]] that implements techniques such as those outlined above.&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time series" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicine" /&gt; As one illustration, trees, ferns, cells of the nervous system,&lt;ref name="branching" /&gt; blood and lung vasculature,&lt;ref name="modeling vasculature"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fractal aspects of three-dimensional vascular constructive optimization

Similarly, random fractals have been used to describe/create many highly irregular real-world objects. A limitation of modeling fractals is that resemblance of a fractal model to a natural phenomenon does not prove that the phenomenon being modeled is formed by a process similar to the modeling algorithms.

In a 1996 interview with [[Michael Silverblatt]], [[David Foster Wallace]] admitted that the structure of the first draft of ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' he gave to his editor Michael Pietsch was inspired by fractals, specifically the [[Sierpinski triangle]] (a.k.a. Sierpinski gasket), but that the edited novel is "more like a lopsided Sierpinsky Gasket".&lt;ref name="novel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw/bw960411david_foster_wallace |first=David Foster |last=Wallace |title=Bookworm on KCRW |publisher=Kcrw.com |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ion production capabilities ==

If a circle boundary is drawn around the two-dimensional view of a fractal, the fractal will never cross the boundary, this is due to the scaling of each successive iteration of the fractal being smaller. When fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the fractal increases, while the area will never exceed a certain value. A fractal in three-dimensional space is similar, however, a difference between fractals in two dimensions and three dimensions, is that a three dimensional fractal will increase in surface area, but never exceed a certain volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fractal.org/Bewustzijns-Besturings-Model/Fractals-Useful-Beauty.htm|title=Introduction to Fractal Geometry|website=www.fractal.org|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be utilized to maximize the efficiency of [[ion propulsion]], when choosing electron emitter construction and material. If done correctly, the efficiency of the emission process can be maximized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs21grc.html|title=NASA – Ion Propulsion|last=DeFelice|first=David|date=August 18, 2015|work=NASA|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco del Rincón''', [[Minim (religious order)|OM]] (29 January 1650 – 28 June 1723) was a [[Spain|Spanish]]-born [[Minim (religious order)|Minim]] [[friar]] and [[prelate]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in the [[New World]], in what is now the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]].

From 1705 to 1714, Rincón was [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], and was appointed Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Caracas|Caracas]] in 1714, but he declined to accept the position. In 1716, he was appointed Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bogotá|Santafé en Nueva Granada]] (now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bogotá|Archdiocese of Bogotá]]), where he served until his death in 1723. He also had political influence in the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], serving as President of the [[Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogotá|Royal Audience of Santafé de Bogotá]] from 1717 to 1718.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Rincón was born on 29 January 1650 in [[Borox]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/bogo0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Bogotá, Colombia|newspaper=GCatholic|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[University of Bologna]] in [[Italy]], where he graduated with a degree in [[theology]].

=== Priesthood ===
Rincón joined the [[Order of Minims]], where he held various leadership positions, including being the Provincial Superior of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]].

'''Genetics of aging''' is generally concerned with [[life extension]] associated with genetic alterations, rather than with [[Progeroid syndromes|accelerated aging disease]]s leading to reduction in lifespan.

The first [[mutation]] found to increase [[longevity]] in an animal was the ''age-1'' gene in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''. Michael Klass discovered that lifespan of ''C.&amp;nbsp;elegans'' could be altered by mutations, but Klass believed that the effect was due to reduced food consumption ([[calorie restriction]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Klass MR | title=A method for the isolation of longevity mutants in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and initial results | journal=MECHANISMS OF AGEING AND DEVELOPMENT  | volume=22 | issue=3-4 | year=1983 | pages=279–286 | id= | pmid=6632998 | doi=10.1016/0047-6374(83)90082-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Johnson later showed that [[life extension]] of up to 65% was due to the mutation itself rather than due to calorie restriction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman DB, Johnson TE | title=A mutation in the age-1 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans lengthens life and reduces hermaphrodite fertility | journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]  | volume=118 | issue=1 | year=1988 | pages=75–86  | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/118/1/75.long | format=[[PDF]] | pmc = 1203268 | id= | pmid=8608934}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he named the gene ''age-1'' in the expectation that other genes that control aging would be found. The ''age-1'' gene encodes the catalytic subunit of [[Class I PI 3-kinases|class-I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase]]&amp;nbsp;(PI3K).

A decade after Johnson's discovery ''[[daf-2]]'', one of the two genes that are essential for [[dauer larva]] formation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gottlieb S, Ruvkun G | title=daf-2, daf-16 and daf-23: genetically interacting genes controlling Dauer formation in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal=[[Genetics (journal)ÀGenetics]]  | volume=137 | issue=1 | year=1994 | pages=107–120  | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/137/1/107.long | pmc = 1205929 | id= | pmid=8056303}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shown by [[Cynthia Kenyon]] to double ''C.&amp;nbsp;elegans'' lifespan.&lt;ref name="pmid8247153"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kenyon C, Chang J, Gensch E, Rudner A, Tabtiang R | title=A C. elegans mutant that lives twice as long as wild type | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]  | volume=366 | issue=6454 | year=1993 | pages=461–464 | id= | pmid=8247153 | doi=10.1038/366461a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyon showed that the ''[[daf-2]]'' mutants, which would form dauers above {{Convert|25|C|K F|0}} would bypass the dauer state below {{Convert|20|C|K F|0}} with a doubling of lifespan.&lt;ref name="pmid8247153" /&gt; Prior to Kenyon's study it was commonly believed that lifespan could only be increased at the cost of a loss of reproductive capacity, but Kenyon's nematodes maintained youthful reproductive capacity as well as extended youth in general. Subsequent genetic modification (PI3K-null mutation) to ''C.&amp;nbsp;elegans'' was shown to extend [[maximum life span]] tenfold.&lt;ref name="pmid17996009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayyadevara S, Alla R, Thaden JJ, Shmookler Reis RJ | title=Remarkable longevity and stress resistance of nematode PI3K-null mutants | journal=Aging Cell | volume=7 | issue=1 | year=2008 | pages=13–22 | id= | pmid=17996009 | doi=10.1111/j.1474-9726.2007.00348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shmookler Reis RJ, Bharill P, Tazearslan C, Ayyadevara S | title=Extreme-longevity mutations orchestrate silencing of multiple signaling pathways | journal=[[Biochimica et Biophysica Acta]]  | volume=1790 | issue=10 | year=2009 | pages=1075–1083| doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.05.011 | pmc = 2885961 | id= | pmid=19465083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic modifications in other species have not achieved as great a lifespan extension as have been seen for ''C.&amp;nbsp;elegans''. ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' lifespan has been doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tatar M, Kopelman A, Epstein D, Tu MP, Yin CM, Garofalo RS | title=A mutant Drosophila insulin receptor homolog that extends life-span and impairs neuroendocrine function | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]  | volume=292 | issue=5514 | year=1988 | pages=107–110 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5514/107.long | id= | pmid=11292875 | doi=10.1126/science.1057987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic mutations in mice can increase maximum lifespan to 1.5&amp;nbsp;times normal, and up to 1.7&amp;nbsp;times normal when combined with [[calorie restriction]].&lt;ref name="pmid11719795"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartke A, Wright JC, Mattison JA, Ingram DK, Miller RA, Roth GS | title=Extending the lifespan of long-lived mice | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]  | volume=414 | issue=6862 | year=2001 | pages=412 | id= | pmid=11719795 | doi=10.1038/35106646| url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62803/1/414412a0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In yeast, [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]+-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2 is required for genomic silencing at three loci: the yeast mating [[locus (genetics)|loci]], the [[telomere]]s and the [[ribosomal DNA]] (rDNA). In some species of yeast, replicative aging may be partially caused by [[homologous recombination]] between rDNA repeats; [[excision (genetics)|excision]] of rDNA repeats results in the formation of [[extrachromosomal rDNA circle]]s (ERCs). These ERCs replicate and preferentially segregate to the mother cell during cell division, and are believed to result in cellular senescence by [[titration|titrating]] away (competing for) essential [[nucleotide|nuclear factors]]. ERCs have not been observed in other species (nor even all strains of the same yeast species) of yeast (which also display replicative senescence), and ERCs are not believed to contribute to aging in higher organisms such as humans (they have not been shown to accumulate in mammals in a similar manner to yeast). Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) has been found in worms, flies, and humans. The origin and role of eccDNA in aging, if any, is unknown.

Despite the lack of a connection between circular DNA and aging in higher organisms, extra copies of Sir2 are capable of extending the lifespan of both worms and flies (though, in flies, this finding has not been replicated by other investigators, and the activator of Sir2 [[resveratrol]] does not reproducibly increase lifespan in either species.&lt;ref name="resveratrol"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Bass TM |author2=Weinkove D |author3=Houthoofd K |author4=Gems D |author5=Partridge L |title=Effects of resveratrol on lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans |journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development |volume=128 |issue=10 |pages=546–52 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17875315 |doi=10.1016/j.mad.2007.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Whether the Sir2 homologues in higher organisms have any role in lifespan is unclear, but the human SIRT1 protein has been demonstrated to [[deacetylation|deacetylate]] [[p53]], Ku70, and the [[forkhead box proteins|forkhead]] family of [[transcription factor]]s. SIRT1 can also regulate acetylates such as [[p300-CBP coactivator family|CBP/p300]], and has been shown to deacetylate specific [[histone]] residues.

RAS1 and RAS2 also affect aging in yeast and have a human homologue. RAS2 overexpression has been shown to extend lifespan in yeast.

Other genes regulate aging in yeast by increasing the resistance to [[oxidative stress]]. [[Superoxide dismutase]], a [[protein]] that protects against the effects of [[mitochondria]]l free [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], can extend yeast lifespan in stationary phase when overexpressed.

In higher organisms, aging is likely to be regulated in part through the insulin/IGF-1 pathway. Mutations that affect [[Insulin-like growth factor|insulin-like signaling]] in worms, flies, and the growth hormone/IGF1 axis in mice are associated with extended lifespan. In yeast, Sir2 activity is regulated by the nicotinamidase PNC1. PNC1 is transcriptionally [[upregulation|upregulated]] under stressful conditions such as [[caloric restriction]], [[heat shock]], and [[osmotic shock]]. By converting [[nicotinamide]] to [[niacin]], nicotinamide is removed, inhibiting the activity of Sir2. A [[nicotinamidase]] found in humans, known as [[PBEF]], may serve a similar function, and a secreted form of PBEF known as [[visfatin]] may help to regulate serum [[insulin]] levels. It is not known, however, whether these mechanisms also exist in humans, since there are obvious differences in biology between humans and model organisms.

Sir2 activity has been shown to increase under calorie restriction. Due to the lack of available glucose in the cells, more NAD+ is available and can activate Sir2. [[Resveratrol]], a stilbenoid found in the skin of red [[grape]]s, was reported to extend the lifespan of yeast, worms, and flies (the lifespan extension in flies and worms have proved to be irreproducible by independent investigators&lt;ref name="resveratrol" /&gt;). It has been shown to activate Sir2 and therefore mimics the effects of calorie restriction, if one accepts that caloric restriction is indeed dependent on Sir2.

According to the GenAge database of aging-related genes, there are over 1800 genes altering lifespan in [[model organisms]]: 838 in the soil roundworm (''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''), 883 in the bakers' yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''), 170 in the fruit fly (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'') and 126 in the mouse (''[[Mus musculus]]'').&lt;ref name="GenAge" &gt;{{Cite web|title=GenAge database | url= http://genomics.senescence.info/genes/models.html | accessdate = 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ned Sharpless and collaborators demonstrated the first in vivo link between p16-expression and lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishnamurthy|first1=J|last2=Torrice|first2=C|last3=Ramsey|first3=MR|last4=Kovalev|first4=GI|last5=Al-Regaiey|first5=K|last6=Su|first6=L|last7=Sharpless|first7=NE|title=Ink4a/Arf expression is a biomarker of aging|journal=J.

Jan van Deursen and Darren Baker in collaboration with Andre Terzic at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Rochester, Minn., provided the first in vivo evidence for a causal link between cellular senescence and aging by preventing the accumulation of senescent cells in BubR1 progeroid mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baker DJ |author2=Dawlaty MM |author3=Wijshake T |author4=Jeganathan KB |author5=Malureanu L |author6=van Ree JH |author7=Crespo-Diaz R |author8=Reyes S |author9=Seaburg L |author10=Shapiro V |author11=Behfar A |author12=Terzic A |author13=van de Sluis B |author14=van Deursen JM | date = Jan 2013 | title = Increased expression of BubR1 protects against aneuploidy and cancer and extends healthy lifespan | url = | journal = Nat Cell Biol | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 96–102 | doi = 10.1038/ncb2643 | pmid = 23242215 |pmc=3707109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of senescent cells, the mice’s tissues showed a major improvement in the usual burden of age-related disorders. They did not develop [[cataracts]], avoided the usual wasting of muscle with age. They retained the fat layers in the skin that usually thin out with age and, in people, cause wrinkling. A second study led by Jan van Deursen in collaboration with a team of collaborators at the Mayo Clinic and Groningen University, provided the first direct in vivo evidence that cellular senescence causes signs of aging by eliminating senescent cells from progeroid mice by introducing a drug-inducible suicide gene and then treating the mice with the drug to kill senescent cells selectively, as opposed to decreasing whole body p16.&lt;ref name="cell removal"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baker, D. |author2=Wijshake, T. |author3=Tchkonia, T. |author4=LeBrasseur, N. |author5=Childs, B. |author6=van de Sluis, B. |author7=Kirkland, J. |author8=van Deursen, J. | date=10 November 2011 | title = Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders| journal =Nature | volume =479 |issue=7372 | pages =232–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature10600 | pmid=22048312 | pmc=3468323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Mayo study led by James Kirkland in collaboration with Scripps and other groups demonstrated that senolytics, drugs that target senescent cells, enhance cardiac function and improve vascular reactivity in old mice, alleviate gait disturbance caused by radiation in mice, and delay frailty, neurological dysfunction, and osteoporosis in progeroid mice. Discovery of senolytic drugs was based on a hypothesis-driven approach: the investigators leveraged the observation that senescent cells are resistant to apoptosis to discover that pro-survival pathways are up-regulated in these cells. They demonstrated that these survival pathways are the "Achilles heel" of senescent cells using RNA interference approaches, including Bcl-2-, AKT-, p21-, and tyrosine kinase-related pathways. They then used drugs known to target the identified pathways and showed these drugs kill senescent cells by apoptosis in culture and decrease senescent cell burden in multiple tissues in vivo. Importantly, these drugs had long term effects after a single dose, consistent with removal of senescent cells, rather than a temporary effect requiring continued presence of the drugs. This was the first study to show that clearing senescent cells enhances function in chronologically aged mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Y|last2=Tchkonia|first2=T|last3=Pirtskhalava|first3=T|last4=Gower|first4=AC|last5=Ding|first5=H|last6=Giorgadze|first6=N|last7=Palmer|first7=AK|last8=Ikeno|first8=Y|last9=Hubbard|first9=GB|last10=Lenburg|first10=M|last11=O'Hara|first11=SP|last12=LaRusso|first12=NF|last13=Miller|first13=JD|last14=Roos|first14=CM|last15=Verzosa|first15=GC|last16=LeBrasseur|first16=NK|last17=Wren|first17=JD|last18=Farr|first18=JN|last19=Khosla|first19=S|last20=Stout|first20=MB|last21=McGowan|first21=SJ|last22=Fuhrmann-Stroissnigg|first22=H|last23=Gurkar|first23=AU|last24=Zhao|first24=J|last25=Colangelo|first25=D|last26=Dorronsoro|first26=A|last27=Ling|first27=YY|last28=Barghouthy|first28=AS|last29=Navarro|first29=DC|last30=Sano|first30=T|last31=Robbins|first31=PD|last32=Niedernhofer|first32=LJ|last33=Kirkland|first33=JL|authorlink12=Nicholas F.

'''Gottlieb Fluhmann''' (c. 1837 - c. 1892) was a reclusive [[cattle]] [[ranch]]er in [[Park County, Colorado]], whose mysterious disappearance was not resolved until 1944. Even then it was impossible more than a half-century later to determine what had caused his death.

==Ranching background==
A native of [[Switzerland]], Fluhmann was 5'4" in stature and spoke in broken [[English language|English]]. He came to the [[United States]] in the early 1860s. Making his way west to Colorado seeking gold, he settled in the Puma Hills north of [[Lake George, Colorado|Lake George]] in Park County "a beautiful [[log cabin]] at the edge of a lush, spring-fed [[meadow]]." Five large windows offered a scenic view. The floor of his cabin was made of planks. Sanded boards lined the inside walls. There were built-in cabinets and molding around the ceiling.&lt;ref name=parkco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cozine.com/1999-march/pioneers-of-the-colorado-parks-by-richard-barth/|title=Richard Barth, ''Pioneers of the Colorado Parks – North, Middle, and South Parks from 1850 to 1900''|publisher=cozine.com|accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Few people ever visited Fluhmann, who was considered "a suspicious, argumentative, and flighty old man with almost no friends and no relatives" nearer than [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where he had a niece, Alice Fluhmann. A nephew, John Fluhmann, lived in [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]] in [[Gunnison County, Colorado|Gunnison County]] in western Colorado.&lt;ref name=vandusen/&gt; With his loyal mongrel dog, Fluhmann checked his cattle daily, armed with an 1886 [[.38]]-caliber [[Marlin Firearms|Marlin rifle]] attached to his saddle and a [[.45]]-caliber pistol under his coat. Fluhmann believed that he was a victim of cattle thieves, but he was unable to stop the [[rustling]].&lt;ref name=parkco/&gt; He even treated his cattle like personal pets.&lt;ref name=restlessnative/&gt;
 
Fluhmann built another domicile a mile away in a cave of a high rock cleft, from which he could watch for rustlers or other strangers who might approach his land, but no one knew of this outpost. Neighbors reported Fluhmann missing. A search party, including the nephew, was organized. Fluhmann was declared dead in 1894, probably one or two years after his death. His remains had not yet been found, but Fluhmann's estate was [[Probate court|probated]].&lt;ref name=parkco/&gt; He left behind "a fine ranch and a thousand head of cattle."&lt;ref&gt;''Colorado Democrat'', [[Buena Vista, Colorado|Buena Vista]], [[Colorado]], May 15, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; The administrator of the estate reported having sold 166 head of cattle in the spring of 1893. There was no explanation for the other cattle.&lt;ref name=vandusen/&gt;

==Finding the body==
In 1944, a hunter on military leave, [[United States Army]] Master Sgt. Francis V. Brahler (1907-2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billiongraves.com/pages/record/FrancisVBrahler/3965630|title=Francis V. Brahler|publisher=billiongraves.com|accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Brahler is interred in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania|Pottstown]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;/ref&gt; then at [[Peterson Air Force Base|Peterson Field]], accidentally found Fluhmann's long-forgotten cave-cabin. Brahler entered through a window and found Fluhmann's possessions undisturbed and in excellent condition. The body was near the center of the cabin, as were remains of the dog. The Marlin rifle, ready for firing, was also there. The burial site of the skeleton is unknown. The mystery of what happened to the rancher continues.&lt;ref name=parkco/&gt;

''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph]]'' reported that Brahler 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
spotted the old window frame on the ledge and upon investigating, found the cave entrance. The big dishpan was still suspended with the letters, pipes, and other items, including two gold inlaid [[flintlock]]s. He took many of the items back with him to his campsite and returned the next day. This time he found a human skull and the bones of what appeared to be the skull of a dog.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph]]'', November 1, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were reports of suicide. A newspaper article in 1893 in ''The Flume'' in the [[county seat]] of [[Fairplay, Colorado|Fairplay]] reported that Fluhmann had "remarked to different parties that he would kill himself [and that] when he did disappear, they would never be able to find him."&lt;ref&gt;''The Flume'', [[Fairplay, Colorado|Fairplay]], Colorado, April 20, 1893&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fluhmann had reportedly quarreled with [[Benjamin Ratcliff]], a rancher who lived thirty miles away in the Tarryall Valley. Author Midge Harbour in her 1982 book ''The Tarryall Mountains and the Puma Hills: A History,'' espouses the view that Ratcliff hunted down Fluhmann until he found the cave-cabin, where he shot Fluhmann dead without warning. Harbour proposes a scenario by which Ratcliff demeaned Fluhmann in a saloon, having claimed then to be eating tasty beef from Fluhmann's stock. The Ratcliff children then taunted Fluhmann.&lt;ref name=restlessnative&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tri-lakestribune.net/stories/Gottlieb-Fluhmanns-ghost-and-Ratcliff-side-of-the-story,66720|title=Rob Carrigan, Gottlieb Fluhmann's ghost and Ratcliff side of the story, October 27, 2012|publisher=trilakestribune.net|accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Pikes Peak Backcountry: The Historic Saga of the Peak’s West Slope'' (1999), Celinda Kaelin asserts that Fluhmann conceived his cave-cabin as an emergency plan to protect himself from outsiders. Kaelin explains her theory:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When Fluhmann first disappeared, everyone, including the local sheriff assumed he had returned to Switzerland. But not Ratcliff. He knew his prey would never leave his beloved animals unattended. When the cattle still appeared well-cared-for after several months, Ratcliff began a systematic search for the little foreigner. He eventually discovered the cave one evening after months of searching. Ratcliff waited on the ledge above the cave until early the next morning. As Fluhmann cautiously opened the heavy door to greet the new day, Ratcliff fired sending a fatal bullet through the stock of Fluhmann’s gun and into his chest. He then climbed down to his victim and dragged him back into the cave.&lt;ref name=restlessnative/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Surviving Ratcliff family members dispute the claim that Ratcliff murdered Fluhmann. They even question whether Ratcliff knew Fluhmann and cite "exaggerated local commentary and inaccurate facts ... without proof."&lt;ref name=restlessnative/&gt; 

In 1895, Ratcliff murdered three school board members, one of whom had reportedly spread false rumors of Ratcliff's alleged incestuous relationship with an older daughter.&lt;ref name=restlessnative/&gt; Within a year, he was [[Hanging|hanged]] at the [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] at [[Cañon City, Colorado|Cañon City]]. Despite the theories advanced in the Harbour and Kaelin books, Ratcliff had not been an initial suspect when Fluhmann went missing and was never charged in the disappearance.&lt;ref name=vandusen&gt;Laura King Van Dusen, "Gottlieb Fluhmann: Disappeared from Lake George Area in 1892; Remains, Including Valuable Possessions, Discovered in Remote Cave in 1944", ''Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past'' ([[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]]: The History Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-62619-161-7}}, pp. 107-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is that Fluhmann could have suffocated from warming or cooking inside the cave-cabin without proper [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. This could explain the neat condition of the domicile.&lt;ref name=vandusen/&gt;

{{Campaignbox Coal Wars}}
The '''Herrin massacre''' took place on June 21-22, 1922 in [[Herrin, Illinois]], in a coal mining area during a nationwide strike by the [[United Mine Workers|United Mineworkers of America]] (UMWA). Although the owner of the mine originally agreed with the union to observe the strike, when the price of coal went up, he hired non-union workers to produce and ship out coal, as he had high debt in start-up costs. 

Enraged that the owner had disregarded their agreement, on June 21, union miners shot at the strikebreakers going to work, where the mine had armed guards. When striking union members armed themselves and laid siege to the mine, the owner's guards shot and killed three white union miners in an exchange of gunfire. 

The next day, union miners killed superintendent McDowell and 18 of 50 strikebreakers and mine guards, many of them brutally. A twentieth victim from the non-union group was later murdered, bringing the death total to 23.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Paul M. Angle, ''Bloody Williamson: A Chapter in American Lawlessness'', University of Illinois Press, 1992, p. 24-26, 42 {{ISBN|978-0252062339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fliege"/&gt;

==Historical background==
On April 1, 1922 the [[United Mine Workers of America]] (UMWA) began a nationwide strike. W. J. Lester, owner of the Southern Illinois Coal Company, operated a [[strip mine]] about halfway between [[Herrin, Illinois|Herrin]] and [[Marion, Illinois]]. Lester at first complied with the strike. 

As he had only recently opened the mine, he had massive startup debts and was willing to negotiate with the UMWA to allow his mine to remain open, as long as no [[coal]] was shipped out. Under the agreement, some United Mine Workers members were allowed to continue working during the strike. Lester told an associate that local union leaders were friendly with him; however, he was warned this did not mean he had any control over the ordinary members.&lt;ref&gt;Angle, ''Bloody Williamson'', 1992, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

By June, Lester's miners had dug out nearly 60,000 tons of coal. [[Strike action|Strike]]-driven shortages drove up demand and the price of coal, and Lester figured he could make a $250,000 profit if he sold his coal. He decided to violate the agreement he had made with the union. When the UMWA members working for him objected, he fired all the union workers.&lt;ref name="wieck"/&gt; 

Lester brought in mine guards and 50 [[strikebreaker]]s, who were vilified as "scabs" by the union men. They had been recruited by employment agencies in [[Chicago]]. On June 16, 1922, he shipped out sixteen [[railroad cars]] filled with coal. Testimony later revealed that his mine guards possessed machine guns. They aggressively searched passers-by, and "they frighten women, they boast and are hard-boiled."&lt;ref&gt;Briton Hadden, "Henry Robinson Luce", ''Time'', 30 December 1922, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escalation==
Lester, responding to a reporter's questions, said his steam shovel operators and the railroad workers were members of their respective unions. [[John L. Lewis]], president of the UMWA, responded in a telegram on June 20. He called the Steam Shovelmen's Union an "outlaw organization" that had also provided strikebreakers elsewhere. UMWA members, he said, "are justified in treating this crowd as an outlaw organization and in viewing its members in the same light as they do any other common strikebreakers."{{cn|date=April 2015}}

There was confusion and disagreement between Lewis and William J. Tracy, representative of District No. 1, International Brotherhood of Steam Shovel and Dredgemen (IBSSD). In a widely publicized statement, Lewis said that two representatives of the UMWA had contacted the IBSSD, but "have failed to secure any satisfaction."&lt;ref name="New York Times, June 23, 1922"&gt;''New York Times'', 23 June 1922&lt;/ref&gt; He did note that the Steam Shovel union had been suspended from the [[American Federation of Labor]], to which the United Mine Workers also belonged. Lewis claimed that the IBSSD was also strikebreaking in Ohio. 

Tracy responded that though he had sent four individuals to the Herrin site when requested by the owner, they turned away when they saw the guards. He said that no one from his organization was working in Herrin.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 24 June 1922&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy also criticized the UMWA for not communicating adequately about the situation.&lt;ref name="New York Times, June 23, 1922"/&gt; 

It is unclear if Lester was telling the truth, or if he had contacted the IBSSD to disguise the use of non-union workers. To Lewis, it did not matter. Lester's workers were not UMWA members, and the UMWA claimed sole jurisdiction over all coal miners.

Lewis' message was printed in newspapers, and miners throughout the region decided to take action. Early in the morning on June 21, a truck carrying Lester's guards and strikebreakers was ambushed near [[Carbondale, Illinois]] on its way to his mine. Three men were wounded and six others jumped into the river to escape.&lt;ref name="fliege"&gt;Stu Fliege, ''Tales and Trails of Illinois'', University of Illinois Press, 2002, pp. 180-81&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lois A. Carrier, ''Illinois: Crossroads of a Continent'', University of Illinois Press, 1998, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day several hundred union miners rallied in the Herrin cemetery. Lewis' message was read to the crowd, enraging them further. 

The union miners marched into Herrin and looted the hardware store of its firearms and ammunition. At about 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., they surrounded Lester's mine. Lester's guards opened fire, killing two of the UMWA members and mortally wounding a third.&lt;ref name="wieck"&gt;David Thoreau Wieck, ''Woman from Spillertown: A Memoir of Agnes Burns Wieck'', SIU Press, 1992, pp. 82-84&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Writers' Project]], Illinois, ''Illinois: A Descriptive and Historical Guide'', A.C. McClurg &amp; Company, Chicago, 1939, p. 453&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Siege==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
The mine superintendent, C.K. McDowell, called National Guard Col. Hunter to tell him the mine was surrounded and being fired upon. McDowell said he could not reach County Sheriff Thaxton, and pleaded for troops. Col. Hunter called Thaxton's deputy and told him to ask the [[Illinois National Guard]] [[Adjutant General]] for troops and to get out to the mine with as many men as possible to stop the attack and break up the mob action.

Thaxton's men did nothing. Hunter contacted the adjutant general himself and convinced him to mobilize troops. Lester, who had left the area several days earlier, was reached by phone in Chicago. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he agreed to close the mine for the remainder of the nationwide UMWA strike. 

Hunter and a citizens' group laid out a plan to get a truce in place — telephoning superintendent McDowell to tell him to raise a [[white flag]], and asking the UMWA sub-district vice president, Fox Hughes, to go to the mine and do the same. The method of getting the guards and nearly 50 strikebreakers safely out of the mine was to be worked out later.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Herrin Massacre|last=Doody|first=Scott|publisher=lulu.com|year=2013|isbn=978-1-300-89792-7|location=|pages=65-66, 67-68, 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Superintendent McDowell later reported by phone that the shooting had died down, Hunter and the citizens' group were optimistic that a disaster would be avoided. They decided the National Guard troops were not needed after all. Hughes went to the mine with a white flag, but he never took it out or raised it. He later said he had not seen McDowell raise a white flag, so he decided Lester's men had not lived up to the bargain. He went home and did nothing, later claiming he learned that his boss in the UMWA leadership, Hugh Willis, was now involved and decided his role was finished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the evening, more union supporters stole guns and ammunition, and made their way to the [[strip mine]]. McDowell was to have called Hunter when the truce took effect. When Col. Hunter tried to telephone the mine, he found the phone lines had been cut. No law enforcement officers went to the mine, no government officials accompanied Hughes to ensure the white flags were raised, and no troops were activated by the National Guard despite repeated signs that Thaxton could not be counted on to act. No action was taken to enforce a truce.

Late in the evening of June 21, Sheriff Thaxton reluctantly agreed to go to the mine to ensure the truce was carried out, and the superintendent and strikebreakers were given safe passage. Despite being urged to go immediately, he claimed he needed to rest. Thaxton promised to meet Hunter and Major Davis of the Carbondale National Guard company at the sheriff's office at 6 a.m. the following morning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

That evening, Hugh Willis, the local UMWA leader, spoke to union supporters in Herrin. Willis said of the strikebreakers: "God damn them, they ought to have known better than to come down here; but now that they're here, let them take what's coming to them." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gunfire continued throughout the night, and the mob began destroying equipment to prevent the mine from reopening. They used hammers, shovels, and dynamite to wreck the [[dragline]]s and bulldozers, while keeping the strikebreakers pinned down inside coal cars and behind barricades.

==Surrender==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2015}}
The strikebreakers sent out a mine guard, Bernard Jones, with an apron tied to a broomstick. Jones told the mob the men would surrender if their safety would be guaranteed. He was told, "Come on out and we'll get you out of the county."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The nearly 50 strikebreakers, guards and superintendent McDowell did as they were told, and the union miners began marching them all to Herrin, five miles away. After about a half mile, the strikebreakers encountered more men waiting at Crenshaw Crossing. One of them shouted, "The only way to free the county of strikebreakers is to kill them all off and stop the breed!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carrier |first1=Lois |title=Illinois: Crossroads of a Continent |date=1998 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=9780252068089 |page=203 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HE1sFuiKX8C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=%22The+only+way+to+free+the+county+of+strikebreakers+is+to+kill+them+all+off+and+stop+the+breed!%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nq6i-e8cON&amp;sig=Dw1BJ7M-H0G_QHfp2arK3tjhnv4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjvueKguNneAhVHrVMKHdXhDd4Q6AEwAHoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20only%20way%20to%20free%20the%20county%20of%20strikebreakers%20is%20to%20kill%20them%20all%20off%20and%20stop%20the%20breed!%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mob grew more agitated and violent as the procession of prisoners continued. Some struck the strikebreakers with the butts of their rifles and shotguns.

==Chase and massacre==
{{Refimprove|section|date=June 2016}}
By about half mile past Crenshaw Crossing at Moake Crossing, superintendent McDowell was already bloodied and limping, unable to walk any further. A union man told him, "I'm going to kill you and use you for bait to catch the other men."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

He and another man grabbed McDowell and led him down a side road. Gunshots were heard, and the rest were forced to continue toward Herrin. A farmer later discovered McDowell's body. He had been shot four times – twice in the stomach, and once each in the chest and head.  A car drove up to the procession, and a man came out whom some said they overheard being called "Hugh Willis" and "the president." According to the accounts of surviving captives, Willis said, "Listen, don't you go killing these fellows on a public highway. There are too many women and children and witnesses around to do that. Take them over in the woods and give it to them. Kill all you can."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The strikebreakers were taken into the woods, where they reached a barbed wire fence. They were told to run for their lives. A union man shouted, "Let's see how fast you can run between here and Chicago, you damned gutter-bums!"{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The mob opened fire as they ran. Many of the non-union men were caught in the fence and shot dead. Others, making it over the fence but not knowing where they were, ran through Harrison's Woods toward Herrin, a mile further north. One strikebreaker was caught and hanged, and three more were shot to death at his feet. The assistant superintendent of the mine was still alive but unconscious. A union man noticed and shot him in the head. The chase continued into the morning of the 22nd.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Six men were shot and killed outside Smith's Garage in the town.&lt;ref name="graves"&gt;[http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20131115/news/711159858/ Associated Press, "Illinois cemetery search finds 1922 massacre victims"], ''Daily Herald'', 15 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six strikebreakers were recaptured and ordered to remove their shirts and shoes. They were told to crawl to Herrin Cemetery.&lt;ref name="Point of Beginning"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pobonline.com/articles/97208-team-uses-scanning-to-uncover-herrin-massacre|title= Team Uses Scanning to Uncover Herrin Massacre|last=Di Naso|first=Steven M.|date=January 19, 2014|work=Point of Beginning Magazine|publisher= BNP Media|at=Surveying History|accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By noon a crowd of about 1,000 spectators had gathered at the cemetery. They watched as the strikebreakers were roped together, and union men took turns beating and shooting them.  They were also urinated upon. Those still alive at the end had their throats cut by a union man with a pocketknife. Townspeople came to watch and taunt the dead and dying along the route to the cemetery. A reporter tried to give a dying man some water and was told that if he did, "he wouldn't live to see the next day."&lt;ref name="Point of Beginning"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Sheriff Thaxton had failed to meet Col. Hunter and Major Davis at his office at 6 a.m. as promised; he finally showed up at 8 a.m. By then Hunter and Davis had already heard rumors of the violence against the strikebreakers. When the three finally arrived at the mine, what remained of the operation was in flames, and they learned the mob had left three hours earlier.

When they traced the steps of the mob, they found the grisly evidence of the dead, dying, and wounded. Men with injuries were taken to Dr. J. Taylor Black's Herrin Hospital. In total, 19 of the 50 strikebreakers died during the [[massacre]], and another was murdered shortly after. Three union miners had been shot and killed during the siege of the strip mine the first day, bringing the total number of victims to 23.

The dead strikebreakers were laid out in the Dillard Building in downtown Herrin. Most of the town turned out to look at them. Some gazed quietly, others cursed and spat on the bodies. Sixteen of the 19 strikebreakers killed in the action were buried in the [[potter's field]] area of Herrin Cemetery on June 25, 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/image/2015/06/20/Coal-Miners-Remembered-1.jpg Listing of 17 killed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151226134507/http://www.herrinmassacre.com/funeralrecords.html Herrin Victims funeral records]&lt;/ref&gt; A seventeenth victim was buried in October 1922 after he died following unsuccessful surgery for injuries incurred in the violence.&lt;ref name="ends"/&gt; Thousands attended the funerals of the three union miners who were shot and died at the beginning of the siege.

The nation reacted to the massacre with disgust. One newspaper editorial said "Herrin, Illinois should be ostracized. Shut off from all communication with the outside world and the people there left to soak in the blood they have spilled."{{cn|date=April 2015}} President [[Warren Harding]] characterized it as a "shocking crime, barbarity, butchery, rot and madness."{{cn|date=April 2015}} Others also compared the people of Herrin to the alleged behavior of German troops during [[World War I]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}

Lester, whose double-dealing had set the tragic events into motion, made a significant profit when the union bought his mine at "a handsome price" in order to avoid lawsuits.&lt;ref name="wieck"/&gt;

==The trials==
At first, the inquest held by the coroner concluded that all the strikebreakers were killed by unknown individuals, and stated that "the deaths of the decedents were due to the acts direct and indirect of the officials of the Southern Illinois Coal Company." He recommended that the company and its officers be investigated in order to affix appropriate responsibility on them. 

Two trials were held, the first on November 7, 1922, and the second in the winter of 1923. Only six men were  indicted for the massacre, and the first two trials ended in acquittals for all the defendants. &lt;!-- Were they union men? --&gt;The prosecution gave up and dismissed the remaining indictments. Otis Clark was the first man to be tried on a total of 214 charges. Two years later, Clark was shot and killed by an unknown assailant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another of the accused died in a mine accident.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

A Williamson County [[grand jury]] investigating the incident faulted the Southern Illinois Coal Company for introducing strike breakers and armed guards, and for committing illegal activities such as closing public highways. It criticized the state administration for refusing to take necessary measures once the trouble had begun.&lt;ref name="Herbert David Croly 1922, page 132"&gt;Herbert David Croly, ''The New Republic'', Volume 32, The Republic Pub. Co., 1922, page 132&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert David Croly of ''The New Republic'' criticized the state of Illinois for allowing the [[Illinois Chamber of Commerce]] to fund the investigation.&lt;ref name="Herbert David Croly 1922, page 132"/&gt; 

Croly described the retaliation for the deaths of two strikers (the third had been mortally wounded) as "atrocious". He noted that while the union miners were likely to escape punishment for killing the African-American strikebreakers, officials who have harmed strikers—such as Major Patrick Hamrock of the Colorado National Guard at [[Ludlow Massacre|Ludlow]], or Wheeler after [[Bisbee Deportation|Bisbee]]—likewise frequently escaped justice.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert David Croly, ''The New Republic'', Volume 32, The Republic Pub. Co., 1922, pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Croly noted that the local government was sympathetic to the union, as was public sentiment. He said that under such circumstances, the union had a responsibility to police its own members.&lt;ref name="Herbert David Croly 1922, page 132"/&gt;

== Missing graves of massacre victims discovered ==
In November 2013, eight missing graves of massacre victims were discovered by a research team led by Steven Di Naso, Eastern Illinois University geologist; and Scott Doody, author and historian. By October 2015, the team had determined the last eight graves of victims from the Herrin Massacre. Following the events of June 21-22, 1922, 16 of the victims had been buried in unmarked graves in the potter's field area of Herrin Cemetery. The other three had been claimed by family members after their murders. A seventeenth victim was buried there after he died in October 1922, from injuries suffered during the massacre. &lt;ref name="memorial"/&gt; For nearly a century, exact burial locations of the victims had been lost. The discovery of the graves provided conclusive answers to the whereabouts of these victims. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20131115/news/711159858/|title="Illinois cemetery search finds 1922 massacre victims"|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2013|work=Daily Herald|access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also documented that families had arranged for the remains of five victims to be removed from these graves and reinterred in their hometowns.&lt;ref name="memorial"/&gt;

Following the discovery of the unmarked graves, the city erected a monument in June 2015 at the potter's field area of the Herrin cemetery to recognize and memorialize the 17 massacre victims who were buried here.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thesouthern.com/news/local/herrin-massacre-memorialized-with-monument/article_7f536a9f-636b-55c0-8b7b-ec0fc7796e7e.html|title="Herrin Massacre Memorialized with Monument"|last=Mariano|first=Nick|date=June 10, 2015|work=The Southern Illinoisan|access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, the city announced that it was ending any more excavations associated with the Herrin massacre project. If family of a victim wanted exploration, they would have to make a specific request to the city council. The research team was satisfied that they have been able to identify the 17 persons buried at the Herrin cemetery from the massacre.&lt;ref name="ends"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thesouthern.com/news/local/communities/herrin/digging-ends-at-herrin-cemetery/article_f6fc41a7-9e83-591c-a091-2dfe7f188b3a.html|title="Digging ends at Herrin Cemetery"|last=Parker|first=Molly|date=Nov 3, 2015|work=The Southern Illinoisan|access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heterospory''' is the production of [[spores]] of two different sizes and sexes by the [[sporophyte |sporophytes]] of [[land plants]]. The smaller of these, the [[microspore]], is male and the larger [[megaspore]] is female.

(1966) The origin and development of heterospory in vascular plants. Chapter 9 in ''Trends in Plant morphogenesis'', ed. by E.G. Cutter, Longmans.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of Heterospory ==

Heterospory developed due to natural selection pressures that encouraged an increase in [[propagule]] size.{{explain|date=April 2017}} This may first have led to an increase in spore size and ultimately resulted in the species producing larger megaspores as well as smaller microspores.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haig|first=David|last2=Westoby|first2=Mark|date=1989-11-01|title=Selective forces in the emergence of the seed habit|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1989.tb01576.x/abstract|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=215–238|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1989.tb01576.x|issn=1095-8312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterospory evolved from [[homospory]] many times, but the species in which it first appeared are now extinct. Heterosporic plants that produce [[seeds]] are their most successful and widespread descendants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Spermatophyte|Seed plants]] constitute the largest subsection of heterosporic plants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Microspores and Megaspores ==

'''Microspores''' are [[haploid]] spores that in endosporic species contain the male gametophyte, which is carried to the megaspores by wind, water currents or animal vectors. Microspores are nearly all nonflagellated, and are therefore not capable of active movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology of Plants|last=Raven|first=Peter H.|last2=Evert|first2=Ray F.|last3=Eichhorn|first3=Susan E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The morphology of the microspore consists of an outer double walled structures surrounding the dense cytoplasm and central nucleus.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.preservearticles.com/2012032128330/structure-of-microspores-and-the-development-of-male-gametophyte-germination-of-microspores.html|title=Structure of Microspores and the Development of Male Gametophyte (= germination of Microspores)|last=Ray|first=Ankita|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Megaspores''' contain the female gametophytes in heterosporic plant species. They develop archegonia that produce egg cells that are fertilized by sperm of the male gametophyte  originating from the microspore. This results in the formation of a fertilized diploid [[zygote]], that develops into the sporophyte embryo. While heterosporous plants produce fewer megaspores, they are significantly larger than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[glossary of botanical terms#exospory|exosporic]] species, the smaller spores germinate into free-living male [[gametophytes]] and the larger spores germinate into free-living [[female]] gametophytes. In [[glossary of botanical terms#endospory|endosporic]] species, the gametophytes of both sexes are very highly reduced and contained within the spore wall. The microspores of both exosporic and endosporic species are free-sporing, distributed by wind, water or animal vectors, but in endosporic species the megaspores and the megagametophyte contained within are retained and nurtured by the sporophyte phase. Endosporic species are thus usually [[monoicous|dioecious]], a condition that promotes [[monoicous#Role in survival|outcrossing]]. Some exosporic species produce micro- and megaspores in the same [[sporangium]], a condition known as homoangy, while in others the micro- and megaspores are produced in separate sporangia (heterangy). These may both be borne on the same [[Plant reproductive morphology|monoecious]] sporophyte or on different sporophytes in dioicous species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reproduction ==

Heterospory was a key event in the evolution of both fossil and surviving plants. The retention of megaspores and the dispersal of microspores allow for both dispersal and establishment reproductive strategies. This adaptive ability of heterospory increases reproductive success as any type of environment favors having these two strategies. Heterospory stops self-fertilization from occurring in a gametophyte, but does not stop two gametophytes that originated from the same sporophyte from mating.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Kurt B.|last2=Burd|first2=Martin|date=2016-10-01|title=Why did heterospory evolve?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12304/abstract|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/brv.12304|issn=1469-185X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specific type of self-fertilization is termed as sporophytic selfing, and it occurs most commonly among [[angiosperms]]. While heterospory stops extreme inbreeding from occurring, it does not prevent inbreeding altogether as sporophytic selfing can still occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A complete model for the origin of heterospory, known as the Haig-Westoby model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haig|first=David|last2=Westoby|first2=Mark|title=A model for the origin of heterospory|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519388802030|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=134|issue=2|pages=257–272|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(88)80203-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; establishes a connection between minimum spore size and successful reproduction of bisexual gametophytes. For the female function, as minimum spore size increases so does the chance for successful reproduction. For the male function, reproductive success does not change as the minimum spore size increases.

'''Ivane Abashidze''' ({{lang-ka|ივანე აბაშიძე}}; died 12 December 1822) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] nobleman of the [[Abashidze]] family and a claimant to the [[Kingdom of Imereti|throne of Imereti]] during the revolt against the [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Russian rule]] in 1820. He was murdered in exile in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

== Family background == 
Ivane Abashidze came from one of the leading noble Georgian families, which had once attained, in the person of [[George VI of Imereti|Giorgi–Malakia Abashidze]], to the crown of the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti from 1702 to 1707. His father was Prince Kaikhosro Abashidze (died 1810) and his mother was Princess Darejan (1756–1827), a daughter of King [[Solomon I of Imereti]], whom Kaikhosro wed in 1768.

== Political career ==
Ivane Abashidze's involvement in politics was associated with the anti-Russian revolt in Imereti from 1819 to 1820. Imereti had been absorbed by Russia in 1810 and the former kingdom had been in a renewed rebellion by 1819. In 1820, Ivane—hitherto a "loyal" Russian subject—was nominated, by virtue of being Solomon I's grandson, as a king of Imereti by one of the rebel noble parties, dominated by the Abashidze clan. Overwhelmed by the Russian troops, Abashidze fled to [[Kaikhosro IV Gurieli|Kaikhosro Gurieli]], an uncle of his wife, in the [[Principality of Guria]], whose many nobles also joined the Imeretian rebellion. The Russian colonel Puzirevsky, sent in Guria to enforce the surrender of the fugitive pretender, was killed. Abashidze and the Gurians then carried operations into Imereti and finally entrenched themselves in the Khani gorge. In July 1820, the Russians under General Velyaminov occupied the gorge and then overran Guria. Ivane Abashidze's family were rounded up, but he escaped capture by the Russians and fled to the Ottoman territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rayfield|author-link=Donald Rayfield|first=Donald|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|year=2012|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1780230303|pages = 276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Darejan, was arrested and deported to Russia. She would outlive her son and die in [[Moscow]] in 1827. In the meantime, the loyal prince-regnant of Guria, [[Mamia V Gurieli]], successfully negotiated the return of Ivane's Gurian wife and his children from the road to their exile in Russia.&lt;ref name="akaki"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nplg.gov.ge/gsdl/cgi-bin/library.exe?e=d-00000-00---off-0vertwo--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-ka-50---20-about---00-3-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=vertwo&amp;cl=CL1.25.1&amp;d=HASH0165bab210801ef4f5665187 | title=ჩემი თავგადასავალი | publisher=National Parliamentary Library of Georgia | date=1894–1908 | accessdate=30 June 2013 | author=Tsereteli, Akaki | language=Georgian |trans-title=My Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Ivane Abashidze was murdered near the Ottoman-controlled town of [[Akhaltsikhe]], in 1822, allegedly at the instigation of [[Prince Vakhtang of Imereti (died 1850)|Prince Vakhtang]], a scion of the Imeretian royals, also an anti-Russian rebel and pretender to the throne of Imereti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khomeriki|first=Manana|script-title=იმერეთის დე იურე მეფე ვახტანგ ბაგრატიონი|trans-title=De Jure King of Imereti Vakhtang Bagrationi|year=2012|publisher=Universali|location=Tbilisi|isbn=978-9941-17-655-5|page=20|url=http://dspace.nplg.gov.ge/bitstream/1234/11412/1/Bagrationi_Vaxtang.pdf|language=ka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and descendants == 
Ivane Abashidze was married to Princess Elisabed, a daughter of [[Simon II Gurieli]], Prince of Guria. They had two sons, Kaikhosro and Giorgi, and a daughter, Ekaterine. Ekaterine eventually married Prince Rostom Tsereteli and became the mother of the popular Georgian writer [[Akaki Tsereteli]].&lt;ref name="akaki"/&gt;

Townshend was the son of [[Lord John Townshend]], younger son of [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend]]. His mother was Georgiana Anne Poyntz. He served in the [[Royal Navy]] and achieved the rank of [[Rear-Admiral]]. Between 1847 and 1855 he also sat as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]]. In the latter year he succeeded his first cousin in the marquessate and entered the [[House of Lords]].

Lord Townshend married Elizabeth Jane Crichton-Stuart, daughter of [[Lord George Stuart]], younger son of [[John Crichton-Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute]], on 18 August 1825. They had five children:

*Lady Audrey Jane Charlotte Townshend (d. 1926), married firstly, Greville Howard, son of [[Charles Howard, 17th Earl of Suffolk]] and had issue. She married secondly, General [[Redvers Henry Buller]].
*James Dudley Browlow Stuart Townshend (d. 1846), unmarried
*Anne Maria Townshend (d. 1899), married Alexander Sherson

'''Josefa Loazia''', also more commonly known as "Juanita"or "Josefa Segovia", was a Mexican-American woman who was executed by hanging in [[Downieville, California]] on July 5, 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The California Crucible: Frontier narratives and the lynching of Josefa Segovia|last=Ochoa|first=Oscar|publisher=California State University|year=2015|isbn=
|location=Dominguez Hills, CA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was found guilty of murdering a man, Frederick Cannon, who attempted to assault her. She is known to be the first and only woman to be hanged in California.&lt;ref name=gutierrez&gt;Gutierrez, Margo, and Matt S. Meier. ''Encyclopedia of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement''. Greenwood, 2000. Print. p. 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt; Many discrepancies exist regarding the circumstances of her death. Josefa's death has many connections and relevancy to the larger history of Latina/os in the United States because it shows how her racial status affected perception of her and how devalued the life of a Mexican American woman was. Josefa's death highlights the discrimination and violence against Latinos in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Upon the end of the [[Mexican–American War]], the discovery of gold in California, and the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], life for Mexicans in what had become the United States was changed completely. They lost their property, political power, and their culture was deemed worthless &lt;ref name=navarro&gt;Navarro, Marysa, Gwendolyn Mink, and Gloria Steinem. ''The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History''. Reprint Edition. Mariner Books , 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They became segregated and did not have opportunities for advancement. This discrimination affected and applied to both rich and poor Mexicans.&lt;ref name=navarro /&gt; In [[Anglo]] journals and other media, Mexican women were depicted as flashy and morally deviant "sirens".&lt;ref name=navarro /&gt; This is apparent in how Josefa's story was presented in Anglo media. In complete disregard of her identity, she came to be known as "Juanita" after her death, a stereotypical name for a Mexican woman.

== Early life and controversy about her name ==
Not much is known about the early life of Josefa Loaiza. The date of her birth is unknown.&lt;ref name=blea&gt;Blea, Irene I. ''U.S. Chicanas and Latinas Within a Global Context: Women of Color at the Fourth World Women's Conference''. Praeger, 1997. 89–90. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; Josefa Segovia's true name has been a topic of great debate among historians and scholars. Before the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, most male scholars contended that Josefa had no recorded last name. For example, in Gordon Young's ''Days of 49'', he says that her name was "Juanita".&lt;ref name=young /&gt; Bancroft also uses the name Juanita, although his use of it suggests that it is not the correct name. Throughout his account of the events at Downieville he refers to Segovia as either "The Mexican" or "the little woman" only assigning her a name during his description of her trial. This lack of any name for her for much of the account suggests that the name Juanita was simply chosen as a generic name for a Mexican woman.&lt;ref name=bancroft /&gt; Historian Rodolpho F. Acuna claimed her name was Juana Loaiza citing an 1877 Schedule of Mexican Claims Against the United States that listed one Jose Maria Loiza as claiming damages for the lynching of his wife. Doubt is cast upon this name however, as it does not show up in the 1850 census, suggesting that the claim may have been fraudulent.&lt;ref name=rubio /&gt; It wasn't until Martha Cotera, an influential activist of both the [[Chicano Movement]] and Chicana Feminist Movement, informed Chicano scholars in 1976 that her last name was Segovia.&lt;ref name=gutierrez /&gt;

== Adult life ==

=== Family ===
Irene I. Blea's book ''U.S. Chicanas and Latinas in a Historical Context'' claims that Josefa was a [[Sonora]]n and of good character.&lt;ref name=blea /&gt; She was about 26 years old at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=blea /&gt; Kerry Segrave recounts Josefa Segovia's life in Downieville, California, also known as "The Forks" for its location at the north fork of the [[Yuba River]]. She lived with a Mexican gambler, José, in a small house on the main street of town. It is not completely clear if they were married or not.&lt;ref name=segrave&gt;Segrave, Kerry. Lynchings of Women in the United States: The Recorded Cases, 1851–1946.
Jefferson: McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers, 2010. 21-22. eBook. p. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reputation in Downieville ===
[[File:Hanging of Juanita in Downieville.jpg|thumb|The hanging of Juanita in Downieville]]
Josefa was probably not married to José, but she did live with him. Therefore, she received a bad reputation.&lt;ref name=blea /&gt; According to one account, Juanita (read Josefa) was slender and barely {{convert|5|ft|spell=in}} tall.&lt;ref name=young&gt;Young, Gordon. "Days of 49'." Popular Tribunals[Downieville, California] 1851, Volume 1 Pg.
417-557. Web. 4 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The same account states that Josefa was beautiful, vivacious and intelligent. Some say that she was not at all disliked in the mining camp in Downieville.&lt;ref name=young /&gt;

Downie relates the story in the following fashion.  Juanita had accompanied her partner to Downieville from Mexico and both lived in an [[adobe]] house.  Downie states, "Whether she was his wife or not makes no difference in this story."  He further describes her figure as "richly developed and in strict proportions."  Only her temper was "not well balanced."  Celebrating the Fourth of July, Cannon and companions were returning from the [[dram shop]] at a late hour, with Cannon staggering from the influence of liquor.  Along the way, he stumbled through the door of the adobe hut.  His friends quickly pulled him back outside and they proceeded home.  Mortified the next morning of his embarrassing blunder, he proceeded to the hut to offer an apology in Spanish.  This did not go well with the Mexican couple, and Juanita grew angry.  In a rage, she drew a knife and stabbed Cannon.  Soon a "mob of infuriated men" gathered, ready to invoke the "miner's law" of a "Life for Life".  Only a Mr. Thayer came to her defense, but to no avail as she was quickly tried and found guilty.  A scaffold was erected and the "howling blood-thirsty mob...cried for vengeance" according to Downie.  Downie states Juanita retold the story of the "unfortunate incident", how she had been "provoked" and if done so again would "repeat her act."  She then took the rope, placed the noose around her neck, said "''Adios Senors!''" and "leaped from the scaffold into eternity."  Downie concludes by stating "it was one of those blots that stained the early history of California." &lt;ref name="Downie"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Downie|first1=William|title=Hunting for Gold|date=1971|publisher=American West Publishing Company|location=Palo Alto|isbn=0-910118-22-1|pages=146–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and racial environment for Latina/os in California ==
[[File:CalGoldRushMap crop.jpg|thumbnail|left|Map of California during the Gold Rush]]
In 1835, [[Andrew Jackson]] tried to buy California for $3.5 million, but Mexico refused the offer. Ten years later, [[James K. Polk]] suggested annexing Texas, but also put California as a high priority on his list of territory to acquire.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; The US and Mexico went to war on May 13, 1846. Two years later on February 2, 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; What neither the U.S. or Mexico realized was that 9 days earlier, gold had been found in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; It is estimated that between 1848 and 1852, as many as 25,000 Mexicans migrated to California to mine.&lt;ref name=carrigan&gt;Carrigan, William D., and Clive Webb. "The Lynching of Persons of Mexican Origin or Descent in the United States, 1848 To 1928." ''Journal of Social History''. 37.2 (2003): n. page. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1848, as many as 3,000 Mexicans migrated to the mining regions. Often, they traveled as entire families.&lt;ref name=pbsmexicans /&gt; After hearing of the gold, thousands of American men borrowed money, mortgaged their homes, or spent their life savings to travel to California and take advantage of the opportunity to find gold. Because society at the time was based on a waged labor, the idea that a person could obtain wealth by finding gold became irresistible.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;"The California Gold Rush." PBS. PBS, 13 Sept. 2006. Web. 05 Dec. 2013.
&lt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/e_goldrush.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 1849, the population of non-native Californians grew to over 100,000. Two-thirds of this non-native population were Americans. Despite the fact that the work of mining was the hardest kind of labor, the promise of gold drew miners west every year.&lt;ref name=pbsmexicans /&gt;

In 1848, when the [[California Gold Rush]] began, the population of the state was a Mexican majority. However, this Mexican population fell to 15% by 1850 and to 4% by 1870.&lt;ref name=california&gt;California Department of Parks and Recreation. California Department of Parks and Recreation, 1988. Print. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/5views/5views.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022072218/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/5views/5views.htm |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern California, where Downieville is located, received the majority of the Anglo migration during the beginning of the Gold Rush. The Mexican majority in 1848 allowed for many successes for early racial relations. For example, all state laws and regulations were to be translated into Spanish.&lt;ref name=california /&gt; This continued until the rapid establishment of a statewide Anglo majority, which left the Mexican-Americans politically powerless. The last major political event where Mexicans had any influence in California was the 1849 state constitutional convention because they were soon greatly outnumbered.&lt;ref name=rosales /&gt; Political influence first declined in the north where the gold mining areas attracted Anglo pioneers. By 1851, legislation contrary to the interests of Mexican-Americans began to be enacted. For example, property taxes in the six southern counties where most Mexicans resided were five times higher than the average &lt;ref name=rosales /&gt;

=== Racial prejudice and violence ===
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed by the United States and Mexico to end the war, did not explicitly define the rights of Mexicans in the newly acquired territories of the U.S. However, it guaranteed them the same rights as U.S. citizens, but this guarantee was not upheld.&lt;ref name=rosales /&gt; [[Lynching in the United States]] of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans was common in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=gutierrez /&gt; In California, Mexicans only constituted a small portion of the population at this time which was not more than 15%. However, Latinos make up over one third of lynch mob victims between 1850 and 1895.&lt;ref name=gutierrez /&gt; Lynching was common since Mexicans were constantly accused of stealing gold or horses, and of killing or raping Anglo women.&lt;ref name=gutierrez /&gt; The last recorded instance of lynching in California is the 1892 murder of Francisco Torres, but lynching continued in Texas &lt;ref name=gutierrez /&gt;

This is a small example of how Mexicans were viewed because the town of Downieville would not have seen any reason to have any more Mexicans in their community or their state.&lt;ref name=blea /&gt;

=== The Gold Rush ===
During the 1840s, many Americans started moving west into Texas, Oregon, and California.&lt;ref name=pbsmexicans&gt;"Mexicans in the Gold Rush." PBS. PBS, 13 Sept. 2006. Web. 04 Dec. 2013. &lt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/p_mexicans.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans thought California was a great place for opportunity.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; Mexicans were considered lazy because they failed to take advantage of the natural resources of the Southwest.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; Members of the elite class of Mexicans in the newly acquired U.S. territories separated themselves from the markedly [[mestizo]], or mixed race, Mexican lower classes.&lt;ref name=rosales&gt;Rosales, Francisco Arturo. ''Chicano! the History of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement''. 2 Revised Edition. Arte Publico Press, 1997. 14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, Mexicans were considered a distinct and inferior racial other who did not fit into the U.S. binary classification of race, and because of their impurity and status as a hybrid of Anglo, Indian, Spanish, and African blood, they were pushed to the margins of whiteness.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; Because of this racial prejudice and economic discrimination, Mexican-Americans became physically separated from Anglos as they were forced to live in specific neighborhoods which became prime areas for the manifestation of poverty, disease and crime.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; The boundaries between Anglos and Mexicans contributed to the misunderstanding and suspicion between the two groups which increased the frequency of the racial stereotyping experienced by Mexicans. However, racial stereotypes were not the only factor that lead to mob violence against and lynching of Mexicans. Gender was also a factor as nine Mexicans were lynched by Anglos for alleged transgressions of sexual norms.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; Anglos viewed Mexican men as having effeminate qualities and were denied the attributes of honor, honesty, and loyalty. Therefore, Anglos accused Mexicans of crimes such as cheating at cards or cowardly acts of murder.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; For Mexican women, they were often romanticized in literature as uncommonly beautiful, sophisticated, and graceful. Therefore, sometimes Mexican women could be viewed as able to be morally brought up by an Anglo man. However, the stereotype of many Mexican women of lower classes was that they were the opposite of the stereotypical Anglo woman. Whereas the Anglo woman was chaste and pious, Mexican women were viewed as depraved and sexually promiscuous.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; During the Gold Rush, the popular stereotype of the Mexican prostitute gained much power in popular culture as a way for Anglos to assert that Mexican women in the mines, like Josefa, turned to prostitution due to their innate moral degeneracy rather than because of their lack of economic opportunity &lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt;

=== Mining ===
Racism was an important factor in unleashing violence against Mexicans, but another determining factor was economic competition. In the industries of the Southwest United States, Mexicans were viewed by Anglos as a lazy people who had failed to capitalize on the rich resources of the Southwest.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; It was the "manifest destiny" of the white man, predicated on false assumptions of superiority, to develop this economic potential of the region. Therefore, any Mexican challenge to this was considered unacceptable due to the proprietary rights of the Anglo pioneers.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt;

The Foreign Miners' Tax was introduced in California in 1850 with the goal of eliminating foreign competition, mainly Mexican but also from Chinese migrants, in the mining industry.&lt;ref name=california /&gt; The tax was designed to discourage immigration to the United States by removing the prospect of economic prosperity. The law required that all persons who were not native born or who had not become American citizens under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, to pay twenty dollars for licenses allowing them to mine. The law provided an exception for California's Native Americans.&lt;ref name=neumann&gt;Neumann Caryn E.. "Foreign Miner Taxes." Immigration in America. N.p., 30 11 2011. Web. 3 Dec 2013. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://immigrationinamerica.org/506-foreign-miner-taxes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224418/http://immigrationinamerica.org/506-foreign-miner-taxes.html |archivedate=2013-12-17 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The law was successful in getting Mexican miners to leave many mines for fear of their safety, and the tax fueled ethnic violence because it sanctioned the expulsion of miners who could not or would not pay.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; The next foreign miner tax of 1852 would target Asian miners &lt;ref name=neumann /&gt;

Lifestyle options in the mining industry were limited, especially for Latinos. For women, the options were wife or prostitute, which made them a "good woman" or a "bad woman".&lt;ref name=blea /&gt; Basically, a woman's reputation was determined by whether her sexual activities were sanctioned or not, which is how the apparently unmarried Josefa might have been negatively perceived &lt;ref name=blea /&gt;

== Assault ==

=== July 4, 1851 ===
Joe Cannon, also possibly Frank or Frederick, was a successful American miner in Downieville in the summer of 1851.&lt;ref name=segrave /&gt; On the night of July 4, 1851, Josefa's "husband", José, was gambling as usual in the local gambling and drinking house. That night, Cannon and his companions tried to enter Josefa and José's home. Many accounts say that Cannon actually broke the front door to the house.&lt;ref name=blea /&gt; However, they failed and left to gather more people.&lt;ref name=segrave /&gt; It is assumed by many that they were going to rape Josefa, who might have already been pregnant.&lt;ref name=blea /&gt; The crowd returned and forced its way inside the house. Josefa stabbed Cannon and killed him in the early morning hours of July 5.&lt;ref name=segrave /&gt; It should be noted that some accounts say that after Joe's return the argument between him and Josefa started in the street whereupon she invited him in to her house for more discussion with the stabbing then taking place inside.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Mexican Americans in California" Historic Sites. Downieville, Sierra County 17 Nov. 2004. Web. 05 Dec. 2013.&lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/5views/5views5h31.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030065839/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/5views/5views5h31.htm |archivedate=2012-10-30 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of these events may be found in a book by William Lewis Manly. His account states that "Juanita" was married and that she and her husband "kept a monte game for the delectation of the miners...but beyond this fact absolutely nothing was said against her character."  In Manly's version, Cannon "got drunk one night and about midnight went to the house occupied by the Spanish woman and her husband and kicked the door down.  Early the following morning he told his comrades that he was going to apologize to the woman for what he had done.  He went alone to the house, and, while talking with the husband and wife, the woman suddenly drew a knife and stabbed Cannon to the heart.  What had been said that provoked the deed was never known, further than that Juanita claimed she had been grossly insulted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manly|first=William|title=Death Valley in '49|date=1949|publisher=Borden Publishing Co.|location=Chapter XIII|page=364|chapter=XIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial ===
The American mining population in Downieville was enraged by Cannon's death. Josefa was put on trial the next day, and the jury consisted of Cannon's friends and companions while the rest of Downieville waited for the results.&lt;ref name=woman /&gt; Supposedly, a physician, Dr. Cyrus D. Aiken, testified that Josefa was not in a fit condition to be hanged &lt;ref name=young /&gt; Protests immediately followed the doctor's testimony and he was forced from the stand and from the town. Moments later, Josefa was found guilty of the murder of Cannon. Also, Mr. Thayer, a lawyer from Nevada attempted to testify against the execution of Juanita but was beaten off the stand.&lt;ref name=young /&gt; Reportedly, he asked for a fair trial for Juanita to see if a murder had really been committed.&lt;ref name=woman&gt;"Woman up in the west". Fairbanks Weekly News – Miner [Alaska], January 21, 1921, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death: July 5, 1851 ===
For the lynching, a scaffold was constructed on the bridge over the Yuba River.&lt;ref name=segrave /&gt; The town came to stand on the banks of the river and watch her execution. It was an important event to lessen the anger of the townspeople over Cannon's death. Josefa was hanged immediately following the trial, and some accounts say that her last words before she was executed were "Adiós Señores".&lt;ref name=popular&gt;''Popular Tribunals''. Vol. i, p. 557 seq.&lt;/ref&gt; She is widely known to be the first woman to be executed by hanging in California &lt;ref name=segrave /&gt; Mr. Manly wrote, "Juanita went calmly to her death. She wore a Panama hat, and after mounting the platform she removed it, tossed it to a friend in the crowd, whose nickname was 'Oregon,' with the remark, 'Adios, amigo.' Then she adjusted the noose to her own neck, raising her long, loose tresses carefully in order to fix the rope firmly in its place; and then, with a smile and wave of her hand to the bloodthirsty crowd present, she stepped calmly from the plank into eternity. Singularly enough, her body rests side by side, in the cemetery on the hill, with that of the man whose life she had taken." Mr. Manly's book is generally a first person account of his experiences migrating to California to mine for gold.  Although he did mine for gold near Downieville in 1851, he, by his own account, was not in Downieville on the dates in question. He does not cite the source for his version of the events though it seems conceivable he heard eye-witness accounts.

== Effects and the Mexican-American community during the Gold Rush ==

=== Media coverage of "Juanita" ===
There are many conflicting stories and sources regarding Josefa's death. Eyewitnesses produce differing accounts of the assault, the trial, the hanging, and of Josefa herself. At the time, media referred to Josefa simply as "Juanita". The public is largely unaware of the lynching of Mexicans because, despite the recent rise in academic literature on lynching, scholars frequently tend to overlook anti-Mexican violence and lynching.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; There is no actual accurate count of how many Mexicans were lynched in the United States, so estimates must be the basis for studies of Mexican lynching victims &lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; Opinion on the incident from 19th century authors differs. In "The Downieville Tragedy" found in an 1887 compilation of his works, author, editor, and compiler of local histories Hubert Howe Bancroft comes down firmly on the side of the vigilantes arguing that it was unlikely Joe Cannon was on the attack that day and that he was instead murdered.&lt;ref name=bancroft&gt;Bancroft, Hubert. "The Downieville Tragedy." ''The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft''. San Francisco: The History Company. 1887. &lt;https://archive.org/stream/cihm_14187#page/n7/mode/2up&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He begins the piece with a description of frontier chivalry, with normally violent men in the early West would refuse to harm women, children, and the elderly, and uses this as evidence that Joe would not have entered Josefa's house to do harm. He then paints a picture of a hot tempered woman hitting her breaking point and committing murder.

In "The Downieville Tragedy" there is evidence that even at the time Anglo-American opinion was split on who represented the guilty party in the assault. Bancroft introduces a dissenting opinion in the form of an excerpt from the Sacramento Times and Transcript:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The act for which the victims suffered was entirely justifiable under the provocation. She had stabbed a man who had persisted in making a disturbance in her house and had greatly outraged her rights. The violent proceedings of an indignant and excited mob, led on by the enemies of the unfortunate woman, were a blot upon the history of the state. Had she committed a crime of really heinous character, a real American would have revolted at such a course as was pursued toward this friendless and unprotected foreigner. We had hoped the story was fabricated. As it is, the perpetrators have shown themselves and their race.&lt;ref name=bancroft /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This presents a view opposite to that of Bancroft's being written not long before his by another Anglo publisher.

=== Statistics of Mexican-Americans lynched during the Gold Rush ===
The treatment of Mexican-Americans during the Gold Rush is a shameful part of U.S. history. Most of these lynchings occurred in Texas and parts of California, and were carried out by impromptu vigilance committees (i.e., Texas Rangers serving "justice" in Texas). Lynchings were frequent and most of them were of innocent Mexicans. Many lynchings were prompted by Mexicans falsely being accused of stealing gold or horses or of killing or raping Anglos.&lt;ref name=gutierrez /&gt;

In California, Mexicans represented over one third of the lynch mob victims between 1850 and 1895, when they were of less than 15 percent of the population. Between 1848 and 1928, at least 597 Mexicans were lynched in the United States.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; Lynching was a way for Anglos to consolidate their colonial control over the recently conquered American West and exert sovereignty over the region. The mob violence only contributed to the displacement of Mexicans, as well as Native Americans, from their land, denial of access to natural resources, political disfranchisement, and economic dependency on the Anglo capitalist system &lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt;

=== Current debates about her death today ===
Today, we think about Josefa's death in an opposite way from how it was viewed in 1851. By giving her the name "Juanita", it devalued her existence and the horrible events that occurred in Downieville, California. During the time of the lynchings, many whites stood as bystanders or were part of the vigilance committee. At "Juanita's" lynching, there was only one person that protested against her wrongful persecution.&lt;ref name=mora&gt;Mora, Anthony. "Mexican Americans in the Nineteenth Century: The First "Latinos"." Introduction to Latina/o Studies. University of Michigan. Michigan, Ann Arbor. 16 Sep 2013. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Chicano Movement]], the decades after the gold rush changed the way that Mexicans and Latinos were viewed in the United States.

Some witnesses recalled Juanita saying before she died: "'I would do the same again if I was so provoked.'".&lt;ref name=rubio&gt;Rubio, J'Aime. "First Recorded Hanging of a Woman in California History." Dreaming Casually, 07 08 2013. Web. 12 Dec. 2013. &lt;http://dreamingcasuallypoetry.blogspot.com/2013/07/first-lynching-of-woman-in-california.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of many characteristics pointed out by some who are of the opinion that she must have been an aggressive woman. This has been used to advance the idea that those who lynched her may have been right that she had murdered Joe the miner when he was not actually threatening her safety. Another fact brought up to support this idea is that the townsfolk noted that she was quick to anger. Due to conflicting witness statements and vague details some modern commentators still fall on the side of Joe Cannon.&lt;ref name=rubio /&gt; This shows that while most current thoughts about the incident take race and gender status as strong indicators that the story given by the vigilantes was most likely inaccurate some today still believe that their actions were justified.

Another interpretation of her death that recognized racial distinctions in the thoughts of her death was made by Preston Dillard, "So Miss Segovia MAY have been a saloon girl who was accused (but never convicted; important distinction) of a past crime, carried a knife and had a temper. ... these reasons sufficiently justify being lynched by a mob? If so, then half the women in Georgetown today would swing tomorrow. Miss Segovia deserved the fair trial she was deprived of. (Think about that) Would you have left those comments justifying her murder if she had been a white woman?"

== Film ==
On television as a young child, he started appearing uncredited at the age of 8 in films such as ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952) and ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt; He quickly moved to featured status by the end of that year.

He showed talent as the kidnapped Indian "Red Chief" in a segment of the film ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]'' (1952) and another kidnap victim as the son of scientist [[Gene Barry]] in ''[[The Atomic City]]'' (1952).

In 1953, he co-starred in the [[John Wayne]] [[Western (genre)|western]] classic ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' (1953) as the [[curious]] [[blond]] son of homesteader [[Geraldine Page]].&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

He also appeared in other film styles such as the ''[[film noir]]'' thriller ''[[Jeopardy (film)|Jeopardy]]'' (1953) with [[Barbara Stanwyck]], the horse opera drama ''Arena'' (1953) with [[Gig Young]], and the comedies ''[[Mister Scoutmaster]]'' (1953) with [[Clifton Webb]] and ''[[Ricochet Romance]]'' (1954) with [[Marjorie Main]].

== Television ==
In 1953-54, Aaker was among the many child actors who auditioned for the role of "Jeff Miller" on the original 1954 ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' series, which later aired as ''Jeff's Collie''. That role went to [[Tommy Rettig]]. Two weeks later, Aaker won the role of "Rusty" on ''The Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin'', co-starring [[James Brown (Rin Tin Tin)|James Brown]] (1920–1992) as [[Lieutenant]] Ripley "Rip" Masters.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt; Aaker and Rettig were friends, and both shows were popular with audiences. The two actors and the two star dogs appeared together in a photograph used on the cover of the July 2, 1955 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''.{{r|rtt|page1=236}}

== Later years ==
Aaker told a newspaper reporter that when he reached the age of 21, he was paid a $10,000 lump sum by the studio that produced ''Rin Tin Tin'' "and he spent the rest of the '60s traveling around the world 'as sort of a flower child.'"&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rin Tin Tin's friend is now a carpenter|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/85252305/?terms=%22Lee%2BAaker%22|work=Southern Illinoisan|date=November 15, 1976|location=Illinois, Carbondale|page=18|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 30, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find work as an adult actor, Aaker got involved as a producer and later worked as a carpenter.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In the late 1960s, Aaker was married to Sharon Ann Hamilton for two years.&lt;ref name=xcs/&gt; He has resided in [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]], [[California]], for many years and is a special-needs ski instructor.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2005, Aaker won the [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Golden Boot Awards|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/goldboot.htm|website=The Old Corral|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as  ''Kids of the West''.

'''Marion Walter Jacobs''' (May 1, 1930 – February 15, 1968), known as '''Little Walter''', was an American [[blues]] musician, singer, and songwriter, whose revolutionary approach to the harmonica and impact on succeeding generations earned comparisons for him to such seminal artists as [[Django Reinhardt]],  [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;Glover, Tony; Dirks, Scott; and Gaines, Ward (2002). ''Blues with a Feeling: The Little Walter Story''. Routledge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His virtuosity and musical innovations fundamentally altered many listeners' expectations of what was possible on blues harmonica.&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"&gt;Dahl, Bill [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p427/biography Little Walter: Biography]. Allmusic.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2008 in the category Sideman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22242651/ Material Girl Becomes a Hall of Famer]. MSNBC. December 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rockhall.com/inductees/little-walter/ Little Walter]. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the only artist to be inducted specifically as a harmonica player.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Jacobs' date of birth is usually given as May 1, 1930, in [[Marksville, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;  He was born without a birth certificate and when he applied for a Social Security card in 1940, his birthdate was listed as May 1, 1923 (over the years he often gave different years, but May 1 was constant).&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt; He was raised in [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]], where he learned to play the harmonica. He quit school and by the age of 12 had left rural Louisiana and travelled, working odd jobs and busking on the streets of New Orleans; Memphis; Helena and West Helena, Arkansas; and St. Louis. He honed his musical skills on harmonica and guitar performing with older bluesmen, including [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]], [[Sunnyland Slim]], [[Honeyboy Edwards]] and others.

Arriving in Chicago in 1945, he occasionally found work as a guitarist but garnered more attention for his already highly developed harmonica playing. According to Chicago bluesman [[Floyd Jones]], Little Walter's first recording was an unreleased demo recorded soon after he arrived in Chicago, on which Walter played guitar backing Jones.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. (1983). "The Dark Road of Floyd Jones". ''Living Blues'', no. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs, reportedly frustrated with having his harmonica drowned out by electric guitars, adopted a simple but previously little-used method: He cupped a small microphone in his hands along with his harmonica and plugged the microphone into a public address system or guitar amplifier. He could thus compete with any guitarist's volume. However, unlike other contemporary blues harp players, such as [[Sonny Boy Williamson I]] and [[Snooky Pryor]], who like many other harmonica players had also begun using the newly available amplifier technology around the same time solely for added volume, Little Walter purposely pushed his amplifiers beyond their intended technical limitations, using the amplification to explore and develop radical new timbres and sonic effects previously unheard from a harmonica or any other instrument.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt; In a short biographical note on Little Walter, Madison Deniro wrote that he was "the first musician of any kind to purposely use electronic distortion."&lt;ref&gt;Fuhrmann, J. T. [http://www.bluesharp.ca/legends/lwalter.html Little Walter: Marion Walter Jacobs (1930–1968)] at bluesharp.ca. Retrieved March 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success===
Jacobs made his first released recordings in 1947 for Bernard Abrams' tiny Ora-Nelle label, which operated out of the back room of Abrams' Maxwell Radio and Records store in the heart of the [[Maxwell Street]] district
in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://campber.people.clemson.edu/parkway.html |title=The Legendary Parkway Label |first1=Robert |last1=Pruter |first2=Robert L. |last2=Campbell |work= |publisher=[[Clemson University]] |location=[[Clemson, South Carolina]] |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and several other of his early recordings, like many blues harp recordings of the era, owed a strong stylistic debt to the pioneering blues harmonica player [[Sonny Boy Williamson I]] (John Lee Williamson). Little Walter joined [[Muddy Waters]]'s band in 1948, and by 1950 he was playing acoustic (unamplified) harmonica on Waters's recordings for [[Chess Records]]. The first appearance on record of Little Walter's amplified harmonica was on Waters's "Country Boy" (Chess 1952), recorded on July 11, 1951. For years after his departure from Waters's band in 1952, Chess continued to hire him to play on Waters's recording sessions, and as a result his harmonica is featured on most of Waters's classic recordings from the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluesandrhythm.co.uk/documents/200.pdf |title=Complete Muddy Waters Discography |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a guitarist, Little Walter recorded three songs for the small Parkway label with Waters and [[Leroy Foster (musician)|Baby Face Leroy Foster]] (reissued on CD by [[Delmark Records]] as "The Blues World of Little Walter" in 1993) and on a session for Chess backing pianist Eddie Ware. His guitar playing was also featured occasionally on early Chess sessions with Waters and [[Jimmy Rogers]].&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

Jacobs had put his career as a bandleader on hold when he joined Waters's band, but he stepped out front again when he recorded as a bandleader for Chess's subsidiary label [[Checker Records]] on May 12, 1952. The first completed take of the first song attempted at his debut session became his first hit, spending eight weeks in the number-one position on the [[Billboard R&amp;B chart|''Billboard'' R&amp;B chart]]. The song was "[[Juke (song)|Juke]]", and it is still the only harmonica instrumental ever to be a number-one hit on the ''Billboard'' R&amp;B chart. The original title of the track file was "Your Cat Will Play", but was renamed at Leonard Chess' suggestion. (Three other harmonica instrumentals by Little Walter also reached the Billboard R&amp;B top 10: "Off the Wall" reached number eight, "Roller Coaster" reached number six, and "Sad Hours" reached number two while "Juke" was still on the charts.) "Juke" was the biggest hit to date for any artist on Chess and its affiliated labels and one of the biggest national R&amp;B hits of 1952, securing Walter's position on the Chess artist roster for the next decade.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

Jacobs had fourteen top-ten hits on the ''Billboard'' R&amp;B charts between 1952 and 1958, including two number-one hits (the second being 
"[[My Babe]]"&lt;ref name=pc4&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19750/m1/ |title=Show 4, The Tribal Drum: The Rise of Rhythm and Blues. [Part 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955), a level of commercial success never achieved by Waters or by his fellow Chess blues artists [[Howlin' Wolf]] and Sonny Boy Williamson II. Following the pattern of "Juke", most of Little Walter's singles released in the 1950s featured a vocal performance on one side and a harmonica instrumental on the other. Many of Walter's vocal numbers were written by him or Chess A&amp;R man [[Willie Dixon]] or adapted from earlier blues themes. In general, his sound was more modern and up-tempo than the popular Chicago blues of the day, with a jazzier conception and rhythmically less rigid approach than that of other contemporary blues harmonica players.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

Jacobs left Waters's band in 1952 and recruited his own backing band, the [[The Aces (blues band)|Aces]], a group that was already working steadily in Chicago backing [[Junior Wells]]. The Aces—the brothers David and Louis Myers on guitars and [[Fred Below]] on drums—were credited as the Jukes on most of the Little Walter records on which they played. By 1955 the members of the Aces had each separately left Little Walter to pursue other opportunities and were initially replaced by the guitarists [[Robert "Junior" Lockwood]] and [[Luther Tucker]] and drummer [[Odie Payne]]. Among others who worked in Little Walter's recording and touring bands in the 1950s were the guitarists [[Jimmie Lee Robinson]] and [[Freddie Robinson]], and drummer George Hunter. Little Walter also occasionally included saxophone players in his touring bands during this period, among them the young [[Albert Ayler]], and [[Ray Charles]] on one early tour. By the late 1950s, Little Walter no longer employed a regular full-time band, instead hiring various players as needed from the large pool of blues musicians in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

Jacobs often played the harmonica on records by others in the Chess stable of artists, including [[Jimmy Rogers]], [[John Brim]], [[Louisiana Red|Rocky Fuller]], [[Memphis Minnie]], the Coronets, [[Johnny Shines]], Floyd Jones, [[Bo Diddley]], and [[Shel Silverstein]]. He also played on recordings for other labels, backing [[Otis Rush]], [[Johnny Young]], and [[Robert Nighthawk]].&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

Jacobs suffered from alcoholism and had a notoriously short temper, which in late 1950s led to violent altercations, minor scrapes with the law, and increasingly irresponsible behavior. This led to a decline in his fame and fortunes, beginning in the late 1950s. Nonetheless he toured Europe twice, in 1964 and 1967 (the long-circulated story that he toured the United Kingdom with the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] in 1964 has been refuted by [[Keith Richards]]). The 1967 European tour, as part of the [[American Folk Blues Festival]], resulted in the only known film footage of Little Walter performing. Footage of Little Walter backing [[Hound Dog Taylor]] and [[Koko Taylor]] was shown on a television program in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 11, 1967 was released on DVD in 2004. Further video of another recently discovered TV appearance in Germany during this same tour, showing Jacobs performing his songs "My Babe", "[[Mean Old World]]", and others, was released on DVD in Europe in January 2009; it is the only known footage of him singing. Other TV appearances in the UK (in 1964) and the Netherlands (in 1967) have been documented, but no footage of these has yet been uncovered. Jacobs recorded and toured infrequently in the 1960s, playing mainly in and around Chicago.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

In 1967 [[Chess Records|Chess]] released a studio album, ''[[Super Blues]]'', featuring Little Walter, Bo Diddley, and Muddy Waters.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

===Death===
A few months after returning from his second European tour, he was involved in a fight while taking a break from a performance at a nightclub on the South Side of Chicago. He apparently sustained only minor injuries in this altercation, but they  aggravated the damage he had suffered in previous violent encounters, and he died in his sleep at the apartment of a girlfriend, at 209 East 54th Street in Chicago early the following morning.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Defender"/&gt; The official cause of death stated on his death certificate was coronary thrombosis (a blood clot in the heart); evidence of external injuries was so insignificant that the police reported that his death was due to "unknown or natural causes",&lt;ref name="Chicago Defender"&gt;''Chicago Defender'', February 21, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and no external injuries were noted on the death certificate.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt; His body was buried at St. Mary's Cemetery, in [[Evergreen Park, Illinois]], on February 22, 1968.&lt;ref name="Chicago Defender"/&gt; His grave remained unmarked until 1991, when fans Scott Dirks and Eomot Rasun had a marker designed and installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6125406|title=Little Walter (1930–1968) – Find a Grave Memorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The music journalist Bill Dahl described Little Walter as "king of all post-war blues harpists", who "took the humble mouth organ in dazzling amplified directions that were unimaginable prior to his ascendancy."&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"/&gt; His legacy has been enormous: he is widely credited by blues historians as the artist primarily responsible for establishing the standard vocabulary for modern blues and [[blues rock]] harmonica players.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allmusic Bio"/&gt; Biographer [[Tony Glover]] notes Little Walter directly influenced [[Junior Wells]], [[James Cotton]], [[George "Harmonica" Smith]], and [[Carey Bell]].&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt; He includes [[Jerry Portnoy]], Rick Estrin of [[Little Charlie &amp; the Nightcats]], [[Kim Wilson]], and [[Rod Piazza]] among those who later studied his technique and helped popularize it with younger players.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;&lt;!--PLEASE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR OTHER PLAYERS--&gt;

Little Walter's daughter, Marion Diaz Reacco, has established the Little Walter Foundation in Chicago, to preserve the legacy and genius of Little Walter. The foundation aims to create programs for the creative arts, including music, animation and video.

'''Lorenz Hackenholt''' (26 June 1914 {{ndash}}-missing 1945 declared legally dead as of 31 December 1945)&lt;ref&gt;Declared legally dead 31 December 1945. The official death date; Hackenholt disappeared in 1945 without a trace.&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) with the rank of ''[[Hauptscharführer]]'' (First Sergeant). During World War II Hackenholt built and operated the gas chamber at the [[Bełżec extermination camp]] in [[occupied Poland]]. In so doing, he personally carried out the murder of hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;ref name="Klee_230"/&gt;

Hackenholt was deeply involved in the operation of [[death camps]] during the deadliest phase of [[the Holocaust in Poland]], known as [[Operation Reinhard]], as well as in other Nazi war crimes, including the murder of mental patients and the disabled in [[Action T4]] programme of forced euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Klee_230"&gt;Klee (2003), ''The Good Old Days'', pp. 230, 237, 241, 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Hackenholt's full name was Laurenzius Marie Hackenholt.  He was born on 26 June 1914 in [[Gelsenkirchen]]/Ruhr.  His father was Theodor Hackenholt and his mother was Elizabeth Wobriezek. He attended the local elementary school until he reached the age of 14.  He then became an apprentice bricklayer.  After he passed the trade examination he worked on various building sites.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"&gt;[http://www.mazal.org/archive/documents/Tregenza/Tregenza01.htm Tregenza, "The ‘Disappearance’ of SS-Hauptscharfuhrer Lorenz Hackenholt", at Mazel on-line library] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080302211812/http://www.mazal.org/archive/documents/Tregenza/Tregenza01.htm |date=2008-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concentration camp guard ===
In 1933, Hackenholt volunteered for the SS.  After joining the SS he was sent to a training school on 1 January 1934.  After that he volunteered for service in the army, where he was assigned to the 12th Engineers' Battalion. After two years military service he was discharged, and then joined the SS Death's Head troops.  He was a skilled driver and mechanic and, beginning in March 1938, served at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] in the motor pool.  He also worked as a guard at Sachsenhausen.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"/&gt;

=== Action T4 ===
[[File:Hackenholt.jpg|thumb|right]]
[[T4 project|Action T4]], the so-called "Euthanasia Program", lasted from early 1940 until the summer of 1941 when the gassings were stopped on [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] orders. In November 1939 Hackenholt was assigned to Action T4, when he was transferred to Berlin for 'special duty'.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"/&gt;  This special duty was under [[Viktor Brack]].  According to [[Werner Dubois|Werner Karl Dubois]], another camp guard transferred to special duty with Hackenholt:

{{quote|Photographs of extreme cases of mental illness were shown to us. We were told that ... the institutions from which the mentally ill were to be taken were needed as military hospitals. We were further told that gas chambers were to be built in which the victims would be gassed, after which they would be cremated. We, anyway, would have nothing to do with the killings, we would only have to cremate the corpses.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"/&gt;}}

There were six T4 killing facilities.  Hackenholt served in all of them.  He drove a bus with the SS staff from facility to facility.  He also removed the bodies from the gas chambers and burned them.  For a while Hackenholt was a driver for ''[[SS-Untersturmführer]]'' Dr. [[August Becker]], the T4 chemist who was responsible for delivering bottled carbon monoxide gas from [[I.G. Farben]] manufacturing plants to the T4 gas chambers.&lt;ref name = Tregenza/&gt;  Hackenholt worked primarily in [[Grafeneck Euthanasia Centre|Grafeneck]] and [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre|Sonnenstein]].&lt;ref name="Klee2"/&gt;

=== Operation Reinhard and beyond ===
[[File:Belzec - SS staff (1942).jpg|thumb|right|275px|SS staff at KZ Belzec. Hackenholt is third from the right (front row).]]

In the fall of 1941, some of the Action T4 personnel, including Hackenholt, were transferred to [[Lublin Reservation]] in [[occupied Poland]] where they came under the authority of ''[[SS-Brigadeführer]]'' [[Odilo Globocnik]]. On vacation leave, Hackenholt went to Berlin to marry Ilse Zillmer, who was then 29 years old.  Hackenholt returned to Poland and was sent to [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], a remote labour camp near the rail station,&lt;ref name="M/MPwB"&gt;{{citation|title=Historia Niemieckiego Obozu Zagłady w Bełżcu [History of the Belzec extermination camp] |author=Bełżec Museum of Martyrdom |publisher=Muzeum - Miejsce Pamięci w Bełżcu |url=http://www.belzec.eu/articles.php?acid=77 |language=Polish |id=Official website. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029003413/http://www.belzec.eu/articles.php?acid=77 |archivedate=2015-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct experiments to establish a method for the mass killing of Jews by gassing.  Hackenholt set up three gas chambers in an insulated barracks. Using engine exhaust, piped into the chambers from a disassembled Soviet tank, Hackenholt killed over 50,000 Jews in one month (mid March to mid April 1942).  In August 1942, Hackenholt built and operated newer and larger gas chambers at Belzec.  Once Belzec came into operation, a sign was placed over the gas chambers which said "Hackenholt Foundation"; with potted geraniums on either side of the entrance.&lt;ref name="Klee_230"/&gt;  Hackenholt also designed and operated gas chambers at the Treblinka and Sobibor extermination camps.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"/&gt;

Hackenholt, who was called "Hacko" by other guards, was a tough, large man who was willing and able to do any task at the extermination camps, although he reportedly balked at cleaning up seeping corruption from bodies rotting in mass graves.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"/&gt;  At Belzec, where all ages of people were killed, some Jews, because of infirmity or age, could not enter the gas chamber.  These people were instead laid down in the mass graves, and, according to the testimony of other guards, shot by Hackenholt.  In 1943, when [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] ordered the mass graves at Belzec to be reopened and the bodies burned, Hackenholt was in charge of the operation.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"/&gt;  [[Himmler]] considered Hackenholt to be "one of the most deserving men of Operation Reinhard" ({{lang-de|einer der verdientesten Männer der Aktion Reinhard}}).&lt;ref name="Klee2"&gt;[[Ernst Klee|Klee, Ernst]]: ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945?'', p. 215. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2003 {{ISBN|3-10-039309-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1943, Hackenholt and other personnel from [[Operation Reinhard]] were transferred to northern Italy ([[Trieste]]),&lt;ref name="Klee2"/&gt; where they attempted to find and kill the few remaining Italian Jews.  In 1944 Hackenholt was awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross (Second Class)]] for his role in Operation Reinhard.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"/&gt;

== Post-war disappearance and investigation ==
Hackenholt disappeared after 1945,&lt;ref name="Klee_230"/&gt; and based on an application by his wife was declared dead by a Berlin court on 1 April 1954, with an official date of death of 31 December 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Was sie taten – Was sie wurden. Ärzte, Juristen und andere Beteiligte am Kranken- oder Judenmord''. 12.Auflage. Fischer-TB, Frankfurt/M. 2004, {{ISBN|3-596-24364-5}}, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

Hackenholt was supposedly killed in Italy in 1945, possibly by execution for selling guns to the partisans. However this was never quite certain.  The West German authorities began an investigation in 1959.  They were able to locate Hackenholt's wife and mother.  Both certified that Hackenholt had not been heard from since the war, and surveillance of the wife's residence showed there were no attempts by him to visit her there.  In 1961, the West German police were able to find [[Erich Bauer|Hermann Erich Bauer]], who had been in the SS with Hackenholt.  Bauer claimed that Hackenholt had definitely survived the war, because he had met him in 1946 near [[Ingolstadt]], [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref name="Klee2"/&gt;  Hackenholt was going under a false name that he had acquired from a dead soldier.  Bauer's statement was corroborated by a former Sobibor guard, who likewise said he had met Hackenholt after the war.  The West German police conducted an investigation but were not able to locate Hackenholt, or to determine whether he might still be alive.&lt;ref name="Tregenza"/&gt;

'''''Love Among the Walnuts: or How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned'''''{{efn|Some sources list the book's title as ''Love Among the Walnuts: or How I Saved My Entire Family from Being Poisoned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Helen Foster|title=Author Day Adventures: Bringing Literacy to Life with an Author Visit|date=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-8108-4370-6|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[farce|farcical]], [[satire|satirical]] [[Young adult fiction|young adult novel]] with [[fairy tale]] elements written by [[Jean Ferris]]. The story revolves around a young man, Sandy, whose family is poisoned by his scheming uncles in a bid to gain the family fortune. He moves them to Walnut Manor, a neighboring [[convalescent home]], where, with the help of the nurse Sunnie, he tries to save his family and benefit the manor's misunderstood residents.

''Love Among the Walnuts'' was first published on September 1, 1998, by [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt]]. Reviews of the work have been mostly positive, with focus on the story's style and tone. It was listed as a [[YALSA Best Book for Young Adults]] and placed third on the ranked Teens' Top Ten Books list, both in 1999.

==Plot==
Horatio Alger Huntington-Ackerman, a successful businessperson, marries Mousey Huntington-Ackerman (née Malone), a striving actor, and has a child named Sandy. They move with their butler Bentley and his wife Flossie to a new country estate called Eclipse with no neighbors except the residents of Walnut Manor, a [[convalescent home]]. One evening when Sandy is a young adult, his uncles Bart and Bernie visit Eclipse. The uncles feed the family a poisoned birthday cake in an attempt to inherit the family fortune, sending everyone but Sandy and Bentley into a coma.

A court ruling mandates that a doctor be present to oversee care for the comatose patients ("the sleepers"). To meet this requirement, Sandy moves them next door to Walnut Manor. There, he meets Dr. Waldemar, the director of the facility, and Sunnie Stone, a nurse hired to care for the sleepers. While Bentley researches a cure of the sleepers' comas, Sandy and Sunnie acquaint themselves with the other patients of Walnut Manor and ultimately fall in love with one another.

With the help of Dr. Waldemar and the manor's residents, Sandy and Sunnie discover that Walnut Manor's patients were placed in the facility's care by their relatives, who, as Walnut Manor's board of directors, have been embezzling from the home. They expose the board of directors' misdeeds and Bentley revives the sleepers from their coma. Sandy, Sunnie, Dr. Waldemar, and the residents of Walnut Manor together thwart Bart and Bernie and send them to prison.

==Reception==
''Love Among the Walnuts'' received mostly positive reviews. Helbig and Perkins commented that "the large cast consists of individualized, complementary, and affectionately handled characters" and the novel's themes "are conveyed with skill and invention".&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' praised the story for its "cast of offbeat characters and some punchy dialogue" while writing that its "plot will have more appeal for adults than children."&lt;ref name="pwreview" /&gt; In ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'', Anne St. John commented that Sandy's "emotional responses and internal struggles will ring true with teenagers who are coming of age in a time of turmoil".&lt;ref name="horn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=St. John|first1=Anne|title=Love Among the Walnuts|url=https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0152015906&amp;UPC=&amp;position=1|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=[[The Horn Book Magazine]]|date=January 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702060136/https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0152015906&amp;UPC=&amp;position=1|archivedate=July 2, 2016|via=[[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Elaine McGuire of ''[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]'', ''Love Among the Walnuts'' is "dripping with charm but never cloying&amp;nbsp;... a fabulous book with lots of lessons about our sickeningly fast-paced '90s lifestyles."&lt;ref name="voya"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGuire|first1=Elaine|title=Love Among the Walnuts|url=https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0152015906&amp;UPC=&amp;position=1|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]|date=February 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702060136/https://catalog.wccls.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Review?ISBN=0152015906&amp;UPC=&amp;position=1|archivedate=July 2, 2016|via=[[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Rohrlick, writing in ''Kliatt'', compared ''Love Among the Walnuts'' favorably to Ferris's later work, ''Once Upon a Marigold'', describing both stories as "madcap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rohrlick|first1=Paula|title=Ferris, Jean. Once upon a marigold|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-107202643.html|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=Kliatt|date=November 1, 2002|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For certain reviewers, the tone and style reinforced the novel's quality. In ''School Library Journal'', Burns commented that ''Love Among the Walnuts'' "is intentionally melodramatic, coincidental, improbable, and hilarious. The restrained, tongue-in-cheek tone heightens the humor of this spoof."&lt;ref name="burns" /&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' compared the tone and plot of the story to that of a film directed by [[Preston Sturges]] or [[Frank Capra]], describing how it "has an unconventional style and offbeat sense of humor that will delight readers or exhaust them, depending on their tolerance for screwball comedies."&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt; Nancy Hinkel, then Associate Editor at Alfred A. Knopf and Crown Books for Young Readers, wrote that the story has "great writing, original ideas, and real style" as well as "a good dose of dry humor that slips past if you're not paying attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinkel|first1=Nancy|title=Would That It Were Mine&amp;nbsp;... |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20010212/25538-would-that-it-were-mine.html|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=February 12, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702062511/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20010212/25538-would-that-it-were-mine.html|archivedate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helbig and Perkins described the novel's style as "fast moving, engaging, and witty."&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

Several reviews indicated reservations in recommending ''Love Among the Walnuts''. ''Publishers Weekly'' wrote that "Sandy's accelerated growth from a baby in the nursery to an adult smitten with Sunny (in the space of a chapter) early on in the novel leaves young readers little to identify with."&lt;ref name="pwreview" /&gt; ''Kirkus Reviews'' commented that "a financial subplot and a muddle of characters, defined by their eccentricities, clog the pacing"&lt;ref name="kirkus" /&gt; of the story while St. John in ''The Horn Book Magazine'' said that "some of the characters are two-dimensional".&lt;ref name="horn" /&gt;

''Love Among the Walnuts'' was one of 50 fiction titles selected as a 1999 [[Young Adult Library Services Association]] (YALSA) [[YALSA Best Book for Young Adults|Best Book for Young Adults]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best Books for Young Adults|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-30515036.html|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=Teacher Librarian|date=March 1, 1999|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked third (after [[J.

'''Luciano Jorge Fernandes''' (6 August 1940 – 5 December 1966) was a Portuguese [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Olhão]], [[Algarve]], Luciano started out at local club [[S.C. Olhanense]] at age 19. His composed defending and assuredness in possession earned the nickname of ''Germano II'', in honour of [[S.L. Benfica]] player [[Germano Figueiredo|Germano]].&lt;ref name=BLM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beyondthelastman.com/2013/04/10/a-misfortune-never-comes-alone-benfica1966-part-one/|title=A Misfortune Never Comes Alone – Benfica 1967, Part One|publisher=Beyond the Last Man|last=M|first=Craig|date=10 April 2013|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the latter in 1963, and coach [[Lajos Czeizler]] displayed him in the [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]] position until he injured his [[knee]], needing an operation; after he returned he got injured again, now in the [[ankle]], only returning to full fitness in the [[1966–67 Primeira Divisão|1966–67 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tovar |first=Rui Miguel | title=Almanaque do Benfica| publisher=Lua de Papel |location=Portugal| year=2012| isbn=978-989-23-2087-8 |page=309-335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 1966, Benfica's new [[hydro massage]] bath short-circuited with seven players inside, Luciano being the only one immersed. [[Eusébio]], [[Jaime Graça]] and [[Santana (footballer)|Santana]] escaped with burns, whilst José Carmo Pais, [[Domiciano Cavém]] and [[Amândio Malta da Silva]] were knocked unconscious until Graça managed to climb out the pool and cut off the power supply; Luciano died immediately at the age of 26, and the team played the rest of the campaign in black, winning the league.&lt;ref name=BLM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/luciano-a-morte-no-estadio-da-luz-numa-manha-de-dezembro|title=Luciano: a morte no Estádio da Luz, numa manhã de dezembro|trans-title=Luciano: death at the Estádio da Luz, on a December morning|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9403">A '''maternal near miss''' ('''MNM''') is an event in which a pregnant woman comes close to [[maternal death]], but does not die &amp;ndash; a "[[near miss (safety)|near-miss]]".  Traditionally, the analysis of maternal deaths has been the criteria of choice for evaluating women's health and the quality of [[obstetric]] care.  Due to the success of [[modern medicine]] such deaths have become very rare in developed countries, which has led to an increased interest in analyzing so-called "near miss" events.

==Background==
Maternal mortality is a [[sentinel event]] to assess the quality of a health care system.  The standard indicator is the [[Maternal Mortality Ratio]], defined as the ratio of the number of [[maternal death]]s per 100,000 live births. Due to improved health care the ratio has been declining steadily in developed countries.  For example, in the UK 1952-1982 the ratio was halving every 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh 1998:176&lt;/ref&gt;  In the European Union the ratio has now stabilized at around 10 to 20.&lt;ref name="Minkauskien"&gt;Minkauskienė 2004:299&lt;/ref&gt;

The small number of cases makes the evaluation of maternal mortality practically impossible&lt;ref name="Minkauskien" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the [[Poisson distribution]] for a discussion of statistical methodological difficulties when the number of cases is "small"&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, the study of negative outcomes have been highly successful in preventing their causes, this strategy of prevention therefore faces difficulties when if the number of negative outcome drop to low levels.  In the UK, for example, the most dramatic decline in maternal death was achieved in [[Rochdale]], an industrial town in the poorest area of England.  In 1928 the town had a [[Maternal Mortality Ratio]] of over 900 per 100,000 live births, more than double the national average of the time. An enquiry into the causes of the deaths reduced the ratio to 280 per 100,000 pregnancies by 1934, only six years later, then the lowest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2003:31&lt;/ref&gt;

The very low figures of maternal mortality have therefore stimulated an interest in investigating cases of life-threatening obstetric [[morbidity]] or '''maternal near miss'''.  There are several advantages of investigating near miss events over events with fatal outcome 
* near miss are more common than maternal deaths&lt;ref&gt;list is based on Adisasmita 2008 unless otherwise indicated&lt;/ref&gt;
* their review is likely to yield useful information on the same pathways that lead to severe [[morbidity]] and death,
* investigating the care received may be less threatening to providers because the woman survived
* one can learn from the women themselves since they can be interviewed about the care they received.
* all near misses should be interpreted as free lessons and opportunities to improve the quality of service provision&lt;ref&gt;Tingle 2002:3&lt;/ref&gt;
* it is also clear that maternal deaths merely are the tip of the iceberg of maternal disability. For every woman who dies, many more will survive but often suffer from lifelong disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2003:29&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing interest is reflected in an increasing number of systematic reviews on the prevalence of near miss.&lt;ref&gt;Adisasmita 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dott 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The studies and reviews span 
* analytic attempts to define the concept more strictly,
* descriptive efforts to measure and quantify new indicators (prevalence) of near-miss for different geographical regions etc.
* explanatory efforts of the leading cause for morbidity

==Definition==
The World Health Organization defines a maternal near-miss case as "a woman who nearly died but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy."

==Identification criteria==
According to the World Health Organization, if a woman present any of the conditions below during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy and survive, she is considered as a maternal near miss case.&lt;ref&gt;WHO 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Mesentoblasts''', also called '''4d cells''', are the origins of [[mesoderm]] tissue formation. Mesentoblasts are found in the [[blastopore]] area between the [[endoderm]] and [[ectoderm]].

[[Image:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|17th century cloth painting depicting seven levels of Jain hell and various tortures suffered in them. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over the each hell.]]
{{Jainism}}
'''Naraka''' ([[Sanskrit]]: नरक) is the realm of existence in [[Jain cosmology]] characterized by great suffering. [[Naraka]] is usually translated into English as "[[hell]]" or "[[purgatory]]". However, Naraka differs from the hells of [[Abrahamic religions]] as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, the length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long—measured in billions of years.  A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.

==Types of hells==
These realms are situated in the seven lower levels (''adho lok'') of the universe while the human abode of [[Jambudvip]] is in the middle (''madhya lok'') and the heavenly realms exist above (''urdhva loka''). These layers together, form the shape of a man with arms akimbo (the familiar 'keyhole' shaped emblem of Jainism), with the human realm of Jambudvip at the waist, ''adho lok'' below, ''urdhva lok'' above, and ''siddha lok'' or ''[[siddhashila]]'' (the realm of the [[siddhas]]) at or above the head. Many Jain temples are built to display this cosmology such Jambudvip in Hastinapur and the fifteen story [[Trilok Teerth Dham]] temple in Uttar Pradesh. The seven lower grounds are:

# Ratna prabha.
# Sharkara prabha.
# Valuka prabha.
# Panka prabha.
# Dhuma prabha.
# Tamaha prabha.
# Mahatamaha prabha.

The first ground, owing to a predominance of ''ratnas'' or jewels, is called ''Ratnaprabha''. Similarly, the second, owing to a predominance of ''sarkara'' or gravel, is called ''Sarkraprabha''. The third owing to a predominance of ''valuka'' or sands, is called ''Valukaprabha''. The fourth, owing to an excess of ''panka'' or mud, is called ''Pankaprabha''. The fifth, owing to an excess of ''dhuma'' or smoke, is called ''Dhumaprabha''. The sixth, owing to a marked possession of ''tamas'' or darkness, is called ''Tamahprabha'', while the seventh, owing to a high concentration of ''mahatamas'' or dense darkness, is called ''Mahatamahprabha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L.

==Hellish beings==
The hellish beings ({{lang-sa|नारकीय}}, ''{{transl|sa|Nārakī}}'') are a type of soul which reside in these various hells. They are born in hells by sudden manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =|others=trans. by K. K. Dixit}} pp. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The hellish beings each possess a ''vaikriya''  body (protean body which can transform itself and take various forms). They have a fixed life span in the respective hells where they reside. The minimum life span of hellish beings in the first to seventh hellish grounds is 10000 years, 1 ''sagaropama'' year (Ocean-measured years which are countless years as per [[Jain cosmology]]),&lt;ref group=note&gt;As per the [[Jain cosmology]] ''Sirsapahelika'' is the highest measurable number in Jainism which is 10^194 years. Higher than that is palyopama (pit measured years) which is explained by an analogy of a pit. Accordingly, a hollow pit of 8 x 8 x 8 miles tightly filled with hair particles of seven day old newly born. [A single hair from the above cut into eight pieces seven times = 20,97,152 Particles]. 1 Particle emptied after every 100 years, the time taken to empty the whole pit = 1 Palyopama. (1 Palyopama = countless years.) Hence palyopama is at least greater than 10^194 years. Sagrapoma is 10 Quadrillion Palyopama, that means a Sagrapoma is more than 10^210 Years&lt;/ref&gt; 3 ''sagaropama'' years, 7 ''sagaropama'' years, 10 ''sagaropama'' years, 17 ''sagaropama'' years and 22 ''sagaropama'' years respectively. The maximum life span of hellish beings in the first to sixth hellish grounds is 1 ''sagaropama'' year, 3 ''sagaropama'' years, 7 ''sagaropama'' years, 10 ''sagaropama'' years, 17 ''sagaropama'' years and 22 ''sagaropama'' years respectively. They experience five types of sufferings: bodily pain, inauspicious ''[[Lesya|leśyā]] '' or soul colouring and pariṇāma or physical transformation, from the nature and location of hells, pain inflicted on one other and torture inflicted by mansion-dwelling demi-gods.

==Causes of birth in Hell==
{{Main|Causes of karma in Jainism#Causes of the Narakayus karma or birth in hells}}

In a dialogue between [[Sudharma Swami]] and [[Mahavira]] in the [[Jain text]] [[Sutrakritanga]], [[Mahavira]] speaks of various reasons a soul may take birth in hells:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.) [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]] | title =The Sūtrakritanga | publisher =The Clarendon Press | year =1895 | location =Oxford | language =English| url =http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe45/index.htm | series =[[Sacred Books of the East|Sacred Books of the East vol.45, Part 2]] | isbn =0-7007-1538-X }} verse SK:5.1.1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Sudharma Swami''': What is the punishment in the hells? Knowing it, O sage, tell it me who do not know it! How do sinners go to hell?
: '''Mahavira''': I shall describe the truly insupportable pains where there is distress and (the punishment of) evil deeds. Those cruel sinners who, from a desire of (worldly) life, commit bad deeds, will sink into the dreadful hell which is full of dense darkness and great suffering. He who always kills movable and immovable beings for the sake of his own comfort, who injures them, who takes what is not freely given, who does not learn what is to be practised (viz. control). The impudent sinner, who injures many beings without relenting will go to hell; at the end of his life he will sink to the (place of) darkness; head downwards he comes to the place of torture. The prisoners in hell lose their senses from fright, and do not know in what direction to run. Going to a place like a burning heap of coals on fire, and being burnt they cry horribly; they remain there long, shrieking aloud.

According to Jain scripture, [[Tattvarthasutra]], following are the causes for birth in hell:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250-52&lt;/ref&gt;

#Killing or causing pain with intense passion.
#Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts.
#Vowless and unrestrained life.&lt;ref&gt;refer [[Mahavrata]] for the vows and restraints in Jainism&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Punishment in Hells.jpg|thumb|300px|Tortures in the hells]]

In a dialogue between Sudharma and Mahavira the Jain text Sutrakritanga, Mahavira describes various tortures and sufferings in hells:{{sfn|Jacobi|1895|p=verse SK:5.1.8-27}}
:They cross the horrible [[Vaitarani]], being urged on by arrows, and wounded with spears. The punishers pierce them with darts; they go in the boat, losing their memory; others pierce them with long pikes and tridents, and throw them on the ground. Some, round whose neck big stones are tied, are drowned in deep water. Others again roll about in the Kadambavâlukâ (river) or in burning chaff, and are roasted in it.  And they come to the great impassable hell, full of agony, called Asûrya (i.e. where the sun does not shine), where there is great darkness, where fires, placed above, below, and all around, are blazing. There, as in a cave, being roasted on the fire, he is burned, having lost the reminiscence (of his sins) and consciousness of everything else; always suffering (he comes) to that miserable hot place that is ever ready (for the punishment of evildoers) There the cruel punishers have lighted four fires, and roast the sinners; they are roasted there like fishes put on the fire alive.
:The prisoners in hell come to the dreadful place called Santakshana (i.e. cutting), where the cruel punishers tie their hands and feet, and with axes in their hands cut them like wooden planks. And they turn the writhing victims round, and stew them, like living fishes, in an iron caldron filled with their own blood, their limbs covered with ordure, their heads smashed.

In Hell beings have a life span of innumerable years and are not easily killed even though they endure great torture. Even if they are killed they immediately take birth and are then repeatedly killed. This is described as thus:
:They are not reduced to ashes there, and they do not die of their enormous pains; undergoing this punishment, the miserable men suffer for their misdeeds. And there in the place, where there is constant shivering, they resort to a large burning fire; but they find no relief in that place of torture; the tormentors torture them still. There is heard everywhere the noise of painfully uttered cries even as in the street of a town. Those whose bad Karman takes effect (viz. the punishers), violently torment again and again those whose bad Karman takes effect also (viz. the punished).
:They deprive the sinner of his life; I shall truly tell you how this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) punishment (their victims) of all sins they had committed in a former life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) for the sake of small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.

'''Noah Lindsey Beery''' (August 10, 1913 – November 1, 1994), known professionally as '''Noah Beery Jr.''' or just '''Noah Beery''', was an American actor specializing in warm, friendly character roles similar to the ones played by his paternal uncle, [[Wallace Beery]], although Noah Beery Jr., unlike his more famous uncle, seldom broke away from playing supporting roles. His father, Noah Nicholas Beery (known professionally as Noah Beery or [[Noah Beery Sr.]]), enjoyed a similarly lengthy film career as a major supporting actor.
Beery Jr. was best known for playing [[James Garner]]'s character's father, "Rocky" in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' (1974–80).

==Life and career==
{{one source|section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Noah Beery Sr &amp; Son - Mar 1922 Silverscreen.jpg|right|thumb|Noah Beery Jr. with his father [[Noah Beery Sr.|Noah Beery]] in 1922]]
[[File:Noah Beery, Jr. in The Carson City Kid.jpg|right|thumb|Noah Beery Jr. in 1940]]
Beery was born in New York City, New York, where his father was working as a stage actor. He was given his nickname "Pidge" by [[George M. Cohan]]'s sister Josie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/4984/Noah-Beery-Jr-/biography|title=Noah Beery Jr.|work=New York Times|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to California in 1915 when his father began acting in motion pictures. After attending school in Los Angeles, they moved to a ranch in the [[San Fernando Valley]], a style of living he would maintain for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

At the age of seven, he appeared with his father in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' and like his father, who immediately began billing himself as "Noah Beery Sr.", he went on to become a respected character actor. His paternal uncle, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]]-winning actor [[Wallace Beery]], became the world's highest-paid actor by 1932, and while neither Beery nor his father ever approached that level, both had long and memorable film careers. The three acting Beerys physically closely resembled each other, but Noah Beery Jr. lacked the powerful voice his father and uncle possessed, which is ironic since both older Beerys made major careers in silent movies.

Beery appeared in dozens of films, including a large early role as [[John Wayne]]'s action partner in ''[[The Trail Beyond]]'' (1934; Wayne was 27 years old and Beery was 21), ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939) with [[Cary Grant]],  ''[[20 Mule Team (1940 film)|20 Mule Team]]'' (1940) with his uncle Wallace Beery, and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948), again with John Wayne.

Beery's early television work included a weekly stint as a clown in ''[[Circus Boy]]'' with [[Micky Dolenz]] in the mid-1950s. In 1960, Beery replaced [[Burt Reynolds]] in the co-starring role of Bill Blake on ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', an [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] series starring [[Darren McGavin]].

He appeared once on the religion anthology series ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]'' and on [[Walter Brennan]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[The Real McCoys]]''. He guest-starred three times on the long-running NBC Western series ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in the 1960s, and twice during the same era on ''[[Wagon Train]]''. In 1965, he made two guest appearances on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' (murderer Tony Claus in "The Case of the Golden Venom", and defendant Lucas Tolliver in "The Case of the Hasty Honeymooner").

Beery portrayed the buckskin-clad recurring [[sidekick]] character "Buffalo Baker" in the 17-episode 1967 television series ''[[Hondo (TV series)|Hondo]]'' starring [[Ralph Taeger]], a role played by [[Ward Bond]] in the original [[3D film|3D]] [[Hondo (film)|John Wayne film]]. But Beery is best known for his role as Joseph "Rocky" Rockford, the father of Jim Rockford, [[James Garner]]'s character on ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' (1974–80).

==Death==
Beery died on November 1, 1994 in [[Tehachapi, California]] of a [[thrombus|cerebral thrombosis]], aged 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-02/news/mn-57647_1_character-actor-noah-beery-jr|title=Noah Beery Jr.; Film, TV Character Actor|last=Staff|first=From Times|date=1994-11-02|last2=Reports|first2=Wire|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 3178-3184), McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beery Jr.'s first wife until 1966 was Maxine Jones, the only child of Western star [[Buck Jones]]. His second wife from 1968 until his death was Lisa Thorman. He had two daughters, Muffett and Melissa; a son, actor Bucklind Beery; and three step-children, Page, Sean, and Lorena Slattery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/obituaries/noah-beery-jr-81-an-actor-known-for-playing-sidekicks.html|title=Noah Beery Jr., 81, an Actor Known for Playing Sidekicks|date=1994-11-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 1960, he received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his contributions to the television industry, located at 7021 [[Hollywood Boulevard|Hollywood Blvd.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/noah-beery-jr|title=Noah Beery Jr.|website=walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/noah-beery-jr|title=Noah Beery Jr. profile|website=latimes.com|accessdate=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''pidyon haben''''' ({{lang-he-n|פדיון הבן}}) or '''redemption of the first-born son'''&lt;ref&gt;
* Eugene Joseph Cohen (1984), ''Guide to ritual circumcision and redemption of the first-born son'', Volume 1: "The Redemption of the First-Born – A mother's first-born is to be dedicated to the service of God, in accordance with the verse, "Sanctify the first-born who opens the womb." This sanctification was the result of an historical event."
* Michele Klein (2000), ''A Time to Be Born: Customs and Folklore of Jewish Birth'', p. 224: "They have attributed healing properties to the stick. 54 Redemption of the First-Born Son. A first child has special significance for both parents, and this was as true in biblical times as today, but then only when the child was male"
* Mark Washofsky (2001), ''Jewish living: a guide to contemporary reform practice'', p. 148: "Redemption of the First-born Son (Pidyon Haben) – In Jewish tradition, the first-born son is to be "redeemed" from God. This originates in the belief that God "acquired" the Israelite first-born by sparing them from makkat bekhorot"
* Ruth Langer (2005), ''To Worship To Worship God Properly: Tensions Between Liturgical Custom and Halakhah in Judaism (Monographs of the Hebrew Union College Series)'', p. 73 ("Redemption of the First Born").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt; is a [[mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]] whereby a Jewish firstborn son is "redeemed" by use of silver coins from his birth-state of sanctity, i.e. from being predestined by his firstborn status to serve as a priest.

The redemption is attained by giving five silver coins to a [[Kohen]] (a patrilineal descendant of the priestly family of [[Aaron]]).

==Biblical references==
In the [[Hebrew Bible]] the laws (see [[mitzvah]]) concerning the redemption of the first-born male are referred to in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Leviticus]]:
{{quotation|Exodus 13:13–o916 Every firstborn of man among your sons, you shall redeem. And it will come to pass that if your son asks you in the future, saying, “What is this?” you shall say to him, “With a mighty hand did God take us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. And it came to pass when Pharaoh was too stubborn to let us out, God slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt."}}
The redemption price was set at 5 [[shekels]] for each of 273 surplus firstborn Israelites over and above the Levite totals (there was no separate census for firstborn Levites):{{quotation|Numbers 3:45–47 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborns among the children of Israel . . . You shall take five shekels per head, according to the holy shekel, by which the shekel is twenty gerahs.}} The redemption has been seen as part of the "natural evolution from animal sacrifice to a money substitute,"&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Thompson ''Penitence and Sacrifice in Early Israel Outside the Levitical Law'' 1963, p. 102 "natural evolution from animal sacrifice to a money substitute, which is seen, for example in the redemption of the first-born.1 The Ugaritic references to 'dSdm have been claimed to support the view, both of an offering, and of a monetary ..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of redemption money occurs also in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Ugaritic]] (Canaan) texts, but not in the same function.&lt;ref&gt;''The IVP Bible Background Commentary: Old Testament'' [[John H. Walton]], [[Victor H. Matthews]], Mark W. Chavalas - 2000 p. 144  "3:47–51. redemption money. The concept of ransom or redemption money occurs both in 'Akkadian (Babylonian) and 'Ugaritic (Canaanite) texts, though not in this same function. The nation here bought back its firstborn from God by "trading" ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Specific references to redemption of the first-born son in Ugaritic texts are disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Wyatt ''Religious Texts from Ugarit'' 2nd Edition. p. 123 "Your son will have the appetite of a bull calf 39" footnote "39 Alternatively, may this be construed as the lung of a calf (npS 'gl) which will be offered as a sacrifice of redemption for a first-born son? (Cf. Exod. 13.11–15.) But such an interpretation would not be compatible with the threat of Mot's next words."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The [[Shulkhan Arukh]] states that when a Jewish woman gives birth to a firstborn male by natural means,&lt;ref&gt;i.e. vaginally and not by [[Caesarean section]]&lt;/ref&gt; then the child must be "redeemed".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' 305:1&lt;/ref&gt; The father&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' 305:2&lt;/ref&gt; of the child must "redeem" the child from a known [[Kohen]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' 305:3&lt;/ref&gt; representing the original [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] priesthood, for the sum of five silver [[Shekels]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; or equivalent in  country's currency (if it has silver currency of the correct weight). The procedure does not apply when the father is a [[Kohen]] or [[Levite]], and does not normally apply when the mother is the daughter of one.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' 305:18&lt;/ref&gt;

This redemption ceremony is performed when at least thirty days have passed since the child's birth.   If the 31st day falls on [[Shabbat]] or a [[Jewish holiday|festival]], the redemption is delayed, because any sort of business transaction is not allowed on those days.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' 305:11&lt;/ref&gt;    These days are counted from sunset to sunset, and the day of birth counts as the first day.  While the redemption could be performed immediately after dark on the 31st night, it is usually done the next day; but if the 31st day is a [[Ta'anit|fast day]], it is done the previous night, so that it can be accompanied by a festive meal.&lt;ref&gt;Shach 305:12&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible to hold the ceremony on the 30th day itself, if it will be impossible to perform it the next day, so long as at least one [[Synodic month]] (29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.9 seconds) has passed since the moment of birth.&lt;ref&gt;Shach 305:19, at the end, citing the Bach.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exemptions===

If a woman gives birth to a second son naturally when the first son was born by Caesarean section, that child is not redeemed either.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' 305:24&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a first-born male does not require redemption if his birth was preceded by an earlier miscarriage by the mother that occurred after the third month of pregnancy. However, if the miscarriage occurred during the first 40 days of pregnancy, redemption is required. If the previous miscarriage occurred after forty days, but before the fetus developed distinguishing characteristics, redemption of the first-born is still required, but the blessing said by the father is omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Levites]], including [[Kohen|''Kohanim'']], do not redeem their children through the Pidyon HaBen ceremony. The reason is that the Levites, as substitutes for the first-born, are pledged to minister and assist the ''kohanim'' in Divine service, and cannot be redeemed from this service obligation.

The children of daughters of Levites and Kohanim are not redeemed either. According to some authorities, however, a child whose mother is a ''Bat Kohen'' and whose father is a non-Jew requires a Pidyon HaBen ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5762/chukat62/pp.htm|title=Orthodox Union, NCSY Newsletter Torah Tidbits, Parshat Chukat 5762|author=|date=|website=ou.org|accessdate=17 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064308/http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5762/chukat62/pp.htm|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceremony ==
[[File:Presentation of the first-born, 1724, from Juedisches Ceremoniel.jpg|220px|right|thumb|''Presentation of the First-born'' (1724), from ''Juedisches Ceremoniel'']]
In the traditional ceremony, the father brings the child to the [[Kohen]] and recites a formula, or responds to ritual questions, indicating that this is the Israelite mother's firstborn son and he has come to redeem him as commanded in the Torah. If the family is sephardic, the Kohen asks the mother if the child is indeed her firstborn son and if she did not miscarry in the past. The Kohen asks the father which he would rather have, the child or the five silver [[shekel]]s which he must pay. The father states that he prefers the child to the money, then he recites a blessing and hands over five silver coins (or an equivalent amount of total silver). The Kohen holds the coins over the child and declares that the redemption price is received and accepted in place of the child. He then blesses the child. (Note: The Kohen would not receive the child if the father would refuse to redeem the boy. The function of the question&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siddur Nachlas Shimon/ The Artscroll Weekday Siddur|publisher=Mesorah Publications, Ltd.|isbn=0899066682|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; is merely to endear the mitzvah to the father.)

The ceremony traditionally takes place before a [[minyan]] of 10 men. The child is sometimes presented on a silver tray, surrounded by jewelry lent for the occasion by women in attendance. This is to contrast with the Golden Calf, when gold and jewelry was used for a sinful purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/197,2068468/What-are-some-customs-observed-at-a-Pidyon-Haben.html|title=What are some customs observed at a Pidyon Haben? - life cycle pidyon haben mitzvot|author=|date=|website=www.askmoses.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event starts by beginning a [[se'udath mitzvah|festive meal]], (unlike a Brit Mila or Wedding &lt;ref&gt;RabbiKaganoff.com/archives/251&lt;/ref&gt; where the meal follows). If the family is sephardic, the event starts with the ceremony. Guests in some places are given cloves of garlic and cubes of sugar to take home: these strongly flavored foods can be used to flavor a large quantity of food which will in some sense extend the mitzvah of participation in the ceremony to all who eat them.

If a first-born son reaches [[bar mitzvah]] age without having been redeemed, he is responsible for arranging the mitzvah himself as soon as possible.

== Coins ==
Contemporary religious authorities believe that the ''Shekel HaKodesh'' (Holy Shekel) of the Temple was larger and of purer silver content than the standard [[Shekel]] used for trade in ancient Israel. [[Halakha]] requires that the coins used have a requisite total amount of actual silver. There are varying opinions as to the correct amount of silver, they fall in between 100&amp;nbsp;grams and 117&amp;nbsp;grams. Coins which do not contain the requisite amount of silver do not result in a valid redemption.

The Israeli Mint has minted special edition 23.4&amp;nbsp;gram silver commemorative coins for the purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kveller.com/baby_and_toddler/Circumcision_/Pidyon_Haben.shtml|title=Pidyon Haben|author=|date=16 September 2010|website=kveller.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; five of which would come to exactly 117&amp;nbsp;grams of silver.  Pre-1936 American [[Dollar (United States coin)|silver dollars]] weigh 26.73&amp;nbsp;grams of 90% silver content and hence contain 24.06g of pure silver, although such coins have become increasingly rare (modern U.S. coins contain no silver). Four [[American Silver Eagle]] coins, specially minted coins sold to collectors and investors which contain 31.1035&amp;nbsp;grams of 99.9% pure silver, or five of the above-mentioned specially minted silver coins of Israel are commonly used for Pidyon Ha-Ben in the United States. One may use silver bullion as well; it is not necessary for it to be a coin per se.

Though the silver coins are the payment to the Kohen under [[Torah Laws|torah law]] and are one of the [[twenty-four kohanic gifts]], they are sometimes returned by the Kohen to the family as a gift for the child, although halachic authorities stipulate that, for the Pidyon to be valid, the choice of returning the coins as a gift rest {{em|entirely}} upon the Kohen whereas pressuring the kohen to do so would render the redemption invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Responsa "[[Chsam Sofer]]", to Yoreh Deah, Chap. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pidyon Certificate===
Some kohens officiating for the pidyon ceremony will present the father with a "Pidyon HaBen Certificate" of the pidyon transaction, the certificate will usually be framed for display and may serve as a receipt (and evidence) that the transaction was done according to [[halacha]] (i.e. the kohen was not pressured to return the coins), with the kohen and two witnesses ("[[Eidim]]") affixing their signatures at the time of the pidyon ceremony.

== Women and Pidyon HaBen ==
{{main|bat kohen}}
Some Orthodox authorities,{{who?|date=March 2014}} citing a passage in the [[Talmud]] ([[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 8a) describing such an event, permit a male non-[[Kohen]] married to a Bat Kohen (daughter of a male Kohen) to accept Pidyon HaBen money on the Bat Kohen's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lind.org.il/features/bnotkohanim_v24.htm Midreshet Lindenbaum, Bnot Kohanim: Our Holy Daughters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118061402/http://www.lind.org.il/features/bnotkohanim_v24.htm |date=2009-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of a Bat Kohen accepting Pidyon HaBen money on her own behalf is a matter of discussion in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] but is not currently done in practice following a lengthy responsa on the topic by [[Joseph Saul Nathanson]].

==Frequency of ceremony==

Pidyon HaBen is a relatively rare ceremony.  It is not performed if the firstborn is a girl, born by caesarian section, preceded by a miscarriage, or if either grandfather is a Kohen or a Levi.

== Traditional Jewish interpretation ==
[[File:Pidyon HaBen P6020058.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The silver tray, the silver coins and the glass for the wine]]
According to the traditional rabbinic interpretation, in the early part of the [[Bible]], as recorded in the [[Book of Genesis]], the duties of a priest fell upon the eldest son of each family. The first-born was to be dedicated to God in order to perform this task.

Following the [[Israelite]] Exodus from Egypt, after the nation had sinned with the [[Golden Calf]], the priesthood was taken away from the first-borns, and given to the tribe of [[Tribe of Levi|Levites]], specifically to the [[Kohanim]], that is: [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] [[Aaron]], his children, and their descendants. At the same time it was instituted that the first born of each family should be ''redeemed''; i.e. they would be 'bought back' from the dedication to God that would previously have been required of them. Levites were substituted for the first-born and wholly given to Divine service:

:And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given unto him from the children of Israel.
:And I behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be Mine. For all the first-born are Mine: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast, Mine they shall be: I am the {{LORD}}.' ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 3:9, 12–13)

The first-born male of every clean animal was to be given up to the priest for sacrifice ([[Deuteronomy]] 12:6; [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 13:12, 34:20; Numbers 18:15–17). The first-born of an ass, if not redeemed, was to be put to death (Exodus 13:13; 34:20). There is no need for redemption by any other unclean animal, for the firstborn status only applies to clean animals (Leviticus 27:27. See Rashi there. Also see Rashi to Exodus 34:19).

'''''Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765–1775''''' is a book that examines the role of nonviolent struggle in the period before the [[American Revolution]]. Edited by Walter H. Conser, Jr., Ronald M. McCarthy, [[David J. Toscano]] and [[Gene Sharp]], the book was published in the United States in 1986. It argues that the [[Stamp Act]] resistance and other campaigns from 1765 to 1775 were fundamental for shaping the outcome of the struggle for American independence, and were not merely a "prelude" to armed conflict.

Nonviolent resistance was at the heart of these campaigns, but key features of this nonviolence have been largely neglected by historians. To fill this perceived gap, the book provides a sustained narrative of the 1765–1775 resistance, followed by a set of interpretive essays aimed to provoke further discussion and inquiry. Six hypothetical explanations are offered for why the colonists shifted to military struggle, despite the considerable success of nonviolent struggle.
Reviews have appeared in several historical and legal journals.&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;

In their preface, the editors state that their interest in the historical period covered in ''RPASI'' began in the 1970s, when they were studying [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]] as a pragmatic tool of civilian struggle. In their work, they

{{Quote|discovered a large number of events in [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial history]] - [[boycott]]s, nonimportation, noncooperation, and [[protest]] demonstrations of many kinds - all of which could be described as examples of nonviolent action [and] the incidence and success... seemed so significant that we were surprised that the subject had received so little attention. Although many scholars have described the decade in great detail, the richness and importance of the nonviolent activity was lost because of their emphasis on a seemingly inevitable rush toward war.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|ix}}}}

[[File:SamuelAdamsSmall.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=.35|alt=Samuel Adams portrait closeup|&amp;ldquo;I beseech you... to avoid Blood and Tumult.... Nothing can ruin us but our Violence.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;[[Samuel Adams]], 1774.&lt;ref name=samadams1774&gt;Quoted on page v of ''RPASI''. In a letter from [[Samuel Adams]] to  James Warren, 21 May 1774.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Indeed, "researchers often look throughout the length of a period for evidence of what they regard as its inevitable outcome... for example... for the roots of war.... In the process, they... may ignore the contributions of alternative means to the outcome."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} An example is that "[[Samuel Adams]], whom many... associate with the tactics of violence, issued numerous statements prior to [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] opposing the use of armed force"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} (see quote at left).

The book project was originally conceived due to recognition by co-editor [[Gene Sharp]], a leading scholar of nonviolent struggle, that the American colonists had "employed the techniques of nonviolent resistance" &lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|xi}} in their struggle against Great Britain.&lt;ref name=sharpthank&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The preface states that Sharp "has been unfailingly helpful in the other editors' attempt to understand the significance of these actions and has been centrally responsible for placing this work within the context of contemporary Anglo-American scholarship. Editors Conser, McCarthy, and [[David J. Toscano|Toscano]] wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge their great debt to [[Gene Sharp]] and his efforts to make the work as complete and rigorous as possible|''RPASI'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The book was sponsored by [[Harvard University]]'s Center for International Affairs, and by the [[Albert Einstein Institution]],&lt;ref&gt;"A book from the Program on Nonviolent Sanctions in Conflict and Defense, Center for International Affairs, [[Harvard University]] and the [[Albert Einstein Institution]]" (''RPASI'', p. ii).&lt;/ref&gt; both led by Sharp. 
The editors claim that the book "if read carefully, is likely to spark scholarly controversy and argument," and that they "believe that such debate can clarify the issues... and enhance the understanding of this critical decade in our history."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|x}}

''Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765-1775'' contains 14 chapters that are intended to "relate integrally to one another and provide a complete narrative of the period [of 1765-1775]."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|x}} These chapters are listed in the table at right.

After the first introductory chapter, the next 7 chapters contain the book's "narrative section,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} which focuses on describing the struggles from 1765 to 1775 chronologically, using the "terminology of the day,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} and only "rarely [making] use of the term &amp;lsquo;nonviolent action.&amp;rsquo;"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}}
The book's final 6 chapters are analytical, offering interpretations of the decade's events. These chapters address questions raised in the narrative section, and also suggest areas for future research.

Basic concepts are introduced in Chapter 1, which gives an overview of the three main resistance campaigns of 1765 to 1775 opposing the [[Stamp Act of 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765, the [[Townsend Acts]] of 1767, and the [[Intolerable Acts|Coercive Acts]] of 1774. Nonviolent action is described as a technique that operates to bring about change through serving to "manipulate the shared social, cultural, economic and political system in which the opposing parties engage in conflict."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|15}} Citing Sharp's ''[[Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'', they divide methods of nonviolent action into the three categories of ''nonviolent protest and persuasion'', ''noncooperation'', and ''nonviolent intervention''. Nonviolent action succeeds by "rendering the opponent's sources of power unusable, unworkable, and uncontrollable,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|16}} through mechanisms that may include conversion, accommodation, or "nonviolent coercion [that] occurs when an opponent is forced against his or her will to grant the actionists' demands."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|16}}

{{Quote|The most dramatic use of nonviolent intervention on the part of the colonists is found in their creation of new governmental bodies such as the provincial congresses and conventions. By receiving overwhelming support from the populace, these extralegal bodies and their local counterparts effectively replaced the Crown's established government in the colonies.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|15}}}}

The editors argue (Ch. 1) that previous scholarship has overlooked "the degree to which the colonists used a kind of 'weapons system' that operated without force of arms or violence in trying to compel the British government to change its policies."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|4}} Viewed from this angle, commercial resistance (nonimportation) is analyzed closely (Ch. 9). It is apparent that the colonists' skill in applying the methods of nonviolent struggle "improved greatly over the decade," as did the "intellectual underpinnings"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|19}} of their resistance (Chs. 10, 11).

Still, at the close of the decade, the nonviolent movement was abandoned in favor of military resistance, and the editors discuss six alternative hypothetical explanations for why this shift occurred (Ch. 12; see table at right). The hypothetical explanations are not meant as mutually exclusive, but as "avenues for fruitful inquiry."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|453}} Indeed,

{{Quote|The editors believe that definitive conclusions are premature at this time and await the future efforts of skillful scholars sensitive to the issues raised in this volume. What actually went on in the "minds and hearts" of the colonists... will always be difficult to assess [but] the historical record is present for serious examination.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|453}}}}

[[John Adams]] (quoted above right), who lived through and helped lead the independence struggle, claimed that "The revolution was... substantially effected before hostilities commenced."&lt;ref name=johnadams1815/&gt; McCarthy (Ch. 14) argues that "independence in many of the colonies had essentially been achieved prior to the commencement of military hostilities at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|20}}

In the ''[[Journal of Southern History]]'', Mills wrote of ''RPASI'' that "Although the work covers familiar ground, the approach is fresh and the treatment is stimulating. The interpretative theme is certain to provoke debate."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}
He added that "The criticisms one might make of this study are cosmetic (e.g., the considerable variations in the sizes of several chapters) rather than substantive."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}

In the ''[[Journal of American History]]'', Ireland commended the historical essays as shedding light on important aspects of the American Revolution, stating that "having them collected together in one place is useful."&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|242}} He was critical of most chapters by the editors as "much less valuable,"&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|242}} and came away feeling "that I have missed the point, or that there is no point here of any great moment for a historian."&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|243}}

In ''Law and History Review'', Roeber wrote that ''RPASI'' "includes stimulating essays by ten authors, four British,"&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|164}} and

{{Quote|The British contributors... present an image of British domestic tactics of resistance, and ministerial policy on the use of the military that is quite striking.... an impressive documentation of what one might call an eighteenth-century British ethic of restraint, both on the part of aggrieved complainants, and authorities faced with fractious subjects.&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|164}}}}

But in the American colonial frontier, "military tactics were acknowledged by all to be more vicious than those employed in European conflicts."&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|165}} Thus, for Roeber, "One comes away from this rich and stimulating series of essays with the disturbing sense that Americans had, at the very time of the Republic's founding, been swept up on a tide of violent resistance that fit with their colonial frontier experience."&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Mills wrote that "One can hope that the challenge to conduct more research into the period from 1774 to 1775 and the shift from nonviolent to violent action will be heeded."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}

'''Rex Bell''' (born '''George Francis Beldam'''; October 16, 1903 &amp;ndash; July 4, 1962) was an American [[actor]] and [[politician]]. He was a [[Western movie]] star married to actress [[Clara Bow]], and the 21st [[Lieutenant Governor of Nevada|Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Nevada]].

==Film career==
Bell made his film debut in ''Wild West Romance'' in 1928,&lt;ref name="fga"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rex Bell: Nevada's Goodwill Ambassador |journal=Films of the Golden Age |date=Winter 2017-2018 |issue=91 |pages=58-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to act in a number of films, mostly [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], in which he had the lead role. He left the movie industry in 1936, although he had generally small roles in a few later films.

In 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= J.M.|last= KALIL |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= WALKING BOX RANCH: Sale brings less than third of asking price|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2000/Dec-20-Wed-2000/news/15071459.html |work= [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |publisher= |date=2000-12-20 |accessdate=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell and his wife, actress Clara Bow, founded the [[Walking Box Ranch]],&lt;ref name=lvrj20001119&gt;{{cite news |first= J.M.|last= KALIL |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Ranch sells for $650,000|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2000/Nov-19-Sun-2000/news/14859959.html |work= [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |publisher= |date=2000-11-19 |accessdate=2009-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Searchlight, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reid, Harry|authorlink=Harry Reid|title=Searchlight: The Camp That Didn't Fail|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2b9aEAtOkv4C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Rex+bell%22+searchlight#v=onepage&amp;q=rex%20bell&amp;f=false|publisher=University of Nevada Press|page=103|isbn=0874177537|date=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His final film appearance was a brief cameo as a cowboy in [[John Huston]]'s film ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), which was shot on location in Nevada. He appeared in the film with actress [[Marilyn Monroe]], who died a month after Bell in the summer of 1962.

==Political career==

In 1944, Bell ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ticket against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Berkeley Bunker]]. The ''[[Nevada State Journal]]'' commented on November 1: "He has made friends where ever he appeared, but consensus is that the time is too short to overcome a handicap of not being so well known as his opponent".&lt;ref&gt;Nevada State Journal, November 1, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; The election was held November 7, and Bell got 19,096 votes while Bunker received 36,648.&lt;ref&gt;Nevada State Journal, November 18, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell was the leader of the [[Nevada Republican Party]] and in 1948 was an alternate to the [[1948 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. He was also active in the Nevada Chamber of Commerce and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevadaday.com/parade/grandmarshals/1953.htm Nevada Day Grand Marshals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ties Bell forged during those years helped him win the Lieutenant Governor's office in 1954.  That year, [[Charles H. Russell]], the incumbent Republican governor, also won.  In 1958, Democrat Grant Sawyer unseated Russell, but Bell won re-election as Lieutenant Governor (Bell and his Nevada state political position are mentioned in [[John D. MacDonald]]'s 1960 novel ''The Only Girl in the Game''). He died in office of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1962.

==Other activities==
===Television===
Bell was host of the program ''Cowboys and Injuns'' in 1950. It began on a station in Los Angeles&lt;ref name=fga/&gt; and went on to be broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

'''Sensemaking''' is the process by which people give [[semantics|meaning]] to their collective experiences. It is often formally defined as "the ongoing retrospective development of plausible images that rationalize what people are doing" ([[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick, Sutcliffe, &amp; Obstfeld, 2005, p. 409]]). The concept was introduced to [[organizational studies]] by [[Karl E. Weick]] in the 1970s and has affected both theory and practice. The concept was intended to encourage a shift away from the traditional focus of organization theorists on [[decision-making]] and towards the processes that constitute the meaning of the decisions that are enacted in behavior.

==Roots in social psychology==

In 1966, [[Daniel Katz (psychologist)|Daniel Katz]] and [[Robert L. Kahn]] published their highly influential book ''The Social Psychology of Organizations'' ([[#Reference-Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. 1966|Katz &amp; Kahn, 1966]]). In 1969, Karl Weick played on this title in his seminal ''The Social Psychology of Organizing'', shifting the focus from organizations as entities to organiz''ing'' as an activity. It was especially the second edition, published ten years later ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1979|Weick, 1979]]) that established Weick's approach in organization studies.

==Properties==

Weick identified seven properties of sensemaking ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]):

# ''Identity'' and identification is central&amp;nbsp;– who people think they are in their context shapes what they enact and how they interpret events ([[#Reference-Pratt, M.G. 2000|Pratt, 2000]]; [[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick, et al., 2005]]; [[#Reference-Thurlow, A., &amp; Mills, J. 2009|Thurlow &amp; Mills, 2009]]; [[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 2009|Watson, 2009]]).
# ''Retrospection'' provides the opportunity for sensemaking: the point of retrospection in time affects what people notice ([[#Reference-Dunford, R., &amp; Jones, D. 2000|Dunford &amp; Jones, 2000]]), thus attention and interruptions to that attention are highly relevant to the process ([[#Reference-Gephart, R. P. 1993|Gephart, 1993]]).
# People ''enact'' the environments they face in dialogues and narratives ([[#Reference-Bruner, J. 1991|Bruner, 1991]]; [[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 1998|Watson, 1998]]; [[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]). As people speak, and build narrative accounts, it helps them understand what they think, organize their experiences and control and predict events ([[#Reference-Isabella, L. A. 1990|Isabella, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]; [[#Reference-Abolafia, M. 2010|Abolafia, 2010]]) and reduce complexity in the context of change management ([[#Reference-Kumar, P. and Singhal, M. 2012|Kumar &amp; Singhal, 2012]]).
# Sensemaking is a ''social'' activity in that plausible stories are preserved, retained or shared ([[#Reference-Isabella, L. A. 1990|Isabella, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Maitlis, S. 2005|Maitlis, 2005]]). However, the audience for sensemaking includes the speakers themselves ([[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 1995|Watson, 1995]]) and the narratives are "both individual and shared...an evolving product of conversations with ourselves and with others" ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]: 565).
# Sensemaking is ''ongoing'', so Individuals simultaneously shape and react to the environments they face. As they project themselves onto this environment and observe the consequences they learn about their identities and the accuracy of their accounts of the world ([[#Reference-Thurlow, A., &amp; Mills, J. 2009|Thurlow &amp; Mills, 2009]]). This is a feedback process so even as individuals deduce their identity from the behaviour of others towards them, they also try to influence this behaviour. As Weick argued, "The basic idea of sensemaking is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs" ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick, 1993]]: 635).
# People ''extract cues'' from the context to help them decide on what information is relevant and what explanations are acceptable ([[#Reference-Salancick, G., &amp; Pfeffer, J. 1978|Salancick &amp; Pfeffer, 1978]]; [[#Reference-Brown, A. D., Stacey, P., &amp; Nandhakumar, J. 2007|Brown, Stacey, &amp; Nandhakumar, 2007]]). Extracted cues provide points of reference for linking ideas to broader networks of meaning and are 'simple, familiar structures that are seeds from which people develop a larger sense of what may be occurring." ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]: 50).
# People favour ''plausibility over accuracy'' in accounts of events and contexts ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]; [[#Reference-Brown, A. D. 2005|Brown, 2005]]; [[#Reference-Abolafia, M. 2010|Abolafia, 2010]]): "in an equivocal, postmodern world, infused with the politics of interpretation and conflicting interests and inhabited by people with multiple shifting identities, an obsession with accuracy seems fruitless, and not of much practical help, either" ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]: 61).

Each of these seven aspects interact and intertwine as individuals interpret events. Their interpretations become evident through [[narrative]]s&amp;nbsp;– written and spoken&amp;nbsp;– which convey the sense they have made of events ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]), as well as through [[diagrammatic reasoning]] and associated material practices ([[#Reference-Huff, A. S. 1990|Huff, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Stigliani, I., &amp; Ravasi, D. 2012|Stigliani &amp; Ravasi, 2012]]).

==From decision-making to sensemaking==

The rise of the sensemaking perspective marks a shift of focus in organization studies from how decisions shape organizations to how meaning drives organizing ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick, 1993]]). The aim was to focus attention on the largely cognitive activity of framing experienced situations as meaningful. It is a collaborative process of creating shared awareness and understanding out of different individuals' perspectives and varied interests.

==From planning to action==

Sensemaking scholars are less interested in the intricacies of planning than in the details of action ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995, p. 55]]).

==Uncertainty, ambiguity, and crisis==
The sensemaking approach is often used to provide insight into factors that surface as organizations address either uncertain or ambiguous situations ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1988|Weick 1988]], [[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|1993]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick et al., 2005]]). Beginning in the 1980s with an influential re-analysis of the Bhopal disaster, Weick's name has come to be associated with the study of the situated sensemaking that influences the outcomes of disasters ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick 1993]]).

== Categories and related concepts ==

A 2014 review of the literature on sensemaking in organizations identified a dozen different categories of sensemaking and a half-dozen sensemaking related concepts ([[#Reference-Maitlis, S. &amp; Christianson, M. 2014|Maitlis &amp; Christianson, 2014]]). The categories of sensemaking included: constituent-minded, cultural, ecological, environmental, future-oriented, intercultural, interpersonal, market, political, prosocial, prospective, and resourceful. The sensemaking-related concepts included: sensebreaking, sensedemanding, sense-exchanging, sensegiving, sensehiding, and sense specification.

==Other applications==

Sensemaking is central to the conceptual framework for military [[network-centric operations]] (NCO) espoused by the [[United States Department of Defense]] ([[#Reference-Garstka, J. and Alberts, D. 2004|Garstka and Alberts, 2004]]). In a joint/coalition military environment, sensemaking is complicated by numerous technical, social, organizational, cultural, and operational factors. A central hypothesis of NCO is that the quality of shared sensemaking and collaboration will be better in a "robustly networked" force than in a platform-centric force, empowering people to make better decisions. According to NCO theory, there is a mutually-reinforcing relationship among and between individual sensemaking, shared sensemaking, and collaboration.

In defense applications, sensemaking theorists have primarily focused on how shared awareness and understanding are developed within [[command and control]] organizations at the operational level. At the tactical level, individuals monitor and assess their immediate physical environment in order to predict where different elements will be in the next moment. At the operational level, where the situation is far broader, more complex and more uncertain, and evolves over hours and days, the organization must collectively make sense of enemy dispositions, [[intention]]s and capabilities, as well as anticipate the (often unintended) effects of own-force actions on a complex [[system of systems]].

Sensemaking has been studied in the patient safety literature ([[#Reference-Battles, et al. 2006|Battles, et al. 2006]]). It has been used as a conceptual framework for identifying and detecting high risk patient situations. For example, [[#Reference-Rhodes, et al. 2015|Rhodes, et al. (2015)]] examined sensemaking and the co-production of safety of primary medical care patients.

'''The Network''' is an organization in [[The Hardy Boys]] Casefiles book series.    

The Network is a top-secret [[government agency]] in the same branch as the [[CIA]] and [[FBI]], but even to most people in those organizations, The Network is unknown.  After the events of Casefiles #6 ''The Crowning Terror'' and [[Ultra-Thriller]] #2 ''The Alien Factor'', The Network took over control of everything that Espionage Resources (another top-secret government agency) ran, due to high corruption in that agency.  

[[Frank Hardy (The Hardy Boys)|Frank]] and [[Joe Hardy (The Hardy Boys)|Joe Hardy]] (the Hardy boys of the title) first found out about The Network (in ''[[Dead on Target (The Hardy Boys)|Dead on Target]]'') when they met one of the agency’s best agents, the [[The Gray Man (The Hardy Boys)|Gray Man]].  At the time the Hardys were investigating a car bombing that had killed Joe’s girlfriend, [[Iola Morton]].  The Gray Man offered to help find the person who planted the bomb, the Hardys accepted his offer and with his help Frank and Joe learned that it was not a person that planted the bomb, but The Network’s worst enemy - a worldwide group of terrorist group that calls themselves [[The Assassins (The Hardy Boys)|The Assassins]].  Since then the Hardys have worked with the Network on many cases.

'''Thermal trauma''' is any burn-related [[injury]] that can potentially lead to serious outcomes. There are various causes of thermal trauma, including fire, radiant heat, radiation, chemical, or electrical contact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1975728-overview|work=Medscape|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can affect a person in many ways based on factors from anatomical and physiological factors. Depending on the severity of the burns, quick management and transport to an appropriate burn facility may be necessary to prevent loss of life.  Various classification scales exist for use with thermal trauma to determine the severity of the burns, which is used to determine the resources used and for statistical collection. The initial assessment is critical in determining the extent of injuries and what will be needed to manage an injury, and treating immediate life threats.

==Classification==
Burn injuries are generally classified by either severity, the location of damage, or a combination of both.

Various scales exist to provide a quantifiable metric to measure the severity of burn-related injuries. The value can be used for [[triage|triaging]] a patient or for statistical analysis. Burn injury scales measure damage to anatomical parts, physiological values (blood pressure etc.), [[comorbidity|comorbidities]] or a combination of those.
