==Early life and career==

Bousteila Bousteila was born in [[Aïn M'lila]]in [[Oum el-Bouaghi]] on 8 April 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menas.co.uk/documents/Algeria's%20Perfect%20Storm%20-%20Jeremy%20Keenan%20-%20Menas%20Associates%20-%2031.03.10.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-09 |title=Algeria's Perfect Storm }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is suggested that he may take the helm at the ministry of defence. He joined the FLN Army as a Conscript in 1962 during the final stages of the War of Independence, and after Independence moved up the ranks to secure a commission from the Military Academy. He was commissioned into the Army Signal Corps in 1965 and transferred to the Gendarmerie in 1969. He was trained in Intelligence work in the Soviet Union. In 1991 he was promoted to Brigadier General and Commander of the 12th Gendarmerie Brigade. In 1996 he was promoted to Major General and Commander of the 2nd Security Division i.e. covering all Gendarmerie Divisions in North-Western Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaintelligence.fr/MC-/who-s-who/2006/03/23/ahmed-boustila%2C18501838-BRE-login|accessdate=2010-11-09|title=Ahmed Bousteila - Algerie - Maghreb Confidentiel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
he was promoted to [[Lieutenant general]] rank on 5 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2015/09/10/bousteila-nouba-gendarmer_n_8118118.html|accessdate=2015-09-13|title=huffpostmaghreb Algerie - Le général-major Menad Nouba nouveau chef de la gendarmerie, Ahmed Bousteila à la retraite}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was involved in the Algerian government's rollout of [[biometric passport]]s and also ordered increased security measures on roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echoroukonline.com/eng/index.php?news=11092|accessdate=2010-11-09|title=Echorouk Online - Algeria mobilises 40,000 gendarmes to secure East-West Motorway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Finlay Walls''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 1928) is a British historian of [[Missiology|missions]], best known for his pioneering studies of the history of the African church and a pioneer in the academic field of [[World Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Burrows |editor-first1=William R.|editor-last2=Gornik |editor-first2=Mark R. |editor-last3=McLean |editor-first3=Janice A.|title=Understanding World Christianity: The Vision and Work of Andrew F. Walls |location=Maryknoll, NY|publisher=Orbis Books |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Walls was born in 1928 in [[New Milton]], England. He studied theology at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], receiving a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first-class degree]] in 1948, and completed his graduate studies in the [[Early Christianity|early Church]] in 1956 under the [[patristics]] scholar [[Frank Leslie Cross]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Brian|date=October 2001|title=Profile of Andrew Walls|journal=Epworth Review|volume=28|issue=4|pages=16–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at [[Fourah Bay College]], [[Sierra Leone]] (1957–62) and the [[University of Nigeria, Nsukka]] (1962–65). He was later appointed to a post in [[Church history|ecclesiastical history]] in the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1966, before being the first head of the Department of [[Religious studies]] in the [[University of Aberdeen]] (1970). He would subsequently move to the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1986. He is currently Professor of the History of Mission at [[Liverpool Hope University]], Honorary Professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/people/|title=Academic Staff|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research Professor at [[Africa International University]]'s Center for World Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Professor at the Center for World Christianity of AIU|url=http://www.negst.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=292%3Aresearch-professor&amp;catid=3%3Anewsevents|publisher=Africa International University|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor Emeritus at the Akrofi-Christaller Institute of Theology, Mission and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acighana.org/site/academics/staff.php?astaffid=7|title=Academic Staff|website=''acighana.org''|publisher=Akrofi-Christaller Institute of Theology, Mission and Culture|access-date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walls established the ''[[Journal of Religion in Africa]]'' in 1967 and ''[[Studies in World Christianity]]'' in 1995. He also founded the [[Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World]] (now known as the Centre for the Study of World Christianity), first at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1982, before moving it to the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1987, a year after he moved to Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frost's Scottish Who's Who |url=http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/mfwhoswho/individuals/W_mfwwi/andrew_walls.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516054537/http://martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/mfwhoswho/individuals/W_mfwwi/andrew_walls.html |archivedate=16 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his late wife Doreen Harden, whom he married in 1953, they have two children, Christine and Andrew.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After Doreen's death, he married Ingrid Reneau in 2012, a Research Fellow with the Presbyterian Mission Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/missionconnections/reneau-ingrid/|title=Dr. Ingrid Reneau Walls|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130135635/https://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/missionconnections/reneau-ingrid/|archivedate=30 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2018, Walls received an honorary degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]] from the University of Edinburgh in recognition of his scholarly contributions to the study of Christianity in Africa and the non-Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/divinity/news-events/latest-news/honorary-grad-prof-andrew-walls|title=Honorary Doctor of Divinity: Professor Andrew Finlay Walls, OBE, MA, BLitt, DD, FSASco|last=|first=|date=26 November 2018|work=School of Divinity, University of Edinburgh|access-date=27 November 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Christianity==
Walls' most significant observations have concerned the geographical trends in Christianity in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in terms of expansion in Africa, in what is generally termed [[World Christianity]]. Historian [[Lamin Sanneh]] commented that he was 'one of the few scholars who saw that African Christianity was not just an exotic, curious phenomenon in an obscure part of the world, but that African Christianity might be the shape of things to come'.&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stafford|first=Tim|title=Historian Ahead of His Time|journal=[[Christianity Today]]|date=February 2007|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/february/34.87.html|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pioneering research led the magazine ''[[Christianity Today]]'' to describe him in 2007 as 'a historian ahead of his time' and 'the most important person you don't know'.&lt;ref name="CT" /&gt;

Liverpool Hope University has a research centre named in honour of him, which encourages and supports research in the field of African and Asian Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hope.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/researchcentredetails/andrewfwallscentre/|title=Andrew F. Walls Centre – Liverpool Hope University|website=hope.ac.uk|access-date=13 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041011/http://www.hope.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/researchcentredetails/andrewfwallscentre/|archive-date=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious studies==
Although he is more well known for his work in Christianity, Walls has also been a significant pioneer in shaping the field of [[religious studies]] as it is taught in universities of Scotland.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=James L.|last2=Sutcliffe|first2=Steven J.|date=March 2006|title=Religious studies in Scotland: A persistent tension with divinity|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001|journal=Religion|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he first returned to Scotland, Walls taught [[Church history|Ecclesiastical History]] in the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1966. However, he recognised that the [[Christ's College, Aberdeen|Faculty of Divinity in Aberdeen]] did not allow for a sufficient global perspective of religion, and founded the Department of [[Religious studies]] outside the Faculty of Divinity in 1970.

Significantly, Walls' work in Aberdeen would establish the first department of Religious Studies in Scotland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the mid-1970s, the department would be known for emphasising work in the study of what was then called '[[Indigenous religions|primal religions]]'. Moreover, his vision for a global perspective of religion allowed for Walls to attract a number of significant members of staff and students who were interested in religions of the non-Western world. It would also be in this new department that the original [[Centre for the Study of World Christianity|Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World]] was established, before eventually being relocated to the [[New College, Edinburgh|University of Edinburgh]] in 1987. It has been known as the Centre for the Study of World Christianity since 2009.

Many of the original signatories were prominent Chinese citizens inside and outside the government, including lawyers; a [[Tibet]]an poet and essayist, [[Woeser]]; and [[Bao Tong]], a former senior [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] official, who all faced a risk of arrest and jail.&lt;ref name=Macartney2008/&gt; The Charter calls for 19 changes including an independent legal system, freedom of association and the elimination of [[One-party state|one-party rule]]. "All kinds of social conflicts have constantly accumulated and feelings of discontent have risen consistently," it reads. "The current system has become backward to the point that change cannot be avoided." China remains the only large world power to still retain an [[authoritarian]] system that so infringes on human rights, it states. "This situation must change! Political democratic reforms cannot be delayed any longer!"&lt;ref name=Macartney2008&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5313746.ece|title=Leading Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, arrested over freedom charter |last= Macartney|first=Jane |date=10 December 2008|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=10 December 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific demands are:
#Amending the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution]].
#[[Separation of powers]].
#Legislative democracy.
#An [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].
#Public control of public servants. 
#Guarantee of [[human rights]].
#Election of [[civil servant|public officials]].
#Abolition of the [[hukou system]].
#[[Freedom of association]].

The opening paragraph of the charter states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{cquote|This year is the [[Qinding Xianfa Dagang|100th year of China's Constitution]], the 60th anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the 30th anniversary of the birth of the [[Democracy Wall]], and the 10th year since China signed the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. After experiencing a prolonged period of human rights disasters and a tortuous struggle and resistance, the awakening Chinese citizens are increasingly and more clearly recognizing that freedom, equality, and human rights are universal common values shared by all humankind, and that democracy, a republic, and constitutionalism constitute the basic structural framework of modern governance. A "modernization" bereft of these universal values and this basic political framework is a disastrous process that deprives humans of their rights, corrodes human nature, and destroys human dignity. Where will China head in the 21st century? Continue a "modernization" under this kind of authoritarian rule? Or recognize universal values, assimilate into the mainstream civilization, and build a democratic political system? This is a major decision that cannot be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/85717|title=Charter 08 (translated from the Chinese by Human Rights in China)|publisher=Human Rights in China|accessdate=10 December 2008|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530173604/http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/85717#|archive-date=2012-05-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Eileen Rose Busby''' (August 15, 1922 &amp;ndash; April 6, 2005) was an American [[author]] and [[antiques]] expert who was featured on [[HGTV]]'s ''Appraise It!'' show.

==Early life==
{{citation needed span|text=Busby was born Eileen May Rose in [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]]. Her parents, Frank and [[Esther Rose]], relocated to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] while she was still a baby. Busby taught herself to read when she was 3 years old, skipped a grade in school, and graduated from [[San Diego High School]] at age 16.|date=April 2015}}

==Biography==
Busby, who first married [[James (Jim) Scott]] and then Richard Busby, often spoke before groups about antiques collecting. She also taught a how-to course for many years at [[Cuyamaca College]] and [[Grossmont College]], community colleges in [[El Cajon, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuyamaca.edu/preview/pdf/2004%20Fall%20Preview.pdf|title=Grossmont College, On the Antiques Trail class schedule, Fall 2004|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote two books about the history and collecting of ''Royal Winton Porcelain'' and ''Cottage Ware''. Her third book, ''[[Chintz]] and Pastel Ware'', co-authored with daughter [[Cordelia Mendoza]], also an antiques expert and an appraiser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ana-appraisers.org/directory-of-appraisers.html|title=Directory of ANA Qualified Appraisers|author=|date=|website=Appraisers National Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; is scheduled for posthumous publication by [[Schiffer Publishing]] in 2011. She was scheduled to lecture at the annual Chintz Convention, held in Northern California in April 2005, a month after her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectx.com/news/collectorMag.cfm?domain_id=4&amp;file_id=136&amp;mode=remoteServe "Epitaph," ''Collector'' magazine, June 2005 (scroll to page 8)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Busby's book ''Cottage Ware'' is referenced in collector [[Judith Miller (antiques expert)|Judith Miller]]'s book ''Buy, Sell, or Keep'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias=stripbooks&amp;field-keywords=eileen+rose+busby&amp;rh=n:283155,k:eileen+rose+busby&amp;ajr=0|title=Amazon.com: eileen rose busby: Books|author=|date=|website=www.amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she is listed in ''[[Ralph Kovel|Kovels' Yellow Pages]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0609804170 Listing, ''Kovels' Yellow Pages'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Busby and her husband, Richard, lived in England for 10 years, some of it spent in a thatched roof cottage, from where they traveled the countryside researching [[Royal Winton]] and chintz. Busby wrote articles about their travels while Richard took photos, which were published in ''Sea'' magazine and ''International Yachtsman''. While living in England, Busby passed the UK's [[Mensa International|Mensa]] exam and became a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050409/news_1m9busby.html |title=Eileen Rose Busby; writer, world traveler and antiques expert |author=Elizabeth Fitzsimons |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2005-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021134812/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050409/news_1m9busby.html |archivedate=2007-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also taught word processing at a U.S. military base.

In 1999, Busby was featured as a collector on HGTV's ''Appraise It!'' show, taped at [[Butterfield &amp; Butterfield]]'s auction house in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/shows_ait|title=Home &amp; Garden Television&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a bachelor's degree in sociology at age 62 from [[State University of New York]]. Also, she was a member of the San Diego Press Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdpressclub.com/|title=The San Diego Press Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her return to the US from England in 1990, she wrote articles for ''The Collector'', ''Antiques and Collectibles'', and ''West Coast Peddler.'' She also sold Royal Winton and chintz china pieces, which she had purchased in England, as a dealer at daughter Cordelia Mendoza's antiques store in [[Ocean Beach, San Diego, California|Ocean Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiquecottage.blogspot.com/|title=Cordelia's Cottage|author=|date=|website=antiquecottage.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; California.

'''Giedroyć''' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: Giedraitis; [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: Гедройц; [[French language|French]]: Guedroitz) is a Polish surname, originating from the [[Giedroyć family|Giedroyć princely family]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

==Overview==
The Second and Third Editions of the Lithuanian Chronicle relate that Giedrius ([[Palemonids]]), a brother of Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania (late 13th century), built a castle, named it [[Giedraičiai]], and adopted the title Prince of Giedraičiai.

A document issued by Grand Duke [[Vytautas|Vytautas of Lithuania]] in the period 1399–1429 settled a dispute between the Bishop of Vilnius and the Princes of Giedraičiai. Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince.

The two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's "central core") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bartłomiej (died in 1524).&lt;ref&gt;For a full genealogy of those two lines see [http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/gotha.htm On-line Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth]] confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyć family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bartłomiej, were recorded with the title Prince – including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as "of the Princes".

Under the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status.

==Armorial bearings==
The Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus. A decree issued in 1401 by Władisław Jagiello, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, confirms the right of Prince Michał Giedroyć vel. Ratybor (baptized c.1387) to the arms Hippocentaurus "as used by his illustrious grandfather" Ginwill (2nd Duke of Giedrojcie and candidate to the grand ducal office of Lithuania).

But the earliest surviving illustrated Giedroyć armorial charge is a rose, on seals attached to state documents of 1431-4.

Through the 17th and 18th centuries, the centaur was used predominantly by most members of the family, sometimes in combination with the rose; while the descendants of Mikołaj (died 1657, sixth generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) continued to use the rose alone. But the centaur (sometimes with the rose, sometimes without) predominates in all the 19th century Russian records, even for the descendants of Mikołaj.

At the English College of Arms, the arms of [[Michal Giedroyc]] (born 1929, 16th generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) include both the rose and the centaur (called a sagittary in English heraldry) blazoned as follows: Per fess Or and Gules in chief a Rose Gules barbed and seeded proper and in base a Sagittary trippant to the dexter the head facing to the sinister his tail a serpent facing to the dexter holding in the hands a Bow with arrow drawn and set towards the head of the serpent all Or.

'''Dr. Hannibal Lecter''' is a character in a series of suspense novels by [[Thomas Harris]].

Lecter was introduced in the 1981 [[thriller (genre)|thriller novel]] ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' as a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]]. The novel and its sequel, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', feature Lecter as one of the primary [[antagonist]]s after the two serial killers in both novels. In the third novel, ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'', Lecter becomes a [[protagonist]]. His role as the [[antihero]] occurs in the fourth novel, ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'', which explores his childhood and development into a serial killer.

The first film adapted from the Harris novels was ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (based on ''Red Dragon'') which features [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Lecter, spelled "Lecktor". In 1991, [[Anthony Hopkins]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] for his portrayal of the character in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. He would reprise the role in ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' in 2001 and in [[Red Dragon (2002 film)|a second adaptation of ''Red Dragon'']] made in 2002 under the original title.

The [[NBC]] television series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'' debuted in 2013, and focuses on the development of the relationship between Lecter and [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]], an FBI [[offender profiling|profiler]]. In the series, Lecter is portrayed by [[Denmark|Danish]] actor [[Mads Mikkelsen]], who won a [[Saturn Award]] for his performance.

In 2003, Hannibal Lecter (as portrayed by Hopkins) was chosen by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|greatest villain in American cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.filmsite.org/afi100heroesvilla.html | title=AFI's 100 Heroes &amp; Villains |date=June 2003 | work=American Film Institute | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named him one of the ''100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam B.|last=Vary|title=The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years: Here's our full list!|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/01/100-greatest-characters-of-last-20-years-full-list/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=June 1, 2010|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
''Red Dragon'' firmly states that Lecter does not fit any known [[offender profiling|psychological profile]]. In ''The Silence of the Lambs'', Lecter's keeper, Dr. [[Frederick Chilton]], claims that Lecter is a "pure [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]" ("pure [[psychopathy|psychopath]]" in the film adaptation). In the novel ''Red Dragon'', protagonist [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]] says that Lecter has no conscience and [[zoosadism|tortured animals]] as a child, but does not exhibit any other of the [[Macdonald triad|criteria]] traditionally associated with sociopathy; Graham explains that psychiatrists refer to Lecter as a sociopath because "they don't know what else to call him". In the film adaptation of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', protagonist [[Clarice Starling]] says of Lecter, "They don't have a name for what he is." 

Lecter's pathology is explored in greater detail in ''Hannibal'' and ''Hannibal Rising'', which explains that he was [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] as a child in [[Lithuania]] in 1944 when he witnessed the murder and cannibalism of his beloved sister, Mischa, by a group of deserting [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II#Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hilfswillige]], one of whom claimed that Lecter unwittingly ate his sister as well.

All media in which Lecter appears portray him as intellectually brilliant, cultured and sophisticated, with refined tastes in art, music and cuisine. He is frequently depicted preparing gourmet meals from his victims' flesh, the most famous example being his admission that he once ate a census taker's liver "with some [[fava bean]]s and a nice [[Chianti]]" (a "big [[Amarone]]" in the novel). He is deeply offended by rudeness, and frequently kills people who have bad manners. Prior to his capture and imprisonment, he was a member of [[Baltimore, Maryland]]'s social elite, and a sitting member of the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra's board of directors.

In ''The Silence of the Lambs'', Lecter is described through Starling's eyes: "small, sleek, and in his hands and arms she saw wiry strength like her own". The novel also reveals that Lecter's left hand has a condition called mid ray duplication [[polydactyly]], i.e. a duplicated middle finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Harris|authorlink=Thomas Harris|title=Silence of the Lambs|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|date=1988|page=15|quote=Dr. Lecter has six fingers on his left hand}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hannibal'', he performs plastic surgery on his own face on several occasions, and removes his extra digit. Lecter's eyes are a shade of maroon, and reflect the light in "pinpoints of red".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Harris|authorlink=Thomas Harris|title=Silence of the Lambs|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|date=1988|page=16|quote=Dr. Lecter's eyes are maroon, and they reflect the light in pinpoints of red}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has small white teeth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Harris|authorlink=Thomas Harris|title=Silence of the Lambs|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|date=1988|page=17|quote=He tapped his small white teeth against the card and breathed in its smell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dark, slicked-back hair with a [[widow's peak]]. He also has a keen sense of smell; in ''The Silence of the Lambs'', he is able to identify through a plexiglass window with small holes the brand of perfume that Starling wore the day ''before''. He has an [[eidetic memory]] with which he has constructed in his mind an elaborate "[[memory palace]]" with which he relives memories and sensations in rich detail.

===Novels===
====''Red Dragon''====
In the backstory of 1986 ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] profiler [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]] interviews Lecter about one of his patients who was murdered by a serial killer, before intuiting that Lecter is the culprit. Realizing that Graham is on to him, Lecter creeps up behind Will and stabs him with a [[linoleum knife]], nearly disemboweling him. Graham survives, but is so traumatized by the incident that he takes early retirement from the FBI. Lecter is charged with a series of nine murders, but is found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]]. He is institutionalized in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the care of Dr. [[Frederick Chilton]], a pompous, incompetent psychologist whom he despises. Some years later, Graham comes out of retirement and consults Lecter in order to catch another serial killer, [[Francis Dolarhyde]], known by the nickname "The Tooth Fairy". Through the [[classifieds]] of a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] called ''The National Tattler'', Lecter provides Dolarhyde with Graham's home address, enabling Dolarhyde to disfigure Graham and attempt to kill his family. At the end of the novel, Lecter sends Graham a taunting note saying that he hopes Graham isn't "too ugly".

====''The Silence of the Lambs''====
In the 1988 sequel ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', Lecter assists FBI agent-in-training [[Clarice Starling]] in catching a serial killer known as "[[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]]". Lecter is fascinated by Starling, and they form an unusual relationship in which he provides her with a [[offender profiling|profile]] of the killer and his [[modus operandi]] in exchange for details about her unhappy childhood. Lecter had previously met Buffalo Bill, the former lover of his patient (and eventual victim) Benjamin Raspail. He does not reveal this information directly, instead giving Starling vague clues to help her figure it out for herself. In return for Lecter's assistance, the FBI and Chilton arrange for him to be transferred to a lower security facility. He escapes while in transit, however, killing and mutilating his guards and using one of their faces as a mask to fool paramedics. While in hiding, he writes a letter to Starling wishing her well, and another to Chilton swearing gruesome revenge; Chilton disappears soon afterward.

====''Hannibal''====
In the third novel, 1999's ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'', Lecter lives in a [[palazzo]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], and works as a museum curator under the alias "Dr. Fell". The novel reveals that one of Lecter's victims survived: [[Mason Verger]], a wealthy, [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[pedophilia|pedophile]] whom Lecter had brutalized during a therapy session, leaving him a horrifically disfigured [[quadriplegic]]. Verger offers a huge reward for anyone who apprehends Lecter, whom he intends to feed to wild boars specially bred for the purpose. Verger enlists the help of Rinaldo Pazzi, a disgraced Italian police inspector, and Paul Krendler, a corrupt [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] official and Starling's boss. Lecter kills Pazzi and returns to the United States to escape Verger's [[Sardinia]]n henchmen, only to be captured. Starling follows them, intent on apprehending Lecter personally, and is injured in a gunfight with Verger's henchmen. Lecter escapes, and persuades Verger's sister Margot - his former patient, whom Verger had molested and raped years earlier - to kill her brother, promising to take the blame. He rescues the wounded Starling and takes her to Krendler's rented lake house to treat her, subjecting her to a regimen of [[mind-altering drugs]] and [[classical conditioning]] in order to make her believe she is his long-dead sister Mischa. One day, he invites her to a formal dinner where the guest and first course is Paul Krendler, whose brain they consume together. On this night, Starling tells Lecter that Mischa's memory can live within him instead of taking her place. She then offers him her breast, and they become lovers. Three years later, former orderly Barney Matthews, who had befriended and respected Lecter while he was incarcerated in Baltimore, sees Lecter and Starling entering the [[Teatro Colón]] opera house in [[Buenos Aires]]. Fearing for his life, Barney leaves Buenos Aires immediately, never to return.

====''Hannibal Rising''====
Harris wrote a 2006 prequel, ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'', after film producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] (who owned the cinematic rights to the Lecter character) announced that he was going to make a film depicting Lecter's childhood and development into a serial killer with or without Harris' help. Harris would also write the film's screenplay. The novel chronicles Lecter's early life, from his birth into an aristocratic family in [[Lithuania]] in 1933, to being orphaned, along with his beloved sister Mischa, in 1944 when a German [[Stuka]] bomber attacks a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] tank in front of their forest hideaway. Shortly thereafter, he and Mischa are captured by a band of [[Nazi collaborators|German collaborators]], who murder and cannibalize Mischa before her brother's eyes; Lecter later learns that the collaborators also fed him Mischa's remains. Irreparably traumatized, Lecter escapes from the deserters and wanders through the forest, dazed and unable to speak. He is found and taken in by an orphanage, where he is bullied by the other children and [[child abuse|abused]] by the dean. He is adopted by his uncle Robert and his [[Japanese people|Japanese]] wife, Lady Murasaki, who nurses him back to health and teaches him to speak again. After his uncle's death, Lecter forms a close, pseudo-romantic relationship with his step-aunt. During this time he also shows great intellectual aptitude, entering medical school at a young age and distinguishing himself. Despite his seemingly comfortable life, Lecter is consumed by a savage obsession with avenging Mischa's death. He kills for the first time as a teenager, beheading a [[racism|racist]] fishmonger who insulted Murasaki. He then methodically tracks down, [[torture]]s, and murders each of the men who had killed his sister. In the process of taking his revenge, he forsakes his relationship with Murasaki and seemingly loses all traces of his humanity. The novel ends with Lecter being accepted to the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]].

[[File:Heyes.jpg|thumb|right|Anthony Hopkins as Lecter in ''The Silence of the Lambs''.|225x225px]]
''Red Dragon'' was first adapted to film in 1986 as the [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] film ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', although the spelling of Lecter's name was changed to "Lecktor". He was played by actor [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccPeC-uRI2c|last=Cox |first=Brian |subjectlink=Brian Cox (actor) |interviewer=[[Terry Wogan]] |title=Brian Cox: Interview (Manhunter)|work=Wogan Now and Then |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=London, England |date=March 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox based his performance on Scottish serial killer [[Peter Manuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=James|last=Mottram|title=Manhunter|journal=[[Total Film]]|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|location=Bath, England|issue=177|pages=112–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[Orion Pictures]] produced a [[Jonathan Demme]]-directed adaptation of ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', in which Lecter was played by actor [[Anthony Hopkins]]. Hopkins' Academy Award–winning performance made Lecter into a cultural icon. In 2001, ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'' was adapted to film, with Hopkins reprising his role. In the [[Hannibal (film)|film adaptation]], the ending is revised: Starling attempts to apprehend Lecter, who escapes after cutting off his own hand to free himself from her handcuffs. In 2002, ''[[Red Dragon (2002 film)|Red Dragon]]'' was adapted again, this time under its original title, with Hopkins again as Lecter and [[Edward Norton]] as [[Will Graham (fictional character)|Will Graham]]. Hopkins wrote a screenplay for a ''Hannibal'' sequel, ending with Starling killing Lecter, but it was never produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ann|last=Oldenburg|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002-10-03-red-dragon-cover_x.htm|title=Marquee names serve up another helping of Hannibal|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=London, England|date=October 3, 2002|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, the novel ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' was adapted into the [[Hannibal Rising (film)|film of the same name]], which portrayed Lecter's development into a serial killer. In the film, which was finished by 2007, eight-year-old Lecter is portrayed by Aaran Thomas, while [[Gaspard Ulliel]] portrays him as a young man. Both the novel and film received generally negative critical reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|id=hannibal_rising|title=Hannibal Rising}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In television===
{{main article|Hannibal (TV series)}}
In February 2012, [[NBC]] gave a series order to ''Hannibal'', a television adaptation of ''Red Dragon'' to be written and executive-produced by [[Bryan Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Natalie|last=Abrams|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/NBC-Hannibal-Notorious-Pilot-1043405.aspx|title=Pilot Season: NBC Orders Hannibal Straight to Series; Also Picks Up Notorious|magazine=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=NTVB Media|location=Portland, Oregon|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mads Mikkelsen]] plays Lecter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=James|last=Hibberd|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/06/04/cast-hannibal|title=NBC casts Bond villain as Hannibal Lecter|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=June 4, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite [[Hugh Dancy]] as [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Morgan|last=Jeffrey|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a372800/hannibal-lecter-tv-series-casts-hugh-dancy-as-will-graham.html|title=Hannibal Lecter TV series casts Hugh Dancy as Will Graham|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|location=London, England|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller commented on Mikkelsen's version of Lecter: "What I love about Mads' approach to the character is that, in our first meeting, he was adamant that he didn't want to do Hopkins or Cox. He talked about the character not so much as 'Hannibal Lecter the cannibal psychiatrist', but as [[Satan]] – this [[fallen angel]] who's enamoured with mankind and had an affinity for who we are as people, but was definitely not among us – he was other. I thought that was a really cool, interesting approach, because I love science fiction and horror and – not that we'd ever do anything deliberately to suggest this – but having it subtextually play as him being [[Lucifer]] felt like a really interesting kink to the series. It was slightly different than anything that's been done before and it also gives it a slightly more epic quality if you watch the show through the prism of, 'This is Satan at work, tempting someone with the apple of their psyche'. It appealed to all of those genre things that get me excited about any sort of entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Morgan|last=Jeffery|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/interviews/a478343/bryan-fuller-hannibal-qa-lecter-is-like-satan-at-work.html|title=Bryan Fuller 'Hannibal' Q&amp;A: 'Lecter is like Satan at work'|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|location=london, England|date=May 3, 2013|accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 1====
The first season amends the series' continuity so that Graham and Lecter first work together during the hunt for Garrett Jacob Hobbs (Vladimir Jon Cubrt), the "Minnesota Shrike", a serial killer who preys on college girls. During the investigation, Lecter secretly calls Hobbs to tip him off that Graham is on to him. As a result, Hobbs turns on his own family, killing his wife and trying to kill his daughter Abigail ([[Kacey Rohl]]) as Graham charges in and shoots him dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Apéritif |episodelink=Hannibal (season 1)#ep1|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=April 4, 2013|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killing Hobbs weighs on Graham's conscience and gives him nightmares, so his boss [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) sends him to Lecter for counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Amuse-Bouche |episodelink=Hannibal (season 1)#ep2|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=April 11, 2013|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the first season, Lecter acts as Graham's unofficial psychiatrist, and they form a tenuous friendship. Lecter and Graham also become father figures to Abigail, and cover for her when they discover that she was her father's accomplice. Lecter is fascinated by Graham's ability to empathize with psychopaths, and he spends much of the series trying to undermine Graham's fragile sanity and push him into becoming a killer. To this end, Lecter prevents Graham from learning that he has advanced [[encephalitis]], just to see how Graham would function under the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Buffet Froid |episodelink=Hannibal (season 1)#ep10|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=May 20, 2013|season=1|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first-season finale, Lecter reluctantly frames Graham for a series of murders that he himself committed throughout the season – including, apparently, Abigail's – but not before Graham realizes that Lecter is the Chesapeake Ripper, the very serial killer he has been trying to catch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Savoreaux |episodelink=Hannibal (season 1)#ep13|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=June 20, 2013|season=1|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 2====
Throughout the beginning of the second season, Graham, who is now institutionalized, attempts to convince his skeptical former colleagues that Lecter is the real killer and begins pulling strings from within his cell in order to expose him. Meanwhile, Lecter begins to manipulate evidence from the outside, exonerating himself after the FBI's initial investigations into Graham's claims. Eventually, Graham persuades his friend and colleague Beverly Katz ([[Hetienne Park]]), a forensic scientist, to investigate Lecter in exchange for help on a case. She breaks into Lecter's house, where she find evidence of his guilt. Lecter catches her, however, and kills her; he then sections her body vertically and displays it in tableau. Angry and vengeful, Graham convinces a deranged hospital orderly ([[Jonathan Tucker]]) to try to kill Lecter, but the attempt fails.&lt;ref name="Mukōzuke"&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Mukōzuke |episodelink=Hannibal (season 2)#ep5|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=March 28, 2014|season=2|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lecter retaliates by taking as his lover Alana Bloom ([[Caroline Dhavernas]]), a psychologist for whom Graham had romantic feelings.&lt;ref name="Mukōzuke"/&gt; Lecter then exonerates Graham by planting forensic evidence of Graham's alleged victims at the scene of one of his own murders, resulting in Graham's release. He also frames his colleague [[Frederick Chilton]] ([[Raúl Esparza]]) by planting a mutilated corpse in his house and "[[Brainwashing|influencing]]" his surviving victim Miriam Lass ([[Anna Chlumsky]]), into believing that Chilton had abducted and tortured her.&lt;ref name="Mukōzuke"/&gt;

Graham resumes therapy with Lecter as an attempt to [[entrapment|entrap]] him. Lecter becomes aware of the ruse, but is fascinated by the experience and allows it to continue in an attempt to examine his connection with Graham, which quickly grows into a close bond. In an attempt to push Graham into becoming a killer, Lecter sends his psychotic former patient Randall Tier ([[Mark O'Brien (actor)|Mark O'Brien]]) after him, and Graham kills and mutilates Tier – just as Lecter hoped he would.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Shiizakana |episodelink=Hannibal (season 2)#ep9|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=April 25, 2014|season=2|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Graham attacks tabloid reporter [[Freddy Lounds|Fredericka "Freddy" Lounds]] ([[Lara Jean Chorostecki]]), who is investigating him and Lecter. Graham shares a meal with Lecter of what is implied to be her flesh, but it is soon revealed that Lounds is still alive and conspiring with Graham and Crawford to draw Lecter into their trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Naka-Choko |episodelink=Hannibal (season 2)#ep10|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=May 2, 2014|season=2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lecter and Graham acquire a common enemy in [[Mason Verger]] ([[Michael Pitt]]), a wealthy [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] whom they both despise for emotionally and sexually abusing his twin sister Margot ([[Katharine Isabelle]]). Verger makes a deal with Graham to kill Lecter, secretly planning to feed them both to his prize pigs; however, Graham changes his mind and frees Lecter, allowing them both to escape. Lecter then takes Verger hostage in Graham's house. He gives him a hallucinogenic drug cocktail, and tells him to cut off pieces of his own face and feed them to Graham's dogs. With Graham's tacit approval, Lecter then breaks Verger's neck with his bare hands, paralyzing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Tome-Wan |episodelink=Hannibal (season 2)#ep12|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=May 16, 2014|season=2|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second-season finale, Crawford arrives at Lecter's house to arrest him. In the ensuing struggle, Lecter seriously wounds Crawford, while a very much alive Abigail Hobbs pushes Bloom out of a window. Lecter then stabs Graham and cuts Abigail's throat in front of him, and leaves them as he flees before the police arrive. He is shown in a post-credits scene aboard a flight to France with his psychiatrist, [[Bedelia Du Maurier]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Mizumono |episodelink=Hannibal (season 2)#ep13|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=May 23, 2014|season=2|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 3====
The third season amends the series' continuity to incorporate events from the novel ''Hannibal''. It also changes Lecter's origin story: in this continuity, Lecter's sister Mischa was murdered, cannibalized, and fed to him by a peasant in his native [[Lithuania]], who would eventually become his prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Secondo|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=June 3, 2015|season=3|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain episodes also suggest that, in his youth, Lecter was the unidentified serial killer known as "[[Il Mostro|The Monster of Florence]]".&lt;ref name="Primavera"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Primavera|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=June 11, 2015|season=3|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Months after his escape, Lecter is living in Florence with Du Maurier, working as a museum curator under the alias "Dr. Fell" – having murdered the original curator and stolen his identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title= Antipasto |series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=June 4, 2015|season=3|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disgraced Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Fortunato Cerlino) tries to apprehend him to collect a bounty placed by Mason Verger ([[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]]), who is also consulting with Bloom to capture Lecter. Lecter kills Pazzi and tries to flee the country, but is accosted by Crawford, who engages him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Meanwhile, Graham goes looking for Lecter with the help of the doctor's family servant Chiyoh ([[Tao Okamoto]]), traveling to his adversary's home country to find out more about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Contorno|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=July 9, 2015|season=3|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lecter manages to escape from Crawford and meet up with Graham when he arrives to Italy again. Graham makes peace with Lecter before pulling a knife on him, but Chiyoh shoots and wounds Graham. Lecter takes Graham back to his villa and tries to perform a [[craniotomy]] on him in front of Crawford, but is interrupted by Italian detectives on Verger's payroll, who deliver them both to Verger's estate in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Dolce|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=July 9, 2015|season=3|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verger's physician Cordell Doemling ([[Glenn Fleshler]]) tells Lecter that he will mutilate him until he dies, and prepare gourmet cuisine from his flesh for Verger to eat. Influenced by Graham, Bloom frees Lecter, who suggests that Margot kill her brother, promising to take the blame. Lecter then kills Doemling, who is about to surgically remove Graham's face and graft it onto Verger's, and later instructs Margot and Bloom on how to milk the unconscious Verger's prostate to give Margot the sperm she needs to conceive a child and thus inherit the Verger family fortune. After Margot kills her brother, Lecter goes to Graham's house, carrying wounded and unconscious Graham. When Graham wakes up, he allows Lecter to escape, but later that evening Lecter surrenders to Crawford, who takes him into custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Digestivo|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=July 18, 2015|season=3|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lecter is found insane at his trial, and incarcerated in the Baltimore Hospital for the Criminally Insane, under Chilton and Bloom's care. Three years later, Graham visits him at the hospital to ask for help in profiling a serial killer dubbed "The Tooth Fairy", who murders entire families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Great Red Dragon|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=July 25, 2015|season=3|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lecter begins communicating with the killer, [[Francis Dolarhyde]] ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]) and gives him Graham's home address. Dolarhyde attacks and wounds Graham's wife, Molly ([[Nina Arianda]]). Bloom and Crawford threaten to take away Lecter's hospital privileges unless he lets them listen in on his conversations with Dolarhyde. Lecter complies, but then suddenly tells Dolarhyde they are listening. Bloom punishes him by taking away his books and toilet, and confining him in a straitjacket and muzzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=...And the Beast From the Sea|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=August 15, 2015|season=3|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham, in an attempt to make Dolarhyde come out of hiding, gives an interview with Chilton and Lounds in which he describes "The Tooth Fairy" as ugly, impotent, and a product of [[incest]]. Dolarhyde, enraged by the "bad review", abducts, burns and disfigures Chilton, and sends Lecter Chilton's severed lips, one of which Lecter eats.&lt;ref name="The Number of the Beast is 666"&gt;{{Cite episode|title= The Number of the Beast is 666...|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=August 22, 2015|season=3|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series finale, "The Wrath of the Lamb", Lecter and Graham develop a plan to catch Dolarhyde, using Lecter as bait. Lecter goes with Graham on a police convoy, to be transferred to another facility in order to eventually draw the killer out. However, Graham has made a deal with Dolarhyde to free Lecter, and Dolarhyde attacks the convoy, killing the guards and letting Lecter and Graham live. Lecter then takes Graham to a secluded clifftop cottage where he previously held Abigail Hobbs and Miriam Lass. Dolarhyde tracks them down and attacks them, shooting Lecter in the back and stabbing Graham in the face. Though they are both badly wounded, Lecter and Graham manage to get the better of Dolarhyde and kill him together: Graham slices open Dolarhyde's chest, while Lecter tears out his throat with his teeth. Lecter and Graham then embrace, before Graham pushes them both off a cliff. Their ultimate fate is left ambiguous; a post-credits scene shows Du Maurier dining on her own leg at a table set for three.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite episode|title= The Wrath of the Lamb|series=Hannibal|serieslink=Hannibal (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=August 29, 2015|season=3|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series creator Bryan Fuller has said this scene is meant to suggest that Lecter and Graham survived and that Graham has become Lecter's partner in murder. Fuller has stated that Season 4 would have depicted Lecter and Graham on the run from the FBI in Argentina, mirroring Lecter and Starling's storyline from the novels.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Adam|last=Bryant|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/hannibal-series-finale-postmortem-bryan-fuller/|title=''Hannibal'' Boss on the Finale: "If the Audience Is Done, Then I Will Be Done"|magazine=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=NTVB Media|location=Portland, Oregon|date=August 29, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship between Graham and Lecter====

The emotional relationship between Graham and Lecter forms the foundation of the series. In season 3, their developing romance has been taken from subtext into text.&lt;ref name="The Number of the Beast is 666"/&gt; As to whether it was a part of the initial plan to portray their relationship as romantic, Fuller stated: "No, it naturally evolved because I guess I was absorbing so much of Mads and Hugh's performance, which felt like it was growing in intimacy, and it would have been inauthentic not to address it. Because all of these characters, and particularly Bedelia, was able to call out what she had witnessed [between Lecter and Graham], it seemed like a natural conclusion. I remember when I turned in the rewrite pages where Will asks Bedelia if Hannibal is in love with him, I got a note from Don Mancini, one of our writers who was always pushing for more [[homosexual]] text – not just context or subtext but text, text, text – and he was like, "I'm so glad you put that in there! They said it! They said it!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Emma | last=Dibdin | title=''Hannibal'': Bryan Fuller talks season 4, sexual fluidity, and how Will became Clarice Starling | url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/hannibal/interviews/a667077/hannibal-bryan-fuller-talks-season-4-sexual-fluidity-and-how-will-became-clarice-starling/ | work=[[Digital Spy]] | publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]| location=London, England| date=6 September 2015 | accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing what motivated him to verbally acknowledge the romance between Graham and Lecter, Fuller said, "It felt like we had to shit or get off the pot, ultimately, because there had been so much going on between these two men that when Will asks, "Is Hannibal Lecter in love with me?" it is very much about death and the romance between these two men. There is a quality to connections that go above and beyond sexuality. You can have this intimate connection with somebody that then causes you to wonder where the lines of your own sexuality are. And we didn't quite broach the sexuality. It was certainly suggested, but the love is absolutely on the table." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Michael | last=Slezak | title=''Hannibal'' Finale Post Mortem: Bryan Fuller on Will/Lecter Love, Bedelia's Last Supper, That Siouxsie Sioux Jam | url=http://tvline.com/2015/08/29/hannibal-series-finale-will-lecter-cliff-bryan-fuller-interview-season-4/ | website=[[TV Line]] | date=August 2015 | accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering how the song for the finale of the series - "Love Crime" by [[Siouxsie Sioux]] - was created, Fuller said: "It was interesting. She [Siouxsie Sioux] was like, "I want to write this song, and what are the things I should really be thinking about?" And I was like, 'this is a love story. A love story between a full-fledged psychopath and someone who has nascent psychopathic abilities.' Actually, Hannibal Lecter is not a psychopath; he's something else entirely. But it's a love relationship between two men: one of them is a cannibal, and one of them understands those cannibalistic instincts all too well." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Alan | last=Sepinwall | title=''Hannibal's'' creator explains that dark, twisted and… romantic(?) series finale | url=http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/hannibal-creator-i-wanted-to-be-sure-we-had-an-ending-for-the-story/ | website=[[UPROXX]] | date=August 29, 2015 | accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other media===
Hannibal Lecter is parodied in the 2005 [[musical theatre|musical]], ''[[SILENCE! The Musical]]'', with the character being originated by actor [[Brent Barrett]].

==Real-life models==
Thomas Harris has given few interviews and did not explain where he got inspiration for Hannibal Lecter until mid-2013. Harris revealed that the character was inspired by a real-life doctor and murderer he met while visiting a prison in the city of [[Monterrey]] during a trip to Mexico in the 1960s when he was a 23-year-old reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The REAL Hannibal Lecter: Author Thomas Harris reveals for first time how killer doctor in Mexican prison inspired him to create most famous cannibal in history|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2379949/Killer-doctor-inspired-cinematic-history-Author-reveals-chilling-story-Hannibal-Lecter--actually-SAVED-someones-life.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]]|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctor was serving a life sentence for murdering a young man, supposedly a "close friend", mutilating his body into several body parts, and putting them in a very small box. Harris, who would only refer to the surgeon by the fake name "Dr. Salazar", described him as a "small lithe pale man with dark red hair". He added: "There was certain intelligence and elegance about him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Oliver |last=Harvey|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/921070/my-chilling-meeting-with-the-elegant-killer-doctor-who-inspired-lecter-character/|title=My chilling meeting with the elegant killer doctor who inspired Lecter character |work=[[The Sun (UK)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News UK]]|location=London, England|date=2 August 2013|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris had gone to Mexico to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a US citizen on death row for murdering three young people in the country, but he ended up also speaking to "Salazar", who saved Simmons' life after a guard shot him during an escape bid. "Salazar" revealed his dark side as he began discussing Simmons' disfigured face, tormented upbringing and how attractive his victims had been.
[[File:Doctor Balli.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Alfredo Ballí Treviño, the real-life inspiration for Lecter, according to Thomas Harris.]]
Several reporters and investigators have traced the records and whereabouts of the Mexican prison doctor in later years and discovered that "Salazar" was in reality Alfredo Ballí Treviño, a physician from an upper-class Monterrey family who was found guilty of murdering a close friend (and lover) and mutilating his body; he was also suspected of killing and dismembering several hitchhikers in the city outskirts during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Harris also incorporated some of these details into [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]]'s development as a killer in ''Silence of the Lambs''. Ballí was initially condemned to death, but his sentence was later commuted to 20 years and he was released in 1981. After his release, Ballí continued working as a physician in an austere office until his death by natural causes in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Diego Enrique |last=Osorno|url=https://www.vice.com/es_mx/read/hannibal-lecter-es-de-monterrey |title=Hannibal Lecter es de Monterrey |magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|VICE]] |publisher=[[Vice Media|Vice Media Mexico]]|language=Spanish |location=Mexico City, Mexico|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Umberto|last=Bacchi|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/495908/20130731/hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-ball.htm|title=Real Hannibal Lecter was Murderous Gay Mexican Doctor Alfredo Ballí Treviño|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|publisher=[[Newsweek Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=July 31, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Maria G.|last=Valdez|url=http://www.latintimes.com/articles/6867/20130730/real-hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-balli-trevino-inspiration-thomas-harris-silence-lambs-25-anniversary.htm|title=Who Was The Real Hannibal Lecter?|newspaper=[[Latin Times]]|publisher=[[Newsweek Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Evil Serial Killers'', [[Charlotte Greig]] asserts that the serial killer [[Albert Fish]] was the inspiration, at least in part, for Lecter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charlotte|last=Grieg|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|location=London, England|date=2009|ISBN=978-1841932897|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greig also states that to explain Lecter's pathology, Harris borrowed the story of serial killer and cannibal [[Andrei Chikatilo]]'s brother Stepan being kidnapped and eaten by starving neighbors (though she states that it is unclear whether the story was true or whether Stepan Chikatilo even existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charlotte|last=Grieg|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|location=London, England|date=2009|ISBN=978-1841932897|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the book ''Hannibal'' was inspired by [[The Monster of Florence]].

'''He Chengjun''' ({{zh|何成濬}}) (June 20, 1882 – May 7, 1961) was a [[Kuomintang]] politician and military officer of the Republic of China. He was born in [[Hubei]]. He was graduate of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]]. As a member of the [[Tongmenghui]], he took part in the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. He was briefly mayor of [[Beijing]] after its capture by the [[National Revolutionary Army]] during the [[Northern Expedition]]. In the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], he was governor of his home province and defended it against the advancing [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. After the defeat of the Kuomintang in the [[Chinese Civil War]], he went to [[Hong Kong]] and in 1951 arrived in [[Taiwan]]. He died in [[Taipei]] at the age of 78.&lt;ref name=Xu&gt;徐主編（2007）、665頁。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;劉国銘主編（2005）、1103頁。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toa&gt;東亜問題調査会編（1941）、29頁。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;東亜問題調査会編（1941）、29頁によると、北平市長代理や東三省攻略軍総司令を務めたとしているが、徐主編（2007）、665頁と劉国銘主編（2005）、1103頁にはその旨の記述は見当たらない。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ただし[[1930年]]2月までは、実務を民政庁庁長方本仁に委ね、何自身は軍務を引き続きつとめている。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;東亜問題調査会編（1941）、30頁。&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Henry Jackson''' (May 3, 1861 &amp;ndash; January 10, 1952), also known as '''Honoré Jackson''' or '''Jaxon''', was secretary to [[Louis Riel]] during the [[North-West Rebellion]] in [[Canada]] in 1885.  He was married to Aimée, a former teacher in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Messamore|first=Barbara J.|title=Review of Honoré Jaxon: Prairie Visionary, by Donald B. Smith|journal=Journal of Historical Biography|date=Autumn 2011|volume=10|pages=134–137|url=https://www.ufv.ca/jhb/Volume_10/Volume_10_Messamore.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada West]] to a [[Methodism|Methodist]] family but several years later his family moved to Wingham, Ontario. Jackson later attended the [[University of Toronto]] for 3 years; however, due to his fathers bankruptcy, he was unable to complete his last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Francis|last2= Jones|last3= Smith|last4= Wardhaugh|first1=Douglas|first2 =Richard|first3= Donald|first4= Robert|title=Destinies Canadian History since Confederation|year=2012|publisher=Nelson|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-17-650251-5|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 he moved to [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]] (then part of the [[Northwest Territories]]), where he soon began to sympathize with the [[Metis (people)|Métis]] and their struggle against the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]], though he was not a Métis himself. Jackson became personal secretary to [[Louis Riel]] when Riel returned to Canada in 1884, and the two organized a Métis militia and made plans for a [[Provisional Government of Saskatchewan|provisional government]]. Open fighting broke out between the disgruntled Metis and police forces/armed civilian volunteers on March 18 at Duck Lake.

That same day (18 March 1885), Jackson was baptised [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] by Father Fourmond.  Riel stood as godfather for the ceremony and gave him the name "Honoré Joseph Jaxon". The next day Riel declared the establishment of a provisional government (see [[Exovedate]]).

However, Jackson's mental health was affected by the religious event, and by the turmoil and excitement of open rebellion, and within days, Riel imprisoned Jackson, perhaps thinking he had gone insane but also fearing that his eccentric religious ideas and his support for [[Henry George]]'s radical philosophical ideas against private ownership of land may cause discord within his (Riel's) followers.&lt;ref&gt;Beal and Macleod, Prairie Fire, p. 132-33; Donatien Fremont, The Secretaries of Riel (1985), p. 103-106&lt;/ref&gt; Later during the rebellion, Riel released Jackson.

He was captured when Canadian government troops overcame the last Metis resistance in the [[Battle of Batoche]] ending on May 12, 1885. He was tried for [[treason]], but found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to an insane asylum in [[Lower Fort Garry]], near [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. He escaped the asylum on November 2 and fled to the [[United States]].

Once there, he changed his name to Honoré Jaxon and joined the [[labour union]] movement in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and was active in socialist circles as well. He also decided to lie about his identity and told others he was a Métis. In 1894 he was part of [[Coxey's Army]], which marched to [[Washington, DC]] to demand an [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]]. In 1897 he converted to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and oriented his concerns to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Smith | first = Donald B | title = Honore Jaxon: Prairie Visionary | publisher = Coteau Books | year = 2007 | location = | pages = 102–103 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SB9pwQ42_B4C&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-1-55050-367-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Will C. van den Hoonaard|title=The Origins of the Bahá’í Community of Canada, 1898-1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntLfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=30 October 2010|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

He returned to Canada briefly between 1907-1909, spending some of the time interviewing former participants of the Rebellion and addressing labour/socialist meetings. He returned to the United States, eventually moving to [[New York City]]. He collected books, newspapers, and pamphlets relating to the Métis people in an attempt to establish in their honour a museum in New York. However, years went by and he slipped into poverty and extreme old age.  He was evicted from his apartment on December 12, 1951, and his collection (considered unimportant by the city) was sold as waste paper.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2007, p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; He died a month later.

'''Isatai'i''' ([[Comanche language|Comanche]] ''isa'' 'wolf or coyote' + ''tai'i'' 'vagina') or Isatai (c.1840 – 1916) was a [[Comanche]] warrior and medicine man of the Kwaharʉ band. Originally named Kwihnai Tosabitʉ (White Eagle), after the [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls|debacle at Adobe Walls]] on June 27, 1874, for which he was blamed,  he was known as Isatai'i.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isatai'i gained enormous prominence for a brief period in 1873-74 as a prophet and "messiah" of Native Americans.  He succeeded, albeit very temporarily, in uniting the autonomous Comanche bands as no previous Chief or leader had ever done.  Indeed, his prestige was such that he was able to organize what was said to be the first Comanche [[sun dance]], an Indian ritual that his tribe had not previously adopted.&lt;ref name="tsha"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fis05 | title=ISA-TAI | publisher=The Handbook of Texas Online | first=Gaines | last=Kincaid | accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Not much is known about Isatai'i’s youth.  He was born a Kwaharʉ Comanche, a few years before [[Quanah Parker]], probably about 1840.  As an adult he became a medicine man, not a traditional warrior.  He first came into prominence right before the [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls]] as he preached a Messianic War against [[American bison|buffalo]] hunters and other whites he feared were ending the Comanche way of life. Isatai'i's prophecies were based on his claim that he had ascended far above the earth into the clouds and had conversed with the [[Great Spirit]].  He claimed the Great Spirit had granted him extraordinary powers. Among these powers were the ability to cure the sick, bring the dead back to life, to control the weather and other natural phenomena, and to make bullets fall to the ground, harming no one.  He claimed that he could belch up bullets and cartridges, and reswallow same.  He correctly predicted the disappearance of the comet in 1873, and also correctly predicted a drought that year&amp;mdash;predictions that solidified his status as a miracle worker, prophet, and medicine man.&lt;ref name="tsha"/&gt;

==Preparing for the Second Battle of Adobe Walls==
{{main|Second Battle of Adobe Walls}}

Isatai'i brought all the bands of the Comanches together for the sun dance in May 1874.   At the sun dance, he began preaching a war of revenge and extermination, and told the warriors they would be invulnerable to their enemies. Comanche history says that Isatai'i’s hatred of the whites was motivated by the deaths of family members at their hands.&lt;ref name="tsha"/&gt;

It is notable that members of other tribes, mainly the [[Kiowa]]s and [[Cheyenne]]s, found his message appealing.  At first, the Comanche wished to exterminate the [[Tonkawa]]s, long allies and scouts for the hated [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]].  But disregarding that plan as secondary to the need of saving the buffalo, then approaching extermination at the hands of white hunters, the Comanches decided to attack the hunters in the [[Texas Panhandle]], who were destroying the buffalo and thereby endangering the Native American Plains tribes' chief source of food.   On June 27 a party of 250 - 1000 Indians, primarily all the bands of the Comanches, but including Kiowa and Cheyenne, attacked the buffalo hunters who were camping at the old trading post of Adobe Walls, on the [[South Canadian River]].   During the battle, led primarily by the young Comanche Quanah Parker, Isatai'i remained at least a mile away on a distant hill. The buffalo hunters,  twenty-eight men and one woman, protected by the solid adobe walls and armed with long-range rifles, fought off the Indians and finally compelled them to withdraw.  It was during this battle that [[Billy Dixon]] made what may be the most famous rifle shot of the west, hitting a Comanche chief one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) away.&lt;ref name="tsha"/&gt;

About fifteen warriors were killed and a larger number wounded, including Quanah Parker.&lt;ref name="tsha"/&gt;

==After Adobe Walls==

Isatai'i tried to absolve himself of the blame for the disastrous defeat by claiming that his magic had been weakened before the battle when one of the Cheyennes violated a sacred taboo by killing a skunk.&lt;ref name="tsha"/&gt; The Cheyennes took this poorly, especially the [[Dog Soldiers]], and responded by beating him severely.  Isatai'i was discredited and publicly humiliated.&lt;ref name="redriver"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/redriver/index.html | title=The Red River War of 1874 | work=Texas Beyond History | publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] | date=1 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

Although many military historians do not consider the Second Battle of Adobe Walls a major historic engagement, it was a crushing spiritual defeat for the Southern Plains Indians, who had come to believe fully in the superhuman prophetic powers of the medicine man, and being driven off by civilian buffalo hunters certainly marked the end of their time as any sort of military power.  Within a year, the Comanche and Kiowa were all on the reservation.&lt;ref name="tsha"/&gt;

He is of [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref&gt;Stagliano and Lencioni family history&lt;/ref&gt; ancestry with some of his grandparents from [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO/&gt;&lt;ref name=rog/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/16805/interview-john-stagliano-02/ |title=Interview: John Stagliano|date=April 10, 2002|work=rogreviews.com|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, he wrote [[erotic fiction]] for a small newspaper, and did some [[softcore pornography|softcore]] modeling.&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO/&gt; He made his debut in a [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[pornographic film]] in an [[8 mm film|8mm]] loop in 1974.&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO/&gt; In 1979, he was looking for dancing jobs in Hollywood. He replied to an advertisement in the ''[[Daily Variety]]'' looking for male [[stripper]]s for the new [[Chippendales]] show.&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionistastheshow.com/index.php?node=reviews-lv_tribune110504.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515102051/http://www.fashionistastheshow.com/index.php?node=reviews-lv_tribune110504.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 15, 2006|title=Las Vegas Show - John Stagliano's Fashionistas Website|work=fashionistastheshow.com|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed with the group four or five nights a week for the next four years.&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO/&gt; In 1982, when he was 30, he began publishing a small [[pornographic magazine]] on newsprint, which he called ''Evil Angel''.&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO/&gt;

==Adult film producer==
Initially he had little knowledge of film making, but he made his first movie for $8,000 in 1983, titled ''Bouncing Buns'', starring [[Stacy Donovan]]. For the next six years he made films for other companies to manufacture and distribute.&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evilangel.com/en/director/John-Stagliano/7 |title=Profile of John Stagliano |accessdate=2011-04-15 |date= |work= |publisher=evilangel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he started Evil Angel to sell his own films. The origin of the company's name dates back to when Stagliano was working as a stripper. "There was another guy in one of my shows named John. So this MC started calling me Evil John to differentiate us. This was when I was doing [[Dracula]] and chains. At the same time I had a girlfriend who called herself Angel when she did strip shows. She was a very nasty girl and I suggested that she call herself Evil Angel. She didn't, but I loved the name and wound up using it for my company."&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO/&gt;[[Image:John Stagliano DSC 0116 cropped.JPG|thumb|John Stagliano, AVN Expo, January 2005]]

The first Evil Angel film was ''Dance Fire'', filmed in 1988 by Stagliano, starring himself, Trinity Loren, Brandy Alexandre and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=90126 |title=Evil Angel Releases First-Ever Video on DVD |accessdate=2009-04-17 |author=Steve Javors |date=2008-02-14 |work= |publisher=[[XBIZ]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114162310/http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=90126 |archivedate=January 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Adventures of Buttman'' ===
In 1989, he produced "The Adventures of Buttman," the first in a popular series which is credited with sparking the "[[gonzo pornography|gonzo]]" adult film genre.&lt;ref&gt;-http://www.xbiz.com/articles/profiles/11549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AVNcompanyprofile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/companies/7671.html |title=ELEGANT ANGEL |accessdate=2009-04-11 |date= |work= |publisher=[[AVN (magazine)|AVN]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303111442/http://business.avn.com/companies/7671.html |archivedate=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/articles/82856 |title=Elegant Angel |accessdate=2009-04-11 |author=Hunter, Tod |date=2007-08-10 |work= |publisher=[[XBIZ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide2Gonzo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamelink.com/news.jhtml?news_id=news_nt_101_gonzo |title=The Quick and Dirty Guide to Gonzo |accessdate=2008-08-24 |last=Weasels |first=P }}&lt;/ref&gt; These films involved highlighting the female buttocks,&lt;ref name=STAGLIANO/&gt; with actors often licking, kissing and playfully biting the female behind. Stagliano has stated that a scene showing [[Tracey Adams]]' buttocks inspired him to make the ''Buttman'' series of films. The clip shows Adams on her hands and knees with her rear end stuck high in the air. "The shot only lasted a couple of seconds," says Stagliano, "but I knew then what I wanted to do."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lukeford.com/stars/female/tracey_adams.html Luke Ford&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527172251/http://www.lukeford.com/stars/female/tracey_adams.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Stagliano productions had little to no anal sex in them and were critically acclaimed for the showcasing of his buttocks [[sexual fetishism|fetish]]. Later ''Buttman'' films included numerous [[anal sex]] scenes, often featuring Stagliano himself. In the 1990s, Stagliano became one of the most successful figures in American pornographic films.&lt;ref name=Headpress&gt;{{cite book|title=Headpress: Powered by Love|publisher=[[Headpress]]|author1=O'Toole, Laurence  |author2=Kerekes, David |year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJU0uP5-MsoC|isbn=1-900486-22-9|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
He has directed series including ''Buttman at [[Nudes-A-Poppin|Nudes a Poppin']]'', ''Buttman Goes to Rio'', ''Buttman's Anal Divas'', ''Buttman's Anal Show'', ''Buttman's Bend Over Babes'', ''Buttman's Bend Over Brazilian Babes'', ''Buttman's Big Butt Backdoor Babes'', ''Buttman's Big Tit Adventure'', ''Buttman's Butt Freak'', ''Buttman's European Vacation'', ''Buttman's Favorite Big Butt Babes'', ''Face Dance'' and ''[[Fashionistas]]'', as well as numerous one-off films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evilangel.com/director/John_Stagliano/titles |title=JOHN STAGLIANO'S TITLES |accessdate=2009-04-17 |date= |work= |publisher=evilangel.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119115918/http://evilangel.com/director/John_Stagliano/titles |archivedate=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stagliano also served as mentor, producer, and co-director to [[Tristan Taormino]] in her video version of ''[[The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women]]''.

From October 2004 through February 2008, Stagliano produced and directed a [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] show called [[Fashionistas]] based on his porn film of the same name. In 2008, he won the 'Best Director - Video' award for ''Fashionistas Safado: Berlin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/13891052.html |title=SHOW REVIEW: "Fashionistas"  |accessdate=2009-04-18 |author=Mike Weatherford |date=2008-01-18 |work= |publisher=[[Las Vegas Review Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Safado" is a Portuguese word meaning lewd or salacious.)

Stagliano was described by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' magazine in 1998 as "the nation's leading director of hard-core videos."&lt;ref name=BigRedSon&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=David Foster|title=Consider the lobster and other essays|year=2007|publisher=Back Bay Books/Little, Brown and Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0316013321|pages=3–50|url=http://social.rollins.edu/wpsites/sexwarandplague/files/2012/07/DF-Wallace-Big-Red-Son.pdf|edition=1st Back Bay paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obscenity trial ===
On April 8, 2008, Evil Angel and Stagliano were indicted on federal [[obscenity]] charges by a federal [[grand jury]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080808135047/http://www.xbiz.com/docs/xbiz/news/92236_Stagliano%20indictment%20as%20filed.pdf Obscenity indictment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=92236 |title=John Stagliano, Evil Angel Charged With 7 Obscenity Violations |accessdate=2009-04-17 |author=Steve Javors |date=2008-04-09 |work= |publisher=[[XBIZ]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506140601/http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=92236 |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avn.com/video/articles/29505.html John Stagliano, Evil Angel Indicted On Federal Obscenity Charges] [[Adult Video News]], posted April 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/04/feds-charge-por/|title= Feds Charge Porn Producer With Selling Adult Content to Adults|work= wired.com|accessdate= July 17, 2010|author= Kevin Poulsen|date= 2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes selected by the government to support the  prosecution involved [[urination]], use of [[enema]]s, and [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]].&lt;ref name=drops/&gt;
 
On July 16, 2010, a federal trial began in Washington, D.C. with Stagliano as defendant and after three days all charges were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/All-Charges-Dismissed-Against-Stagliano-and-Companies-403848.html |title=All Charges Dismissed Against Stagliano and Companies|work=AVN|accessdate=July 17, 2010|author=Mark Kernes|date=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Richard J.

He stated that he hoped "[higher] courts and [[United States Congress|Congress]] will give greater guidance to judges in whose courtrooms these cases will be tried."&lt;ref name=drops/&gt;

===HIV lawsuit===
Stagliano was diagnosed with HIV in January 1997.

In a June 2013 lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court against Stagliano and his company Evil Angel, adult performer Katie Summers alleged "negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, sexual battery and violations of professions code section 17200" because Stagliano didn't inform her of his HIV positive status prior to her performing in the 2010 movie ''Buttman's Stretch Class 4''.  According to the lawsuit, Summers consented to Stagliano engaging in sexual contact within the context of her acting in an adult film. In the scene, Stagliano can be seen handing Summers sex toys and touching her buttocks, but he does not perform hardcore sex with her. Summers claims that had she known of Stagliano's status prior to the scene that she would not have done it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/06/18/porn-star-katie-summers-evil-angel-butt-man-hiv-lawsuit-john-stagliano/ |title=Porn Star Sues - 'Buttman' Never Told Me He Was HIV Positive |publisher=TMZ.com |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2014-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press interview, Stagliano's wife Karen&lt;ref name=Knot&gt;{{cite web | title =John and Karen Stagliano Tie the Knot | author=Jared Rutter | publisher =AVN.com | url =http://www.avn.com/performer/articles/33766.html| date = 2008-12-13| accessdate =2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; disputes the allegations: "John and the company feel that he did not do anything with Katie Summers that would warrant having to inform her of his HIV status," Karen said "He had no genital contact with her, no sexual touching of her genitals at all that would have put her at any sort of a medical risk whatsoever."

The suit against Stagliano went into forced [[arbitration]] and the [[plaintiff]] had her deposition taken, but on 29 September 2014 Summers dropped her lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/185660 |title=Katie Summers Drops Suit Against John Stagliano, Evil Angel|work=XBIZ|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stagliano's attorney, [[Paul Cambria]], "[Summers] had no case. I took her testimony and when I was done I could not see any possible way for her to succeed."

==Critical appraisal==
In her essay "[[Cracker (pejorative)|Crackers]] and [[Masturbation|Whackers]]: The [[White Trash]] of Porn,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Williams (film scholar)|Williams, Linda]] (editor). ''Porn Studies''; Duke University Press; Durham and London, 2004; {{ISBN|978-0822333128}}, p.325&lt;/ref&gt; which among other things brings into relief the heritage of [[bawdy song]]s, the related [[Joke#Folklore and anthropology|oral culture of joke telling]], and the "bawdy, farcical character" of early [[stag film]]s in modern porn, Constance Penley,&lt;ref&gt;Professor of [[film studies]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], author of ''The Future of an Illusion: Film, Feminism, and Psychoanalysis'' (1989), and ''Nasa/Trek: Popular Culture and Sex in America'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; exclaiming  that after its [[Golden Age of Porn|golden era]] passed, porn became "wonderfully trashy again," asserts that John Stagliano did for anal fetishism what [[Woody Allen]]  did for [[neurosis]], pointing out that, "as in so many stag films," Buttman is the "butt of the joke" since, "seeking the perfect shot of a woman's perfect ass," the character "gets mugged, evicted, bankrupted, rejected, and ridiculed&amp;nbsp;– &amp;nbsp;all in his single-minded quest for perfection."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3620">'''Joseph Oklahombi''' (May 1, 1895, [[Bokchito, Oklahoma|Bokchito]], [[Bryan County, Oklahoma]] - April 13, 1960) was an [[Americans|American]] [[soldier]] of the [[Choctaw]] nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/O/OK091.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was the most-decorated [[World War I]] soldier from [[Oklahoma]]. He served in Company D, First Battalion, [[141st Infantry Regiment (United States)|141st Regiment]], Seventy-first Brigade of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|Thirty-sixth Infantry Division]] during World War I, where he was one of the [[Choctaw code talkers]].

On October 8, 1918, Private Oklahombi was at St. Etienne, [[France]]. He and 23 other soldiers attacked an enemy position and captured 171 Germans while killing some 79 more. They held their position for four days while under attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/j_oklah.htm|title=Joseph Oklahombi|website=www.worldwar1.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahombi was awarded the [[Silver Star]] with Victory Ribbon, and the [[Croix de Guerre]] from France's Marshal [[Henri-Philippe Petain]]. At the time the members of the Choctaw nation were not formally U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Choctaw Code Talkers", PBS documentary, {{cite web|url=http://www.choctawnation.com/news-room/press-room/media-releases/choctaw-code-talkers-documentary-comes-to-public-television-in-fall-2010/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206005403/http://www.choctawnation.com/news-room/press-room/media-releases/choctaw-code-talkers-documentary-comes-to-public-television-in-fall-2010 |archivedate=2011-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oklahombi was married and had a son. He was killed on 13 April 1960 when hit by a truck while walking along a road.  He was buried with military honors at Yashau Cemetery in [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/61970347 Joseph Oklahombi at Findagrave.com&lt;/ref&gt;

From '''Chief Gary Batton''' of the '''Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma''':

"Many of you know the story of the Choctaw Code Talkers of WWI and WWII and also the story of Code Talker Joseph Oklahombi, who single-handedly captured 171 Germans after moving 200 yards over open ground against artillery and machine gun fire, rushing a machine gun nest and capturing one of the guns.

==Biography==
Kohn was a federal [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] agent from [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He dated [[Tara Knowles]], but they split and she returned to her home town of [[Charming, California]] to escape him. She also filed a [[restraining order]] against him. Tara became pregnant in Chicago, but had an abortion at six weeks. He then became obsessed with her and tracked her down.

===Season 1===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 1)}}
Josh Kohn travelled to Charming to look for Tara, and pretended to be investigating a local motorcycle gang, the [[Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club|Sons of Anarchy]], as his reason for being there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Fun+Town/episode/1228109/recap.html Fun Town - Recap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316032810/http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Fun+Town/episode/1228109/recap.html |date=2010-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered that she had previously been in a relationship with [[Jax Teller]], the Vice-President of the Sons of Anarchy, and began following him and taking photographs. He trailed him out to [[Indian Hills, Nevada]] and photographed him having sex with a woman. He then sent these photos to Tara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Patch+Over/episode/1216591/recap.html Patch Over - Recap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316033830/http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Patch+Over/episode/1216591/recap.html |date=2010-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began stalking Tara and phoning her frequently. When Tara told Jax about this, he threatened to kill him if he went near Tara again. He also reported him to the police, who in turn informed the ATF. Upon learning that Kohn has threatened Abel and the authorities have not yet apprehended him, Jax went and hunted for him himself. He found him at the local barber shop, and a brawl ensued with Jax emerging the victor. Kohn was then arrested for breaching his restraining order on Tara. He was told that his career as an ATF agent was over and taken to the airport in a police car, with instructions to return to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Old+Bones/episode/1224007/recap.html Old Bones - Recap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908074103/http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Old+Bones/episode/1224007/recap.html |date=2009-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Charming in the dead of night, however, and broke into Tara's home. He then attempted to rape her, but she grabbed his pistol and shot him in the stomach. As he lay bleeding, she called Jax and told him to come over and help. Shortly after arriving at her house, Jax took the gun from Tara and shot Kohn in the head. Jax later took his body to the desert and burned it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Hell+Followed/episode/1228115/recap.html Hell Followed - Recap]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}
Kohn is mentioned to have been declared MIA by the ATF, having failed to arrive in Chicago. Stahl, however, had private suspicions that SAMCRO murdered Kohn. These suspicions are confirmed when speaking with Jax during his time in San Jaoquin County Jail, Jax all-but-confessed to killing Kohn - he casually asks if Stahl ever heard from Kohn, remarking how dangerous it must be to be a federal agent. Stahl immediately realized Jax killed Kohn, yet she "thought (he) was too pretty to be a killer" and hinted that, once her investigation into the True IRA was over, she would look around Charming for Kohn's shallow grave.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22371">'''Viola June Cobb''' (August 24, 1927 – October 17, 2015) was an American informant for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. She worked at [[Fidel Castro]]'s headquarters in [[Havana]] as a translator and public relations worker in 1959 and 1960. After leaving Cuba, Cobb continued working for the CIA in Guatemala and Mexico. She was the first CIA asset to relay an account of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] having attended a [[twist (dance)|twist]] party in Mexico City weeks before the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. Earlier in the 1950s, Cobb was involved with the production and trafficking of narcotics with her Colombian fiancé and his twin brother. She later provided information to the US [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] that led to arrests in Cuba and Colombia.

Cobb was fluent in Spanish, notably translating Castro's "[[History Will Absolve Me]]" speech and former Guatemalan president [[Juan José Arévalo]]'s short story ''The Shark and the Sardines''.

==Early life and education==
Viola June Cobb was born on August 24, 1927 in [[Ponca City, Oklahoma]] to Jasper E. Cobb and Jesse Lois Sharp.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=449}} She graduated from [[Ponca City High School]], and went on to attend [[University of Oklahoma]] for one year{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=383}} in the mid-1940s.&lt;ref name="MDNR"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Sooner, on Castro Staff, Denies Red Tie|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1831024/viola_june_cobb_arrival_from_cuba_1960/|work=Miami Daily News-Record|agency=Associated Press|date=September 18, 1960|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then worked at a Ponca City radio station and for a local newspaper as a courthouse reporter.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=383}} She was an adjunct of the [[Civil Air Patrol]] squadron in [[Norman, Oklahoma]], attaining the rank of 2nd class Lieutenant.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=449}}

==Travels to Mexico and Colombia==
After leaving the University of Oklahoma, Cobb traveled to [[Mexico]], where she met Rafael Herran Olozaga, who was from a wealthy and politically-connected Colombian family. Both his great-grandfather, [[Pedro Alcántara Herrán]], and his great-great-grandfather, [[Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera]], had served as Presidents of Colombia.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=379}} His family disapproved of the relationship, considering Cobb beneath his station. They were later engaged.

Cobb took extension classes with Olozaga&lt;ref name="MFF1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hermsdorf|first1=Harry|title=104-10174-10123: Memorandum: Contingent Recruitment of Viola June Cobb|url=https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=35494#relPageId=2&amp;tab=page|publisher=Mary Ferrell Foundation|accessdate=May 23, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University]] in [[Mexico City]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="MDNR"/&gt; In Mexico, she worked for an oil firm&lt;!-- Texas-based Southeastern Oil Company?&lt;ref name="MFF1"/&gt; --&gt; in public relations. She also edited ''Modern Mexico'', a Mexican Chamber of Commerce publication.&lt;ref name="MDNR"/&gt;

In 1948, Cobb traveled with Olozaga and his twin brother Tomas to Colombia. The brothers had plans to cultivate and traffic [[opium]].{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=379}} By 1949, they were on a six-month expedition in the [[Ecuador]]ian jungle where they were engaged in cocaine production.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|pp=383, 385}} Cobb worked for [[Pan American Airways]] and was a public relations employee in [[Guayaquil]], Ecuador.&lt;ref name="MDNR"/&gt; Six months later, Cobb was back in Colombia. She returned to Oklahoma in 1950 and spent around ten months living with her father,{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|pp=385–386}} working as a news reporter in [[Kay County, Oklahoma|Kay County]].&lt;ref name="MDNR"/&gt;

Cobb returned to Colombia in 1951 and contracted [[leishmaniasis]],&lt;ref name="medical"&gt;[https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=35521#relPageId=2&amp;tab=page Summary of her medical record from first attack of tropical fever], HSCA Segregated CIA Collection (microfilm - reel 11: June Cobb), October 20, 1960, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; a rare tropical disease. She returned to the United States for treatment, spending several months hospitalized at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in New York City. After she recovered, she spent five months working at the hospital as an administrative assistant for Dr. Isidore Snapper.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|pp=383, 395}} In early 1952, Cobb began a relationship with the [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]].{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=379}} During the summer of 1952, she was employed with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in their letters department. Cobb then moved to Chicago and worked as a secretary again for Snapper, who was now the director of medical education at [[Cook County Hospital]].{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|pp=383, 395}}

Cobb returned to New York City in 1953 and found work as an interpreter and translator. Her friend Warren Broglie,&lt;ref&gt;Broglie was also a CIA informant.&lt;/ref&gt; manager of the [[Waldorf Astoria]], referred clients to her.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=384}} Towards the end of 1953, Cobb worked briefly for [[Foster Wheeler]], a firm that was building a refinery in Colombia.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=386}} In the summer of 1954, Cobb was treated for [[agranulocytosis]] at [[Beth-El Hospital]] in New York.&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt;

By 1955, Cobb was traveling in Latin America. In 1956, she worked for the Colombian-American Culture Foundation in Medellin and taught briefly at the American school.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=386}}

In December 1956, the Olozaga brothers were arrested in Havana for possession and distribution of [[heroin]]. The pair were apprehended by Cuban law enforcement officials, with the assistance of US FBN agents, a day after Cobb had left Cuba for [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. Cobb had traveled with the brothers to Havana to help them sell several grams of heroin and several ounces of cocaine.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=379}} The brothers were released quickly, owing to their family connections.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|pp=379–380}} In a joint operation of the FBN and the Colombian Intelligence Service, the brothers were arrested again in Medellin, Colombia in February 1957 for running a cocaine laboratory on their parents' estate. FBN agent George Gaffney later recalled that the 1957 operation originated in New Orleans when "a woman with CIA connections offered information" to an agent.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=380}}

In 1957, Cobb briefly worked as a secretary for county attorney Ralph Haynes.&lt;ref name="MDNR"/&gt;

For a time in 1958, Cobb was acquainted with Dimitre Dimitrov, a Bulgarian politician who had been imprisoned in Greece and interrogated by the CIA as part of [[Project ARTICHOKE]].{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=175}}

By 1959, Cobb had moved to New York City. She lived briefly at the Hotel Iroquois.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=310}}

==Involvement with Cuba==
===Meeting Castro===
Cobb visited Havana in February 1959 and later recounted meeting with [[Fidel Castro]]'s Minister of Health regarding their campaign against vice and cooperation with doctors from Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia against the use of [[coca]] leaves.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=388}} During her trip she was given a copy of Castro's 1953 "[[History Will Absolve Me]]" speech. When she returned to the United States, she set about translating the speech to English. Cuban journalist Luis Conte Agüero learned of the translation and visited Cobb in New York. He wrote a prologue for the booklet and assisted with printing costs.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=388}}

After Castro was sworn in as Cuba's Prime Minister, he visited the United States in April 1959. One evening in New York, Cobb accompanied Agüero to the Statler Hotel where she was introduced to Castro. She had brought a copy of the translated speech. Castro was pleased when he saw the booklet she had made and ordered a print run of 1,000 copies to be made and distributed in New York.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=46}} Cobb also met Castro's private secretary [[Celia Sánchez]], who invited her to Havana to work under Castro in the Ministry Office.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=72}}

===Working for Castro===
Cobb agreed, traveling to Cuba afterwards. Her duties in Havana included translating Castro's speeches and working as a public relations assistant.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=46}} She also translated Castro's new land reform laws into English.&lt;ref name="Parade"/&gt; She worked on the 18th floor, down the hall from Castro's office.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=72}} She and [[William Alexander Morgan]] were the only Americans to gain any sort of influence in the new regime.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=73}}

Cobb returned to the United States in June 1959, and again for medical treatment in September and December of that year. While recuperating from surgery, Cobb stayed at a beach house owned by Castro and Sánchez.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=72}}

Cobb disagreed with Castro openly over his turn to [[authoritarianism]] and [[Marxism]], her anger becoming evident as the Communist influence on him became obvious. Cobb had hoped that a cessation in the US bombing of Cuban cane fields would prevent Castro's turn towards dictatorship.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=74}}

In early 1960, during Castro's second trip to New York, tabloids reported that 17-year-old [[Marita Lorenz]] had been raped by the Cuban leader. She was pregnant, and Cobb later said that the father was Castro's bodyguard, Jesus Yanez Pelletier.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=73}} Lorenz's mother later reported that Cobb had called her and offered her employment if she would return to Cuba with her daughter.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=77}} [[Che Guevara]] conducted an investigation of the incident and Cobb was included in a roundup of the suspects. She was protected by Castro and Sánchez, but the relationship cooled and she lost the access she had had before.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=74}}

===CIA recruitment===
&lt;!-- In April 1960, CIA case officer Joe Piccolo, working for the Western Hemisphere Division's Cuban branch, found a discrepancy in Cobb's records while conducting an expedited records check. He discovered that while Cobb claimed that she had first gone to Cuba in September, she had actually gone much earlier. The CIA intervened and closed Piccolo's investigation. --&gt;
CIA agent Harry Hermsdorf, undercover as a European journalist in Cuba, first met Cobb in the [[Hotel Tryp Habana Libre|Havana Hilton]]'s hotel coffee shop while having coffee with Jorge Losada, the editor of ''Vision'', a Latin American magazine. Losada introduced Cobb to Hermsdorf, who was using the alias Heinrich Heubner. Following a brief conversation, Cobb agreed to arrange meetings with Cuban officials for Hermsdorf and ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' correspondent [[Claus Jacobi]].{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=392}}

From May 24–26, 1960, Cobb met with Hermsdorf, who evaluated her at her hotel. Without mentioning the CIA, he offered her a long-term employment opportunity and invited her to meet him somewhere outside of Cuba. They arranged to meet at the [[Drake Hotel (New York City)|Drake Hotel]] in New York on June 3.&lt;ref name="MFF1"/&gt; Cobb traveled to the United States in early June 1960. She also stopped in Washington, D.C., where she stayed at the [[Raleigh Hotel (Washington D.C.)|Raleigh Hotel]]. The CIA arranged surveillance of her hotel room and of a [[polygraph]] that she took.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=107}}

Cobb made a verbal agreement to work for the CIA and returned to Havana on June 7, and was to be paid 200 Cuban pesos per month plus expenses. Jean T. Pierson was designated her CIA handler. Hermsdorf asked Cobb to monitor the activities of the chief of [[Prensa Latina]] and the head of the Free China News Agency. He also requested that she determine what [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]] had accomplished on his recent trip to the [[Soviet Union]] and pass on the "names and contacts of Soviet and satellite citizens" who dealt with the Cuban government.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=395}} In a June CIA memo from Hermsdorf, he wrote "If Miss Cobb can be controlled and accepts steering, it would perhaps be desirable to mould her into a long-range asset by having her become very cozy with the communist leaders and become, overtly, ever more 'rabid' about the revolutionary movement. Later she could perhaps be used elsewhere in Latin America, probably among the rabid left wing youth groups that are becoming increasingly anti-American and more powerful in various areas."{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=395}}

Cobb left Cuba in September 1960, and on September 12 formalized her contract with the CIA, which stipulated that she received $200 each month for a year-long operation, called JMARC, "to penetrate the Cuban government in an effort to obtain information on present and planned activities of the Castro regime." Cobb was given the cryptonym AMUPAS-1.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|p=74}}&lt;ref&gt;Cobb's aliases included "Clarinda E. Sharpe" and "Joyce Pineinch".&lt;/ref&gt; From September 21 to 29, the CIA maintained surveillance of Cobb's hotel room in New York City.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=107}} Cobb was acquainted with Kennedy advisor [[Richard N. Goodwin]], and soon had direct access to the White House through him.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|pp=74–75}}

While in Havana, one more than one occasion, Cobb met with CIA operative [[David Sánchez Morales]] at the house of Geraldine Shamma.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=243}}

Cobb's first CIA operation involved befriending [[CBS]] newscaster Richard Gibson, a co-founder of the [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]].{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|pp=93–94}} Cobb determined that Gibson had made a trip to Cuba, met with Castro and [[Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado]], and received money for operating expenses and to maintain the FPCC New York office.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|pp=227–228}} In later testimony, Cobb said that she had firsthand knowledge that Cuba was funding the committee.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|pp=93–94}} During 1961, Gibson wrote a number of letters to Cobb.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=301}}

==Guatemala==
Around 1961, alongside Raul Osegueda, Cobb translated former Guatemalan President [[Juan José Arévalo]]'s 1956 allegory ''The Shark and the Sardines'' to English.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|pp=84–85}} From Mexico, Cobb assisted Guatemalan revolutionaries fighting [[Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]], helping them obtain equipment.&lt;ref name="Parade"/&gt; She was deported by the Guatemalan police on November 9, 1961.{{cn|date=June 2017}} CIA Mexico City cables related that Cobb was deported with Achilles Centeno Perez. Guatemalan border officials told them they would be killed if they returned to the country. Cobb's entry to Mexico was assisted by George Frederick Munro, whose family maintained a ranch in [[Cuernavaca]] that Cobb said she visited several times. Munro advised Cobb against returning to Guatemala, where she wanted to complete an undisclosed task on behalf of the CIA.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|pp=258–259}}

==Appearance before Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security==
In March 1962, Cobb was called to testify before an executive session of the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security]].{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=385}} Prior to her appearance,  She did not reveal her association with the CIA and members of the subcommittee appeared unaware of the fact.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=385}}

An August 12, 1962 article by Jack Anderson in ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' magazine painted Cobb as a "[[wikt:soldier of fortune|soldier of fortune]]", detailing her time working for Castro and her involvement with drug trafficking in Latin America.&lt;ref name="Parade"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jack|title=Meet June Cobb: She's a soldier of fortune|url=https://jfkjmn.com/new-page-4|work=Parade|date=August 12, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico City==
In June 1963, the CIA reapproved Cobb as an informant for WH/3-Mexico D.F., despite an October 1962 CIA security memo recommending no contact with her other than assessment.{{sfn|Newman|2008|p=302}} Later that year, Cobb was transferred to Mexico City and her cryptonym was changed to LICOOKY-1.{{sfn|Russo|Molton|2008|pp=93–94}}

Cobb then moved to Mexico City. She was a CIA asset for the Mexico City station, reporting to [[David Atlee Phillips]].{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=243}} Warren Broglie, who was then managing Hotel Luma, passed information to Cobb that she relayed to station chief [[Winston M. Scott]].{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=385}} When she was in need of a residence, her friend [[Eunice Odio]] suggested she call [[Elena Garro]].

Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy by [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], and the release of the [[Warren Report]], Cobb was privy to a conversation between Elena Garro, her sister Deva Guerrero, and her daughter. They expressed surprise at seeing Oswald's face in the newspapers, as they said they recognized him from a [[twist (dance)|twist]] party at the home of Rubén Durán. They said that he was accompanied by two other men who looked like [[beatnik]]s. In an October 5 report, Cobb informed the CIA of the conversation.{{sfn|Shenon|2013|pp=495–497}} Cobb wanted the women to tell American authorities what they knew, but advised them against going to the American embassy, instead suggesting that they go to Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=1540&amp;relPageId=6&amp;search=cobb On December 25, Sra. De Paz again discussed at considerable length her alleged encounter with Oswald...], [[Assassination Records Review Board]]. December 25, 1965. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb was asked to leave Garro's home after their cat's back legs were found broken.

Oswald had checked out a copy of ''The Shark and the Sardines'' from the Dallas Public Library on about November 6, 1963. The book had not been returned.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|pp=84–85}}

As of December 1965, Cobb was roommates with Eunice Odio.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=357}} In 1965 and 1966, Cobb set up Milton Abramson, a New York-based drug trafficker, Adela Castillo, and others for arrest by the FBI in the United States.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=383}}

==Death==

The CIA's extensive file on Cobb is estimated to include over 2,500 pages. Following the Kennedy assassination, all of the documents related to Cobb's work with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics were marked secret.{{sfn|Albarelli, Jr.|2013|p=379}} Following the passage of the [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992]], many of the documents have been declassified. Some of the [[Warren Commission]]'s declassified files indicate that the CIA, in the late 1970s, refused to help [[House Select Committee on Assassinations|House Select Committee on Assassinations]] investigators locate Cobb for an interview about Oswald's activities in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt;

Further documents concerning Cobb that are related to the assassination were scheduled to be released under the JFK Records Act in October 2017.

'''Karl Hermann Jeschke''' (born August 17, 1890, date of death unknown) was an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Oberscharführer]]'' and member of staff at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. He was prosecuted at the [[Auschwitz Trial]].

Jeschke was born in [[Hohenliebenthal]]. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. He served in the [[Wehrmacht]] fighting on the front until 1944. In July 1944 he was drafted into the [[Waffen-SS]] and sent to Auschwitz, where he worked as a guard. In mid-September 1944 he was transferred to the Charlottengrube subcamp.

After [[World War II]], Jeschke was tried by the [[Supreme National Tribunal]] in [[Kraków]]. He received a three-year prison sentence.

They were ordered to pay fines and compensation of $AUD1.1 million. After the Australian government intervened on their behalf, Kerry and Kay Danes were provisionally released on 6 October 2001.

==Gem Mining Lao ==
===Background===
[[File:Mekong border crossing.jpg|thumb|right|Huay Xai, Laos border crossing to Thailand]]
The Lao People's Democratic Republic ([[Laos]]) is one of the world's least developed [[Communism|communist]] countries. In 1994, Laos was the world's third largest producer of [[Drug policy in Laos|opium]], primarily in the northern provinces. Much of this predominantly [[Buddhism in Laos|Buddhist]] [[Landlocked country|landlocked]] [[socialist state]] lacks adequate infrastructure. The [[Lao People's Armed Forces]] (LPAF) is small, poorly funded, and ineffectively resourced. Its mission focus is border and internal security, primarily in internal suppression of Laotian dissident and opposition groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html CIA Factbook: Laos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] (LPRP) is the only legal political party. In 1991, a new constitution was adopted and enshrined a leading role for the LPRP. 

In 1994, Bjarne (Bernie) Jeppesen ([[Denmark]]) and his wife Julie Bruns ([[New Zealand]]) founded Gem Mining Lao PDR (GML) with Lao-born American, Somkhit Vilavong. They were granted a fifteen year concession from the Lao government to mine at [[Huay Xai]], a small city located in the north, which lies on the east of the [[Mekong]] just over the river border from [[Chiang Khong|Chiang Khong, Thailand]] near the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]. In May 2000, Jeppesen and his wife fled Laos amidst charges of embezzlement. The Lao Government terminated GML’s mining concession and then nationalized GML’s sapphire mines. Jeppesen's caretakers, Kerry and Kay Danes, were arrested later the same year. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sapphminco.com/history-of-lao-sapphire-mines.php|title=Laos – Land of a Million Elephants… &amp; Sapphires by Richard W. Hughes, Auslan Ishmael, Flavie Isatelle &amp; Peter Wang|work=|date= |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 8}}

===Kerry and Kay Danes=== 
[[File:That luang1.jpg|thumb|left|Pha That Luang in Vientiane is the national symbol of Laos]]
By the end of 2000, [[Warrant officer|Warrant Officer (WO)]] Kerry Danes, a [[Special Air Service Regiment|Special Air Service Regiment (SAS)]] soldier on extended leave from the [[Australian Army]], had been living for two years in the capital city [[Vientiane]]. According to American gem expert [[Richard W. Hughes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruby-sapphire.com/lao_sapphires.htm|title=Love &amp; Hate by Richard W. Hughes|work=|date= |accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 44 - 48}}, Danes was general manager of ''Lao Securicor'' (a subsidiary of [[Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited]]), a company that provided a security guard for the Vientiane office of the country's biggest sapphire mine, Gem Mining Lao (GML).  Amidst allegations of missing gems, the registered owners and founders/executives of GML had been prohibited from leaving Laos. Security contractor Kerry Danes formally agreed to handle all affairs for GML prior to two of their founders fleeing Laos on 28 May 2000 to [[Bangkok|Bangkok, Thailand]] (and later Denmark). More than 450 Laotian employees of GML lost their jobs. The Lao government later convicted the fugitive GML pair (who never returned) in absentia for theft and misappropriations related to GML, and sentenced them to twenty years imprisonment. According to Bernie Jeppesen (GML), Danes' subsequent problem resulted from his association with Gem Mining Lao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/85920-20001226.html|title=LAO GOVERNMENT SEIZES SAPPHIRE MINING COMPANY, RADIO FREE ASIA REPORTS|work=Radio Free Asia|date=26 December 2000|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Detainment====
[[File:Geschliffener blauer Saphir.jpg|thumb|left|Picture of a blue sapphire (for illustration purposes only)]]
Kerry Danes formally agreed to handle all affairs for GML when two of its founders, Jeppeson and Bruns, unlawfully fled Laos to Thailand on 28 May 2000.  Danes also co-signed a letter from Jeppesen accusing members of the Lao government of corruption. Two months after the departure of Jeppeson and Bruns, quantities of [[Huay Xai|Huay Sai]] sapphires allegedly appeared at [[Chanthaburi]] gem markets in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruby-sapphire.com/lao_sapphires.htm|title=Love &amp; Hate by Richard W. Hughes|work=|date= |accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 45 - 46}} Danes was the managing director of Lao Securicor, a security company in charge of shipping gems for GML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/01/1022569846085.html|title=Free, but 'still there'|work=The Age|date=2 June 2002 |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 12}} In December 1999, the Lao government had ordered GML to suspend exports of all raw and semi-finished sapphire products. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/85920-20001226.html|title=LAO GOVERNMENT SEIZES SAPPHIRE MINING COMPANY, RADIO FREE ASIA REPORTS|work=Radio Free Asia|date=26 December 2000|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 December 2000, Kerry Danes (aged 42) was seized in his Vientiane office by Lao secret police  on suspicion of involvement in the theft of over $US6 million worth of sapphires and cash from a gem mine that he had been hired to secure. Under Lao law, suspects could be held for up to twelve months before charges were laid. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Lao-breaks-silence-on-detained-Oz-couple-20001230|title=Lao breaks silence on detained Oz couple|work=news24|date=30 December 2000 |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GML [[fugitive]] Bernie Jeppesen attributed Danes' problem to his association with Gem Mining Lao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/85920-20001226.html|title=LAO GOVERNMENT SEIZES SAPPHIRE MINING COMPANY, RADIO FREE ASIA REPORTS|work=Radio Free Asia|date=26 December 2000|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Danes' wife, Kay (aged 33), worked as an office manager for Lao Securicor security company, which contracted to GML. She tried to flee the country on foot the same day with two of their three children (the third child, aged 14, was not in Laos), but was detained with $US52,700 cash at the nearby [[Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge|Laos-Thailand border]] by the head of Lao secret police. Under Lao law, suspects could be held for up to twelve months before charges were laid. The children, Sahra (aged 11) and Nathan Danes (aged 7), were released and with the aid of Australian consular staff, returned to Australia two days later on 25 December 2000 to stay with their grandparents in [[Brisbane]]. Kerry and Kay Danes were incarcerated in separate sections of mixed-sex [[Phonthong Prison]], known as the 'Foreigners Prison', near Vientiane. On Christmas Day, Kay reportedly told her mother by mobile phone: "Mum, I think by tomorrow I'll be dead." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Lao-breaks-silence-on-detained-Oz-couple-20001230|title=Lao breaks silence on detained Oz couple|work=news24|date=30 December 2000 |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1092480.stm|title=Fears for couple seized in Laos|work=BBC News|date=3 January 2001 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 10}} 

====Allegations====
In May 2001, the Danes’ [[Sydney]]-based lawyer said Kay's psychological condition was deteriorating, and she had developed a bad toothache in need of treatment. However, Kerry was physically and mentally strong. The case against the Danes centred on the transfer of a small fortune ($AUD200,000) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2001-06-30/fears-australian-couple-in-laos-jail/557974|title=Fears Australian couple in Laos jail|work=ABC Radio Australia|date= 24 March 2012|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a Lao bank account in Kay Danes’ name. The transfer occurred about the time authorities alleged that finished and rough-cut sapphires worth millions of dollars disappeared from the office of a mining company that Danes provided security for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tasmaniantimes.com.au/index.php/article/a-journalists-life-2|title=A journalist’s life (2)|work=Courier Mail by Daniel Pedersen|date=15 May 2001 |accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 4}} Soon after the Danes were detained, fugitive Bernie Jeppesen (GML) claimed that two dubious Australian characters (one notorious for [[Money laundering|money laundering]] and the other a [[Disbarment|disbarred]] lawyer) known as associates of murdered [[Melbourne]] lawyer/[[Confidence trick|conman]] [[Max Green (lawyer)|Max Green]]) were the main [[Allegation|accusers]] against the Danes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tasmaniantimes.com.au/index.php/article/a-journalists-life-2|title=A journalist’s life (2)|work=Courier Mail by Daniel Pedersen|date=15 May 2001 |accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 7}}

[[File:Alexander Downer.jpg|thumb|left|Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer in 2003]]

====Conviction====
In June 2001, a Lao court convicted both Kerry and Kay Danes of embezzlement, tax evasion and destruction of evidence, sentenced each to seven years imprisonment, and ordered them to pay fines and compensation of $AUD1.1 million. The Australian government intervened on their behalf, and the Danes had served less than a total of ten months in prison when provisionally released on 6 October 2001. Not yet permitted to leave the country, the Danes decamped at the residence of Australian ambassador to Laos, Jonathan Thwaites. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruby-sapphire.com/lao_sapphires.htm|title=Love &amp; Hate by Richard W. Hughes|work=|date= |accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 50}}  Laos authorities returned cash seized from Kay Danes and bank account funds of almost $200,000  ordered frozen at the time of the Danes' arrest. However, it was expected that such monies would be used to pay fines and compensation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2001-06-30/fears-australian-couple-in-laos-jail/557974|title=Fears Australian couple in Laos jail|work=ABC Radio Australia|date= 24 March 2012|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Pardon====
In large part due to Laos's strong ties with Australia, coupled with the fact that Kerry Danes was still enlisted as a full-time [[Non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned officer]] in the Australian Defence Force, the pair received a formal presidential pardon on 6 November 2001, which absolved them of their convictions.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|title=The Europa World Year Book Kazakhstan-Zimbabwe|date=July 2004|publisher=Europa Publications Ltd|isbn=978-1857432558|pages=2563|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C&amp;pg=PA2563&amp;dq=kay+danes|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Alexander Downer]], the Danes were advised they were free to leave Laos and welcome to return at any time if they wished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2001/fa165_01.html|title=Kerry and Kay Danes pardoned in Laos|work=Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer Media Release|date=6 November 2001|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple flew back to Australia, and Kerry Danes returned to military service. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaydanes.com/appearances.html|title=Hostage to Humanitarian Presentation (Rotary)|work=Kay Danes|date=23 May 2017 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fines====
As a condition of release in October 2001, the Danes agreed to pay the June 2001 court-ordered $AUD1.1 million in fines and compensation in four equal instalments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruby-sapphire.com/lao_sapphires.htm|title=Love &amp; Hate by Richard W. Hughes|work=|date= |accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 51}} When told that the Lao government was considering court action for non-payment in August 2002, Kay Danes argued on [[ABC Local Radio]] that the agreement was simply a diplomatic face-saving exercise, and she felt that the Australian government should intervene on their behalf again because she would be [[Capital punishment|"executed"]] if forced to return to Laos. The Australian Foreign Minister's press secretary advised that the issue was a private legal matter between the Laos government and the Danes. Australia was obligated to pass on any court order issued in Laos, however no official documents had been received by the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s659886.htm|title=Laos government asks Danes for $1m|work=ABC The World Today|date=27 August 2002|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Meditating Under the Bodhi Tree, 800 C.E.jpg|thumb|The Buddha under a bodhi tree.]]
====Film====
In 2013, the producers of ''The [[Bodhi]] Tree'' film considered buying an option on Kay Danes' 2009 memoir ''Standing Ground: An Imprisoned Couple's Struggle for Justice Against a Communist Regime'' but later decided to base the film on two [[novel|novels]] by British journalist [[Paul Conroy (journalist)|Paul Conroy]]. ''The Bodhi Tree'' concentrates on the main story of [[Max Green (lawyer)|lawyer Max Green]], Australia's biggest legal fraudster, who embezzled millions of dollars and was later murdered in [[Cambodia]]. The smaller supporting story [[Fiction|fictionalises]] the Danes in Laos. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.if.com.au/who-killed-melbourne-tax-lawyer/|title=Who killed Melbourne tax lawyer? |date=9 November 2014|accessdate=29 March 2018 |publisher=if.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kerry Arthur Danes==
[[Warrant officer|WO]] Kerry Danes (born 21 October 1958 Longreach, Queensland) resumed Australian military service after leaving Laos in 2001. His known overseas postings include [[Afghanistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[West Bank]]. The compulsory [[Retirement|retirement]] age for [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) personnel is 60 years and 65 years for reservists. However, there is provision for the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] or the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] to extend the compulsory retirement age for either a specific officer or member or a class of officers or members. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/2-recruitment-and-employment-law/compulsory-retirement|title=Australian Government Recruitment and Employment Law|work=Australian Law Reform Commission|date=|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/adf-troops-able-to-serve-until-60-20070402-5kl.html|title=ADF troops able to serve until 60|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of Danes can be viewed online, but these pictures appear to be either subject to copyright or are on websites that Wikipedia has [[Blacklist|blacklisted]], such as [[Change.org]]: a for-profit site on which organisations pay to host and promote their petitions.

==Kay Frances Danes==
Kay Frances Stewart was born on 20 October 1967 in the [[Brisbane|Brisbane, Queensland]] suburb of [[Wynnum, Queensland|Wynnum]]. She married Australian [[Special forces|special forces]] soldier Kerry Danes and together they had three children: the first being born in 1986. The [[Special Air Service Regiment|Special Air Service Regiment (SAS)]] is based at [[Campbell Barracks (Australia)|Campbell Barracks]] in [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]], a suburb of [[Perth, Western Australia]]. In 1998, Kerry took extended leave without pay to try his luck in a civilian job in poverty-stricken Laos and enjoyed a relatively opulent comfortable [[Expatriate|expatriate]] lifestyle. His wife and three pre-teen children followed. Kay was engaged as an office manager for husband Kerry. In her memoirs, Kay Danes refers to herself as an [[Adrenaline junkie|adrenaline junkie]] &lt;ref&gt;https://kaydanes.wordpress.com/books/beneath-the-pale-blue-burqa/&lt;/ref&gt; and regarded Laos as an exciting adventure up until being jailed in December 2000. 

===Thailand===
At the start of Chapter 1 of her third memoir ''Families Behind Bars: Stories of Injustice, Endurance and Hope'' (2008), Kay Danes writes that she was also a director of a [[bodyguard]] company based in [[Thailand]] at the time she was detained in Laos in 2000. She claims to have hired out former elite military and police officers. Danes also asserts that she had access to the [[King of Thailand]]'s own personal bodyguards, and she would sometimes provide close protection services to employers of her husband's security company in Laos. Opposite page 96 of her fourth memoir ''Standing Ground: An Imprisoned Couple's Struggle for Justice Against a Communist Regime'' (2009), Danes captions a picture of herself at [[Siem Reap]] airport on a [[covert]] surveillance assignment in 2000. Separately, Kay Danes' mother writes on page 43 of ''Families Behind Bars'' that Kay called her in Australia on Christmas Day 2000 on Kerry Danes' mobile phone after secretly concealing it during her first two days of imprisonment in Laos. No information is provided with respect to who else Kay Danes may have contacted.

====Background====
Shortly after independence in 1953, a long civil war ended the monarchy. Since 1975, Laos has been a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist republic]] that espouses [[Marxism–Leninism]]. It is governed by the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]], in which the party leadership is dominated by military figures. As a multi-ethnic country, the politically and culturally dominant [[Lao people]] making up approximately fifty-five percent of the population, live mostly in the lowlands. [[Mon-Khmer languages|Mon-Khmer]] groups, the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and other indigenous hill tribes, accounting for the other forty-five percent, live in the foothills and mountains. From 1975 to 1996, the United States resettled some 250,000 Lao [[Refugee|refugees]] from Thailand, including 130,000 Hmong.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2770.htm Laos (04/09)]. U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Indochina refugee crisis]]) The government of Laos has been accused of committing [[genocide]], and [[human rights]] and [[religious freedom]] violations against the Hmong ethnic minority within its own borders.&lt;ref name="Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unpo.org/article/5095|author1=Unrepresented Nations |author2=Peoples Organization | accessdate=6 April 2018|title=WGIP: Side event on the Hmong Lao, at the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Allegations====
After the Australian government successfully negotiated a Lao presidential pardon in 2001 on their behalf, Kerry and Kay Danes returned to Australia with their monies intact. Kerry resumed Australian military service. Kay found herself "on a slippery slide of prescribed medications" for quite a few years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blankgc.com.au/jailed-lauded-striving-for-change-kay-danes/|title=Jailed,lauded,striving for change Kay Danes|work=blank Gold Coast by Pippa Andreas|date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 20}} The Danes reportedly experienced and witnessed daily incidents of torture and ill-treatment by Laotian authorities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA260042002?open&amp;of=ENG-2S3 |publisher=Amnesty International |title=LAO PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. The laws are promulgated but have no impact on the people: Torture, ill-treatment and hidden suffering in detention |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911234233/http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA260042002?open&amp;of=ENG-2S3 |archivedate=11 September 2009 |date=26 July 2002 |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 25}}. However, no description of ongoing physical injuries of their own can be found. In 2002, the Australian government declined to intervene when it was suggested that the Laos government was considering court action for non-payment of the $AUD1.1 million in fines and compensation that the Danes had agreed to pay by instalments when their presidential pardon was negotiated. Affected with post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic depression, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/southeast/former-political-prisoner-kay-danes-hopes-to-inspire-others-with-her-story/news-story/e8dd09e256409845742ec177bc8f843e|title=Former political prisoner Kay Danes hopes to inspire others with her story|work=Courier Mail|date=24 July 2016 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 4}} Kay Danes released her first memoir ''Deliver Us From Evil : Bad Things Do Happen to Good People'' in 2002. 

====Legitimacy====
Books confer a sense of [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] politicians sometimes invite authors to testify at congressional hearings. Danes was invited to speak the same year at the ''U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos'' in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the [[Library of Congress]], [[Washington, D.C.]] Having found an appreciative audience, she testified on numerous occasions on Capitol Hill, and spoke at the National Press Club &lt;ref&gt;Media Newswire "Kay Danes, Sheng Xiong to Speak About Laos, Hmong Human Rights Issues (16 April 2009) http://www.media-newswire.com/release_1089564.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Online PR NEW/MEDIA, (13 January 2010) "Laos' Secret Jails, Camps: Minnesota Hmong Appeal for Families, US Citizens Jailed in Gulag" http://www.onlineprnews.com/news/17395-1263356748-laos-secret-jails-and-camps-minnesota-hmong-appeal-for-families-us-citizens-jailed-in-gulag-system.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Media Newswire, www.media-newswire.com (16 April 2009) "Laos, Thailand Hmong Refugee Crisis: Australian Author to Speak at World Affairs, Washington, D.C. Events" Laos, Thailand Hmong Refugee Crisis: Australian Author to Speak at World Affairs, Washington, D.C. Events&lt;/ref&gt; about human rights violations and the plight of political and foreign prisoners held in Laos.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, James, (1 October 2002), Washington Times, Washington, D.C. "Embassy Row Column: Kay Danes on Laos Detention speaks at U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92262756.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Philip, Center for Public Policy Analysis (1 July 2002) "Lao Hmong Refugee Crisis" http://www.centreforpublicpolicyanalysis.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sense of [[injustice]] can be a powerful motivational condition, causing people to take action not just to defend themselves but also others who they perceive to be unfairly treated. Danes continued writing and two more memoirs were released in 2006 and 2008. Danes testified in 2009 and 2011 at special sessions of the ''U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos''. Kay provided information about the [[Vientiane]] [[Phonthong Prison|prison]] that she and husband Kerry were released from in 2001. Such information was considered in the context of the 2007 imprisonment of three missing [[Hmong-American|Hmong-Americans]] &lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand, (22 April 2011), "Laos: Appeal for Release of 3 Hmong-Americans " http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1104/S00536/laos-appeal-for-release-of-3-hmong-americans.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Danes published her fourth Lao memoir ''Standing Ground: An Imprisoned Couple's Struggle for Justice Against a Communist Regime''.

====Publications====
Kay Danes has published several [[Memoir|memoirs]] based on her own personal experiences and observations. She is often promoted as an international author and speaker. The overarching [[Theme (narrative)|theme]] of Danes' first four books (2002 - 2009), as indicated by the titles, is that of [[Indignation|indignation]]. Her second memoir ''Nightmare in Laos : The True Story of a Woman Imprisoned in a Communist Gulag'' (2006) noticeably includes the word '[[gulag]]' which, in English language use, commonly refers to any forced-labour camp in the [[Soviet Union]]. The dissolution of the Soviet Union ended the [[Cold War]] in 1991. Danes was incarcerated and pardoned some ten years later in a different part of the world. There are clearly anti-Laos and [[anti-communism]] sentiments that match [[American conservatism]]. A [[Defensive attribution hypothesis|defensive attribution]] could be [[inference|inferred]]. If Kerry and Kay Danes had served their full seven year prison sentences, they would have been due for release in December 2007. The writing of Laos memoirs ended not long after the seventh anniversary of being pardoned. Kay Danes has consistently mentioned suffering from [[Diagnosis|diagnosed]] [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/southeast/kay-danes-is-dedicated-to-helping-others-after-appalling-treatment-in-laos/news-story/0e0edb08e2fc525c66d184580afeb455|title=Kay Danes is dedicated to helping others after appalling treatment in Laos|work=Quest Newspapers by Josh Alston|date=28 June 2013|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|para 7}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaydanes.com/appearances.html|title=Kay Danes website|date=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/southeast/former-political-prisoner-kay-danes-hopes-to-inspire-others-with-her-story/news-story/e8dd09e256409845742ec177bc8f843e|title=Former political prisoner Kay Danes hopes to inspire others with her story|work=Quest Newspapers by Ellen-Maree Elliot|date=24 July 2013|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this might explain [[Mainstream media|mainstream media]] inconsistencies in basic facts such as the amount of time she was actually imprisoned and the associated circumstances.

===Afghanistan===
In October / November 2008 (seven years after being pardoned in Laos), &lt;ref&gt;https://kaydanes.wordpress.com/books/beneath-the-pale-blue-burqa/&lt;/ref&gt; while Warrant Officer Kerry Danes was on a tour of duty with the Australian Army, his wife Kay took the opportunity to visit Afghanistan from Australia and travel in a [[Toyota Hiace]] van through war-torn countryside as part of a small group of five mixed-[[Gender|gender]] [[Rotarians]] under [[United States Marine Corps]] protection. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kaydanes.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/bayside-14-dec.jpg|title=Author Kay talks about journey in Afghanistan|work=Bayside Bulletin Newspaper|date=14 December 2010|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009,  Kay Danes was named Citizen of the Year in her [[Redland City|hometown]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaydanes1/
|title=Kay Danes, OAM LinkedIn Profile|work=LinkedIn|date=|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she published her fifth memoir ''Beneath the Pale Blue Burqa : One Woman's Journey Through Taliban Strongholds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blankgc.com.au/jailed-lauded-striving-for-change-kay-danes/

On page 38, Kay Danes refers to herself as an [[Adrenaline junkie|adrenaline junkie]]. In the Acknowledgements, Danes writes how honoured she is being able to risk both life and limb on this adventure. 

===Saudi Arabia===
[[File:11th MEU 141213-M-CB493-105 (15657874453).jpg|thumb|left|United States Military Training Mission|Saudi and United States military training in December 2014]]
In 2011 (ten years after being pardoned in Laos), Kay Danes moved to [[Saudi Arabia]] when husband Kerry was deployed there with the [[Australian Defence Force]]. The following year, Kay was employed by the Australian government as an administrative assistant at its Embassy in [[Riyadh]]. In 2012, she was named State Finalist for [[Australian of the Year]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/?view=fullView&amp;recipientID=833 |title=State Finalist Australian of the Year 2012: Kay Danes |accessdate=11 December 2012 |publisher=Australian of the Year Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; : an award conferred on an Australian citizen by the [[National Australia Day Council]], a not-for-profit [[Australian Government|Australian Government owned]] [[social enterprise]].

Saudi Arabia is widely accused of having one of the worst human rights records in the world and remains one of the very few countries in the world not to accept the [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Human rights issues that have attracted strong criticism include the extremely disadvantaged position of [[Saudi Arabia#Women|women]], capital punishment for [[LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia|homosexuality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/24/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death/ |title=Here are the 10 countries where homosexuality may be punished by death |date=24 February 2014 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; religious discrimination, the lack of religious freedom and the activities of the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|religious police]]. In 2004, the government approved the establishment of the [[National Society for Human Rights]] (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], pp. 250–252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Aerial perspective of Main Beach in Surfer's Paradise.jpg|thumb|left|Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast in March 2018]]
In 2014 (thirteen years after being pardoned in Laos), Kay Frances Danes was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia|Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM)]] for social justice and human rights work &lt;ref&gt;Businesswire, Businesswire.com, Washington, D.C. and Canberra, Australia, January 30, 2014, "Australia Announces Award to Laos, Hmong Human Rights Activist" http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140130006717/en/Australia-Announces-Award-Laos-Hmong-Human-Rights#.UvwfjoXc1F8&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, she left the workforce in Saudi Arabia to complete a Master of Human Rights degree online through [[Curtin University]] [[Western Australia|(WA)]], and to also take advantage of the travel opportunities of the [[Middle East]]. There appears to be no readily accessible details of Kay Danes' undergraduate studies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blankgc.com.au/jailed-lauded-striving-for-change-kay-danes/|title=JAILED, LAUDED, STRIVING FOR CHANGE - KAY DANES|work=blank Gold Coast|date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danes relocated to Australia in January 2015 and commenced a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD (Law and Justice)]], researching how incidents of harm from major attacks have impacted Australian humanitarian workers in armed conflict. Kay Danes (born 1967) nominated 2019 for completion of her doctorate from [[Southern Cross University|Southern Cross University (SCU)]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]]. A PhD is often a requirement for employment as a university [[professor]] or [[research|researcher]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaydanes1/|title=Kay Danes, OAM LinkedIn Profile|work=LinkedIn|date=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevin Andrew Fenton''' [[Fellow of the Faculty of Public Health|FFPH]] (born 19 December 1966)&lt;ref name="CBB"&gt;"Kevin Fenton." ''Contemporary Black Biography''. Vol. 87. Detroit: Gale, 2011. Gale ''Biography In Context''. Web. 28 Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; is director of health and wellbeing at [[Public Health England]]. He was formerly director of the United States [[National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention]], part of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].

Fenton was born in [[Glasgow, Scotland]] to Sydney and Carmen Fenton.  He grew up in Jamaica, where his father was head of the science department at [[Excelsior High School (Kingston, Jamaica)|Excelsior High School]] and his mother was a nurse at the hospital of the [[University of the West Indies]].  Fenton attended Wolmer's Boys' School in Kingston where he completed O'Levels and A'Levels before graduating.  He then went on to attend The UWI, first as a computer science major but later he graduated with an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from the UWI Medical School, where he was elected class president for the 1985-86 school year.  He completed [[Residency (medicine)|residencies]] at [[Cornwall Regional Hospital]] in [[Montego Bay]] and [[University College Hospital]] in Kingston.&lt;ref name="CBB"/&gt;

Working as a government doctor in [[Lucea, Jamaica]] caused Fenton to concentrate on [[public health]].  He earned an [[Professional degrees of public health|MPH]] from the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] in 1992 and a doctorate in [[epidemiology]] from [[University College London]].  Fenton became a senior lecturer on HIV epidemiology and honorary consultant epidemiologist at the [[Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre]] of the UK's [[National Health Service]] and a lead researcher on the second [[National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles]] in 2000 and 2001.  In 2002 he became director of the Centre's [[Health Protection Agency HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections Department]].&lt;ref name="CBB"/&gt;

Fenton joined the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in 2005, initially as director of the [[National Syphilis Elimination Effort]], then director of the National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention, renamed the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention in 2007.&lt;ref name="CBB"/&gt;

In 2011 and 2012, Fenton appeared on ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'''s "The Root 100" list of "black achievers and influencers between the ages of 25 and 45".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theroot.com/root-100/2011/kevin-fenton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theroot.com/root-100/2012/kevin-fenton&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenton left CDC, and the USA, in 2012 to join the new English national public health body, [[Public Health England]], as head of its directorate of health improvement and population healthcare, renamed health and wellbeing shortly before April 2013's official commencement of the organisation. As of 2015, Fenton was paid a salary of between £175,000 and £179,999 by the department, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492289/150K_senior_salaries.csv/preview|title = Senior officials 'high earners' salaries as at 30 September 2015 - GOV.UK|date = 2015-12-17|website = www.gov.uk|access-date = 2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2nd February 2017, Kevin Fenton was announced as Southwark Council's new Director of Health and Wellbeing, working on secondment from Public Health England.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/feb/national-health-expert-professor-kevin-fenton-announced-as-southwark-council-s-new-director-of-health-and-wellbeing&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Machapunga''' were a small Native American tribe of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] family, one of a number in the territory of North Carolina. Previously they were known under the name [[Secotan]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ordahl Kupperman, Roanoke: The Abandoned Colony&lt;/ref&gt; They were a group who had migrated south from the Algonquian peoples of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] in present-day [[Virginia]]. They are now extinct as a separate tribe. They spoke an Algonquian language and historically occupied a coastal area of northeastern [[North Carolina]].

==History==
[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived along the waterways throughout the South. Over time they gave rise to the historical tribes known at the time of European encounter.  Other peoples migrated into the area as well.

The early 20th-century [[ethnographer]] [[Frank Speck]] believed that the historical Machapunga and other Algonquian tribes in North Carolina had probably been earlier connected to the larger population based in coastal Virginia. He believed the tribes in North Carolina were part of an early and large Algonquian migration in a southerly direction in historical times. He noted the presence of Algonquian-speaking tribes on the Northeast coast and in eastern and central Canada.&lt;ref name="Speck"&gt;[http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jmack/algonqin/speck.htm Frank G. Speck, "REMNANTS OF THE MACHAPUNGA INDIANS OF NORTH CAROLINA"], ''American Anthropologist'' 18 (1916): pp. 271–276, Carolina Algonkian Project, Rootsweb, permission by ''American Anthropologist'', accessed Apr 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One of a number of small, Algonquian-speaking tribes in coastal North Carolina, the ''Machapunga'' (meaning "bad dust" or "much dirt," which sounds like an [[exonym]] given by a competing tribe, rather than an [[Endonym|autonym]] they would identify with) lived in the [[Pungo River]] area. Many lived in a village called ''Mattamuskeet'' on the shore of [[Lake Mattamuskeet]] in present-day [[Hyde County, North Carolina|Hyde County]]. In 1701 English colonists described the tribe as containing roughly 100 members. 

In 1711 they participated in the [[Tuscarora War]] against the colonists. By 1715, the remaining members of the [[Coree]], who lived to the south, had been merged into the Machapunga and lived together with them in Mattamuskeet. 

John Squires was the Chief of the Tribe. His mother was Ethelia, married to an Englishman named Jonathan Squires. Ethelia's father was the Chief of the Nanticoke in Dorchester County Maryland, but her mother was Machapunga, thus having made John the Chief of the Machapunga. John owned and operated a Trading Post, with another Indian named Long Tom off of the Old Indian Trail on the Chesapeake Bay. They were summoned many times by the English Colonists to interpret for them, and helped settle many indifferences between the Colonists and the Indians. John's parents, Jonathan and Ethelia continued to reside on the Nanticoke Nation Land in Dorchester County Maryland. John Squires was one of the most well documented Indians of the Machapunga Tribe. He has many Squire descendants of both Nanticoke, and Machapunga blood.

Because of colonial concerns about [[slavery]] and racial control, officials organized society in a [[Binary number|binary]] way, classifying people as white and colored (the latter category essentially covered all non-whites). Living conditions and arrangements were often more fluid than the record keeping. When the United States starting keeping census records in 1790, it had no category for Indian and did not establish a separate one until late in the 19th century. Those not living on reservations were included among "Free blacks," "Other free," or "Mulatto", which were different categories used to classify free non-whites. Before that time, the surviving Native Americans in the states were generally classified as [[mulatto]], [[free people of color]] or black, if of identifiably African descent. In [[Maryland]], Catholic churches kept parish records that continued to indicate families and individuals who identified as Indian, regardless of whether they were of mixed race, but the states did not.

Descendants of the Machapunga tribe reside in the [[Inner Banks]] of eastern North Carolina. Some of the Machapunga descendants traditionally had the surnames Squires, Mackey, sometimes spelled Mackee, Mackie or Macky. Other known surnames among the people were Barber, Chance, Clark, Collins, Elks, Morris, and King. Survivors intermarried with other ethnic peoples, and their children and grandchildren carry all their ancestry. 

Ethnographers and anthropologists such as Speck studied the peoples of the Southeast in the early 20th century, trying to determine if Native American cultures had survived. Speck found little evidence of the Machapunga and other Algonquian cultures. He did note that people had continued fishing with their traditional nets, and the women wove baskets according to traditional skills and styles.&lt;ref name="Speck"/&gt;

'''Manolache Costache Epureanu''' (1823–1880) was twice the [[Prime Minister of Romania]] as a representative of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservative Party]]: in 1870 (20 April-14 December) and in 1876 (6 May-5 August).

== Biography ==

Born in [[Bârlad]], [[Moldavia]], he studied in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]] and returned to Moldavia to participate in the 1848 revolutionary movement, being part of the [[ad hoc]] committee.

In 1866, he was the president of the council which decided to invite a foreign dynasty to rule Romania. In 1871, during the [[Lascăr Catargiu|Catargiu]] conservative government, Epureanu was the [[Minister of Justice]] between October 1872 and March 1873. He then switched to the opposition and in 1876, he was a Liberal Prime Minister, but later he switched again to the Conservative Party.

He published ''Chestia locuitorilor privită din punctul de vedere al Regulamentului organic'' (1866) and ''Despre pretinsa rescumpărare a căilor ferate'' (1879).

He died in [[Schlangenbad]], [[Duchy of Nassau]], which is now in Germany.

'''Gabriel-Maximilien Leuvielle''' (16 December 1883{{spaced ndash}}1 November 1925), better known by the stage name '''Max Linder''' ({{IPA-fr|maks lɛ̃.dɛʁ|lang}}), was a [[France|French]] [[actor]], [[Film director|director]], [[screenwriter]], [[Film producer|producer]] and [[comedian]] of the [[silent film|silent film era]]. His onscreen persona "Max" was one of the first recognizable recurring characters in film. He has also been cited as the "first international movie star."&lt;ref&gt;Waldekranz, Rune: Filmens Historia - Del 1, p. 208 (P.A. Norstedt &amp; Söners Förlag, Stockholm)&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Cavernes, France to Catholic parents, Linder grew up with a passion for the theatre and enrolled in the Conservatoire Bordeaux in 1899. He soon received awards for his performances and continued to pursue a career in the legitimate theatre. He became a contract player with the Bordeaux Théâtre des Arts from 1901 to 1904, performing in plays by [[Molière]], [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Alfred de Musset]].

From the summer of 1905, Linder appeared in short comedy films for Pathé, at first usually in supporting roles. His first major film role was in the [[Georges Méliès]]-like [[fantasy film]] ''The Legend of Punching''. During the following years, Linder made several hundred [[short film]]s portraying "Max", a wealthy and dapper man-about-town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life. Starting with ''The Skater's Debut'' in 1907, the character became one of the first identifiable motion-picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies. By 1911, Linder was co-directing his own films (with René LePrince) as well as writing the scripts.

Linder enlisted at the outbreak of the First World War, and worked at first as a dispatch driver and entertainer. During his service, he was injured several times, and the experiences reportedly had a devastating effect on him both physically and mentally.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen, Snorre Smàri: "Max Linder: Father of Film Comedy" (Classic Images, March 2012, p. 76)&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time he suffered his first outbreak of chronic depression.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Linder was born Gabriel-Maximilien Leuvielle near [[Saint-Loubès]], [[Gironde]]. His parents were wealthy [[vineyard]] owners and expected Linder to take over the family business; his older brother Maurice  (born 28 June 1881) had become a celebrated national rugby player. But Linder grew up with a passion for the theatre and was enthralled by the traveling theater and circus performances that occasionally visited his town. He later wrote that "nothing was more distasteful to me than the thought of a life among the grapes."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2&gt;Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 671-77.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career 1899&amp;ndash;1905===
In 1899, Linder enrolled in the [[Conservatoire de Bordeaux]] and quickly won awards for first prize in comedy and second prize in tragedy. He continued to pursue a career in the theater and became a contract player with the [[Bordeaux Théâtre des Arts]] from 1901 to 1904, performing in plays by [[Molière]], [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Alfred de Musset]]. At the same time that he was performing in serious dramatic theater, he became friends with [[Charles le Bargy]] of the [[Comédie-Française]]. Le Bargy encouraged Linder to audition for the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] in 1904. Linder was rejected and began appearing in less prestigious theaters such as the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia Theater]] and the [[Théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique|Théâtre de l'Ambigu]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

By 1905, he had adopted his [[stage name]] of '''Max Linder''' and used it in several theatrical performances. Also during this period, Linder applied for work at [[Pathé Frères]]  in [[Vincennes, France|Vincennes]] at the suggestion of film director [[Louis Gasnier]] and began appearing in small bit parts, mostly in [[slapstick]] comedies. Linder continued to appear on the stage for the next two years and was not a significant film star at first. However, an often-told legend about the origins of Linder's film career is that French film producer [[Charles Pathé]] personally saw Linder on the stage and wrote him a note that read "In your eyes lies a fortune. Come and act in front of my cameras, and I will help make it."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

===Film career 1905–1916===
[[Image:Linder bad luck.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Linder in ''[[Seven Years Bad Luck]]'' (1921)]]
From 1905 to 1907, Linder appeared in dozens of short comedy films for Pathé, usually in a supporting role. His first noticeably larger film role was in ''The Young Man's first outing'' in 1905. He also appeared in [[Georges Méliès]]-like [[fantasy films]] such as ''Serpentine Dances'' and ''The Legend of Punching'', his first leading role. His rise to stardom commenced in 1907 when Pathé's slapstick star [[René Gréhan]] left the company to join [[Eclair (camera)|Éclair]]. Gréhan's screen character was Gontran, whose persona included high-society clothing and a [[dandy]]-ish demeanor. Linder was chosen to take over the characterization for Pathé, and the style of dress and personality of Gréhan's character became his trademark. Film critic David Robinson described Linder's screen persona as "no grotesque: he was young, handsome, debonair, immaculate...in silk hat, jock coat, cravat, spats, patent shoes, and swagger cane."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; Linder made more than one hundred [[short film]]s portraying "Max", a wealthy and dapper man-about-town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life. With this character, he had created one of the first identifiable motion-picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies.

Linder's first appearance as "Max" was in ''[[The Skater's Debut]]'' in 1907. [[Lac Daumesnil|Lake Daumesnil]] in Paris had frozen over and director [[Louis Gasnier]] filmed Linder in his new attire, with Linder improvising the rest. In the film, "Max" falls about and does a rendition of "the windmill routine" by spinning his cane around, predating [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s version in ''[[The Rink (film)|The Rink]]'' by nine years. Pathé was unimpressed with the film and re-shot parts of it, and it was not popular with audiences when released. Soon afterwards, Gasnier left Pathé and moved to Italy, leaving Linder without a supporter at Pathé; he made few films in 1908.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; His luck began to change when Pathé's top comedy star, [[André Deed]], left to work with the Italian film company Itala, leaving Linder as the company's leading comedic actor. Later in 1909, Gasnier returned from Italy and immediately began working with Linder again. The team made several shorts in 1909 with Linder in various roles, such as a blind elderly man and a coquettish young woman. But they soon discovered that the character of "Max" was the most popular with audiences and stuck with him from then on. Among the popular "Max" films made by Linder and Grasnier in 1909 are ''A Young Lady Killer'' and ''The Cure for Cowardice''&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

By 1910, Linder had proved himself to Pathé and was quickly becoming one of the most popular film actors in the world. When Gasnier was sent to the United States later that year to oversee Pathé's productions there, [[Lucien Nonguet]] took over as Linder's director. Together they made such films as ''Max takes a bath'' and the autobiographical ''Max Linder's Film Debut'', which fictitiously recreates the legend of Linder's early film career and includes [[Charles Pathé]] as himself.

By the end of the year, Linder had become the most popular film actor in the world. Although actress [[Florence Lawrence]] is often referred to as "''The First Movie Star''" in the United States, Linder appears to be the very first worldwide movie star with a major following. In [[Russia]], he was voted the most popular film actor, ahead of [[Asta Nielsen]]. He also had a Russian impersonator, Zozlov, and a devoted fan in [[Czar Nicholas II]]. Another professed fan was British playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]]. The first feature film ever made in [[Bulgaria]] was a remake of one of Linder's earlier movies. He was offered $12,000 to spend a month in [[Berlin]] making public appearances with his film screenings, but had to decline for health reasons. In France, a Max Linder movie theater had opened in Paris.

At the height of his fame, Linder ended 1910 with a serious illness. He was forced to stop making films when [[appendicitis]] left him bedridden, and some newspapers reported that he had died. He eventually recovered the following spring and began making films again in May 1911.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

In 1911, Linder returned to filmmaking and began co-directing his own films (with [[René LePrince]]) as well as writing the scripts. By 1912, he was the solo director of his films. Gaining complete control over his own films brought positive results both critically and commercially; the films Linder made during this period are generally considered to be his best. ''[[Max, Victim of Quinine]]'' is considered by film critic Jean Mitry to be "his masterpiece."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; In the film, an intoxicated "Max" gets into numerous fights with such dignitaries as the Minister of War, an ambassador and the police commissioner, all of whom challenge him to a duel and present him with their business cards. Eventually "Max" is apprehended by the police, who attempt to return him to his residence, but end up mistakenly taking him to the homes of the various men whom he had previously fought with.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

The universality of silent films brought Linder fame and fortune throughout Europe, making him the highest paid entertainer of the day, with a salary increase of 150,000 francs (the average monthly salary in France was 100 francs at the time). He began touring Europe with his films from 1911 to 1912, including [[Spain]], where he entertained thousands of fans at the [[Barcelona]] railway station, [[Austria]], and [[Russia]], where he was accompanied on piano by a young [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]. In 1912 after the tour, Linder demanded and received a salary of one million francs a year, and [[Charles Pathé]] used the huge sum to generate publicity, with an ad reading "We understand that the shackles which bind Max Linder have attained the value of one million francs a year...the imagination boggles at such a figure!"&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; This set a precedent in the entertainment industry for actors' salaries that would become a staple of the Hollywood system, but privately Pathé nicknamed Linder "The Napoleon of the Cinema".&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

The high point of Linder's career was from 1912 to 1914. His films were made with increased skill and "Max" was at his funniest. He made such films as ''Max Virtuoso'', ''Max Does Not Speak English'', ''Max and His Dog'', ''Max's Hat'' and ''Max and the Jealous Husband''. His ensemble of actors included [[Stacia de Napierkowska]], [[Jane Renouardt]], [[Gaby Morlay]] and occasional performances from the young actors [[Abel Gance]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]]. Linder had given Chevalier his start in movies, but the silent medium did not suit Chevalier, who stuck to the stage until the all-singing all-dancing features came in, many years later.

The outbreak of [[World War I]] brought a temporary end to Linder's film career in 1914, but not before he made the short patriotic film ''[[The Second of August]]'' that year.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; Linder attempted to enlist in the French army, but was physically unfit for combat duty. Instead he worked as a dispatch driver between Paris and the front lines. Many conflicting stories about the reasons behind his dismissal from the army exist, including that he was shot through the lung, and seriously wounded. Initially, it was reported by one newspaper that he had been killed; Linder actually phoned the offending publishers, leading them to run the headline "Max Linder Not Killed".&lt;ref&gt;''Paul Merton's Weird and Wonderful World of Early Cinema''&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have asserted that he became infected with [[pneumonia]] after hiding from a German patrol in icy water for several hours. After being dismissed from his duties, Linder spent the remainder of the war entertaining the troops and making films. It was also during this period that Linder suffered his first serious bout with [[chronic depression]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

Correction: Max Linder couldn't have been "the most popular film actor in the world" by the end of 1910--the first screen actors weren't known by name in America until the middle of the year. Even at the height of his popularity in the US, Linder received just 1092 in Motion Picture Story's 1912 Popular Player Contest, to reach 79th place--three ahead of Jean the Vitagraph Dog. Maurice Costello, the first true international star, received 430,816 votes to win the contest hands down. By 1913, he was famous the world over. In 1915, a British film magazine named him the most popular foreign player, while Linder came in 17th. (Richard DeCordova, Picture Personalities: The Emergence of the Star System in America (Chicago, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2001),74; Motion Picture Story, June 1912, 146; Pictures and the Picturegoer, November 6, 1915, 112.

===Move to the US and career decline 1916&amp;ndash;1925===
In 1916, Linder was approached by American film producer [[George K. Spoor]], the president of the [[Essanay|Essanay Film Manufacturing Company]], to make twelve short films for him in the US at a salary of $5,000 a week. Earlier that year, [[Charlie Chaplin]], then the most popular comedian in the world, had left Essanay for more money and independence at [[Mutual Film]] and Spoor wanted to replace Chaplin with Max Linder, whose pantomime skills were arguably equally accomplished. Linder was offered a new contract from Charles Pathé, but accepted Spoor's offer and moved to the United States to work for Essanay later that year. Unfortunately his first few American-made "Max" films were unpopular both critically and financially. The first two, ''[[Max Comes Across]]'' and ''[[Max Wants a Divorce]]'' were complete failures, but the third film, ''[[Max and his Taxi]]'' was moderately successful. The financially troubled studio may have been counting on Linder to restore its flagging fortunes and cancelled production of the remaining films on Linder's contract.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; ''[[Max and his Taxi]]'' had been shot in [[Hollywood]] and while there Linder had developed a close friendship with Charlie Chaplin. They would often attend events such as boxing matches or car races together, and according to writer Jack Spears, "while working on a picture Linder would go next door to Chaplin's home and discuss the day's shooting. The two often sat until dawn, developing and refining the gags. Chaplin's suggestions were invaluable, Linder said."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;
[[File:The Little Cafe Max Linder.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''The Little Café'']]
Linder returned to France in 1917 and opened a movie theater, the Ciné Max Linder. However, due to his depression and anxiety about the still ongoing war, he was unable to continue making films on a regular basis, and was often quoted by journalists about the horrors of the front lines. After the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in 1918, Linder was able to regain his enthusiasm and agreed to make a film with director [[Raymond Bernard]], the feature length ''[[The Little Café]]'' in 1919. In the film, Linder plays a waiter who suddenly becomes a millionaire, but simultaneously is tricked into a twenty-year contract to be a waiter by the cafe owner. The film made over a million francs in Europe and briefly revived his career, but was financially unsuccessful in the US.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

Four years after failing to become a major star in the US, Linder made another attempt at filmmaking in [[Hollywood]] and formed his own production company there in 1921. His first film back in the US was ''[[Seven Years Bad Luck]]'', considered by some to be his best film. The film contains one of the earliest (though not the first) examples on film of the "human mirror" gag best known in the scene between [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]] and [[Harpo Marx]] in ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' twelve years later. Linder next made ''[[Be My Wife (1921 film)|Be My Wife]]'' later that year, but again neither films were able to find a major audience in the US.

Linder then decided to dispense of the "Max" character and try something different for his third (and final) attempt: ''[[The Three Must-Get-Theres]]'' in 1922. The film is a [[satire]] of [[swashbuckling]] films made by [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and is loosely based on the plot of [[Alexander Dumas]]' ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. The film was praised by Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin, but again failed at the box office. At the films premiere, Linder had said to director [[Robert Florey]] "You see, Bob, I sense that I'm no longer funny; I have so many preoccupations that I can no longer concentrate on my film character ... The public is mildly amused by my situations, but this evening where were the explosions of laughter that we hear when Charlie's on the screen?...Make people laugh, its easy to say make people laugh, but I don't feel funny anymore."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

With his depression making it difficult for him to work, Linder returned to France in 1922 and shortly afterwards made a semi-serious film: ''[[Au Secours!]]''  (''Help!'') for director [[Abel Gance]]. The film is essentially a [[horror film]] set in a [[haunted house]], with occasional moments of comedy by Linder. The film was released in [[England]] in 1924 and was critically praised, however the legal copyright of the film prevented it from being released in France or the US for several years. Linder's last film was ''[[The King of the Circus]]'' directed by [[Édouard-Émile Violet]] (with pre-production collaboration from [[Jacques Feyder]]) and filmed in [[Vienna]] in 1925. In the film, "Max" joins a circus in order to be closer to the woman that he loves. The film includes such gags as a hungover "Max" waking up in a department store and the film's plot is similar to the [[Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928). In late 1925, Linder was working on pre-production for his next film ''Barkas le fol'', which would never be made.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

==Marriage and death==
As a consequence of his war service, Linder suffered from continuing health problems, including bouts of severe [[clinical depression|depression]]. In 1923, he married eighteen-year-old Hélène "Jean" Peters, who came from a wealthy family and with whom he had a daughter, [[Maud Linder|Maud]] (born 27 July 1924), also known as "Josette".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents of suicide dispute over child.

Linder and his wife may have made a [[suicide pact]]. In February 1924, they were both found unconscious at a hotel in [[Vienna, Austria]], though this was explained as an accidental overdose of "sleeping powder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Max Linder and Wife in Double Suicide.

In late October 1925, Max and Hélène reportedly attended a Paris screening of ''[[Quo_Vadis_(1924_film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (in which the main characters, as a reporter put it, "bleed themselves to death"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Max Linder's Wife Could Not Quit Him.

They drank [[Veronal]], injected morphine and slashed their wrists.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Max Linder and Wife in Double Suicide.

There is still some question, however, as to whether the deaths were really a result of a suicide pact, or whether Max murdered his much-younger wife or pressured her into killing herself. On Nov. 2, 1925, The New York Times reported that Hélène Linder had told her mother by letter that, "He will kill me." The article also claims that "no one believes she herself opened her veins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Max Linder's Wife Could Not Quit Him.

Linder was buried at the Catholique cimetière de Saint-Loubès. His wife is buried at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FOHgDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=myrl+alderman#v=snippet&amp;q=jo%20stafford&amp;f=false|title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.

==Legacy==
Upon receiving the news of Linder's death, Chaplin is reported to have closed his studio for one day out of respect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511729/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm#trivia Max Linder profile], imdb.com; accessed 21 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the ensuing years, Linder was relegated to little more than a footnote in film history until 1963 when a Max Linder compilation film titled ''Laugh with Max Linder'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/event/4513|title=Films, TV and people|work=British Film Institute|accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was theatrically released. The film was a compilation of Linder's last three films made in Hollywood and its release was supervised by his daughter, [[Maud Linder]]. 

In 1983, Maud Linder made a documentary film, ''[[The Man in the Silk Hat]]'', about Linder's life and career.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; It was screened out of competition at the [[1983 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1434/year/1983.html|title=VISSZAESOK|work=Festival de Cannes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Maud Linder published a book about Linder in France, ''Max Linder was my father'' and in 2008 she received the [[Prix Henri Langlois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prixhenrilanglois.org/?page_id=241|title=借家って何？貸家との違いを紹介します！(What is rented house?

In his honor, ''Lycée Max Linder'', a public school in the city of [[Libourne]] in the [[Gironde]] département near his birthplace was given his name in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amaelmaxlinder.fr/la-m%C3%A9moire-du-lyc%C3%A9e/historique/&lt;/ref&gt;

Linder's influence on film comedy and particularly on [[slapstick]] films is that the genre shifted from the "knockabout" comedies made by such people as [[Mack Sennett]] and [[André Deed]] to a more subtle, refined and character driven medium that would later be dominated by Chaplin, [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]] and others. Linder's influence on Chaplin is apparent both from Chaplin sometimes borrowing gags or entire plot-lines from Linder's films, as well as from a famous signed photo that Chaplin sent Linder which read: "To Max, the Professor, from his disciple, Charlie Chaplin."&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt; Mack Sennett and [[King Vidor]] also singled out Linder as a great influence on their directing careers. His high society characterizations as "Max" also influenced such actors as [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[Raymond Griffith]].&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

In his heyday, Linder had two major rivals in France: [[Léonce Perret]] and [[Charles Prince (actor)|Charles Prince]]. Perrett later became a successful director, but his early career included a series of "Léonce" slapstick shorts that were popular but nowhere near the stature of Linder's films. Charles Prince, on the other hand, was gaining popularity during his career and was nearly equal to Linder by the beginning of [[World War I]]. Prince's screen persona was "Rigadin", who like "Max" was a bumbling [[bourgeois]] socialite who always got into trouble. Both Linder and Prince were employed by [[Pathé]] in the early 1910s and they often used the same story lines, sets and directors. Years after both comedians' careers were long over, Linder has received several revivals in interest while Charles Prince remains mostly forgotten.&lt;ref name=Wakeman2/&gt;

==In popular media==
Linder is referenced in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' where the owner of a [[Movie theater|cinema]] in [[Nazi]] occupied [[Paris]] in 1944, Shosanna Dreyfus, says that she will be having a Max Linder festival. The relative merits of Linder and [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] are then discussed by the German soldier, Frederick Zoller, who argues that Linder is superior to [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] while also admitting that Linder never made anything as good as ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]''.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

Both Montazeri and his father actively encouraged the rebellion of [[Shia Muslim]]s against the governments in the Muslim countries and also, strongly argued for the export of the Islamic regime to other countries, often called "Islamic Internationale".&lt;ref name=avon2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alf2013&gt;{{cite book|author=Ali Alfoneh|title=Iran Unveiled: How the Revolutionary Guards Is Transforming Iran from Theocracy into Military Dictatorship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8N7ATqedvAC&amp;pg=PA213|accessdate=27 July 2013|date=18 April 2013|publisher=AEI Press|isbn=978-0-8447-7255-4|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter goal was mostly achieved through the OLM,&lt;ref name=ostovar/&gt;&lt;ref name=mej10/&gt; and it is one of two pillars of ideology guided the revolution along with the propagation of [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=bar09&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shmuel Bar|title=Iranian terrorist policy and "export of revolution"|journal=Interdisciplinary Center|year=2009|url=http://www.herzliyaconference.org/_Uploads/2903Iranian.pdf|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he argued that all Muslims could enter Islamic states without passport or visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shaul Bakhash|title=The Islamic Republic of Iran, 1979-1989|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|volume=13|issue=4|pages=54–62|jstor=40257945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
At the initial phase of the Iranian revolution the activities of the Montazeri's group, Satja, led to tensions between Montazeri and both the Guards's leadership and the provisional government.&lt;ref name=metz87/&gt; His father, Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, publicly reprimanded him and stated that Mohammad had poor mental health because he had been tortured by the former Shah's secret police.&lt;ref name=metz87/&gt; Eventually, elder Montazeri disassociated himself from his son’s activities.&lt;ref name=gary87/&gt;

Mohammad Montazeri was part of the Libya-friendly group in the court of Khomeini and there was a feud between his group and the faction, called "Syrian mafia", led by [[Sadegh Ghotbzadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Gayn|title=Into the depths of a boiling caldron|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DCNlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SogNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1340,5195980&amp;dq=mohammad+montazeri&amp;hl=en|accessdate=27 July 2013|newspaper=Edmonton Journal|date=20 December 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghotbzadeh's faction was called previously [[Liberation Movement of Iran|the Liberation Movement of Iran (LMI)]], and Mostafa Chamran was also part of it.&lt;ref name=tony10/&gt; In addition, Montazeri had serious disagreements with Ayatollah [[Mohammad Beheshti]], cofounder of the Islamic Republican Party.&lt;ref name=Alf2013/&gt;

Montazeri was killed in [[Hafte Tir bombing|a bombing]] at the central headquarters of the then ruling party, Islamic Republican Party, in Tehran on 28 June 1981.

'''Morris Krok''' (28 April 1931 – October 2005) was a [[South African]] [[author]],&lt;ref&gt;Blatant raw foodist propaganda!, Joe Alexander, Blue Dolphin Publishing, 1990, page 47 "Morris Krok, from South Africa, is another outstanding rawfoodist author, very much of a spiritual bent."&lt;/ref&gt; [[publisher]] and [[health]] [[educator]].

== Biography ==

'''Background'''

Morris Krok was born in [[Johannesburg]]&lt;ref&gt;South African Jewry, Leon Feldberg, Fieldhill Pub. Co., 1976, page 240, "Morris Krok. Director of Company. Born Johannesburg, 28 April 1931, son of Simon and Sarah Krok."&lt;/ref&gt; and brought up in [[Durban]],&lt;ref&gt;Survival Into The 21st Century: Planetary Healers Manual, Viktoras Kulvinskas, Omnagod Press, 1979 - 323 pages, “In 1961, Dr. Morris Krok of Durban South Africa, published “Conquest of Disease,” where he reproduced a part of a speech by Dr. Moore, which was written up in: “Life Natural, Ganeshganar, Padukottai, S. Ry, India. Nov. 1960″.&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa]]. As a young man, he started to seek solutions for his health problems and was influenced by [[Naturopathy|natural healing]] writers of the 20th century such as [[Vincent Priessnitz]], [[Louis Kuhne]], [[Harry Benjamin]], [[Arnold Ehret]], [[Dugald Semple]],&lt;ref&gt;Dugald Semple, The Sunfood Way To Health, Health For All, 1956, 138 pages, "Your food determines in a large measure how long you shall live — how much you shall enjoy life, and how successful your life shall be."&lt;/ref&gt; [[George R. Clements]], [[Walter Siegmeister]],&lt;ref&gt;Creation of the Superman, Raymond W. Bernard, Health Research, 1996, Preface (Morris Krok), "This book reads like a fascinating story."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Essie Honiball]]&lt;ref&gt;The fruit hunters: a story of nature, adventure, commerce and obsession, Adam Gollner, Simon and Schuster, 2008, page 97, "Morris Krok's Fruit: The Food and Medicine of Man relates how he attended a fruitarian lecture with Essie Honiball, author of I Live On Fruit. Asked what one should eat, the answer is: "Fruit, of course."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johnny Lovewisdom]]. He also studied [[new age]], [[occult]], [[esoteric]], [[yogic]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] writings from the [[Eastern world|East]]. Krok migrated to [[California]] to develop his work and writings, dedicating his life to the quest for knowledge about health, [[vitality]] and [[higher consciousness]]. A regular [[marathon]] runner, Krok died from [[cancer]] of the leg in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vibranthealthandwealth.com/vibrance/articles/krok.html Who Was Morris Krok?, David Klein, Living Nutrition, Volume 20, 2007, "The man who had written Formula For Long Life and had a small cult-like global following had died of cancer at age 74."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195159/http://www.vibranthealthandwealth.com/vibrance/articles/krok.html |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; blaming "his problem on his terrible diet in his youth and on cooked food temptations from family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patenaude|first1=Frederic|title=Morris Krok Passed Away|url=http://fredraw.typepad.com/personal/2005/10/morris_krok_is_.html|website=Peaches and a Guitar|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beliefs'''

In the 1950s, a popular South African [[newspaper]] featured a story about Krok’s belief that [[fruit]] was the ideal food for [[humankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Who Was Morris Krok? by David Klein Ph.D, Obituary, Living Nutrition, Volume 20, {{cite web |url=http://www.vibranthealthandwealth.com/vibrance/articles/krok.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195159/http://www.vibranthealthandwealth.com/vibrance/articles/krok.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, David Klein Ph.D., publisher of Living Nutrition, chronicled Krok's famous sayings including "Man will always get colds if he persists in eating large quantities of mucous forming foods in the form of [[starch]], [[dairy products]] and [[animal fat]]s." and "Health is the balance between assimilation and elimination.” in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingnutrition.com/fwn/read.php?1,426,429 ‘Life’s Most Transforming Teachings: Morris Krok’s Quest, Morris Krok's Teachings by David Klein Ph.D, Living Nutrition, 9 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Who Was Morris Krok? by David Klein Ph.D, Obituary, Living Nutrition, Volume 20, http://www.livingnutrition.com/backissues/contents.html#20&lt;/ref&gt; Central to Krok's thinking was that mucusless foods held the key to good health. In the article, ''A Yogic Perspective''&lt;ref&gt;''A Yogic Perspective: Light alkalizing foods - the key to endurance and good health'', Morris Krok, Living Nutrition,  vol. 6, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt; he describes how "To heal and avoid [[illness]], one must [[Alkaline|alkalinize]] the [[Human body|body]] through a [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of predominately [[wikt:raw|raw]] fruits and [[vegetables]]."

'''Writings'''

Krok wrote books on [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|detoxification]], internal purification, [[Sustainable living|natural living]], [[self-healing]], [[fruitarianism]], [[fasting]], [[rawfoodism|living foods]], raw [[nutrition]], [[physical culture]], [[hatha yoga]], [[meditation]], [[deep breathing]], higher consciousness, [[radiant energy]], [[life extension]] and [[vitalism]]. As well as being an author, Krok published several books by other authors including [[Johanna Brandt]],&lt;ref&gt;The Grape Cure, Joanna Brandt, Durban: Essence of Health Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Otto Abramowski&lt;ref&gt;Water Into Gold, Ernestine Hill, Angus and Robertson, 1965, 291 pages, "Dr. Otto Abramowski was the grandson of a Governor of Warsaw, and had been a surgeon in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, of which he told many a stirring tale."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theos Bernard]], through Essence of Health Publishers.

'''Golden Path'''

Krok's book ''Golden Path To Rejuvenation'' described how a [[non-toxic]] diet and the [[osmotic pressure]] of [[rainwater]] could detoxify and purify the [[Biological membrane|membrane]]s and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the body. Krok believed that internal purification, was the direct and most effective way for a longer and youthful life. He described how not everything humans eat is used by the body, showing how accumulated [[wastes]] and [[toxins]] caused by an unnatural diet and other substances, result in illness and premature [[ageing]].&lt;ref&gt;''Experiences in Euphoria'', USA: Living Nutrition, Vol. 7, 1990s "euphoria can only be experienced more often if mucous-forming and toxic foods are not eaten, so that the 24 feet of small intestines and few feet of colon, become scrupulously clean. When these are kept clean, this cleanliness will spill over to the lungs, sinuses, nasal passages and eustachian tubes. What I infer from these experiences is that the wonderful feeling of euphoria, does not depend on a specific vitamin, mineral, supplement or food, but on the thorough natural cleansing of the entire body. Foods that are the big culprits are all starches, dairy products, eating too much of any cooked food, as well as of natural concentrated raw foods such as avocado, nuts, dried fruits and dates."&lt;/ref&gt; His internal purification programme was designed to help increase [[longevity]] and remain youthful.&lt;ref&gt;''Experiences in Euphoria'', USA: Living Nutrition, Vol. 7, 1990s, "If civilized man puts himself on an elimination program for an extended period of time, he will be shocked by the amount of stored slime that is dislodged and eliminated from the 30 feet of intestines and delicate bronchial tubes of the lungs. As he discovers the principle of detoxification, he will understand why no pill, special food or stretching exercise can clear the large thick, salty, toxic accumulations that foul the body..... The sticky, slimy and toxic substances contained in starchy foods, dairy products and animal foods will in a short time, neutralize hours of physical endeavor."&lt;/ref&gt; He believed internal cleansing in conjunction with [[plant]] [[food]]s was the 'golden path'. The book also explained the ''[[yogic]] [[vomiting|vomit]]'' technique, a central part of the detoxification regime he endorsed.

'''Legacy'''

Krok was one of a series of 20th-century writers who wrote about fruitarianism, raw nutrition, fasting, detoxification, yoga&lt;ref&gt;Yoga World Wide, Meenakashi Devi Gitananda, Satya Press, 1972, page 52, "Yoga is expounded in various parts of Africa. Morris Krok and Swami Sahajananda are in South Africa."&lt;/ref&gt; and higher consciousness. His contemporaries included Brian Clement Ph.D,&lt;ref&gt;Living foods for optimum health: staying healthy in an unhealthy world, Brian R. Clement, Theresa Foy DiGeronimo, Crown Publishing Group, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Douglas N. Graham,&lt;ref&gt;80/10/10 Diet: Balancing Your Health, Your Weight, and Your Life One Luscious Bite at a Time, Douglas N. Graham, FoodnSport Press, 2006 - 348 pages&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viktoras Kulvinskas]] and Robert Gray.&lt;ref&gt;The colon health handbook: new health through colon rejuvenation, Robert Gray, San Francisco: Emerald Publishing, 2002, 74 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Authors who have endorsed Krok's writings in their books include John McCabe,&lt;ref&gt;Sunfood Living: Resource Guide for Global Health, John McCabe, North Atlantic Books, 2007, 576 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Alexander,&lt;ref&gt;Blatant raw foodist propaganda!, or, Sell your stove to the junkman and feel great!, or, Consider your true nature, Joe Alexander, Blue Dolphin Publishing, 1990, page 47, "Morris Krok, from South Africa, is another outstanding rawfoodist author, very much of a spiritual bent.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Null]],&lt;ref&gt;Complete Handbook of Nutrition, Gary Null, Random House, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Benito De Donno&lt;ref&gt;Glimpses Of Reality, Benito De Donno, 2002, 424 pages&lt;/ref&gt; and David Wolfe.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunfood Diet Success System:
36 Lessons in Health Transformation, David Wolfe, Maul Brothers, 2000, "Consider the words of Morris Krok in his book Diet, Health, And Living On Air: "In the metabolism of fats, sugars, and starches, the waste which is left behind is carbon dioxide and water."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Morris Krok advocated a fruitarian diet in his writings as the optimal diet and described how at stages during his life, he lived "only on fruits".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Krok, ''Fruit: The Food and Medicine For Man'', Connecticut: O'Mangod Press, (1961).
page 17, Chapter 8: "It had taken me almost ten years of continual reading and meditation before I had the courage to live only on fruits.", Page 40, Chapter 19: "At the time of the incident I was living on all fruit.", Page 46, Chapter 21: "After living on fruit for about four months, raw vegetables tasted flat."&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that he later advised against a diet of "only fruit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/bio/billings-t-bio-1b.shtml Tom Billings: dietary bio--continued, Part B, section, Other Important Lessons, August 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]"By the way, Morris Krok now advises against a diet of only fruit, and he is an open, honest, and very nice person."&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was subsequently reported that Krok's diet consisted of "just fruit".&lt;ref&gt;Who Was Morris Krok?, David Klein Ph.D, Living Nutrition, Volume 20, 2007, {{cite web |url=http://www.vibranthealthandwealth.com/vibrance/articles/krok.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195159/http://www.vibranthealthandwealth.com/vibrance/articles/krok.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }} "Someone who attended the talk reported he said that at the moment he was eating a diet of just fruit. I’d never heard that he ate exclusively fruit; however, it would not be surprising if he did so for varying periods of time."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perri Peltz''' (born 11 March 1960) is an American broadcast journalist.

== Career ==

Peltz worked at [[WNBC]] from 1987 to 1996 where she co-anchored ''Weekend Today in New York'' with Ken Taylor, and weekend editions of ''News 4 New York'' at 6 and 11 with [[Ralph Penza]].

Peltz joined ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' for two years. During that period, she often anchored live news coverage on [[NBC]]'s [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[United States cable news|cable news]] television channel [[MSNBC]].

She then worked for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' for two years until she moved to [[CNN]] where she stayed until 2002.

Peltz left CNN to produce a feature film, ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'' starring [[Ted Danson]]. The film was based on the real-life story of a [[middle school]] [[chess team]] from the [[South Bronx]] that became national chess champions. The film aired on the [[A&amp;E Network]].

Peltz then went to work for the [[Robin Hood Foundation]] in [[New York City]]. Robin Hood is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to fighting [[poverty]]. While at Robin Hood, Peltz wanted to tell the stories of the people who were working on the front lines in the war against poverty.

In 2005 she rejoined [[WNBC-TV|WNBC]] after a nine-year absence to co-anchor ''[[Live at Five (WNBC TV series)|Live at Five]]'' with [[Sue Simmons]].  She returned to WNBC to report on those people and the differences they were making. She also anchored ''Live at Five'' with Sue Simmons from 31 May 2005, until 12 March 2007, when she began hosting her own half-hour lifestyle broadcast titled ''News 4 You''. The program was part of WNBC's attempt to boost ratings and features stories from the consumer, health and entertainment worlds.

On 10 September 2007, WNBC cancelled ''News 4 You''. Peltz continued to report both for WNBC and for NBC Network on people who were making a difference.

Peltz co-produced and co-directed the documentary ''[[Prison Dogs]]'', which premiered at the 2016 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

== Education ==
Peltz graduated from [[The Dalton School]] in New York City, and then went to [[Brown University]] and then to [[Columbia University|Columbia]] for a [[Masters in Public Health]]. In 2008, she left WNBC to attend [[medical school]].

==Charitable work==
In 2015, Peltz, a practitioner of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]], supported the work of the [[David Lynch Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the Media Who Meditate|url=http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/broadcast/|publisher=David Lynch Foundation|accessdate=17 May 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YayqombX?url=http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/broadcast/|archivedate=17 May 2015|quote=Eight nationally renowned women leaders in the media who meditate gathered on April 16, 2015 in New York City to raise awareness about the benefits of the evidence-based Transcendental Meditation technique for overcoming stress, improving performance, and enhancing work-life balance in their lives.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salling had sent 100 packets to agents and managers, and "one called me and submitted me for Glee that day in her office."&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvdramas.about.com/od/glee/a/marksallinginter.htm|title=An Interview With Mark Salling (Puck, 'Glee') |date=September 2009 |accessdate=August 26, 2011|last=Thomas|first=Rachel|work=[[about.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had five auditions for ''Glee'' before being cast as Puck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksallingmusic.com/bio.php|title=Mark Salling Bio |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization===
Salling found it challenging to make the character "more than two-dimensional so he can be likable at the same time", which necessitated "find[ing] the balance between arrogance and cocky and sensible and likable".&lt;ref name="Salling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starrymag.com/content.asp?ID=4322&amp;CATEGORY=INTERVIEWS |title=Mark Salling – Good Glee |last=Steinberg|first=Jamie |date=May 2009 |publisher=Starry Constellation Magazine|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled that "in the breakdown for the show, when they were describing his character in the very beginning, it's like Puck: a man-child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2009/10/mark-salling|title=

He then lost {{convert|30|lb}} for a scene in the third episode that required him to be toned, which he described as "an extreme experience".&lt;ref name="Salling"/&gt;

===Relationships===
Puck's main basis for relationships at the beginning is sexual rather than romantic. He has sexual encounters with his female pool-cleaning clients and fellow students, including a recurrent relationship with cheerleader [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) that seems to be casual, though Santana confronts both [[Mercedes Jones]] ([[Amber Riley]]) and [[Lauren Zizes]] ([[Ashley Fink]]) when Puck starts pursuing them in the first and second seasons respectively. He falls in love with [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) after he takes her virginity and impregnates her despite the fact that she's dating his best friend [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) at the time, but he can't give up flirting with and seducing others even when Quinn contemplates raising the baby-to-be with him as he wants rather than giving it up for adoption, since she refuses to have sex with him again. The brief pairing of Puck with [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]) in the episode "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]", spurred by his mother urging him to find a Jewish girlfriend, dissolves because he wants Quinn and she wants Finn. Series creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] was surprised by the positive fan response to their pairing, which he described as "strange and bizarre", explaining that he had believed fans would prefer Rachel to be with Finn. As a result of the response, Murphy planned to revisit their romance later in the season,&lt;ref name="JG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b158760_glee_boss_on_showmance_we_have_some.html?sid=twitterfeed_kristin|title=Glee Boss on Showmance: "We Have Some Plans to Give the People What They Want"|last=Godwin|first=Jennifer|date=December 19, 2009|publisher=[[E! Online]]|accessdate=December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; though nothing much came of it.

In the second season, Puck recruits Lauren to join the glee club when the club needs a twelfth member in order to participate in the Sectionals competition. Within a couple of months, he has fallen in love with her, but she doesn't succumb to his blandishments, and he's forced to woo her over a long period of time, starting as friends. He supports her in her first solo for glee club and runs her campaign for prom queen. They are still a couple at the end of the school year. In the fourth episode of the third season, Puck and the adoptive mother of his child Shelby Corcoran kiss. He ends the series dating Quinn.

==Storylines==

===Season 1===
[[File:Mark Salling Glee Premiere.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Salling]] (''pictured'') played Puck]]
Puck is introduced as a football player and bully at William McKinley High School; he is frequently seen throwing fellow students into dumpsters, or tossing [[slush (beverage)|slushies]] in their faces. It is later revealed that he is [[Jewish]]. He is the best friend of Finn, the quarterback,&lt;ref name="Pilot"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Pilot |episodelink=Pilot (Glee) |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director, writer), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer), Ian Brennan (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 2, 2009 |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a summer pool-cleaning business that leads to sexual encounters with his adult female clients. Despite that, he has sex with fellow students, including in an on-again, off-again relationship with Santana Lopez, a cheerleader, which does not completely end forever until the middle of the second season.&lt;ref name="Acafellas"/&gt; Puck initially acts [[homophobic]] and mocks Finn for joining the school [[glee club]], New Directions, but later becomes a part of glee club director [[Will Schuester]]'s ([[Matthew Morrison]]) all-male [[a cappella]] group, the Acafellas, hoping to impress the mothers at a performance for the school's [[Parent Teacher Association|PTA]] meeting.&lt;ref name="Acafellas"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Acafellas |episodelink=Acafellas |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=John Scott (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer), Brad Falchuk (writer), Ian Brennan (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 16, 2009 |season=1 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently joins New Directions along with two other members of the football team. When Finn's girlfriend Quinn is impregnated and tells Finn the baby is his, Puck realizes that he is the actual father, and offers to support Quinn. She rejects his proposal, calling him a "Lima loser".&lt;ref name="Preggers"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Preggers |episodelink=Preggers|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Brad Falchuk (writer, director) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 23, 2009 |season=1 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puck begins dating [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]), the glee club lead vocalist, after his mother urges him to find a Jewish girlfriend; Rachel is initially resistant, but agrees after Puck sings "[[Sweet Caroline]]" for her in front of the glee club. However, Rachel later breaks up with him after a brief romance.

When the glee club holds a bake sale to pay for a wheelchair-accessible bus so [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) can ride with the club to Sectionals competition, it only succeeds because Puck makes a special, popular cupcake recipe—he secretly adds [[marijuana|pot]], which gives everyone the munchies. He offers financials to Quinn to show he will be a good father and provider; she figures out that it’s the money from the bake sale, and refuses to accept it, though she expresses her gratitude and apologizes for abusing him verbally.&lt;ref name="Wheels"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Wheels |episodelink=Wheels (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (writer, director)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 11, 2009 |season=1 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn reconsiders her plan to have the baby adopted and gives Puck a chance to prove himself by helping her to babysit [[Terri Schuester]]'s ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]) three nephews. Puck impresses her, but Quinn later learns that he was [[sexting]] Santana mostly. Puck claims he will be help her to parent their child, but he cannot remain in a committed relationship with Quinn if she refuses to have sex with him; Quinn returns to her original plan of giving the baby to Terri, who is faking a pregnancy to hold on to Will.&lt;ref name="Hairography"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hairography |episodelink=Hairography (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (writer, director)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 25, 2010 |season=1 |number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel begins to suspect that Puck is the father of Quinn's baby and tells Finn. Finn attacks Puck and confronts Quinn, who admits the truth. Puck again offers to be with Quinn, but she declines and tells him she wants to be alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Sectionals |episodelink=Sectionals|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (writer, director)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=December 9, 2009 |season=1 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she moves in with Puck's family since her parents had kicked her out and she can no longer stay at Finn’s house.

In the episode "[[Laryngitis (Glee)|Laryngitis]]", when Puck's [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] is shaved off by his doctor, he finds the other McKinley students no longer respect him as a badass. He romances fellow glee club member [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]], once a popular cheerleader, to restore his status. His plan is successful, but he and Mercedes ultimately have nothing in common, and split when she quits cheerleading and he returns to his bullying ways. In the first-season finale, "[[Journey to Regionals]]", Quinn goes into labour immediately after the club performs at the Regionals competition, and Puck is in the delivery room when Quinn give birth to a baby girl, whom Puck names Beth. When Puck and Quinn visit their baby in the hospital nursery, Puck tells Quinn that he loves her. Beth is adopted by Rachel's birth mother [[Shelby Corcoran]] ([[Idina Menzel]]), the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, the show choir that defeated New Directions at Regionals.

===Season 2===
In the season opener, "[[Audition (Glee)|Audition]]", Puck is interviewed by blogger [[Jacob Ben Israel]] ([[Josh Sussman]]) and reveals that he had a vasectomy over the summer, saying it was the only responsible thing to do. Soon after the school year begins, Puck is arrested and sent to a juvenile detention center for driving his mother's car through a convenience store window and driving off with the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. He returns in "[[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|Never Been Kissed]]", but he is now on [[probation]] and helps Artie out in an attempt to satisfy his [[community service]], although this is only initially because Puck claimed he was "helping a crip" and they misunderstood him. Though he acts tougher than ever to his classmates, Puck eventually confesses to Artie that he was terrified in juvie, and the two come to the agreement that Artie will tutor Puck, who has to pick up garbage to fulfill his community service requirements. In "[[Furt]]", Puck, Artie, [[Mike Chang]] and [[Sam Evans]] confront [[Dave Karofsky]] in the boys locker room to get him to stop bullying [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]). Because he was still on probation, Puck reluctantly had to watch the beat down between Sam and Karofsky, but despite not being allowed to fight and feeling helpless about it, he showed great restraint and was still praised for standing up for Kurt. "[[Special Education (Glee)|Special Education]]", Puck is asked by Will to find a new glee club member to replace Kurt, who has left McKinley and New Directions. He tries to recruit from the football team, but they lock him in a [[port-a-potty]]; he is rescued the next day by [[Lauren Zizes]] ([[Ashley Fink]]), who becomes the club's new twelfth member. Puck gets intimate with Rachel at her instigation, but leaves abruptly, realizing that he doesn't want to betray Finn for a second time, though Finn dumps Rachel when she confesses to him about it. Puck and Finn finally settle their differences in "[[The Sue Sylvester Shuffle]]", and they work together to help the football team win its first-ever championship. 

In the episode "[[Silly Love Songs (Glee)|Silly Love Songs]]", Puck unexpectedly falls for Lauren, and performs the song "[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]], which expresses his love of Lauren's bigger body type, but Lauren is offended by the song. Santana, unhappy with being deserted by Puck, slaps Lauren in front of him to warn her away, and Lauren tosses her around like she was nothing, leaving her dazed. Puck immediately begs Lauren to go out with him. She ultimately agrees to go on a pre-Valentine's date with him, but stands him up. Puck clumsily tells Lauren he likes her, not because of her looks but because of her "badass-ness"; Lauren says she is not looking for something casual. They go out on Valentine's Day "as friends", though Puck is clearly hoping for more in the future. In the episode "[[Sexy (Glee)|Sexy]]", Lauren tells Puck she's decided to make a sex tape to help her become famous, to his delight, but their plans are dashed when substitute sex education teacher [[Holly Holliday]] ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]) informs them that as both are underage it would be considered child pornography. As part of a class assignment in the episode "[[Original Song]]", Puck writes and sings a song for Lauren—"Big Ass Heart"—that she likes. In "[[Born This Way (Glee)|Born This Way]]", Puck discovers that Lauren had been a child beauty queen; he tells her he will run a campaign for her to become that year’s prom queen, and be her king. After candidate Quinn insults Lauren’s candidacy, Puck helps Lauren dig up dirt on Quinn, but the tactic backfires.&lt;ref name="Born This Way"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Born This Way|episodelink=Born This Way (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=April 26, 2011 |season=2 |number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Puck nor Lauren win the race for prom queen and king,&lt;ref name="PromQueen"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Prom Queen|episodelink=Prom Queen (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Eric Stoltz]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=May 10, 2011 |season=2 |number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they remain a couple; they fly with the rest of New Directions to the nationals competition in New York City, where the glee club comes in twelfth out of fifty teams.&lt;ref name="New York"&gt;{{cite episode |title=New York |episodelink=New York (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=May 24, 2011 |season=2 |number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
Lauren breaks up with Puck at the beginning of school year and drops out of glee club, claiming that it is hurting her reputation.&lt;ref name="Purple"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Purple Piano Project|episodelink=The Purple Piano Project|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Eric Stoltz]] (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 20, 2011 |season=3 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelby Corcoran, who adopted baby Beth, gets a teaching job at McKinley, and invites Puck and Quinn to be a part of Beth's life, provided they both become more responsible.

This visit makes Puck fear that he might one day be like his father and visit Beth at work and ask her for money. He decides to be a father that Beth would be proud of and tries to do better in school and graduate with his class. After he fails his history final and discovers that he is not graduating he decides to not care about grades and flunk out. In the episode "[[Props (Glee)|Props]]", he gets into a fight with Rick "The Stick" Nelson and pulls out a knife. [[Shannon Beiste|Coach Beiste]] ([[Dot-Marie Jones]]) breaks up the fight and she informs Puck that he could get expelled from school for bringing the knife. He tells her that it's a prop knife that they used in their production of ''West Side Story'' and that he does not care since he is flunking out anyway. They have a heart to heart and the next day, she tells him that what he told her in their heart to heart the day before and it gave her the strength to leave her abusive husband. She told him that she owes him big time and that she talked to his history teacher and she agreed to let Puck retake the test. In the season finale, Puck studies with Quinn's help and then retakes his final exam. He passes with a C− and graduates from McKinley.

===Season 4===
In the Season 4 premiere, it is revealed that Puck has a paternal half-brother named [[Jake Puckerman|Jake]] ([[Jacob Artist]]) who he was not aware of, though the two are introduced to each other by Will in the following episode, "[[Britney 2.0]]", while Puck is briefly visiting Lima from his new home, Los Angeles. Jake later turns to Puck for advice over the phone on how to get [[Marley Rose]] ([[Melissa Benoist]]) to date him, and Puck subsequently invites Jake to visit him in California over the Christmas holiday; the two get matching tattoos. Puck decides to return to Lima to live, and the two Puckermans arrange for their mothers to meet on Christmas Day where the two families bond. Puck later starts dating [[Kitty Wilde|Kitty]] ([[Becca Tobin]]) in order to keep her away from Jake and spoiling his budding relationship with Marley, though Puck and she break up when he moves into Finn's dorm room at the college Finn has just started attending, even though Puck is not enrolled there. He appears less frequently this season, despite still being credited as a series regular.

===Season 5===
Puck makes infrequent guest appearances this season. Puck is devastated by Finn's death. In "[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]", three weeks after the funeral, he steals a memorial tree planted for Finn and demands that Kurt, Finn's stepbrother, give him Finn's football jacket. Coach Beiste takes him to task for being drunk regularly after so many weeks, and the two mourn Finn together, but Beiste tells him he has to guide his own life without Finn's help, and asks him to replant the tree. When he later does so, he tells her that he intends to join the Air Force. In "[[100 (Glee)|100]]" Puck comes back to McKinley to say goodbye to the Glee Club before it is disbanded. He sees Quinn and the two of them have a conversation. He is about to tell Quinn that he still has feelings for her when her boyfriend, Biff McIntosh, shows up and shows Puck that he is rude. Puck sings [[Avril Lavigne]]'s song [[Keep Holding On]] to her hoping that this would win her heart, but she turns him down stating that she loves Biff. Later, Quinn and Biff are having dinner at Breadsticks when Santana, Puck, Mike, and Artie show up. They sit with Quinn at her table and Biff reveals that he doesn't know any thing about Quinn's past. Her friends tell her about her behavior in the episode [[The Purple Piano Project]]. Quinn asks Biff to get something out of the car for her and after he leaves, she asks her friends not to mention anything to Biff since she is ashamed of her past. Puck asks her if she is ever going to tell him about their relationship and their daughter, Beth, and she says that she will eventually. This somewhat angers Puck as he tells her that she can't hide from the past and should embrace it. A few days later, Puck is hanging by the school buses when he hears Quinn and Biff fighting. Biff becomes angry with her at the fact that she kept so much from him, including having a baby with Puck. He calls her a slut, causing Puck to snap and punch him. Biff punches Puck back, causing Puck to punch him once more and then throws him into the dumpster. He then tells Quinn that she can help Biff out of the dumpster or join her real friends in the choir room. Later, Puck and Quinn are in the locker room looking at Finn's plaque. Quinn tells Puck that Biff went back to Yale by himself, and the relationship is over. Puck reveals that he still has feelings for her and wants to get back together. Quinn tells Puck that she isn't going to look back to her past, as she wants to look into her future. Puck leaves the locker room heartbroken and storms down the hallway when Quinn runs after him and kisses him, agreeing to give their relationship another chance.

==Musical performances==
As Puck, Salling features in many songs that have been released as [[Single (music)|singles]] available for [[Music download|digital download]] and are also featured in the show's [[soundtrack album]]s. He usually accompanies himself on the guitar for solo songs, including "Sweet Caroline", "Only the Good Die Young", "Fat Bottomed Girls", and the song ostensibly composed by Puck, "Big Ass Heart".

Neil Diamond's "Sweet Caroline" was his first solo number, in the episode "Mash-Up", and received favorable reviews from critics, and also from Diamond himself, who had initially been reluctant to license the number to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118012245.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;ref=bd_tv|title=Keeping 'Glee' in tune |last=Morris|first=Christopher|date=December 4, 2009|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|accessdate=December 6, 2009|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLTpfP5 |archivedate = February 12, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the episode's broadcast, Diamond posted his approval on the [[social networking]] website [[Twitter]], writing: "Hey, so who's this guy Puck singing 'Sweet Caroline' so good, so good, so good on #Glee?

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Salling as Puck has received some positive reviews. Flandez said of Puck in the first-season episode "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]" that we finally saw him "emerging from his bonehead-punk exterior", and that he "wows us with his sensitive, cool guy turn as a solo singer" performing “Sweet Caroline”.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; In his review of the following episode, "[[Wheels (Glee)|Wheels]]", Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote, "Mark Salling just seems to have a ridiculous amount of chemistry with all of the female cast members in the show, and it's fun to see him and Dianna Agron get in that food fight. Again, fun stuff, but a serious emotional core that keeps the show grounded."&lt;ref name="AV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/wheels,35290//|title={{-"}}Wheels{{"-}}||date=November 12, 2009|first=Todd|last=VanDerWerff|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[The Onion]]|accessdate=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television critics responded positively to the pairing of Puck and Lauren Zizes. Robert Canning of [[IGN]] said the "absolute best part" of the "Silly Love Songs" episode was Puck's "unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes."&lt;ref name="sillylovesongsign"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/114/1148604p1.html|title=Glee: "Silly Love Songs" Review|work=[[IGN]] |date=February 9, 2011|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented: "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings."&lt;ref name="sillylovesongsa.v"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/silly-love-songs,51406/|title= Silly Love Songs |work=[[The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2770">'''Rita Goold''' was a British [[psychic]] and [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] medium from [[Leicester]].

==Biography==

Goold acted as a [[Physical mediumship|physical medium]] in the 1980s. She claimed to be a psychic and communicate with beings who created [[crop circle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Collins. ''The New Circlemakers: Insights Into the Crop Circle Mystery''. A.R.E. Press. pp. 22-24. {{ISBN|978-0876045497}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also acted as a [[trance medium]] and claimed to channel and materialize the [[spirit]] of a dead nine-year-old boy known as "Russell". Other spirits she said to materialize included the discredited medium [[Helen Duncan]] and Raymond the son of [[Oliver Lodge]].&lt;ref&gt;Lily Seafield. (2006). Ghostly Scotland. Barnes and Noble. p. 252. {{ISBN|978-0760782552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goold was accused as being a fraud by other spiritualists throughout her career.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Schnabel. (2003). ''Round in Circles: Physicists, Poltergeists, Pranksters and the Secret History of the Cropwatchers''. Hamish Hamilton. pp. 247-249. {{ISBN|978-1591021100}} &lt;/ref&gt; She became a popular medium in Britain known for her abilities to produce [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] and [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialize]] spirits, however, investigators discovered that the materialization figures were Goold herself and that she was a fraud. Goold refused infra-red cameras in her [[séance]]s and would work only in dark conditions.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;[[Tony Cornell]]. (2002). Investigating the Paranormal. Helix Press New York. pp. 347-352. {{ISBN|978-0912328980}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1984, [[Tony Cornell]] attended a series of séances with Goold. During a séance the spirit Russell materialized. However, Cornell felt the hands of Russell and described them as female-like with long nails; moreover, he was the same size as Goold when he was meant to be a boy and he smelt of Goold's perfume.&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;

The other spirit who materialized [[Helen Duncan]] was the same size as Goold but was 224 pounds before she died. At the end of the séance when the lights were turned on Cornell observed that one of the [[shoe]]s was different on Goold from the one before the séance and that one of her trouser legs was rolled up, indicating that she had changed clothing during the séance. Goold would also play [[music]] during her séances which provided cover for her to change clothes and when the music was turned off would pretend to be the spirits.&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;

==Early life==
Ruslana was born on 24 May 1973 in [[Lviv]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] to [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] father Stepan Lyzhychko and [[Russians|Russian]] mother Nina Sapegina.&lt;ref name="gazeta.ua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.ua/ru/post/137468|title=Руслана Лыжичко пошла в бабушку|publisher= Gazeta.ua|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CY2TuWiN?url=http://gazeta.ua/ru/post/137468|archivedate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in the [[Lviv Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]). Encouraged by her mother, Ruslana studied from the age of four at an experimental musical school and sang in different bands, including in the vocal-instrumental band Horizon, the band Orion and the children's ensemble Smile. After finishing secondary school, Ruslana entered the [[Lviv Conservatory]] where she graduated as a classical pianist and symphonic orchestra conductor in 1995.&lt;ref name="ruslana.ua"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ruslana.ua/en/bio.php|title=Biography on Ruslana's official website|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==

===Early career===
Ruslana started her career as the winner of the [[Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk|Slavianski Bazaar]] song competition in Vitebsk, [[Belarus]] in 1996 with the song ''Oj, letili dyki husi''.&lt;ref name="ruslana.ua"/&gt; In the same year, she was among the nominees for the Ukrainian Singer of the Year award and the video for ''Dzvinkyi Viter'' (''Wind Bells'') was awarded Music Video of the Year. Since her early career, Ruslana's producer was Oleksandr Ksenofontov, whom she married in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukrfoto.net/people_12.html Знаменитості України: Лижичко Руслана Степанівна (співачка)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Ruslana began working on ''Christmas with Ruslana'' – the first [[L'viv]] Christmas television project of an All-Ukrainian scale including the video clip ''Ballad of a Princess'' which was the first animated music video made by a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] singer.

Her first album ''[[Myt Vesny – Dzvinkyi Viter]]'' (''A Moment of Spring – Wind Bells''), released in 1998, received high praise from the critics.

Still, wider recognition did not come until 1998 with the song ''Svitanok'' (''Sunrise'') and the album ''Myt' Vesny – Dzvinkyj Viter Live''. ''Svitanok'' was the first Ukrainian big-budget music video. In 1998, Ruslana was awarded Person of the Year, the song ''Svitanok'' was awarded Song of the Year and its accompanying music video was awarded Music Video of the Year. In the second half of 1998, she organized a charity tour which had the aim of raising funds for the restoration of the old castles from Western Ukraine. The tour was a success and thanks to Ruslana's efforts, the [[Zolochiv Castle]] was restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/en/article/culture/who-will-save-ukrainian-castles Who will Save Ukrainian Castles?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, she worked on the Christmas musical ''Ostanne rizdvo 90th'' (''The Last Christmas of the 90s''), which won the Ukrainian ''Movie of the Year'' award. With the video clip to the song ''Znaju ya'' (''I Know''), which is about the ancient people of the [[Hutsuls]] living in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Carpathians]], Ruslana set new standards for modern video clip filming.

===Education===
[[File:Ruslana conducting the orchestra.jpg|thumb|Ruslana is one of the very few pop singers who are capable of conducting a symphonic orchestra, thanks to her higher education in music.]]
In 1995, Ruslana graduated from the [[Lviv Conservatory]] as professional conductor and classical pianist. She was the student of one of the most prominent [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] composers and conductors, [[Mykola Kolessa]] who is regarded as 'the father of the Ukrainian conducting school'. She used to be a part of the student choir of the Lviv Music Academy.

===2004: Wild Dances Project and Eurovision victory===

====Wild Dances Project====
Ruslana's father is from the West-Ukrainian area of the [[Hutsuls]], the dwellers of the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains. They have a unique culture with an ancient and rich history which inspired Ruslana to create her concept album ''Wild Dances''. It combines powerful and permeating ethnic drums, trumpet sounds of the [[trembita]], an ancient [[Hutsul]] music instrument, with modern dance beats. The album was composed by Ruslana after an expedition to the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in spring 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20043/4|title=Ruslana – the first Ukrainian pop singer to win a major European pop song contest|date=3 June 2004|publisher=Welcome to Ukraine|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album ''Dyki Tantsi'' (''Wild Dances'') was released in June 2003 in [[Ukraine]]. The album sold more than 170,000 copies in the first 100 days after its release, even without a supporting tour.&lt;ref name="Ruslana Dyki Tantsi 2003"/&gt; Together with its English language counterpart it was the first album ever to be certified five times platinum in Ukraine, selling more than 500,000 copies, making it the most successful album in Ukraine ever.&lt;ref name="ruslana.ua"/&gt;

====Eurovision Song Contest 2004====
{{main|Eurovision Song Contest 2004}}
Ruslana was internally chosen by the [[National Television Company of Ukraine|NTU]] to represent [[Ukraine]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]]. Before the contest, she was a hot favorite for victory by the bookmakers. At the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]], she performed her self-composed song, ''[[Wild Dances]]'' and won the contest receiving 280 points. In the semifinal, the song received points from all other participating countries; in the final, Switzerland was the only country not giving any points to the song.

The single ''Wild Dances'' stayed a total of 97 weeks in various European single charts. It was certified gold in Belgium, Sweden, Russia, Greece, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In Belgium it topped the single charts at #1 for 10 consecutive weeks.

In Belgium she was among the top 15 ranked performers with her singles "[[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]]" and "[[Dance with the Wolves]]".&lt;ref name="Ukraine All About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukraineallaboutu.com/travel-in-ukraine/meet-people/#/ruslana/|title=Meet world famous Ukrainian celebrities Shevchenko, Klitschko and Ruslana|date=14 July 2012|publisher=Ukraine All About|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruslana was named the most popular person in [[Belgium]],&lt;ref name="Ukraine All About"/&gt; the sexiest girl in [[Greece]],&lt;ref name="Ukraine All About"/&gt; the most influential public person in [[Ukraine]]&lt;ref name="Ukraine All About"/&gt; and was the first foreigner to receive the award of the Federation of Journalists in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Ukraine All About"/&gt;

===2005===
{{main|Eurovision Song Contest 2005}}
[[File:Ruslana Ukrainian stamp 2005-2.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian stamp celebrating Ruslana's victory at the Eurovision Song Contest]]
Ruslana had been initially chosen to host the semi final and the grand final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]].&lt;ref name="ruslana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/4368|title=Ruslana resigns as host|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=4 May 2005|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the singer had to decline the offer due to her involvement in the organization of a big charity concert dedicated to the victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Therefore, Ruslana appeared at the event only as a guest star. She performed a medley of ''[[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]]'' and ''Heart on Fire'' at the opening ceremony being accompanied by the Zhyttia ballet and the Ukrainian drums ensamble ARS Nova. After interviewing the competitors in the [[green room]] she also performed her latest single ''[[The Same Star]]''. During this performance Ruslana wore a red costume inspired by Ukrainian ethnic elements.

Also in 2005, Ruslana designed the cover for [[Jonathan Safran Foer]]'s ''The Unabridged Pocket Book of Lightning'' which was produced as part of [[Penguin Books]]' 70th birthday celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookcoverarchive.com/book/the_unabridged_pocketbook_of_lightning|title=Book cover archive|date=5 June 2005|publisher=bookcoverarchieve.com|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the television program ''Grand Prix Hitliste'', ''[[Wild Dances]]'' was presented as the winner, ahead of famous songs, such as ''[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]'' and Germany's only winner (at the time), ''[[Ein Bißchen Frieden]]'', which finished sixth and twelfth, respectively. The programme was viewed by a television audience of approximately six million people in Germany.&lt;ref name="ruslana2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6210|title=Ruslana – The best of Eurovision|author=Busa, Alexandru|publisher=esctoday|date=4 July 2007|accessdate=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008: Wild Energy &amp; ''Grand Theft Auto IV''===

Ruslana's project ''Wild Energy'' was based on the science fiction novel by Maryna and Sergij Diachenko ''[[Wild Energy. Lana]]''. In a future city which experiences a global energy crisis, far more threatening than lack of oil and gas, people are lacking their will to live, their energy of the heart – the "fuel for people". Lana, one of the synthetic inhabitants, sets out to find the mystical energy source. After many adventures she discovers that the wild energy comes from her own heart.
[[Wild Energy (album)|Wild Energy]] combines the art of music and video production, literature and social commitment in an extraordinary way. In June 2006 Ruslana presented the new single and video ''[[Wild Energy (song)|Wild Energy]]'' in a unique fantasy style. In this video clip the singer develops from a synthetic blonde girl into her wild image.

In March 2008 Ruslana's Ukrainian album ''[[Amazonka]]'' was released in Ukraine, Czech Republic and Slovakia. The English album ''[[Wild Energy (album)|Wild Energy]]'' was released by [[Warner Music]] in Canada and several European countries in autumn 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/10527/ruslana_sings_major_recording_deal_with_warner_records/|title=Ruslana signs major recording deal with Warner Records|date=15 February 2008|publisher=EscToday.com|accessdate=15 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was recorded at the [[Hit Factory]] Studio in Miami and contains two collaborations with American Urban superstars [[T-Pain]] and [[Missy Elliott]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ruslana.ua/?p=377&amp;language=en Ruslana to release Wild Energy]&lt;/ref&gt; On this release Ruslana creates her own distinctive technique of incorporating ancient ethnic styles of the [[Carpathian Mountain]] people with modern popular music.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', Ruslana lends her voice as the host of [[Vladivostok FM]]. Her song "[[Wild Dances]]" is featured as one of the songs on Vladivostok. On 13 May 2008, ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' broke the [[Guinness World Records]] for "Highest grossing video game in 24 hours" and "Highest Revenue Generated by an Entertainment Product in 24 Hours". It sold 3.6 million copies on day one generating $310 million in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/13/grand-theft-auto-iv-breaks-guinness-world-records-with-biggest-entertainment-release-of-all-time|title=Grand Theft Auto IV breaks Guinness World Records with biggest entertainment release of all-time|date=13 May 2008|publisher=ign.com|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2010: Asia Song Festival &amp; new album recordings===
[[File:Ruslana in 2009 Asia Song Festival.jpg|thumb|Ruslana on the catwalk of the 2009 [[Asia Song Festival]] in [[Seoul]], [[Korea]]]]
In 2009, she was invited to attend the sixth [[Asia Song Festival]] which took place in [[Seoul]], [[Korea]]. The event was held at the [[Seoul World Cup Stadium]] where Ruslana sung in front of an audience of 60,000 people. Together with the ''Zhyttia'' ballet, she performed three songs from her first international album: "[[Wild Dances]]", "[[Dance with the Wolves]]" and a bilingual version of "Play, Musician!". Her act was met with great enthusiasm by the Asian public who didn't know her until that moment. Even if she was supposed to receive only an award for her contribution to the cultural exchange between Ukraine and Asia in music, in the end she also won the main award of the festival, receiving the golden statue for the best artist of the Asia Song Festival 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4283|title=Ruslana conquered Asian hearts|date=22 September 2009|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–2012: The Voice of Ukraine and Ukrainian album ''Ey-fori-YA''===
In 2011, Ruslana was appointed as one of the judges of the Ukrainian version of ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'' show. Her involvement in the project was featured on the Dutch TV where the original show of the series kicked off. Eventually, Ruslana's alumni, Tonya Matvienko, placed 2nd in the grand final of the Ukrainian show.

Also in 2011, her song ''[[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]]'' was used by the American gymnast [[Jordyn Wieber]] as the soundtrack for her floor exercise.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/7096506/jordyn-wieber-wins-world-gymnastics-all-title|title=Jordyn Wieber wins world all-around title|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wieber eventually became the 2011 [[2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Women's All-Around Champion]] and won the golden medal at the [[Gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's artistic team all-around|2012 Summer Olympics]] performing her floor exercise on Ruslana's song.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

In April 2012 the new Ukrainian language album ''ЕЙ-форі-Я'' (''EY-fori-YA'') was released in Ukraine. The album on which Ruslana had worked for four years was produced in the USA, Sweden and Ukraine produced by [[Vlad (musician)|Vlad Debriansky]] and Ruslana and features musicians such as Rusty Allen, Victor Little, George Benson, Brian Coller and others.&lt;ref name="umka.com.ua"&gt;[http://www.umka.com.ua/eng/catalogue/dance-pop/ruslana-ey-fori-ya-eu-phori-a.html Ruslana. HEY-phori-YEAH. (EU-phori-A)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its intercontinental rock and pop nature, the album ''EY-fori-YA'' and the three songs taken from it previously is based on Slavic rhythms. Ruslana integrated old Slavic circle dances, liturgies and elements of classic pieces of Russian composers including [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Tschaikowsky]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Rachmaninow]].&lt;ref name="umka.com.ua"/&gt;
The album is designed for flash mob type synchronous dances. In April/May 2012 she toured 11 Ukrainian cities with a unique show concept called ''OGO Show''. During these open-air events Ruslana appeared as lead dancer teaching the audience the moves. The audience doesn't consume passively, but is integrated into the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ogoshow.com.ua Ogoshow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803042756/http://ogoshow.com.ua/ |date=3 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More concept concerts followed within the framework of the ''EURO 2012'' public fan events.

===2013: International album ''My Boo! (Together!)'' &amp; ''Clash of the Choirs''===
Her third international album was set to be released in 2013 under the title ''[[My Boo (Ruslana album)|My Boo! (Together!)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfecte.ro/international/ti-o-mai-amintesti-pe-ruslana-castigatoarea-eurovisionului-din-2004-vezi-cum-arata-acum-la-40-de-ani.html|title=Ti-o mai amintesti pe Ruslana?|publisher=perfecte.ro|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new material shows how versatile Ruslana is as an artist as she completely changed her style since the ''[[Wild Energy (album)|Wild Energy]]'' project, from a wild [[Amazons|Amazon]] to a Urban pop princess.

Most of the album was produced by [[Vlad (musician)|Vlad DeBriansky]] in Los Angeles and includes the names of American top musicians such as [[Rusty Allen]], Victor Little, [[Oscar Seaton, Jr.|Oscar Seaton]], Brian Coller as well as [[Stefan Örn]] from [[Sweden]] who won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]] as a songwriter. [[Goran Bregovich]], the legendary [[Balkan]] musician from [[Serbia]] produced the song ''Kray''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umka.com.ua/eng/catalogue/dance-pop/ruslana-ey-fori-ya-eu-phori-a.html UMKA : Ruslana. HEY-phori-YEAH. (EU-phori-A)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time of the release of the new English album Ruslana's Ukrainian album ''ЕЙ-форі-Я'' (''EY-fori-YA'', ''Euphoria'') was re-released under the new title ''Мій Брат! (разом)'' (''Miy Brat! (razom!)'', ''My Brother! (together!)''). The renaming of the album had become necessary because of the coincidental same name of the winning song of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]]. The Swedish singer [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]] won the event with the song ''Euphoria'', one month after Ruslana had released her Ukrainian album and song of the same name. In order to avoid misunderstandings Ruslana's renamed not only her album but also her English song ''Euphoria'' into ''This Is Euphoria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|iZbREPPVRYI|Interview Ruslana – My boo! (World Out Games 2013 – Antwerp – Belgium)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013 Ruslana globally released the single ''This Is Euphoria'' digitally. The track was composed and produced by Ruslana and the Swedish musician [[Stefan Örn]].

She was invited to perform at the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] which took place in her country's capital [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=remarkable_ruslana_to_perform_with_a_childrens_choir_at_the_junior_eurovision_song_contest Remarkable Ruslana to perform with a children's choir at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she withdrew her act from the show considering the violence shown by the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] authorities against [[2013 Ukraine pro-European Union protests|those who were peacefully protesting]] in the country's capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://escreporter.com/why-wasnt-ruslana-at-junior-eurovision/ Why wasn't Ruslana at Junior Eurovision? ]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of the coaches of the first season of the [[Clash of the Choirs]] TV show in [[Ukraine]]. Ruslana and her alumni from the city of [[Lviv]] have won the grand final of the project on 5 January 2014, receiving 78% of the tele voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1plus1.ua/novyny/ruslana-rozridalasya-na-sceni-bitvi-horiv-pochuvshi-pro-peremogu-svoyeyi-komandi-328407.html |title=Руслана розридалася на сцені "Битви хорів", почувши про перемогу своєї команди - Новини |publisher=1plus1.ua |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014–2016: Eurovision juror===
In January 2014 her international album ''[[My Boo (Ruslana album)|My Boo! (Together!)]]'' was released digitally. For her subsequent album Ruslana intended to study again [[ethnic]] motifs as she regarded the [[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]] project as her most creative work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://show.obozrevatel.com/article/50138-ruslana-myi-s-muzhem-sozdanyi-drug-dlya-druga.htm|title=Ruslana: My s muzhem sozdany drug dlya druga|work=Obozrevatel.com|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her active involvement in the [[Euromaidan]] in Ukraine, Ruslana had to postpone her musical plans.

Ruslana was invited as music expert for Eurosong, the [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|Belgian selection for the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest]] in order to choose the best candidate to represent Belgium at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escflashmalta.com/index.php/music-news/international-music-news/item/3301-belgium-ruslana-joins-panel-for-eurosong-2014|title=Belgium: Ruslana Joins Panel for Eurosong 2014|work=ESCflashMalta.com|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 and 10 October Ruslana held two concerts at the Manchester Ukrainian Cultural Centre 'Dnipro'. She originally planned on performing only one show however as the tickets sold out within hours, it was decided that she would perform a second concert the next day. Tickets for that show were also almost sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruslana.ua/ua/news.php?id=6253|title=Два надзвичайних живих концерти в Манчестері|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October, Ruslana performed a concert along with the [[Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus]] in [[Massey Hall]] in [[Toronto]]. The purpose of the concert was to showcase the beauty and the importance of the [[Bandura]] in Ukrainian music and culture. For her final song, Ruslana performed along with the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus as well as the Zoloti Struny Youth Bandura Ensemble based in Toronto. Ruslana was a juror for the [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|Ukrainian national final]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]]. Out of the three jury members, she was the only one who supported the singer [[Jamala]] who later on became the second Eurovision winner from [[Ukraine]].

In late 2016, after Jamala's victory at Eurovision in Stockholm, Ruslana played 3 concerts in Western Europe. In October she played in London, in November she played in Paris and in December she played in Hanover (Hannover). In all of these concerts she spoke about the victory that Jamala brought for Ukraine, and how Ukraine would be opening up to the world again in May 2017.

=== 2017: It's Magical / Ya lyublyu ===
After her long-lasting creative break, which was caused by the dramatic and stormy events in Ukraine, Ruslana presented her new single "It's Magical / Я люблю" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017|Eurovision]] Grand Finale in Kyiv on 13 May 2017. The new music style combines tender cradle songs with brisk exotic melodies and rhythms. The original, exotic manner of singing which forms the basis of the soundtrack Ruslana acquired on sometimes extreme expeditions into the Carpathian Mountains. The song was released in an English ("It's Magical") and a Ukrainian version ("Я люблю" / "Ya lyublyu" / "I Love").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://oikotimes.com/2017/05/18/ruslana-releases-brand-new-single-and-video-because-its-magical/ |title= Ruslana releases brand new single and video "It's Magical" |publisher=Oikotimes |date=2017-05-18 |accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film production took place in a unique place, the Basalt quarry in the [[Rivne]] region. Director [[Oles Sanin]] created a thunder storm in a realistic way for the video clip. The image of Ruslana in the chainmail in which she appears in the clip resembles her internal state. After all the events in her country and her extreme expeditions into the mountains, Ruslana feels like a kind of warrioress who is called to protect the most valuable: Love. In her song, video Ruslana wants to draw attention to the widespread deforestation in the Carpathians. Her aim is the preservation of the Carpathian primeval forests, their unique wildlife, and exceptional culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://oikotimes.com/2017/05/18/ruslana-releases-brand-new-single-and-video-because-its-magical/ |title= Ruslana releases brand new single and video "It's Magical" |publisher=Oikotimes |date=2017-05-18 |accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==

===2004: Orange Revolution===
{{main|Orange Revolution}}
In autumn 2004 Ruslana actively supported the democratic processes in Ukraine known as the [[Orange Revolution]], to which her song "[[Dance with the Wolves]]" was devoted. She declared her support for [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the disputed [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|Ukrainian presidential elections]]. She became one of the prominent figures that addressed the mass crowds rallying in support of Yushchenko's demand that his original defeat be declared fraudulent.
From spring 2006 to summer 2007 she was a Member of the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] for the party [[People's Union Our Ukraine|Our Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruslana.com.ua/text/arch/eng/arch2007summer.html Ruslana resigns as Member of Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to political reasons the music video supporting her second single extracted from the ''[[Wild Dances]]'' album, "Dance with the Wolves" was censored in Russia as it contains fragments showing Ruslana in the Independence Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/3874 Ruslana censored in Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruslana endorsed [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] during the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|2010 Ukrainian presidential election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://pravda.com.ua/news/2009/6/26/97365.htm Руслана на виборах президента підтримає Тимошенко], [[Ukrainska Pravda]] (26 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and actively supported her candidature during the [[election campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://pravda.com.ua/news/2009/9/10/101315.htm Зірковий колгосп для Тимошенко], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (10 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-335965.html Best singers of country start tour in support of Tymoshenko], [[UNIAN]] (14 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012: Campaign against judicial arbitrariness===

In December 2012 Ruslana launched the human rights campaign ''Не мовчи'' (''Don't keep silent'') which challenges the juridical system of Ukraine. In particular she supports the case of Dmytro and Sergiy Pavlichenko who claim to have been forced to admit a murder they have not committed. The father and son were convicted of killing a judge of a district court in Kyiv and sentenced to life imprisonment and 13 years in prison respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/132017.html |title= Ukrainian ombudsperson promises to check Pavlichenkos' claims of extorted confession to murder|publisher =Interfax Ukraine|date= 14 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was widely criticized mainly by football fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theyarenotkillers.com|title=theyarenotkillers.com|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruslana dedicated her song and video ''Це – Ей-форі-Я'' (''This is Euphoria'') to the case of the Pavlichenkos who according to her are victims of a misjudgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syGbUmsEI0M&amp;list=UUwswva9TnLYr46Lm2rdyhmw|title=Ruslana's advocacy campaign "Don't Keep Silent", Press-center UNIAN|publisher=RuslanaTube|date=4 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first day of the protests she stayed on [[Kiev]]'s [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] virtually all night, up to ten hours a night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/53812822/ns/world_news-europe/#.Uq8vxLTKlHU Ukrainian Eurovision pop star becomes voice of protest], [[NBCNews.com]] (12 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraines-euromaidan-how-kiev-protests-reflect-ukraines-dance-between-east-west-1509144 Ukraine's EuroMaidan: How The Kiev Protests Reflect Ukraine's Dance Between East And West], ''[[International Business Times]]'' (13 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[The Daily Beast]] on 11 December 2013 she explained her role in the opposition as ''charging Maidan with freedom-loving energy'', insisted she ''hates'' politics&lt;ref name="RuslanaTDBI111213"&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/11/meet-ruslana-lyzhychko-the-soulvoickraine-s-revolution.html Meet Ruslana Lyzhychko, the Soul of Ukraine's Revolution], [[The Daily Beast]] (11 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and denied supporting any single leader.&lt;ref name=MrmcpYN131213&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/eurovision-winner-sings-revolution-ukraine-174632324.html#AvyIJig Eurovision winner sings for revolution in Ukraine], [[Yahoo! News]] (13 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In total Ruslana spent at least 100 days and 100 nights on the Maidan stage during the cold winter inspiring the crowds, giving speeches and singing the Ukrainian national anthem every hour day after day and night after and night, often sleeping just a couple of hours on the floor of the Trade Union building occupied by the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruslana at John Batchelor Show, 7.4.2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4X4r4OEDSU|accessdate=7 April 2014| date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a symbol of people power, peace and freedom she established holding up flashlights while singing the Ukrainian national anthem.

When during the night of 30 November 2013 the riot police wanted to clear the occupied Maidan and started beating up peacefully sleeping activists Ruslana rushed for help and managed to seek shelter with about 100 students, some of them wounded, in a nearby monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Special police disrupts EuroMaidan|url= http://ukrainianweek.com/News/95319|accessdate=12 June 2014|newspaper=The Ukrainian Week|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During another night in December 2013 when the riot police advanced again towards the square Ruslana did her utmost to deescalate the situation by talking to them from the stage repeating over and over again "Quiet! No violence!". She gave the protesters the courage to peacefully withstand more than 2,000 riot police who eventually retreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruslana Honored with International Women of Courage Award|url= http://ukraine.usembassy.gov/statements/ruslana-03042014.html|accessdate=12 June 2014|newspaper=Embassy of the United States in Ukraine|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her commitment in the pro-European movement was featured in many international publications. While the American press regarded her as the 'true heroine of [[Ukraine]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Ruslana Lyzhychko, the Soul of Ukraine's Revolution|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/11/meet-ruslana-lyzhychko-the-soulvoickraine-s-revolution.html|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=Daily Beast|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[German language|German]] magazine ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]'' called her 'Kiev's queen of the night',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Revolutionssängerin Ruslana: Kiews Königin der Nacht|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/ukraine-saengerin-ruslana-stimmt-jede-nacht-die-nationalhymne-an-a-939391.html|accessdate=31 December 2013|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]|date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' compared her to [[Jeanne d'Arc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruslana, una indígena ucraniana por Europa|url=http://www.elmundo.es/loc/2013/12/09/52a2257e63fd3deb448b457e.html|accessdate=31 December 2013|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media even compared her to [[Katniss Everdeen]], the heroine of [[The Hunger Games]] trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Ukraine is like "The Hunger Games"|url=http://www.vocativ.com/01-2014/ukraine-like-hunger-games/|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=Vocativ.com|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine included her in the top 10 of the most influential women of 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.ru/forbes-woman-photogallery/zhenshchiny-v-biznese/249077-zhenshchiny-goda-2013-reiting-forbes-woman/photo/10|title=Forbes: Most influential women of 2013|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Business Ukraine'' magazine named her 'person of the year'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunews.com.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1238:business-ukraine-magazine-person-of-the-year-ruslana&amp;catid=6:politics&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Person of the year: Ruslana |date=13 January 2014 |publisher=Business Ukraine |accessdate=13 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111153333/http://www.bunews.com.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1238:business-ukraine-magazine-person-of-the-year-ruslana&amp;catid=6:politics&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 2014 Ruslana started to meet with key EU and U.S. politicians asking for support for Ukraine. Her first appearance in this role at the 495th Plenary Session of the [[European Economic and Social Committee]] (EESC) and a meeting with [[José Manuel Barroso]], President of the European Commission, resulted in a resolution of the EESC to support the Ukrainian civil society and its democratic rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The protest movement of Maidan in Kiev at the EESC|url=http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=president.en.my-news.30579|accessdate=25 January 2014|publisher=Website of the EESC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months Ruslana travelled to Stockholm, Paris, Warsaw, Brussels, Vienna, Strasbourg, Berlin, Munich, São Paulo, Washington D.C. and New York speaking to leading government officials demanding international support. In addition she gave the mass media in various countries an authentic view on the events in Ukraine.

Her activism put herself in serious danger. She received numerous death threats on her phone, her car was followed and she couldn't live in her house for several weeks because it was constantly observed. Snipers aimed at her while she was standing on the Maidan stage. The threats started after she started demanding sanctions from the EU governments against the [[Viktor Yanukovych|Yanukovych]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://maidantranslations.com/2014/02/10/ruslana-titushky-banished-me-from-my-home-threaten-to-punish-me-like-bulatov/comment-page-1/|title=Ruslana: Titushky banished me from my home, threaten to punish me like Bulatov|date=9 February 2014|publisher= Pravda.com.ua|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruslana had also noted the presence of paid provocateurs who have instigated fights in the otherwise peaceful protests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-live-updates-332341.html&lt;/ref&gt; After President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] had fled the country in late February 2014 and the fights in Ukraine escalated Ruslana targeted Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] as aggressor and demanded sanctions against him and his government. In Washington D.C. she stated: ''Putin's propaganda is a machine against the truth. Putin started his terrorist operation in Eastern Ukraine and is preparing his way to Kyiv. Russia's special forces, terrorist, are invading Ukraine. … Tomorrow we will wake up and see that Putin took away everything he wanted.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/en/news/transcripts/2014-distinguished-humanitarian-leadership-award-ruslana-lyzhychko|title=2014 Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership Award: Ruslana Lyzhychko |date=30 April 2014|publisher= Atlantic Council|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For her extraordinary courage, commitment and dedication Ruslana was honoured with several awards including the International Woman of Courage Award, awarded by First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] at the [[Woman in the World Summit]] in New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilve2leadblogil2lorg.me/2014/04/08/international-woman-of-courage-ruslana-lyzhchko-of-the-ukraine/|title=International Woman of Courage: Ruslana Lyzhchko of the Ukraine|date=8 April 2014|publisher= Woman in the World Summit|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2014 [[Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership Award]] from at the [[Atlantic Council]] in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/en/news/transcripts/2014-distinguished-humanitarian-leadership-award-ruslana-lyzhychko|title=2014 Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership Award: Ruslana Lyzhychko|date=30 April 2014|publisher=Atlantic Council|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2014, the day before the Presidential election in Ukraine which happened to be also her birthday, Ruslana organized a global joint prayer which involved one million people in several countries highlighting the unity of Ukrainians across the world and the global support for Ukraine. Ruslana herself read the prayer "For Ukraine, for peace and quiet" and performed the Ukrainian national anthem in 12 languages on Mount [[Khomyak]] in the [[Carpathian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.768951153150053.1073741887.143316715713503&amp;type=3|title=Ruslana with a million people around the world prayed for Ukraine|date=24 May 2014|publisher=Facebook RuslanaOfficial|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social commitment==
In 2004-2005 Ruslana was appointed Good Will Ambassador of Ukraine by the [[UNICEF]] and combats [[trafficking in human beings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brama.com/news/press/2005/05/050510ruslana_unicef.html Ruslana becomes first ever UNICEF National Ambassador in Ukraine ]&lt;/ref&gt; She released two video clips which aim to make potential victims aware of the dangers of [[human trafficking]]. In February 2008 Ruslana performed at an anti-human trafficking event in [[Vienna]], Austria, organized by [[UN.GIFT]] (The United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking) in front of 117 international delegations. Her song ''Not for Sale'' became the anthem of the anti-trafficking campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ruslana.ua/?language=en Ruslana Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the frames of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] in [[Kiev]] she gave a charity concert for children suffering from the consequences of the [[Chernobyl]] tragedy. For another charity project Ruslana joined forces with German rock star [[Peter Maffay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maffay.de/begegnungen/ Website of Peter Maffay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311082622/http://www.maffay.de/begegnungen |date=11 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April/May 2007 they went together with artists from 14 countries on a four weeks tour through Germany. The funds gathered benefited children in need.

Ruslana has also staged numerous charity concerts benefiting Children's hospitals in [[Kiev]], [[Lviv]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk]].

With her project Wild Energy Ruslana supports the use of [[renewable energy]]. She regards the energy of the sun, the water and the wind as an energy independence. The project gradually developed into this bigger meaning. Ruslana wants to make people aware of the dangers of [[global climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89436819 A Ukrainian Pop Star's Would-Be Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

After large regions in Western Ukraine were hit by a flood in July 2008 Ruslana set up the co-ordinating and relief centre ''Carpathians. Flood. SOS! 2008''. The aim of the centre is to create a database of the people in need, to provide emergency humanitarian help and to collect and distribute donations both from the public and from other Ukrainian artists and sportsmen to support the victims of the flood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://karpatysos.info/en/ Carpathians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4503">'''Samūm''' ({{lang-ar|سموم}} also spelled ''Simoom'' or ''Semum''; from the root {{lang|ar|س م م}} ''s-m-m'', {{lang|ar|سم}} "to poison") is a [[Quran]]ic term referring to infernal heat and in Extra-Quranic accounts, also to a kind of [[demon]]. In {{Cite quran|56|42|s=ns}} the tormenting fires of [[Jahannam]] are called ''samūm'' and it is also mentioned in {{Cite quran|15|26|s=ns}} as the origin of [[Jann (legendary creature)|Jann]]. In non-Arabic Qur'anic translations, the term is often translated  with "scorching fire" or "scorching winds", because apart from its Islamic usage, samūm also refers to a [[Simoom|hot, dusty desert wind]].&lt;ref&gt;John Penrice ''A Dictionary and Glossary of the Koran: With Grammatical References and Explanations of the Text'' Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers 1969 {{ISBN|978-0-819-60252-7}} page 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rashid al-Din ''Rashid al-Din's History of India: Collected Essays with Facsimiles and Indices'' Walter de Gruyter 1965 {{ISBN|978-3-111-71602-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both terms may be [[Linguistics|linguistically]] related to [[Samael]]&lt;ref&gt;John Hamilton Warrack, John Warrack ''Carl Maria Von Weber'' CUP Archive 1976 {{ISBN|978-0-521-29121-7}} page 214&lt;/ref&gt;, an [[Angel in Judaism|Archangel]] in [[Talmud]]ic and post-Talmudic literature, who envied humanity and in charge of destructive demons, similar to the Islamic legends about demons created from samūm, envying [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].

== Material of samūm ==
[[Tabari]] offers many interpretations for the nature of samūm. In one interpretation he provides, samūm is "hot wind which kills" and in another "the flame of the fire of the hot wind" and yet in another he relates it to "night-wind" in opposition to ''harur'' (day-wind). Further he states, some hold samūm to be the hell-fire (''nar jahannama''). On the authority of [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaidah]], samūm is the fire that "penetrates the pores due to its fineness in the day-time as well as at night". [[Abu Sãlih]] is reported as saying that samūm is ''smokeless fire'' located between the heavens and [[barzakh|the veil]]. According to [[Ibn Abbas]], the samūm is "the worst hot fire which kills". On the authority of [['Amir ibn Dinar]], samūm is the fire of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Egdunas Racius
 ''ISLAMIC EXEGESIS ON THE JINN: THEIR ORIGIN, KINDS AND SUBSTANCE AND THEIR RELATION TO OTHER BEINGS
'' pp. 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn Kathir]], samūm is the "flame of the fire", which is "the best fire".

== Demon samūm ==
In one narration, the samūm is a sapient creature, which stayed loyal to [[God in Islam|God]] until the creation of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]]. Afterthat, they envied mankind and their ardor turned into hatred, therefore they were cast away from God's mercy. [[Satan#Islam|Satan]], who also disaproved the creation of mankind, became their leader and the samūms his most loyal servants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mailce.com/semum-nedir.html (turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tabari]] recorded a similar story authorized by [[Ibn Abbas]], that a pre-adamitic creature was once loyal to God and subordinative to [[Iblis]], and fought against the [[Jinn]]. But after God created humanity, they envied the new creation and became demons. However Tabari called these demons ''[[Hinn (mythology)|Hinn]]'' instead of "samūm". But depicted "samūm" as their origin in contrast to the Jinn, who were created from ''smokeless fire''.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmoud M. Ayoub ''The Qur'an and Its Interpreters: Surah 1 and 2'' Islamic Book Trust 2012 {{ISBN|978-9-675-06290-2}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some legends relate "samūm" to the mother of [[Shaitan|demons]], created by God as a wife for Iblis, after the latter was banished from [[Jannah|heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Turkish [[horror film]] [[Semum]] is about "samūm", allegedly based on different independently narrations about [[Demonic possession|possessed]] people, claiming to encountered a samūm.&lt;ref&gt;Gönül Dönmez-Colin ''The Routledge Dictionary of Turkish Cinema'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-317-93726-5}} page 130&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seán Garland''' (born 7 March 1934) is a former President of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] in Ireland.

==Early life==
Born at Belvedere Place, off [[Mountjoy Square]] in [[Dublin]], Garland joined the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Irish Republican Army]] in 1953. In 1954, he briefly joined the [[British Army]] as an IRA agent and collected intelligence on [[Gough Barracks]] in [[Armagh]] and supplied it to the IRA in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name="Hanley and Miller, p. 9"&gt;Hanley and Miller, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled the IRA to carry out a successful arms raid on 12 June 1954, with Garland's active involvement on the base. Garland deserted from the British army in October of the same year, before his regiment was due to depart for [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Hanley and Miller, p. 9"/&gt; He became a full-time IRA training officer.

On 1 January 1957 at the beginning of the IRA [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]], he led the unsuccessful attack on [[Brookeborough]] [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] barracks in which his associates [[Seán South]] and [[Fergal O'Hanlon]], both the subjects of well-known [[Irish republicanism|republican]] [[ballad]]s, were shot and fatally wounded. Under fire, Garland carried South on his shoulders in an unsuccessful attempt to save his friend's life. Seriously wounded, he was subsequently hospitalised for a number of weeks and was then jailed in [[Mountjoy Prison]]. In November 1957, while in Mountjoy, Garland was an unsuccessful candidate in the [[Dublin North-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-Central]] by-election. Upon his release, he was [[interned]] in the [[Curragh]], but was released in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workerspartyireland.net/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018215010/http://www.workerspartyireland.net/history.html |archivedate=18 October 2008 |df= }} Interview with Garland on Downtown Radio, August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland returned to IRA service on his release and was sent to [[Belfast]] to liaise with the then largely inactive units in the city. He was arrested while trying to return to Dublin and sentenced in November 1959 to four years in [[Crumlin Road Gaol]] where he subsequently became officer commanding (O.C.) of the IRA prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workerspartyireland.net/history.html Workers Party website containing interview with Seán Garland on Downtown Radio in August 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018215010/http://www.workerspartyireland.net/history.html |date=18 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanley and Miller, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Sinn Féin to the Workers' Party of Ireland==
In the 1960s, Garland became a [[Marxist]] and was one of a generation of IRA leaders who attempted to lead the organisation away from violence and into left-wing political agitation. He worked closely in this with figures such as [[Cathal Goulding]] and [[Tomás MacGiolla]]. During the 1969/70 IRA split, Garland supported the moves to abandon [[abstentionism]] and was a key figure in [[Official Sinn Féin]] (as national organiser) and [[Official Irish Republican Army]] (as Adjutant-General). The Official IRA was openly involved in shootings and bombings of military and civilian targets but declared a [[ceasefire]] in May 1972. Despite this, the Official IRA continued to carry out shootings and robberies during the 1970s and was engaged in a number of feuds with the [[Provisional IRA]] and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA).

On 1 March 1975 in [[Ballymun]], Dublin, Garland survived an INLA assassination attempt while returning home with his wife Mary to his Ballymun home. He was badly wounded in the attack. In 1977, Garland was elected general secretary of Official Sinn Féin. In the same year, he successfully proposed that the party be renamed [[Sinn Féin the Workers Party]]. In 1982, he proposed that the prefix Sinn Féin be dropped from the party name to become simply [[Workers' Party of Ireland|The Workers' Party]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In 1999 Garland was allegedly observed visiting the [[North Korea]]n embassy in [[Moscow]]. It was subsequently alleged that he visited to collect forged [[Superdollar|US dollars]] which, with the help of associates, would be transported to [[Dublin]] and [[Birmingham]] where the notes would be exchanged for [[Pound sterling|pounds]] or authentic dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4337610.stm|work=BBC News|title=US says North Korea forged dollars|date=13 October 2005|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/dc/Press_Releases/2005_Archives/Oct_2005/05370.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051014220354/http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/Press_Releases/2005_Archives/Oct_2005/05370.html |archivedate=14 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US authorities announced that this scheme, which they said involved several international crime syndicates and transactions worth millions of dollars, had been uncovered in "Operation Mali".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/workers-party-boss-linked-to-counterfeit-super-dollars-503002.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Willie | last=Kealy | title=Workers' Party boss linked to counterfeit 'super dollars' | date=18 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/city_banks_target_of_fake_dollars_fraud_1_324175|title=City banks target of fake dollars fraud|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detecting.org.uk/html/Super_Dollar_Famous_Fakes_and_Frauds.html|title=The Super Dollar Famous Fakes and Frauds|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seán Garland was the Workers' Party representative at the [[National Forum on Europe]]. In 2000, he was elected president of the Workers' Party.

==Involvement with KGB==

In 1988 Sean Garland asked the [[KGB]] to provide "special training" to up to five members of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] in order to improve party security. This request was made through the KGB station chief in Dublin, with whom Sean Garland had "confidential contacts". The head of the KGB, [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], viewed the request positively. However, on 12 January 1989, the International Department of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] turned it down, fearing that leaked news of such cooperation would damage the Soviet relationship with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/06-january-1989-no-number/ The Bukovsky Archives, 6 January 1989*.]&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of Kryuchkov's letter and of the Central Committee decision can be found in an archive of classified documents smuggled out of Russia by [[Vladimir Bukovsky]].

==Extradition fight==
[[File:MacGiolla Garland.jpg|300px|thumb|Seán Garland (right) with Tomás MacGiolla, May 2008]]

On 7 October 2005, Garland was arrested in [[Belfast]] on foot of an [[extradition]] application issued by the US authorities. He had been attending the Workers' Party [[Ardfheis]]/Annual Conference at the time. The [[United States of America|United States]] authorities alleged that Garland had been involved in the distribution and resale of [[Counterfeit money|counterfeited]] US dollars - so-called "[[superdollar]]s" or "supernotes" - in 1998. They also alleged that the source of the banknotes was the government of [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=doj-20051008&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/dc/Press_Releases/2005_Archives/Oct_2005/05370.html |title=Leader of Irish Workers' Party and Official Irish Republican Army Leader of Irish Workers' Party and Official Irish Republican Army Arrested in United Kingdom on U.S. Indictment Charging Trafficking in Counterfeit United States Currency |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=8 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051014220354/http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/Press_Releases/2005_Archives/Oct_2005/05370.html |archivedate=2005-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4337610.stm US says N Korea forged dollars] 13 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Garland was released on [[bail]].

A campaign was then launched against the US extradition attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seangarland.org Seán Garland's official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219212232/http://www.seangarland.org/ |date=19 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His supporters claimed the U.S. waited for Garland to travel north of the Irish border before seeking his extradition, believing the [[United Kingdom]] authorities would be more willing to acquiesce than those in the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seangarland.org/id5.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130234448/http://www.seangarland.org/id5.html |archivedate=30 November 2007 |df= }} briefing No.1 point 5&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007 the Irish edition of the [[Mail on Sunday]] speculated that there was evidence that the affair was a US plot to provide a pretext for a military attack on North Korea &lt;ref&gt;Irish Mail on Sunday, 24 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 2005, a ''Sunday Times'' article alleged that Garland became [[List of IRA Chiefs of Staff|chief of staff]] of the largely inactive Official IRA in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Clarke [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2091-1817418,00.html Garland arrested in US forgery hunt] 9 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December, the High Court in Belfast issued a warrant for Garland's arrest after he failed to appear for an extradition hearing. On 1 April 2006, Garland was unanimously re-elected as President of The Workers' Party and in a keynote address to the party membership gathered in Dublin he vowed to fight any attempt to extradite him to the United States. In 2008 he announced his intention to retire from the presidency and was replaced in the position on 17 May 2008 by [[Mick Finnegan]]. Garland remained a member of the party's Central Executive Committee and was its National Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workerspartyireland.net/id163.html Workers' Party elect new Party President] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819180801/http://workerspartyireland.net/id163.html |date=19 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland was subsequently arrested in Dublin in 2009 and the application by the U.S. to extradite him was heard in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0718/garlands.html|title=Garland accused in counterfeit notes plot|date=18 July 2011|work=RTÉ.ie|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign against his extradition continued, bringing in a number of prominent individuals from outside the Workers' Party including its Honorary Chairman the Rev. [[Chris Hudson (trade unionist)|Chris Hudson]]. It sought and received support from numerous political figures from across the spectrum in Ireland, the United Kingdom and further afield. Among these were dozens of members of the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament), MEPs and local politicians. Garland also received support from the entertainment industry including musicians [[Pete Seeger]], [[Christy Moore]], [[Alabama 3]] and [[John Spillane]]. Garland's supporters pointed out that the 77-year-old had been diagnosed from a number of serious medical conditions including diabetes and bowel cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seangarland.org/seanad.html Health ailments of Seán Garland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704183710/http://www.seangarland.org/seanad.html |date= 4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2011, Justice John Edwards in the High Court dismissed the US application for Garland's extradition. Justice Edwards told the court he was not disposed to grant the application and would furnish his reasons for doing so later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/courts/garland-delighted-as-extradition-to-us-denied-2971087.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Brian | last=Kavanagh | title=Garland 'delighted' as extradition to US denied | date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 2012, Justice Edwards stated that since the offence for which the US wanted to extradite was regarded as having been committed in Ireland the Court was prohibited from extraditing Garland. He was therefore obliged to refer the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions who would consider whether there was a case for prosecuting Garland in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/dpp-to-examine-whether-garland-should-be-prosecuted-in-ireland-338932-Jan2012/|title=DPP to examine whether Garland should be prosecuted in Ireland|author=Gavan Reilly|work=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2012, Garland spoke at the funeral of his comrade Noel Cullen, alongside Cullen's son Jake. Noel Cullen was a key figure in The Workers Party who died of cancer at the age of 52. Garland spoke on his friends passion, humanity, and quest for knowledge before handing Jake and Noel's daughter Ríona a starry plough, and an Irish flag. {{Citation needed |date=February 2016}}

After Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono [[Indonesian presidential election, 2009|was re-elected in 2009]], she was re-appointed in her post of Finance Minister.

Originally a Motocross racer, at the age of 20 Roach taught himself to play the [[synthesizer]]&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-roach-p2749 |title=Steve Roach &amp;#124; Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being inspired by such influential synthesizer artists and groups as [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Klaus Schulze]], and [[Vangelis]]. His debut album ''Now'' appeared in 1982, followed by ''[[Structures from Silence]]'' in 1984. In 1986 he released his acclaimed ''Quiet Music'' series. In 1988, he released what has been described by critics as his masterpiece, the double-album ''[[Dreamtime Return]]''.&lt;ref name = "AllMusic"/&gt;

As Roach's approach to ambient music has matured, his compositions have typically&lt;ref name="Gemma"&gt;"Stretch out and enjoy the soundscape" by Gemma Tarlach, [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]], April 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; been [[Beat (music)|beat]]less. His rhythmic and [[trance music|trance-based]] groove and tribal-ambient releases, however, are nearly as numerous&lt;ref name="Gemma"/&gt; as his more atmospheric releases. Some recordings are strictly synthesizer-based, whereas others include ambient [[guitar]] experiments. 

Other pieces, however, cross over with more ethnic and folk influences. Roach learned to play the [[digeridoo]] during his extended trips to [[Australia]] in the 1980s, and he became an early proponent&lt;ref&gt;"Instrument owner lauds soothing effects," [[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)]] June 7, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; of its use in ambient music. His work with Mexican musician [[Jorge Reyes (musician)|Jorge Reyes]] introduced Roach to [[Prehispanic]] musical elements, which he has also included in his music. These fusions established Roach as one of the founders&lt;ref name="Gemma"/&gt; of the tribal-ambient sound.

Roach is married to author and equine teacher  [[Linda Kohanov]]{{r|spiderbytes}} (who provided vocals on some of his albums). They live in [[Tucson, Arizona]].{{r|echoesicons}}

'''Stuart Holroyd''' (born 10 August 1933 in [[Bradford]], [[Yorkshire]]) is a British writer.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors 2004"&gt;''Contemporary Authors'' (Thomson Gale, 1 January 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

He first came to prominence for the philosophical and critical works produced during his close association with the writers [[Colin Wilson]] and [[Bill Hopkins (novelist)|Bill Hopkins]], but has since written prolifically on [[parapsychology]], contacts with [[extraterrestrial life]], [[sexual love]] and other topics.

== Life ==

The son of Thomas Holroyd and Edith (King) Holroyd, Stuart Holroyd attended [[University College London]] (1957–58) &lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors 2004"/&gt; but left without completing his degree.&lt;ref name="Holroyd"&gt;{{cite book|title=''Flight and Pursuit''|author=Holroyd, Stuart|year=1959|location=London|publisher=Victor Gollancz Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published his first book, ''[[Emergence from Chaos]]'', in 1957 at the age of twenty-three. The same publisher, [[Victor Gollancz]], had recently published ''[[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|The Outsider]]'', the first book by Holroyd's friend [[Colin Wilson]].  Wilson and Holroyd, along with the novelist [[Bill Hopkins (novelist)|Bill Hopkins]], were associated with the literary movement known as the [[Angry Young Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kalliney| first = Peter| title = The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DlMUSz-hiuEC&amp;pg=PA44| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 0-19-516921-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, Holroyd, Wilson and Hopkins each contributed an essay to ''[[Declaration (anthology)|Declaration]]'' - an anthology of statements by writers and artists then labelled, rightly or wrongly, as [[Angry Young Men]] (the contributors included not only [[John Osborne]] and [[Kingsley Amis]] but [[Doris Lessing]] and the director [[Lindsay Anderson]]).&lt;ref name="Maschler"&gt;{{cite book|title=''Declaration''|author=Maschler, Tom (editor)|year=1957|location=London|publisher=MacGibbon and Kee}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 March 1958, Holroyd's play, ''The Tenth Chance'' was produced at the [[Royal Court Theatre]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95563.html|title=Angry young men (act. 1956–1958)|last=Ratcliffe|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; disturbances in the audience during the single performance, and a subsequent confrontation in a nearby public house involving [[Kenneth Tynan]], [[Christopher Logue]] and [[Colin Wilson]] were widely reported.&lt;ref&gt;"Sloane Square Stomp", ''Time'', Monday, 24 March 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emergence from Chaos'' was a literary/psychological study of several modern poets.  Holroyd's next book, ''Flight and Pursuit'' (1959) was an autobiographical examination of the author's search for "spiritual values".

In 1961, Holroyd married Susan Joy Bennett. (He was earlier married to Anne Elizabeth Freeman, they married in 1950 and divorced in 1958.) With the exception of a textbook on English literature (''The English Imagination''), Holroyd did not publish another book for sixteen years.  ''Contraries; A Personal Progression'', which appeared in 1975, was a memoir of the "angry" years of the late 1950s, containing portraits of [[Colin Wilson|Wilson]] and [[Bill Hopkins (novelist)|Hopkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Contraries: A Personal Progression''|author=Holroyd, Stuart|year=1975|location=London|publisher=The Bodley Head Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holroyd thereafter turned his attention to different subjects, writing a series of books on the [[paranormal]], [[parapsychology]], encounters with extraterrestrial life, [[gnosticism]] and the philosophy of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]]—work which he later described as "whoring" in the literary market place.&lt;ref&gt;''His Dear Time's Waste'', Pronoia, 2013: introduction,&lt;/ref&gt;

His most recent publication, ''His Dear Time's Waste'' (Pronoia Books, 2013) is described as "a 1950s literary and love life memoir," a re-issue of the amended text of ''Contraries'', with substantial additions derived from journals, correspondence and other early writings, together with reflections from a present point of view.

'''Talyn Rahman-Figueroa''' (''[[Name at birth|née]]'' '''Rahman'''; {{lang-bn|তালিন রহমান}}; born 8 May 1985) is a British diplomatic consultant and Executive Director and founder of [[Grassroot Diplomat]].&lt;ref name="efchr.mcgill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efchr.mcgill.ca/2013/eng/young.php|title=Young Leaders|publisher=McGill University|date=10 March 2012|accessdate=2014-09-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903130646/http://efchr.mcgill.ca/2013/eng/young.php|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}} Talyn Rahman-Figueroa, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, she completed an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Diplomatic Studies from the [[University of Westminster]]&lt;ref name="gatewayassociates"/&gt; with additional training at the United Nations and the [[European Union]]. She later gained a Diploma in Middle Eastern and North African Politics from [[Al Akhawayn University|Université Al-Akhawayn]] in Morocco&lt;ref name="gatewayassociates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thediplomaticinsight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thenextwomen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pitts|first=Beth|url=http://www.thenextwomen.com/2012/01/16/grassroot-diplomat-26-year-old-entrepreneur-desmond-tutu-kofi-annan-nick-clegg-her-networ|title=Grassroot Diplomat: The 26-Year Old Entrepreneur with Desmond Tutu, Kofi Annan &amp; Nick Clegg In Her Network|publisher=The Next Woman|date=16 January 2012|accessdate=2014-09-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903121047/http://www.thenextwomen.com/2012/01/16/grassroot-diplomat-26-year-old-entrepreneur-desmond-tutu-kofi-annan-nick-clegg-her-networ|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Human Rights Fellowship at [[McGill University]] in Canada.

After her studies, Rahman-Figueroa completed supplementary diplomatic training at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the European Union Commission,&lt;ref name="thediplomaticinsight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thenextwomen"/&gt; and the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in New York.&lt;ref name="expertfile"/&gt;

==Career==
Rahman-Figueroa spent two years completing her diplomatic training at various global governmental institutions, [[non-government organisation]]s (NGOs) and government departments.&lt;ref name="soas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/careers/casestudies/lc/talyn-rahman-figueroa.html|title=Talyn Rahman-Figueroa|publisher=SOAS, University of London|accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman-Figueroa joined the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF) to engage in issues of women's rights operated by the United Nations. As an active member, she was nominated on to the executive board where she influenced national campaigns and introduced initiatives to attract younger members. In the same year, she also joined Action for UN Renewal, an organisation that educates the public about the work of the UN, as an executive member updating the organisation's media campaign about the work of the United Nations. She spent much of her time engaging in issues, including women's rights, corporate social responsibility, nuclear disarmament, climate change, militarism, gender justice, and UN reform.&lt;ref name="gatewayassociates"/&gt; Rahman-Figueroa's work in relation to such issues have been published in foreign policy magazines, including ''[[American Diplomacy]]'', ''Diplomatic Insight'', ''Political Insight'' and many others.&lt;ref name="gatewayassociates"/&gt; Her work in these organisations plus many more led her to a career in diplomacy.&lt;ref name="peaceissexy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.peaceissexy.net/talyn-rahman-figueroa/|title=Talyn Rahman-Figueroa – Helping Governments and NGO's Communicate|publisher=Peace Is Sexy|accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman-Figueroa has participated and attended several international summits such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]] Conference, [[United Nations Climate Change conference]] and [[Global Humanitarian Forum]]&lt;ref name="thediplomaticinsight"/&gt; and used this opportunity to network with government officials who were already serving their country on the world stage.&lt;ref name="polemics"&gt;{{cite news|last=Athavale|first=Shruti|url=http://www.polemics-da.com/CareerandInterviews/Anewtypeofdiplomacy.aspx|title=A new type of diplomacy|publisher=Polemics|date=June 2012|accessdate=2014-09-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903120623/http://www.polemics-da.com/CareerandInterviews/Anewtypeofdiplomacy.aspx|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahman-Figueroa's work is active in projects based in Sudan, Nigeria, the Pacific Islands, India and Canada, and is in the process of developing a large public conference on "Women's Role in Diplomacy Revisited" for [[International Women's Day]] with a celebrity keynote speaker and an all female high-level panellist of ambassadors and grassroots activists.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho13"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karim|first1=Mohammed Abdul|last2=Karim|first2=Shahadoth|title=British Bangladeshi Who's Who|url=http://www.bbwhoswho.co.uk/images/Publication.pdf|date=October 2013|publisher=British Bangla Media Group|page=23|isbn= |accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is on the board of several NGOs and is a networker in the diplomatic and political sector.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho13"/&gt;

===Grassroot Diplomat===
Rahman-Figueroa has been described as changing the nature of diplomacy in building trust between civil society and political leaders.&lt;ref name="gatewayassociates"/&gt; In 2008, Rahman-Figueroa established [[Grassroot Diplomat]] as a not-for-profit.&lt;ref name="lead-her-ship"/&gt; In 2011, Grassroot Diplomat was launched as a diplomatic consultancy service for governments and civil society.&lt;ref name="standard"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/anthea-turner-model-of-diplomacy-8967091.html/|title=Anthea Turner Model of Diplomacy|location=London|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the first year, Rahman-Figueroa managed to capture 50 national and 39 international news from 14 different countries – all within her own capacity.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho13"/&gt; Her work and writing on the grassroot diplomacy concept has been covered by international media, including [[Al Jazeera]], [[BSkyB|Sky TV]], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Diplomat]]'', ''Diplomatic Courier'', ''The Muslim Times'' and ''Next Women Magazine''.&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho13"/&gt; Established in August 2011,&lt;ref name="thenextwomen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diplomaticsociety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomaticsociety.co.uk/society-news/meeting-talyn-rahman-figueroa-grassroot-diplomat/|title=Meeting with Talyn Rahman-Figueroa of Grassroot Diplomat|publisher=Diplomatic Society|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=2014-09-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903090926/http://diplomaticsociety.co.uk/society-news/meeting-talyn-rahman-figueroa-grassroot-diplomat/|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="royalholloway"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/politicsandir/news/newsarticles/dipsocmeetingwithtalynrahman-figueroa,directorofgrassrootdiplomat.aspx|title=DipSoc Meeting with Talyn Rahman-Figueroa, Director of Grassroot Diplomat|publisher=Royal Holloway|date=10 March 2012|accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassroot Diplomat has now managed policy-related projects in 10 countries worldwide.

As an unofficial diplomat, Grassroot Diplomat provides her with opportunities to step into the diplomatic realm and liaise with top officials that are otherwise out of public reach.&lt;ref name="peaceissexy"/&gt; Over the years,&lt;ref name="expertfile"/&gt; she has networked with diplomats, political officials and celebrities such as [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Bob Geldof]],&lt;ref name="thenextwomen"/&gt; former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]], Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] and former U.S governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] to advocate the necessity in closing the gap between governments and civil society. As an intermediary, she worked with Nobel Laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]] in clearing his name against the smear campaign led by the [[Government of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]]&lt;ref name="bbwhoswho13"/&gt; and worked with the Minister for Equalities [[Lynne Featherstone]] MP.&lt;ref name="gatewayassociates"/&gt;

In January 2013, Rahman-Figueroa hosted the inaugural Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Awards, an award that recognises politicians and diplomats representing civilian interests at the highest level.&lt;ref name="embassymagazine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.embassymagazine.com/corps/corps_news/emb45_corps2.html|title=Grassroot Diplomats Recognised|work=Embassy Magazine|accessdate=2014-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She passed on the role to television psychologist Dr [[Linda Papadopoulos]] to host the second awards in 2014.

==Personal life==
Rahman-Figueroa lives in London with her husband, Anthony Figueroa.&lt;ref name="thenextwomen"/&gt; She is also former student of the [[Shotokan]] Arts,&lt;ref name="smashwords"/&gt; [[Taekwondo]] and [[Krav Maga]]. She is an active participant of [[CrossFit]] and engages in daily [[high-intensity interval training]] known as Tabata.

In February 2013, Rahman-Figueroa's debut novel, ''Street Fighter: Dream Never Ends'', based on the fighting video-game ''[[Street Fighter]]'' was unofficially published.&lt;ref name="thenextwomen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smashwords"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/284267|title=Street Fighter: Dream Never Ends|publisher=Smashworlds|date=10 February 2013|accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodreads"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8098926.Talyn_Rahman_Figueroa|title= Talyn Rahman-Figueroa|publisher=[[Goodreads]]|accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yi Yuanji''' ({{zh|c=易元吉}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: '''I Yüan-chi''') (c. 1000, [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]]&lt;ref name=gov&gt;[http://tech2.npm.gov.tw/english/dm/painting/selection/info/mainA-05.htm I Yüan-chi]&lt;/ref&gt; – c. 1064)  was a [[Northern Song Dynasty]] painter, famous for his realistic paintings of animals. According to [[Robert van Gulik]], Yi Yuanji's paintings of [[gibbon]]s were particularly celebrated.&lt;ref name=gulik&gt;[[Robert van Gulik|Van Gulik, Robert Hans]] (1967), The gibbon in China: An essay in Chinese animal lore, E. J. Brill, Leiden, Holland. There is a brief summary at [http://www.gibbons.de/main/introduction/chapter_english08.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Geissmann, [http://www.gibbonconservation.org//07_journal/gibbon_journal_4.pdf Gibbon paintings in China, Japan, and Korea: Historical distribution, production rate and context"] . ''Gibbon Journal'', No. 4, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century critic  [[Guo Ruoxu]] (郭若虚) in his "Overview of Painting" (图画见闻志, ''Tuhua Jian Wen Zhi'') tells this about Yi's career:&lt;ref&gt;English translation by Van Gulik, in Van Gulik (1967), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guo Ruoxu's text is also in [http://www.esgweb.net/Article/Class138/Class161/Class165/200702/12045_5.htm this article] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|... His painting was excellent: flowers and birds, bees and [[cicada]]s he rendered life-like with subtle detail. At first he specialized in flower and fruit, but after he had seen such paintings by [[Zhao Chang]] (趙昌), he admitted their superiority with a sigh, and then resolved he would acquire fame by painting subjects not yet tried by the artists of old; thus he began to paint roebucks and gibbons.}}
He spent months roaming the mountains of southern [[Hubei]] and northern [[Hunan]], watching [[Roe Deer|roebuck]]s (獐鹿) and gibbons (猿狖) in their natural environment.&lt;ref name=gulik/&gt;

[[Image:Yi-Yuanji-Fan-painting-Two-gibbons.jpg|thumb|A gibbon picture on a fan by Yi Yuanji]]
In 1064, Yi Yuanji was invited to paint screens in the imperial palace. Once this job has been completed, the [[Emperor Yingzong of Song|Yingzong Emperor]], impressed, commissioned him to paint the "Picture of a Hundred Gibbons", but unfortunately the artist died after painting only a few gibbons.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;&lt;ref name=gulik/&gt; A few of his other gibbon paintings have survived, and [[Robert van Gulik]], quite familiar with the behavior of this ape, comments on how naturally they look in the pictures.&lt;ref name=gulik/&gt; His other work includes depictions of deer, peacocks, birds-and-flowers and fruits-and-vegetables; many of them are kept in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; The "Monkey and Cats" painting is especially charming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809434-3,00.html MASTERPIECES OF CHINESE ART], [[Time Magazine]], May 6, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gulik identifies the monkey as a [[macaque]].&lt;ref name=gulik/&gt; This painting was featured on a 2004 "Year of the Monkey" stamp from [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/philately/archive/review-04-2.html Feline Philately: Cats on stamps]&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of Yi Yuanji, with his intimate knowledge of nature, has attracted attention from modern Chinese painters.&lt;ref&gt;Painting by modern artist Fan Zeng (范曾) [http://auction.sc001.com.cn/detail_auction.asp?id=591600 "Yi Yuanji playing with a monkey (易元吉戏猴图)"], painting by the modern Chinese artist Fang Zeng (范曾)&lt;/ref&gt;
