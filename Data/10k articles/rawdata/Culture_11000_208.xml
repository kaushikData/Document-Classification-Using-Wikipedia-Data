'''African art''' describes the modern and historical paintings, sculptures, installations, and other visual culture from native or indigenous [[Africans]] and the African continent. The definition may also include the art of the native [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[African diaspora]]s, such as [[African American]], [[Caribbean]] and other American art. Despite this diversity, there are some unifying artistic themes when considering the totality of the [[visual culture]] from the continent of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzanne Blier]]: "Africa, Art, and History: An Introduction", ''A History of Art in Africa'', pp. 15–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Masquerade, metalwork, sculpture, architecture, fiber art, and dance are important art forms across Africa and may be included in the study of African art. The term "African art"  does not usually include the art of the [[North Africa]]n areas along the [[Mediterranean]] coast, as such areas had long been part of different traditions. For more than a millennium, the art of such areas had formed part of [[Islamic art]], although with many particular characteristics. The [[art of Ethiopia]], with a long [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Christian tradition]], is also different from that of most of Africa, where [[traditional African religion]] (with [[Islam]] in the north) was dominant until relatively recently.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/arts/artsspecial/how-african-artifacts-became-art-inspiring-modernists.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|author=Carol Kino|title=When Artifact 'Became' Art |publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; African art includes ancient art, Muslim art of North and West Africa, the Christian art of East Africa, and the ritualistic art of these and other regions.  Most [[African sculpture]] was historically in wood and other natural materials that have not survived from earlier than, at most, a few centuries ago; older pottery figures can be found from a number of areas.&lt;ref&gt;Breunig, P. 2014. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBn1BQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nok. African Sculpture in Archaeological Context.] Africa Magna Verlag, Frankfurt.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Traditional African masks|Masks]] are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized. There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among "groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the [[Niger]] and [[Congo river]]s" in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="Honour &amp; Fleming, 557"&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 557&lt;/ref&gt; Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for religious ceremonies; today many are made for tourists as "airport art".&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 559–561&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 19th century there has been an increasing amount of [[African art in Western collections]], the finest pieces of which are now prominently displayed.

African mask art has had an important influence on European [[Modernism|Modernist]] art,&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"&gt;Murrell, Denise. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aima/hd_aima.htm "African Influences in Modern Art"], ''[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'', April 2008. Retrieved on 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction.

West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs, like the famous [[Benin Bronzes]], to decorate palaces and for highly [[Realism (arts)|naturalistic]] royal heads from around the [[Edo people|Bini]] town of [[Benin Empire|Benin City, Edo State]], in terracotta as well as metal, from the 12th–14th centuries. [[Akan goldweights]] are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400–1900; some apparently represent [[proverb]]s, contributing a narrative element rare in African sculpture; and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 556–561&lt;/ref&gt;  Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The [[Mandé peoples|Mande]]-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces from wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.

East Africans are known for Tinga Tinga paintings and Makonde sculptures. There is also tradition of producing [[textile arts|textile art]], .&lt;ref name="Honour &amp; Fleming, 557"&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 557&lt;/ref&gt; The culture from [[Great Zimbabwe]] left more impressive buildings than sculpture, but the eight [[soapstone]] [[Zimbabwe Bird]]s appear to have had a special significance and were presumably mounted on [[monolith]]s. Modern [[Zimbabwe]]an sculptors in soapstone have achieved [[Sculpture of Zimbabwe|considerable international success]]. Southern Africa's oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600&amp;nbsp;AD and have cylindrical heads with a mixture of human and animal features.

* Artistic creativity or Expressive individualism: In Western African art in particular, there is a widespread emphasis on expressive individualism while simultaneously being influenced by the work of predecessors. An example would be Dan artistry as well as its presence in the Western African diaspora.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cool Pose: The Dilemma of Black Manhood in America|author1=Richard Majors|author2=Billson, J.M.|date=1993|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=9780671865726|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bD-PkgpWErUC|page=56|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Artist Himself in African Art Studies: Jan Vandenhoute's Investigation of the Dan Sculptor in Côte D'Ivoire|author1=Vangheluwe, S.|author2=Vandenhoute, J.|date=2001|publisher=Academia Press|isbn=9789038202860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnzNF43P9ZYC|page=19|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emphasis on the human figure: The human figure has always been the primary subject matter for most African art, and this emphasis even influenced certain European traditions.&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"/&gt; For example, in the fifteenth century Portugal traded with the Sapi culture near [[Ivory Coast]] in West Africa, who created elaborate ivory saltcellars that were hybrids of African and European designs, most notably in the addition of the human figure (the human figure typically did not appear in Portuguese saltcellars). The human figure may symbolize the living or the dead, may reference chiefs, dancers, or various trades such as drummers or hunters, or even may be an anthropomorphic representation of a god or have other votive function. Another common theme is the inter-morphosis of human and animal.
*Visual abstraction: African artworks tend to favor visual abstraction over naturalistic representation. This is because many African artworks generalize stylistic norms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzanne Blier]], "Africa, Art, and History: An Introduction", ''A History of Art in Africa'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptian art, also usually thought of as naturalistically depictive, makes use of highly abstracted and regimented visual canons, especially in painting, as well as the use of different colors to represent the qualities and characteristics of an individual being depicted.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Art in Africa'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emphasis on sculpture: African artists tend to favor three-dimensional artworks over two-dimensional works. Even many African paintings or cloth works were meant to be experienced three-dimensionally. House paintings are often seen as a continuous design wrapped around a house, forcing the viewer to walk around the work to experience it fully; while decorated cloths are worn as decorative or ceremonial garments, transforming the wearer into a living sculpture. Distinct from the static form of traditional Western sculpture African art displays animation, a readiness to move.&lt;ref&gt;O'Riley, Michael Kampen (2006).''Art Beyond the West'' (2nd ed.). New Jersey: Pearson Education. {{ISBN|0-13-175152-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Makonde elephant.jpg|thumb|Sculpture that represents an elephant; circa 1974; by [[Makonde people]]]]
*Emphasis on performance art: An extension of the utilitarianism and three-dimensionality of traditional African art is the fact that much of it is crafted for use in performance contexts, rather than in static ones. For example, [[traditional African masks]] and costumes very often are used in communal, ceremonial contexts, where they are "danced." Most societies in Africa have names for their masks, but this single name incorporates not only the sculpture, but also the meanings of the mask, the dance associated with it, and the spirits that reside within. In African thought, the three cannot be differentiated.
*Nonlinear scaling: Often a small part of an African design will look similar to a larger part, such as the diamonds at different scales in the Kasai pattern at right. Louis Senghor, Senegal's first president, referred to this as "dynamic symmetry." [[William Buller Fagg|William Fagg]], the British art historian, compared it to the logarithmic mapping of natural growth by biologist D'Arcy Thompson. More recently it has been described in terms of [[fractal]] geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Eglash, Ron: "African Fractals: Modern computing and indigenous design." Rutgers 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The study of African art until recently focused on the traditional art of certain well-known groups on the continent, with a particular emphasis on traditional sculpture, masks and other visual culture from non-Islamic West Africa,  Central Africa, and Southern Africa with a particular emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. Recently, however, there has been a movement among African art historians and other scholars to include the visual culture of other regions and time periods. The notion is that by including all African cultures and their visual culture over time in ''African art'', there will be a greater understanding of the continent's visual aesthetics across time. Finally, the arts of the people of the [[African diaspora]], in [[Brazil]], the [[Caribbean]] and the southeastern [[United States]], have also begun to be included in the study of African art.

African art takes many forms and is made from many different materials. Most African artworks are wood sculptures, probably because wood is a very widespread material. Jewellery is a popular art form and is used to indicate rank, affiliation with a group, or purely for aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://squinti.com/?page_id=648 |title=The Use of Haematite, Tiger's Eye Stone and Ebony Wood for African Jewelry |publisher=Squinti African Art |accessdate=2012-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119161224/http://squinti.com/?page_id=648 |archivedate=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; African jewelry is made from such diverse materials as Tiger's eye stone, haematite, sisal, coconut shell, beads and ebony wood. Sculptures can be wooden, ceramic or carved out of stone like the famous Shona sculptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://squinti.com/?page_id=728 |title=What is African Art |publisher=Squinti African Art |accessdate=2012-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119141134/http://squinti.com/?page_id=728 |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and decorated or sculpted pottery comes from many regions. Various forms of textiles are made including chitenge, mud cloth and [[kente]] cloth. Mosaics made of butterfly wings or colored sand are popular in west Africa.

==Traditional African religions==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
{{main|Traditional African religions}}
The [[Traditional African religions]] had been influential in African art. The very nature of African art stem from their themes of religious symbolism, functionalism and utilitarianism. In the various Traditional African beliefs, Africans draw from their artistic traditions as sources of inspiration. "These images have religio-metaphysical themes, which serve as the focal point of power, which links the African’s physical world to his beliefs on his essence and existence. Indeed the African art reflect images of ancestral spirits, and pantheons of indigenous gods and goddesses."&lt;ref&gt;Omatseye, B. O. J; Emeriewen, Kingsley Osevwiyo, ''An Appraisal of Religious Art and Symbolic Beliefs in the Traditional African Context (p. 529-544)'' [in] African Research Review, p. 529-30  [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d56c/e656c8bf5e5d418d40aa7dc17dc589fe2806.pdf] (International Association of African Researchers and Reviewers (IAARR)  [http://afrrevjo.net/])&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of African art lie long before recorded history. African rock art in the [[Sahara]] in [[Niger]] preserves 6000-year-old carvings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the153club.org/giraffe.html|title="New" Giraffe Engravings Found|publisher=The 153 Club|accessdate=2007-05-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070612211620/http://www.the153club.org/giraffe.html| archivedate= 12 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with sub-Saharan Africa, the western cultural arts, [[ancient Egypt]]ian paintings and artifacts, and indigenous southern crafts also contributed greatly to African art. Often depicting the abundance of surrounding nature, the art was often abstract interpretations of animals, plant life, or natural designs and shapes. The [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Kush]] in modern [[Sudan]] was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles that did not lead to the north. In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the [[Nok culture]] which thrived between 500&amp;nbsp;BC and 500&amp;nbsp;AD in modern [[Nigeria]], with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes.

More complex methods of producing art were developed in sub-Saharan Africa around the 10th century, some of the most notable advancements include the bronzework of [[Igbo Ukwu]] and the terracottas and metalworks of [[Ile Ife]] [[Bronze]] and [[brass]] castings, often ornamented with [[ivory]] and [[precious stone]]s, became highly prestigious in much of [[West Africa]], sometimes being limited to the work of court artisans and identified with [[Royal family|royalty]], as with the [[Benin Bronzes]].

==Influence on Western art==
{{Main|Proto-Cubism#African, Egyptian, Greek, Iberian &amp; Oceanic art}}
[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1907, Nu à la serviette, oil on canvas, 116 x 89 cm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]]; 1907; ''Nu à la serviette'', oil on canvas, 116 x 89 cm]]
During and after the 19th and 20th century colonial period, Westerners long characterized African art as "primitive."  The term carries with it negative connotations of underdevelopment and poverty. Colonization during the nineteenth century set up a Western understanding hinged on the belief that African art lacked technical ability due to its low socioeconomic status.

At the start of the twentieth century, art historians like [[Carl Einstein]], [[Michał Sobeski]] and [[Leo Frobenius]] published important works about the thematic, giving to African art the status of [[Work of art|aesthetic object]], not only of [[Cultural artifact|ethnographic object]].&lt;ref&gt;Strother, Z. S. (2011). À la recherche de l’Afrique dans ''Negerplastik'' de Carl Einstein. ''Gradhiva'', 14: 30–55. [http://journals.openedition.org/gradhiva/2130 link].&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, artists like [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Joseph Csaky]], and [[Amedeo Modigliani]] became aware of, and inspired by, African art, amongst other art forms.&lt;ref name="African Influences in Modern Art"/&gt; In a situation where the established [[avant-garde]] was straining against the constraints imposed by serving the world of appearances, African art demonstrated the power of supremely well-organized forms; produced not only by responding to the faculty of sight, but also and often primarily, the faculty of imagination, emotion and mystical and religious experience. These artists saw in African art a formal perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power. The study of and response to African art, by artists at the beginning of the twentieth century facilitated an explosion of interest in the abstraction, organisation and reorganisation of forms, and the exploration of emotional and psychological areas hitherto unseen in Western art. By these means, the status of visual art was changed. Art ceased to be merely and primarily [[aesthetic]], but became also a true medium for philosophic and intellectual discourse, and hence more truly and profoundly aesthetic than ever before.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Influence on Western architecture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
European architecture was strongly influenced by African art. Pioneers like [[Antonio Sant'Elia]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Erich Mendelsohn]] were also sculptors and painters. During the 1950s, European architects transformed buildings into big-scale sculptures, replacing unnecessary decoration (so criticized by [[Adolf Loos]]), by integrating textured murals and large bas-reliefs in walls. During the 1960s, African art influenced [[Brutalism]], both in language and symbolism, particularly in the late [[Le Corbusier]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]. The powerful work of [[John Lautner]] reminds of artifacts from the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]; the sensual projects of [[Patricio Pouchulu]] honour the bare wooden sculptures of the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]]. Unlike Europe, African art never established boundaries between body art, painting, sculpture and architecture; thanks to this, Western architects can now extend towards different art expressions.

==Traditional art==
[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|Head of a scepter; 19th century; by [[Yombe people]]]]
Traditional art describes the most popular and studied forms of African art which are typically found in museum collections.

Wooden [[mask]]s, which might either be of human, animal or mythical creatures, are one of the most commonly found forms of art in western Africa. In their original contexts, ceremonial masks are used for celebrations, initiations, crop harvesting, and war preparation. The masks are worn by a chosen or initiated dancer. During the mask ceremony the dancer goes into deep trance, and during this state of mind he  "communicates" with his ancestors. The masks can be worn in three different ways: vertically covering the face: as helmets, encasing the entire head, and as crest, resting upon the head, which was commonly covered by material as part of the disguise. African masks often represent a spirit and it is strongly believed that the spirit of the ancestors possesses the wearer. Most African masks are made with wood, and can be decorated with: [[Ivory]], animal hair, plant fibers (such as raffia), pigments (like [[kaolin]]), stones, and semi-precious [[Gemstone|gem]]s also are included in the masks.

Statues, usually of wood or ivory, are often inlaid with [[cowrie]] shells, metal studs and nails. Decorative clothing is also commonplace and comprises another large part of African art. Among the most complex of African textiles is the colorful, strip-woven [[Kente cloth]] of [[Ghana]]. Boldly patterned [[mudcloth]] is another well known technique.

==Contemporary African art==

{{Main|Contemporary African art}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chidongo.JPG|thumb|Wood sculpture attributed to [[Zimbabwe]]an artist [[Gideon Chidongo]], 4th quarter of 20th century.]] --&gt;
Africa is home to a thriving [[contemporary art]] fine art culture.  This has been understudied until recently, due to scholars' and art collectors' emphasis on traditional art. Notable modern artists include [[El Anatsui]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[William Kentridge]], [[Karel Nel]], [[Kendell Geers]], [[Yinka Shonibare]], [[Zerihun Yetmgeta]], Odhiambo Siangla, Elias Jengo, [[Olu Oguibe]], [[Lubaina Himid]], and [[Bili Bidjocka]], [[Henry Tayali]]. Art [[wikt:biennale|bienniale]]s are held in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], and [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. Many contemporary African artists are represented in museum collections, and their art may sell for high prices at art [[auction]]s. Despite this, many contemporary African artists tend to have a difficult time finding a market for their work. Many contemporary African arts borrow heavily from traditional predecessors. Ironically, this emphasis on abstraction is seen by Westerners as an imitation of European and American [[Cubism|Cubist]] and totemic artists, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Henri Matisse]], who, in the early twentieth century, were heavily influenced by traditional African art. This period was critical to the evolution of Western [[modernism]] in visual arts, symbolized by Picasso's breakthrough painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=John|title=A Life of Picasso: The Cubist Rebel, 1907–1916|year=2007|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-375-71150-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today [[Fathi Hassan]] is considered a major early representative of contemporary black African art. Contemporary African art was pioneered in the 1950s and 1960s in South Africa by artists like [[Irma Stern]], [[Cyril Fradan]], [[Walter Battiss]] and through galleries like the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg. More recently European galleries like the October Gallery in London and collectors such as [[Jean Pigozzi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Magnin|first=André|title=Arts of Africa: Jean Pigozzi's Contemporary Collection|year=2005|publisher=Skira|location=Milan|isbn=88-7624-296-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artur Walther]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Enwezor|first=Okwui|title=Events of the Self: Portraiture and Social Identity: Contemporary African Photography from the Walther Collection|year=2010|publisher=Steidl|location=Göttingen|isbn=978-3-86930-157-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Gianni Baiocchi in Rome have helped expand the interest in the subject. Numerous exhibitions at the Museum for African Art in New York and the African Pavilion at the 2007 [[Venice Biennale]], which showcased the Sindika Dokolo African Collection of Contemporary Art, have gone a long way to countering many of the myths and prejudices that haunt [[Contemporary African Art]]. The appointment of Nigerian [[Okwui Enwezor]] as artistic director of [[Documenta]] 11 and his African centred vision of art propelled the careers of countless African artists onto the international stage.

A wide range of more-or-less traditional forms of art, or adaptations of traditional style to contemporary taste are made for sale to tourists and others, including so-called "airport art". A number of vigorous popular traditions assimilate Western influences into African styles such as the elaborate [[fantasy coffin]]s in shapes such as airplanes, cars or animals of West African cities, and the banners of clubs.

=== Minimalist African Art ===
Another notable contemporary African artist is Amir Nour who is a Sudanese artist currently residing in Chicago. In the 1960s he created a metal sculpture called ''Grazing at Shendi (1969)'' which consists of geometric shapes that connect with his memory of his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sharjahart.org/sharjah-art-foundation/people/nour-amir|title=people

Akan art is an [[art]] form that originated among the [[Akan people]]. Akan art is known for vibrant artistic traditions, including textiles, sculpture, [[Akan goldweights]], as well as gold and silver [[jewelry]]. The Akan people are known for their strong connection between visual and verbal expressions and a distinctive blending of art and philosophy. Akan culture values [[gold]] above all other metals, so the artwork and jewelry made of gold reflects a great deal of value, whether it be made for appearance, artistic expression, or more practical trading purposes.

=====Nok=====
{{main|Nok culture}}
The Nok culture is an early [[Iron Age]] population whose material remains are named after the [[Ham people|Ham]] village of [[Nok]] in [[Kaduna State]] of [[Nigeria]], where their famous [[terracotta]] sculptures were first discovered in 1928. The Nok Culture appeared in [[northern Nigeria]] around 1500 BC&lt;ref name="PB 2014"&gt;Breunig, Peter. 2014. Nok: African Sculpture in Archaeological Context: p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, thus having lasted approximately 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="FB 1969"&gt;Fagg, Bernard. 1969. Recent work in west Africa: New light on the Nok culture. World Archaeology 1(1): 41–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of Nok terracotta sculptures remains unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is preserved in the form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is best known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from [[alluvium|alluvial mud]], in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, rolled, polished, and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued on the international art market. The terracotta figures are hollow, coil built, nearly life sized human heads and bodies that are depicted with highly stylized features, abundant [[jewellery|jewelry]], and varied postures.

Little is known of the original function of the pieces, but theories include ancestor portrayal, [[grave marker]]s, and [[amulet|charms]] to prevent crop failure, infertility, and illness. Also, based on the dome-shaped bases found on several figures, they could have been used as finials for the roofs of ancient structures. Margaret Young-Sanchez, Associate Curator of Art of the Americas, Africa, and Oceania in [[The Cleveland Museum of Art]], explains that most Nok ceramics were shaped by hand from coarse-grained clay and subtractively sculpted in a manner that suggests an influence from wood carving. After some drying, the sculptures were covered with slip and burnished to produce a smooth, glossy surface. The figures are hollow, with several openings to facilitate thorough drying and firing. The firing process most likely resembled that used today in Nigeria, in which the pieces are covered with grass, twigs, and leaves and burned for several hours.

As a result of natural erosion and deposition, Nok terracottas were scattered at various depths throughout the Sahel grasslands, causing difficulty in the dating and classification of the mysterious artifacts. Luckily, two archaeological sites, [[Samun Dukiya]] and [[Taruga]], were found containing Nok art that had remained unmoved. [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] and [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermo-luminescence]] tests narrowed the sculptures’ age down to between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago, making them some of the oldest in Western Africa. Many further dates were retrieved in the course of new archaeological excavations, extending the beginnings of the Nok tradition even further back in time.&lt;ref name="BP 2014"&gt;Breunig, P. (2014). [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBn1BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=african+sculpture+in+archaeological&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAGoVChMI7e7Hzo3gyAIVCYgsCh3AMAtG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Nok. African Sculpture in Archaeological Context. Frankfurt: Africa Magna.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the similarities between the two sites, archaeologist [[Graham Connah]] believes that "Nok artwork represents a style that was adopted by a range of iron-using farming societies of varying cultures, rather than being the diagnostic feature of a particular human group as has often been claimed."

Benin art is the [[art]] from the [[Kingdom of Benin]] or [[Edo Empire]] (1440&amp;ndash;1897), a pre-colonial African state located in what is now known as the South-South region of [[Nigeria]]. The Benin Bronzes are a group of more than a thousand metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the [[Kingdom of Benin]] in what is now modern-day [[Nigeria]].{{efn|The exact number of pieces is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dohlvik |first=Charlotta |title=Museums and Their Voices: A Contemporary Study of the Benin Bronzes |url=http://www.museion.gu.se/digitalAssets/805/805960_Dissertation_Charlotta_Dohlvik.pdf |date=May 2006 |publisher=International Museum Studies |p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources speak of a thousand pieces or several thousand pieces.

The primary ethnic groups in Mali are the Bambara (also known as Bamana) and the Dogon. Smaller ethnic groups consist of the Marka, and the Bozo fisherman of the Niger River. Ancient civilizations flourished in areas like Djene and Timbuktu, where a great variety of ancient bronze and terra-cotta figures have been unearthed.

===== Djenné-Djenno =====
{{main|Djenné-Djenno#Terra-cotta figurines from the Inner Niger Delta region}}

=====Bambara=====
[[File:Chiwara Chicago sculpture.jpg|thumb|Two Bambara [[Chiwara]] c. late 19th early 20th centuries, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. Female (left) and male Vertical styles]]

The [[Bambara people]] ({{lang-bm|Bamanankaw}}) adapted many artistic traditions and began to create display pieces. Before money was the main drive of creation of their artworks they used their abilities solely as a sacred craft for display of spiritual pride, religious beliefs and display of customs. Example artworks include the Bamana [[n'tomo mask]]. Other statues were created for people such as hunters and farmers so others could leave offerings after long farming seasons or group hunts. The stylistic variations in Bambara art are extreme sculptures, masks and headdresses display either stylized or realistic features, and either weathered or encrusted patinas. Until quite recently, the function of Bambara pieces was shrouded in mystery, but in the last twenty years field studies have revealed that certain types of figures and headdresses were associated with a number of the societies that structure Bambara life. During the 1970s a group of approximately twenty figures, masks and TjiWara headdresses belonging to the so-called 'Segou style' were identified. The style is distinct and recognizable by its typical flat faces, arrow-shaped noses, all-over body triangular scarifications and, on the figures, splayed hands.

;Masks
There are three major and one minor type of Bambara [[mask]]. The first type, used by the N'tomo society, has a typical comb-like structure above the face, is worn during dances and may be covered with cowrie shells. The second type of mask, associated with the Komo society, has a spherical head with two antelope horns on the top and an enlarged, flattened mouth. They are used during dances, but some have a thick encrusted patina acquired during other ceremonies in which libations are poured over them.

The third type has connections with the Nama society and is carved in the form of an articulated bird's head, while the fourth, minor type, represents a stylized animal head and is used by the Kore society. Other Bambara masks are known to exist, but unlike those described above, they cannot be linked to specific societies or ceremonies. Bambara carvers have established a reputation for the zoomorphic headdresses worn by Tji-Wara society members. Although they are all different, they all display a highly abstract body, often incorporating a zig-zag motif, which represents the sun's course from east to west, and a head with two large horns. Bambara members of the Tji-Wara society wear the headdress while dancing in their fields at sowing time, hoping to increase the crop yield.

;Statuettes
Bambara [[statuette]]s are primarily used during the annual ceremonies of the Guan society. During these ceremonies, a group of up to seven figures, measuring from 80 to 130&amp;nbsp;cm in height, are removed from their sanctuaries by the elder members of the society. The sculptures are washed, re-oiled and sacrifices are offered to them at their shrines. These figures – some of which date from between the 14th and 16th centuries – usually display a typical crested coiffure, often adorned with a talisman.

Two of these figures were ascribed great significance: a seated or standing maternity figure called Guandousou – known in the West as 'Bambara Queen' – and a male figure called Guantigui, who usually appears holding a knife. The two figures were surrounded by Guannyeni attendant figures standing or seated in various positions, holding a vessel, or a musical instrument, or their breasts. During the 1970s, numerous fakes from Bamako which were based on these sculptures entered the market. They were produced in Bamako.

Other Bambara figures, called Dyonyeni, are thought to be associated with either the southern Dyo society or the Kwore society. These female or hermaphrodite figures usually appear with geometric features such as large conical breasts and measure between 40 and 85&amp;nbsp;cm in height. The blacksmith members of the Dyo society used them during dances to celebrate the end of their initiation ceremonies. They were handled, held by dancers and placed in the middle of the ceremonial circle.

Among the corpus of Bambara figures, Boh sculptures are perhaps the best known. These statues represent a highly stylized animal or human figure, and are made of wood which is repeatedly covered in thick layers of earth impregnated with sacrificial materials such as millet, chicken or goat blood, kola nuts and alcoholic drinks. They were employed by the Kono and the Komo societies and served as receptacles for spiritual forces, and could in turn be used for apotropaic purposes.

Each special creative trait a person obtained was seen as a different way to please higher spirits.

=====Dogon=====
[[Dogon people|Dogon]] art is primarily sculpture. Dogon art revolves around religious values, ideals, and freedoms (Laude, 19). Dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly, and are commonly hidden from the public eye within the houses of families, sanctuaries, or kept with the [[Hogon]] (Laude, 20). The importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made.

Themes found throughout Dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms, superimposed bearded figures, horsemen, stools with caryatids, women with children, figures covering their faces, women grinding pearl millet, women bearing vessels on their heads, donkeys bearing cups, musicians, dogs, quadruped-shaped troughs or benches, figures bending from the waist, mirror-images, aproned figures, and standing figures (Laude, 46–52). Signs of other contacts and origins are evident in Dogon art. The Dogon people were not the first inhabitants of the cliffs of Bandiagara. Influence from Tellem art is evident in Dogon art because of its rectilinear designs (Laude, 24).

Dogon art is extremely versatile, although common stylistic characteristics – such as a tendency towards stylization – are apparent on the statues. Their art deals with the myths whose complex ensemble regulates the life of the individual. The sculptures are preserved in innumerable sites of worship, personal or family altars, altars for rain, altars to protect hunters, in market. As a general characterization of Dogon statues, one could say that they render the human body in a simplified way, reducing it to its essentials. Some are extremely elongated with emphasis on geometric forms. The subjective impression is one of immobility with a mysterious sense of a solemn gravity and serene majesty, although conveying at the same time a latent movement. Dogon sculpture recreates the hermaphroditic silhouettes of the Tellem, featuring raised arms and a thick patina made of blood and millet beer. The four Nommo couples, the mythical ancestors born of the god Amma, ornament stools, pillars or men's meeting houses, door locks, and granary doors. The primordial couple is represented sitting on a stool, the base of which depicts the earth while the upper surface represents the sky; the two are interconnected by the Nommo. The seated female figures, their hands on their abdomen, are linked to the fertility cult, incarnating the first ancestor who died in childbirth, and are the object of offerings of food and sacrifices by women who are expecting a child.

Kneeling statues of protective spirits are placed at the head of the dead to absorb their spiritual strength and to be their intermediaries with the world of the dead, into which they accompany the deceased before once again being placed on the shrines of the ancestors. Horsemen are remainders of the fact that, according to myth, the horse was the first animal present on earth. The Dogon style has evolved into a kind of cubism: ovoid head, squared shoulders, tapered extremities, pointed breasts, forearms, and thighs on a parallel plane, hairdos stylized by three or four incised lines. Dogon sculptures serve as a physical medium in initiations and as an explanation of the world. They serve to transmit an understanding to the initiated, who will decipher the statue according to the level of their knowledge. Carved animal figures, such as dogs and ostriches, are placed on village foundation altars to commemorate sacrificed animals, while granary doors, stools and house posts are also adorned with figures and symbols.

There are nearly eighty styles of masks, but their basic characteristic is great boldness in the use of geometric shapes, independent of the various animals they are supposed to represent. The structure of a large number of masks is based on the interplay of vertical and horizontal lines and shapes. Another large group has triangular, conic shapes. All masks have large geometric eyes and stylized features. The masks are often polychrome, but on many the color is lost; after the ceremonies they were left on the ground and quickly deteriorated because of termites and other conditions. The Dogon continue an ancient masquerading tradition, which commemorates the origin of death. According to their myths, death came into the world as a result of primeval man's transgressions against the divine order. Dama memorial ceremonies are held to accompany the dead into the ancestral realm and restore order to the universe. The performance of masqueraders – sometimes as many as 400 – at these ceremonies is considered absolutely necessary. In the case of the dama, the timing, types of masks involved, and other ritual elements are often specific to one or two villages and may not resemble those seen in locations only several kilometres distant. The masks also appear during baga-bundo rites performed by small numbers of masqueraders before the burial of a male Dogon. Dogon masks evoke the form of animals associated with their mythology, yet their significance is only understood by the highest ranking cult members whose role is to explain the meaning of each mask to a captivated audience.

Burkina Faso is a small, landlocked country north of Ghana and south of Mali and Niger. Economically, it is one of the four or five poorest countries in the world. Culturally, it is extremely rich. In part this is because so few people from Burkina have become Muslim or Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Christopher D. [http://africa.uima.uiowa.edu/topic-essays/show/37 "The Art of Burkina Faso"], Art &amp; Life in Africa, University of Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ancient artistic traditions for which Africa is so well known have been preserved in Burkina Faso because so many people continue to honor the ancestral spirits, and the spirits of nature. In great part they honor the spirits through the use of masks and carved figures. Many of the countries to the north of Burkina Faso had become predominantly Muslim, while many of the countries to the south of Burkina Faso are heavily Christian. In contrast many of the people of Burkina Faso continue to offer prayers and sacrifices to the spirits of nature and to the spirits of their ancestors. The result is that they continue to use the sorts of art that we see in museums in Europe and America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Roy, Christopher D. ''Art of the Upper Volta Rivers'', 1987, Paris: Chaffin.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the principal obstacles to understanding the art of Burkina Faso, including that of the Bwa, &amp;nbsp;has been a confusion between the styles of the Bwa, "gurunsi", and Mossi, &amp;nbsp;and a confusion of the Bwa people &amp;nbsp;with their neighbors to the west the Bobo people. &amp;nbsp;This confusion was the result of the use by French colonial officers of Jula &amp;nbsp;interpreters at the turn of the century. &amp;nbsp;these interpreters considered the two peoples to be the same and so referred to the Bobo as "Bobo-Fing" and to the Bwa as "Bobo-Oule." &amp;nbsp; In fact these two peoples are not related at all. Their languages are quite different, their social systems are quite different, &amp;nbsp;and certainly their art is quite different.&amp;nbsp;In terms of artistic styles the confusion stems from the fact that the Bwa, "gurunsi'" and Mossi &amp;nbsp;make masks that are covered with red white and black geometric graphic patterns. &amp;nbsp;This is simply the style of the Voltaic or Gur peoples, &amp;nbsp;and also includes the Dogon and other peoples who speak Voltaic languages.&lt;ref name="uiowa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |title=Art &amp;amp; Life in Africa – The University of Iowa Museum of Art |publisher=uiowa.edu |accessdate=2014-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630060732/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fang people]] make masks and basketry, carvings, and sculptures. Fang art is characterized by organized clarity and distinct lines and shapes. Bieri, boxes to hold the remains of ancestors, are carved with protective figures. Masks are worn in ceremonies and for hunting. The faces are painted white with black features. Myene art centers around Myene rituals for death. Female ancestors are represented by white painted masks worn by the male relatives. The Bekota use brass and copper to cover their carvings. They use baskets to hold ancestral remains. Tourism is rare in Gabon, and unlike in other African countries, art is not spurred on by commerce.

====Ivory Coast====
{{Main|Culture of Ivory Coast}}
[[File:Child-soldier-afrika.jpg|thumb|''[[military use of children|Childsoldier]] in the Ivory Coast'', [[Gilbert G. Groud]], 2007, mixed materials: tusche and wax crayon ]]
The [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]], the [[Senoufo]] and the [[Dan people|Dan]] peoples are skilled at carving wood and each culture produces wooden masks in wide variety. The Ivorian people use masks to represent animals in [[caricature]] to depict deities, or to represent the souls of the departed.

As the masks are held to be of great spiritual power, it is considered a taboo for anyone other than specially trained persons or chosen ones to wear or possess certain masks. These ceremonial masks are each thought to have a soul, or life force, and wearing these masks is thought to transform the wearer into the entity the mask represents.

[[Ivory Coast]] also has modern painters and illustrators. [[Gilbert G. Groud]] criticizes the ancient beliefs in [[black magic]], as held with the spiritual masks mentioned above, in his illustrated book ''[[Magie Noire]]''.

{{See also|Culture of Kenya}}
[[File:Ataa Oko and Kudjo Affutu with Oko's red coq coffin 2009. Foto Regula Tschumi.JPG|thumb|left|A modern [[fantasy coffin]] in the shape of a red rooster (cock), Ghana]]
Kenyan art has changed much in the post colonial years. Painters emerged in the 1950s after training in [[Makerere University College]]; they include such artists as [[Elimo Njau Elizabeth Karuga]] and Asaph Ngethe Macua. The 1970s saw the self-taught African painters mostly inspired by the demand for original African paintings. These include the Ancient Soi, and Moses Gichuiri. [[Kenyatta University]] also produced artists but more so taught in western art styles of painting. Among these include John Dianga and Moses Gichuiri. Others include the late Dr. Sylvester Maina, Stephen Mayienga and others.
The 1980s produced many contemporary artists. From Teachers Training colleges came Stephen Mbatia, Rix Butama, Shake Makelele, and Meube to name but a few. From the University of Nairobi School of Fine Art and Design came the following artists: Bulinya Martins and Sarah Shiundu. The two by virtue of having learned many basic techniques in design are highly innovative both in style, use of color and execution. Unlike most contemporary Kenyan artist they paint using oils, acrylics and watercolors and/or combination.
Pure abstract art is rare in Kenya. Most artists paint semi-abstract with distorted human figures. The initial paintings by Bulinya Martins were a combination of cubism and original African abstractions. The late Mainga's abstractions were 2D and highly embellished on leather. As for material, the use of Acrylics and oil is more frequent than watercolors. Oil paint is by far the preferred medium today and it lasts much longer.
The art items in Kenya include sisal baskets, elephant hair bracelets, Maasai bead jewelry, musical instruments, silver and gold jewelry, soapstone sculptures, wooden carvings, tribal masks, Maasai figurines, paintings, prints and sculptures. These art items are available in the arts and craft markets and shops throughout the main tourist centers of Kenya.

Cloth in Kenya also represents interesting art, with batik cloth, kangas (women's wraparound skirts) with patterns and even Kenyan proverbs printed on them and kikois (type of sarong for men) that come in many different colors and textiles. Kenya offers African jewelry containing cowry shells, and soapstone carvings from Western Kenya, carved by the [[Gusii people|Gusii]] and [[Abagusii]] ethnic groups in [[Kisii District|Kisii]] stone.

The [[Indiana University Art Museum|Eskenazi Museum of Art at Indiana University]] has a large collection of traditional art objects from Kenya including jewelry, containers, weapons, walking sticks, headrests, stools, utensils, and other objects available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~iuam/kenya/ |title=Indiana University Art Museum Arts of Kenya Online Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethiopia====
{{main|Ethiopian art}}
[[File:Display of Procesional Crosses, Church of Bet Maryam, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3230772118).jpg|thumb|[[Bet Maryam]] church, [[Lalibela]]. Traditional Ethiopian church art]]
Ethiopian art from the 4th century until the 20th can be divided into two broad groupings. First comes a distinctive tradition of [[Christianity|Christian]] art, mostly for churches, in forms including [[painting]], [[Ethiopian cross|crosses]], [[icons]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], and other metalwork such as crowns.  Secondly there are popular arts and crafts such as textiles, [[basketry]] and [[jewellery]], in which Ethiopian traditions are closer to those of other peoples in the region. [[History of Ethiopia|Its history]] goes back almost three thousand years to the kingdom of [[D'mt]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has been the predominant religion in Ethiopia for over 1500 years, for most of this period in a very close relation, or union, with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]] of [[Egypt]], so that [[Coptic art]] has been the main formative influence on Ethiopian church art.

[[File:Lalibela Bet Maryam 1 (28397479782).jpg|thumb|The rock-hewn Church of Bet Maryam in Lalibela.]]
Prehistoric [[rock art]] comparable to that of other African sites survives in a number of places, and until the arrival of Christianity stone [[stela]]e, often carved with simple reliefs, were erected as grave-markers and for other purposes in many regions; [[Tiya]] is one important site. The "pre-Axumite" [[Iron Age]] culture of about the 5th century BCE to the 1st century CE was influenced by the [[Kingdom of Kush]] to the north, and settlers from [[Arabia]], and produced cities with simple temples in stone, such as the ruined one at [[Yeha]], which is impressive for its date in the 4th or 5th century BCE.

The powerful [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in the 1st century BCE and dominated Ethiopia until the 10th century, having become very largely Christian from the 4th century.&lt;ref name="Biasio"&gt;Biasio&lt;/ref&gt; Although some buildings and large, pre-Christian [[Stele|stelae]] exist, there appears to be no surviving Ethiopian Christian art from the Axumite period. However the earliest works remaining show a clear continuity with Coptic art of earlier periods. There was considerable destruction of churches and their contents in the 16th century when the country was invaded by Muslim neighbours. The revival of art after this was influenced by Catholic European art in both iconography and elements of style, but retained its Ethiopian character. In the 20th century, Western artists and architects began to be commissioned by the government, and to train local students, and more fully Westernized art was produced alongside continuations of traditional church art.&lt;ref name="Biasio"/&gt;

Church paintings in Ethiopia were likely produced as far back as the [[Christianity in Ethiopia|introduction of Christianity]] in the 4th century AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://smarthistory.org/christian-ethiopian-art/|title=Christian Ethiopian art|date=2016-12-22|work=Smarthistory|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the earliest surviving examples come from the church of Debre Selam Mikael in the [[Tigray Region]], dated to the 11th century AD.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"&gt;{{citation|first=Dawit|last=Teferi|editor-first=Philip|editor-last=Briggs|title=Ethiopia|chapter=A Short History of Ethiopian Church Art|year=2015|orig-year=1995|location=Chalfont St Peter|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-922-3|page=242|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ|postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 7th-century AD followers of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] who fled to [[Axum]] in temporary exile mentioned that the original [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] was decorated with paintings.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"/&gt; Other early paintings include those from the [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches of [[Lalibela]], dated to the 12th century AD, and in nearby Geneta Maryam, dated to the 13th century AD.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"/&gt; However, paintings in [[illuminated manuscript]]s predate the earliest surviving church paintings; for instance, the Ethiopian [[Garima Gospels]] of the 4th–6th centuries AD contain [[Christian art|illuminated scenes]] imitating the contemporary [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=De Lorenzi|first=James|title=Guardians of the Tradition: Historians and Historical Writing in Ethiopia and Eritrea|location=Rochester|publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1-58046-519-9|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1WECgAAQBAJ| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopian painting, on walls, in books, and in [[icon]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ethiopian-icons-catalogue-of-the-collection-of-the-institute-of-ethiopian-studies-addis-ababa-university/oclc/848786240&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Ethiopian icons: catalogue of the collection of the Institute of Ethiopian studies, Addis Ababa university|last5=Chojnacki|first5=Stanley|publisher=Skira|year=2000|isbn=8881186462|location=Milano|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; is highly distinctive, though the style and [[iconography]] are closely related to the simplified Coptic version of Late Antique and Byzantine Christian art. From the 16th century, [[Roman Catholic church art]] and European art in general began to exert some influence. However, Ethiopian art is highly conservative and retained much of its distinct character until modern times. The production of [[illuminated manuscripts]] for use continued up to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Ross&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important form of Ethiopian art, also related to Coptic styles, are crosses made from wood and metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ethiopian-crosses-a-cultural-history-and-chronology/oclc/838853616|title=Ethiopian crosses: a cultural history and chronology|last=Chojnacki|first=Stanisław|last2=Gossage|first2=Carolyn|date=2006|publisher=Skira|isbn=8876248315|location=Milan|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Evangelatou. 2017. ''A Contextual Reading of Ethiopian Crosses Through Form and Ritual Kaleidoscopes of Meaning''. (Gorgias Eastern Christian Studies.) St. Gorgias Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually [[copper alloy]] or [[brass]], plated (at least originally) with gold or silver. The heads are typically flat [[casting|cast]] plates with elaborate and complex [[openwork]] decoration. The cross motif emerges from the decoration, with the whole design often forming a rotated square or circular shape, though the designs are highly varied and inventive. Many incorporate curved motifs rising from the base, which are called the "arms of [[Adam]]". Except in recent Western-influenced examples, they usually have no ''corpus'', or figure of Christ, and the design often incorporates numerous smaller crosses.  Engraved figurative imagery has sometimes been added.  Crosses are mostly either [[processional cross]]es, with the metal head mounted on a long wooden staff, carried in religious processions and during the [[liturgy]], or hand crosses, with a shorter metal handle in the same casting as the head. Smaller crosses worn as jewellery are also common.

Ethiopia has great ethnic and linguistic diversity, and styles in secular traditional crafts vary greatly in different parts of the country. There are a range of traditions in textiles, many with woven geometric decoration, although many types are also usually plain. Ethiopian church practices make a great deal of use of colourful textiles, and the more elaborate types are widely used as church vestments and as hangings, curtains and wrappings in churches, although they have now largely been supplanted by Western fabrics. Examples of both types can be seen in the picture at the top of the article.  Icons may normally be veiled with a semi-transparent or opaque cloth; very thin [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]]-type cotton cloth is a speciality of Ethiopia, though usually with no pattern.

Colourful basketry with a coiled construction is common in rural Ethiopia. The products have many uses, such as storing grains, seeds and food and being used as tables and bowls. The Muslim city of [[Harar]] is well known for its high quality basketry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopian Handicraft|url=http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|accessdate=22 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701023243/http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|archivedate=1 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many craft products of the Muslim minority relate to wider Islamic decorative traditions.

[[File:Modern Makonde carving in ebony.jpg|thumb|Modern [[Makonde people|Makonde]] carving in [[ebony]]]]
Tinga Tinga art has roots in decorating hut walls in central and south Tanzania. It was first in 1968 when Edward Said Tingatinga started to paint on wooden sheets with enamel colours when Tinga Tinga art became known. The art of the [[Makonde people|Makonde]] must be subdivided into different areas. The Makonde are known as master carvers throughout East Africa, and their statuary that can be found being sold in tourist markets and in museums alike. They traditionally carve household objects, figures and masks. Since the 1950s years the socalled Modern Makonde Art has been developed. An essential step was the turning to abstract figures, mostly spirits (Shetani) that play a special role. Makonde are also part of the important contemporary artists of Africa today. An outstanding position is taken by George Lilanga.

The [[Kuba Kingdom]] (also rendered as the Kingdom of the Bakuba, [[Songora]] or Bushongo) was a [[List of kingdoms in pre-colonial Africa|pre-colonial kingdom]] in [[Central Africa]]. The Kuba Kingdom [[Floruit|flourished]] between the 17th and 19th centuries in the region bordered by the [[Sankuru River|Sankuru]], [[Lulua River|Lulua]], and [[Kasai River|Kasai rivers]] in the south-east of the modern-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. A great deal of the art was created for the courts of chiefs and kings and was profusely decorated, incorporating [[cowrie shells]] and animal skins (especially leopard) as symbols of wealth, prestige and power. Masks are also important to the Kuba. They are used both in the rituals of the court and in the initiation of boys into adulthood, as well as at funerals.

The [[Kingdom of Luba]] or Luba Empire (1585&amp;ndash;1889) was a pre-colonial Central African state that arose in the marshy grasslands of the [[Upemba Depression]] in what is now southern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Today, the [[Luba people]] or baLuba are an ethno-linguistic group indigenous to the south-central region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name="Gates2010p14"&gt;{{cite book|author= Elizabeth Heath| editor1=Anthony Appiah|editor2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|pages=88–89, 14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of them live in this country, residing mainly in its [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], [[Kasai region|Kasai]], and [[Maniema]] provinces.

As in the [[Kuba Kingdom]], the Luba Kingdom held the arts in high esteem. A carver held relatively high status, which was displayed by an [[adze]] (axe) that he carried over his shoulder. Luba art was not very uniform because of the vast territory which the kingdom controlled.  However, some characteristics are common.  The important role of woman in the creation myths and political society resulted in many objects of prestige being decorated with female figures.

=====Sao=====
{{main|Sao civilization}}
The Sao civilisation flourished in [[Middle Africa]] from circa the sixth century BC to as late as the sixteenth century AD, and lived by the [[Chari River]] around [[Lake Chad]] in territory that later became part of [[Cameroon]] and [[Chad]]. Their most important artworks are the terraotta figurines. These figurines represent humans and animals. Other kinds of artifacts show that the Saos were skilled workers in [[bronze]], [[copper]], and [[iron]].&lt;ref name="Fanso 19"&gt;Fanso 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Botswana====

{{See also|Culture of Botswana}}
In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of [[Etsha]] and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting [[basket]]s from [[Mokola Palm]] and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through color use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.

The oldest evidence ancient paintings from both Botswana and [[South Africa]]. Depictions of hunting, both animal and human figures were made by the [[San people]] dating before civilization over 20,000 years old within the [[Kalahari]] desert.

Kingdom of Mapungubwe (1075–1220) was a pre-colonial state in Southern Africa located at the confluence of the [[Shashe River|Shashe]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers, south of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. The most famous Mapungubwe artwork is a tiny golden rhino, known as the [[Golden Rhinoceros of Mapungubwe|golden rhinoceros of Mapungubwe]]. In other graves from Mapengubwe were found objects made of iron, gold, copper, ceramic and glass beads.

====Egypt====
{{Main|Art of Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian architecture|Contemporary art in Egypt}}
{{See also|Culture of Egypt|Egyptian influence in architecture and visual arts}}
Persisting for 3,000 years and thirty dynasties, the "official" [[art of Ancient Egypt]] was centred on the state religion of the time. The art ranged from stone carvings of both massive statues and small statuettes, to wall art that depicted both history and mythology. In [[26th century BC|2600&amp;nbsp;BC]] the maturity of Egyptian carving reached a peak it did not reach again for another 1,500 years during the reign of [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]].

A lot of the art possesses a certain stiffness, with figures poised upright and rigid in a regal fashion. Bodily proportions also appear to be mathematically derived, giving rise to a sense of fantastic perfection in the figures depicted. This most likely was used to reinforce the godliness of the ruling caste.

&lt;gallery widths="200px" heights="200px"&gt;

The Narmer palette is the quintessential statement of the Egyptians' mythology of kingship. A clear manifesto of royal power, it is also one with multiple layers of symbolism

Perhaps the most iconic image of a woman from the ancient world, the bust of [[Nefertiti]] is difficult to contextualize because it seems so exceptional

The mummy mask of [[Tutankhamun]] is perhaps the most iconic object to suvive from ancient Egypt

'''Aloysius Xingu Leng Pendergast'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mlw4CgAAQBAJ Dark Detectives: An Anthology of Supernatural Mysteries. Stephen Jone (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional character appearing in novels by [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]].  He first appeared as a supporting character in their first novel, ''[[Relic (novel)|Relic]]'', and in its sequel ''[[Reliquary (novel)|Reliquary]]'', before assuming the [[protagonist]] role in ''[[The Cabinet of Curiosities]]''.

Pendergast is a [[special agent]] with the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).  He works out of the New Orleans, Louisiana branch of the FBI, but frequently travels out of state to investigate cases which interest him, often those appearing to be the work of [[serial killer]]s.

== Background ==
Aloysius Xingu Leng Pendergast was born in the early winter of 1960 and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Pendergast retains his Southern manners and mellifluous [[Southern American English|Deep Southern accent]]. He studied [[Anthropology]] at [[Harvard University]] (graduating [[Latin honors|''summa cum laude'']]) and received a dual Doctor of Philosophy degree in [[Classics]] and Philosophy from Baliol College, part of [[Oxford University]] in England .

Pendergast once served with the [[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Special Forces]] in the elite "Ghost Company", a spiritual successor to the "Blue Light" detachment (now Delta Force) with Michael Decker and Howard Longstreet, his superiors at the FBI, and Proctor, his bodyguard and chauffeur. The symbol for this company was "a ghost on a blue field, decorated with a star throwing a thunderbolt at a cat's eye with the number nine as its pupil, symbolizing the nine lives [its] members [...] were alleged to have..." The motto was "Fidelitas usque ad mortem" (Loyalty unto death). Most of his military records are classified and unknown.

A number of years before the series began, Pendergast was married to Helen Esterhazy Pendergast. She was presumed killed in a hunting accident while in Africa (mauled by a lion), but reappears in the so-called Helen Trilogy.

Pendergast is generally described as being stoically aloof and eccentric, though his ineffable politeness and unerring intellect imbue him with an irresistible charm or enigmatic sense of danger if the occasion should call for it. [[Polymath|Well-learned in many subjects]], he converses easily with doctors, scientists, intellectuals, vagabonds, highly specialized masters of specific disciplines, and people of a wide variety of language and culture alike. He is a master of [[psychological manipulation]], disguise, and improvisation.

Pendergast appreciates the finer things in life, including expensive cuisine and wines. Food and drink he enjoys include [[Château Pétrus]] wine, antipasto, [[green tea]] of only the purest and most spiritual kind, gelato, and [[steak tartare]]. He has a great distaste for [[opera]]. His interests encompass a wide variety of vastly differing walks of life, yet all focus on the enlightenment of the human mind, body, and soul. He spent a year in Tibet studying the deep meditative art of Chongg Ran, taught to him by the monks of the Gsalrig Chongg monastery.

Pendergast is [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], demonstrating mastery of [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Cantonese]], and appears semi-fluent in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. He also has some knowledge of Japanese.

== Appearance ==
Pendergast is always described as being tall and slender. He is fit, graceful in movement and physically powerful despite his slight frame. His skin is very pale and many people refer to him as "corpse-like" or as an "albino".  He has platinum blond hair and ice-blue eyes that often look grey depending on the lighting. Pendergast religiously dresses in a black, hand-tailored suit made of a special blend of wool made only in  the 1950s, thus he is often described as looking like an [[funeral director|undertaker]].

In many cases, Pendergast's normal appearance is irrelevant. A master of disguises, he has fooled even close acquaintances on several occasions.

==Accoutrements==
Pendergast owns a 1959 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith]] (he used to have two but sold one).  His chauffeur and personal assistant is a mysterious man named Proctor.  All of Pendergast's suits are custom-made in [[Italy]], and his shoes hand-made by [[John Lobb Bootmaker|John Lobb]] of London.

Pendergast's personal sidearm is usually a customized .45 Caliber [[Les Baer]] Government Model [[M1911]] pistol.  In ''[[Relic (novel)|Relic]]'' he carried a .45 [[Colt Anaconda]] [[double-action]] [[revolver]]. He owns a Signature Grade Colt 1911 .45ACP tuned by pistolsmith Hilton Yam (now owner of 10-8 Consulting).

Pendergast maintains an apartment at [[The Dakota]] in New York City, and later inherits an internally renovated [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] mansion near [[Harlem]] from his great-granduncle in ''The Cabinet of Curiosities''. In his apartment there is a fully furnished zen garden where Pendergast likes to take time to meditate before a new challenge.

Though he is a scrupulously scientific man, he wears a talisman or amulet on a chain, that consists of his own modified version of the Pendergast family crest: a lidless eye over two moons, one [[new moon|new]] and one [[full moon|full]], with a phoenix (the original version featured a lion).

Pendergast carries a variety of hidden tools, such as [[Lock picking|lock picks]], flashlights of various sizes, test tubes, syringes, and forensic chemicals.

==Friends and relations==
*[[Lieutenant|Lt.]] [[Vincent D'Agosta]] – [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] (formerly [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton]] PD). Possibly Pendergast's most trusted friend and associate.
*Constance Greene – Pendergast's [[Ward (law)|ward]], research assistant, social secretary, [[amanuensis]], seer. An [[anachronism]] that appears 19, quietly beautiful with violet eyes and auburn hair that possesses a depth of almost limitless knowledge. Born around 1876, her guardian and sister was experimented on and killed by Pendergast's ancestor, Enoch Leng, during his life-extending elixir process. Enoch informally adopts her at the age of six, while testing elixirs on her and raising her in his reclusive home as a student of [[erudite]] knowledge. When Enoch is brutally murdered, she hides in fear into the mansion and its catacombs, traveling only at night through the secret entrance to the [[Hudson River]] area of [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]]. Although she has [[Svengali]] type feelings for Pendergast, she falls prey to his brother's psychotic seduction resulting in a child. The child is secreted away at the Gsalrig Chongg monastery, where, after her confession of love to Pendergast goes unrequited, Constance retires.
*Proctor – Pendergast's [[butler]] and [[chauffeur]] with abilities far beyond most people's assumptions. Before becoming Pendergast's butler, he served in the Special Forces Ghost Company with him.
*Wren – a book restorer at the [[New York Public Library]].
*Mime – an invalid of unknown affiliation, [[Thalidomide]] baby; skilled in obtaining obscure information via the computer and Internet. Also featured in ''[[Mount Dragon]]'' as the friend of Charles Levine.
*Dr. Nora Kelly – [[American Museum of Natural History|New York Museum of Natural History]] curator; also featured as protagonist in ''[[Thunderhead (novel)|Thunderhead]]''.
*William "Bill" Smithback, Jr. – ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' (formerly ''[[New York Post]]'') journalist. (deceased as of ''Cemetery Dance'').
*Captain Laura Hayward – [[New York City Police Department]], married to Vincent D'agosta, not an avid fan of Pendergast's but will often assist in cases. 
*Dr. Margo Green – [[New York Museum of Natural History]] curator.
*Dr. Viola Maskelene – an [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], love interest, later "just friends" forever and always as concluded in ''[[Two Graves (novel)|Two Graves]]''.
*The Monks of the Gsalrig Chongg Monastery.
*Eli Glinn – president of Effective Engineering Solutions, Inc. Expert profiler who gets Pendergast to talk about his childhood and his brother. Also breaks Pendergast out of prison; also featured in ''[[The Ice Limit]]'' and the Gideon Crew series, beginning with ''[[Gideon's Sword]]''.
*Corrie Swanson – from Medicine Creek, [[Kansas]], assisted Pendergast on a case in ''[[Still Life with Crows]]''. Previously enrolled at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]; now enrolled at [[John Jay College]] of Criminal Justice (as of ''Cold Vengeance''). Main character in ''[[White Fire (novel)|White Fire]]''.
*Maurice – Former Caretaker of the Pendergast family mansion, Penumbra, in Louisiana, which has been sold. 
*Kyoko Ishimura – Pendergast's maid in the Dakota apartment. 
*Mrs. Trask - The housekeeper of Pendergast's mansion at 891 Riverside Drive.

==The Pendergast family==
Officially, the Pendergast's family wealth came from [[pharmaceuticals]], and the family became sufficiently old and established in New Orleans to conduct themselves as [[aristocracy]].  However, there are hints that the fortune actually came from [[patent medicine]] ("[[snake oil]]"), and that some of the family's customers suffered permanent injury or even death from its effects.

Pendergast also confides, to his shame, that a streak of [[insanity]] has afflicted his family for generations, such that many of them have been convicted of horrible crimes, and ended their lives in asylums.

*Diogenes Dagrepont Bernoulli Pendergast – Pendergast's younger brother (born circa 1962). As intelligent as Aloysius, if not more so, but criminally insane. Although he was always a unique child, Diogenes was pushed over the edge during a traumatic event during their childhoods, resulting in brain damage and [[heterochromia iridis]].  Diogenes is first mentioned in ''[[Brimstone (Preston and Child novel)|Brimstone]]'', after which he commits a series of grisly murders, which he frames Aloysius for, then a daring theft from the [[New York Museum of Natural History]], to be completed with a horrific mass murder under circumstances similar to the "Event" during his childhood. Aloysius breaks out of prison with the help of his allies, only clearing his name later, and thwarts Diogenes' last crime.  The three novels ''[[Brimstone (Preston and Child novel)|Brimstone]]'', ''[[Dance of Death (novel)|Dance of Death]]'', and ''[[The Book of the Dead (novel)|The Book of the Dead]]'' make up an internal series about the unique fraternal relationship between Aloysius and Diogenes, culminating in the latter's fall into the Sciara del Fuoco in the [[Stromboli]] volcano.  These are known as the "Diogenes Trilogy". [[Sherlock Holmes]] fans will undoubtedly recognize Preston's and Child's homage to Doyle's famous works, in both their choice of first name for Aloysius Pendergast's brother, and in the circumstances of Diogenes's presumed demise. Diogenes reappears, seemingly a changed man in ''[[The Obsidian Chamber]]'', claiming that he wants to live out a long, quiet life with Constance at Halcyon Key. After her refusal, his whereabouts are currently unknown.
*Cornelia Delamere Pendergast – Pendergast's great-aunt, who poisoned her husband, brother and children. Cornelia held residence at the Mount Mercy Hospital for the [[Criminally Insane]] until her death.  Despite her complete insanity, Pendergast still considered her wise, and sought her counsel when he had a dilemma. Sometime during the events of ''[[Fever Dream (novel)|Fever Dream]]'', Cornelia dies, leaving Pendergast a letter of unknown content.
*Antoine Leng Pendergast (a.k.a. Enoch Leng) – Pendergast's great-grand uncle.  Traveled north to New York after being expelled from the Pendergast family.  [[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomist]] and chemist as well as a member of the New York [[Lyceum]] in the late 19th century.  Exposed as a [[serial killer]] in ''[[The Cabinet of Curiosities]]'' who killed in the pursuit of a substance that would prolong his life.  He succeeded, and survived well into the late 20th century until he was murdered in his home on Riverside Drive.  Pendergast now lives in Leng's old mansion with Proctor as butler/chauffeur.  He has refurnished the mansion and made it liveable and elegant.
*Hezekiah Pendergast – (Pendergast's great-great grandfather) Antoine's father. Was a traveling salesman who contributed greatly to the family fortune by selling a quack medicine known as "Hezekiah's Compound Elixir and Glandular Restorative". The tonic was eventually exposed as a lethal blend of [[cocaine]], [[acetanilide|acetanilid]], and [[alkaloid]] botanicals. It was the cause of uncounted addictions and deaths, including that of Hezekiah's wife and Antoine's mother, Constance Leng Pendergast.
*Henri Pendregast de Mousqueton – a "seventeenth-century mountebank who pulled teeth, performed magic and comedy, and practiced quack medicine."
*Eduard Pendregast – a "well-known [[Harley Street]] doctor in eighteenth-century London."
*Comstock Pendergast – Pendergast's great-grand uncle.  Famed [[mesmerist]], magician, and mentor to [[Harry Houdini]].  Eventually murdered his business partner and his family.  He then committed suicide by cutting his throat twice.
*Linnaeus Pendergast – Pendergast's father, who was killed in the fire.
*Isabella Pendergast – Pendergast's mother, also killed in the fire.
*Boethius Pendergast – Pendergast's great-grandfather. Lived at the Penumbra, was good friends with famed naturalist painter [[John James Audubon]] (However, in ''Fever Dream'' it is also mentioned that it was Pendergast's great-great-grandfather who was friends with Audubon. Furthermore, in ''Blue Labyrinth'' it is mentioned that Pendergast's great-great-great-grandfather was friends with Audubon.).
*Helen Pendergast – Pendergast's thought-to-be deceased wife (maiden name Helen Esterhazy). Helen was a doctor with Doctors With Wings, a group similar to [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]] that travels to third-world countries and disaster areas to help people who would have otherwise had little chance of survival.  She is a skilled big [[game (food)|game]] [[hunting|hunter]], and it was one of the pastimes that brought her and Pendergast together. For many years, she was thought to have been killed on an African safari, but she reappears in the book ''Cold Vengeance''. She is a descendant of the Hungarian [[House of Esterházy|Esterházy]] aristocratic family.
*Judson Esterhazy – Pendergast's brother-in-law. Like his sister Helen, he was a doctor with Doctors With Wings and is a skilled hunter. He plays an important role in the "Helen Trilogy".
*[[Percy Harrison Fawcett]] – Pendergast's great-great uncle on his mother's side. He was an explorer and disappeared in the jungles along the Upper [[Xingu River]] (hence Pendergast's middle name) in 1925 while looking for the mysterious [[Lost City of Z]].
*Tristram – Pendergast's son with Helen. He is currently attending boarding school at École Mère-Égliseq in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
*Alban – Identical twin of Tristram, a genetically engineered person, more intelligent and stronger than his father. Deceased as of the events in ''[[Blue Labyrinth]]'' (2014).
*Unnamed nephew - a child of Diogenes Pendergast and Constance Greene, currently living with the monks of the Gsalrig Chongg monastery.

==Chronicles==
Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast appears in several stand-alone novels and stars in two trilogies. All of these books have been jointly written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.

===Stand-alone novels===
*''[[Relic (novel)|Relic]]'' (1995) (''Pendergast's first appearance'') – Pendergast investigates a series of strange murders and rumors of a murderous beast in the [[New York Museum of Natural History]].  Includes Margo Green, reporter Bill Smithback, and Vincent D'Agosta.
*''[[Reliquary (novel)|Reliquary]]'' (1997) – Pendergast returns to New York when a new string of murders surfaces resembling those of the Museum Beast case.  He is again teamed with Margo Green, Dr. Frock, William Smithback Jr., and Vincent D'Agosta (all of whom were in the previous book), and introduces the character of Laura Hayward.
*''[[The Cabinet of Curiosities]]'' (2002) – Pendergast is drawn to the remains of a 19th-century [[charnel house]], unearthed at a construction site in New York and finds himself investigating a new series of 20th century [[copycat crimes|copycat killings]].  He is joined by William Smithback Jr. and Dr. Nora Kelly.
*''[[Still Life with Crows]]'' (2003) – Pendergast travels to midwestern Kansas to the dying farm town of Medicine Creek to investigate a series of brutal and ritualistic killings.  He teams up with a teenage malcontent, Corrie Swanson, to solve the case. The book also hints at a sequel to ''[[The Ice Limit]]''.
*''[[The Wheel of Darkness]]'' (2007) – Pendergast has taken Constance on a whirlwind Grand Tour, hoping to give her closure and a sense of the world that she's missed. They head to Tibet, where Pendergast intensively trained in martial arts and spiritual studies. At a remote monastery, they learn that a rare and dangerous artifact the monks have been guarding for generations has been mysteriously stolen. Pendergast agrees to take up the search. The trail leads him and Constance to the maiden voyage of the ''Brittania'', the world's largest and most luxurious passenger liner—and to an Atlantic crossing fraught with terror.
*''[[Cemetery Dance (novel)|Cemetery Dance]]'' (2009) – Pendergast returns to New York City. Two of his close friends have been attacked by a man who is supposedly dead. Pendergast and D'Agosta undertake a private quest for the truth. Their serpentine journey takes them into a part of Manhattan they never imagined could exist: a secretive and deadly hotbed of [[Obeah]], the [[West Indies|West Indian]] [[Zombi (African god)|Zombi]] cult of sorcery and magic.
*''[[White Fire (novel)|White Fire]]'' (2013) – Corrie Swanson sets out to solve a long-forgotten mystery. In 1876, in a remote mining camp called Roaring Fork in the [[Colorado Rockies (mountains)|Colorado Rockies]], several miners were killed in devastating grizzly bear attacks. Now the town has become an exclusive ski resort and its historic cemetery has been dug up to make way for development. Corrie has arranged to examine the remains of the dead miners. But in doing so she makes a shocking discovery that threatens the resort's very existence. The town's leaders, trying to stop her from exposing their community's dark and bloody past, arrest and jail her. Special Agent Pendergast of the FBI arrives to help—just as a series of brutal arson attacks on multimillion-dollar homes terrify the town and drive away tourists. Drawn irresistibly into the investigation, Pendergast discovers an unlikely secret in Roaring Fork's past, connecting the resort to a chance meeting between [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[Oscar Wilde]]. With the town under siege, and Corrie's life in desperate danger, Pendergast must solve the riddle of the past ... before the town of present goes up in flames.
*''[[Blue Labyrinth (novel)|Blue Labyrinth]]'' (2014) – Pendergast must accept a ruthless killer's challenge when somebody leaves his son Alban's body at the door of his mansion. Contained in Alban's stomach is a rare turquoise that came from a long-deserted mine in California. Pendergast knows he must go there, although he's probably walking into a trap. Sure enough, despite all his precautions, he is exposed to a slow-acting poison that weakens him but will not stop his quest.
*''[[Crimson Shore]]'' (2015) – Pendergast, together with his ward Constance Greene, travels to the quaint seaside village of Exmouth, Massachusetts, to investigate the theft of a priceless wine collection. But inside the wine cellar, they find something considerably more disturbing: a bricked-up niche that once held a crumbling skeleton. Pendergast and Constance soon learn that Exmouth is a town with a troubled history, and this skeleton may be only the first hint of an ancient transgression, which is now kept secret. Local legend holds that during the 1692 witch trials in Salem, the real witches escaped, fleeing north to Exmouth and settling deep in the surrounding salt marshes, where they continued to practice their arts. Then, a murdered corpse turns up in the marshes. The only clue is a series of mysterious carvings. Could these symbols bear some relation to the ancient witches' colony, long believed to be abandoned?

'''''Asia''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] in the 1920s and 1930s that featured reporting about [[Asia]] and its people, including the [[Far East]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]],  and the [[Middle East]]. From 1934 to 1946, it was edited by [[Richard J. Walsh]], with extensive contributions from his wife, [[Pearl S. Buck]]. Under their influence, the journal published many prominent Asian literary and political figures and American authorities. In 1946, after many years of financial trouble, it was merged into a new journal, ''United Nations World''.

==Origins and development==
''Asia'' magazine was established by the [[American Asiatic Association]] in 1898 as ''Journal of the American Asiatic Association''. An editorial in the ''Journal'' explained: "The ignorance of our people in regard to the countries of the Far East is unquestionably a serious obstacle to the legitimate extension of American influence. .&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Asiatic Association''. Asia: 17.1 (March 1917). [https://books.google.com/books?id=SQhZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=irgnorance+of+our+people#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 [[Willard Dickerman Straight|Willard Straight]], who had been involved in promoting American trade and investment in Korea and China since the turn of the century,  and his wife, [[Dorothy Payne Whitney|Dorothy Payne Whitney Straight]], bought the magazine and renamed it ''Asia''. and continued its publication as a popular journal of commerce and travel. The Straights also were co-founders of ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Records " &gt;"Records of Asia Magazine" RG 4, pp. 207 208, "Papers of Pearl S. Buck," [http://www.psbi.org/document.doc?id=533 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Willard Straight died of influenza in 1918, his widow took over publication of the magazine. She married [[Leonard K. Elmhirst]] in 1925. The editors included [[Louis D. Froelick]] and   [[John Foord]], and associate editors [[Gertrude Emerson Sen|Gertrude Emerson]] and Marietta Neff. [[Elsie Weil]], who joined the staff about 1920, was the long time managing editor.&lt;ref name="Records " /&gt;[[Frank H. McIntosh (artist)|Frank H. McIntosh]] painted many of the covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askart.com/AskART/M/frank_mcintosh/frank_mcintosh.aspx Ask Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Richard Walsh and Pearl S. Buck==
In January 1934, although ownership remained unchanged, [[Richard J. Walsh]], head of [[John Day Company|John Day publishers]] published his first issue as editor. He announced that the magazine would no longer be a tourist handbook, and despite objections from some readers, the magazine was shifted from advertising luxury goods, travel and promotion of American commerce in the Orient to discussion of international affairs and current Asian culture and literature. In the first editorial Walsh promised readers a wide range of topics and views. The magazine's political stance changed as well. Walsh wrote that it would "look upon Communism as objectively as upon art, and bring to religious concepts as open a mind as we bring to economic problems." Walsh soon brought his new wife, [[Pearl S. Buck]] into the editorial process. {{sfnb|Conn|1996| p= 159-160, 171-173}}

In the following years, Asia underwent revolution and war. Walsh, as publisher of John Day, and Buck, as America's most influential writer about Asia, attracted and recruited a new range of Asian and American writers, many of whom promoted an anti-colonial agenda, such as support for Indian independence, and anti-racist program. Subscriptions rose as Americans become more worried about the oncoming [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Writers included [[William Ernest Hocking]], the Harvard liberal theologian; [[Hu Shih]], leader of China's [[New Culture Movement]]; [[Owen Lattimore]], the emerging authority on Central Asia; [[Lin Yutang]]; [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the Indian independence leader; and reporters such as [[Nathaniel Peffer]]; [[Edgar Snow]],  [[Nym Wales]], and [[Theodore H. White]], who reported from the front line on China before World War II. Buck wrote a regular book review column titled “Asia Book Shelf.” The magazine recruited corresponding editors to gather articles, including [[Gertrude Emerson Sen]] in India and [[Harold John Timperley|H.J. Timperley]], an Australian journalist in China.{{sfnb|Conn|1996| p= 159-160, 171-173}}

In 1941, Walsh and Buck bought the magazine from the Elmhirsts. They changed the name to ''Asia and the Americas'' in November 1942, and Buck assumed the editorship. She continued her attacks on imperialism, particularly British, and offered strong support for colonial independence movements.{{sfnb|Conn|1996| p= 243}} With the end of the war in 1945, however, Americans lost interest in Asia and the magazine suffered a financial crisis. Buck resigned as editor in 1947 merged the magazine with ''[[Free World (magazine)|Free World]]'' and ''Inter-American'' to form a new journal,''United Nations World''.{{sfnb|Conn|1996| p = 297-298}}

The '''silkworm''' is the [[larva]] or [[caterpillar]] of the '''domestic silkmoth''', '''''Bombyx mori''''' ([[Latin]]: "silkworm of the [[mulberry]] tree"). It is an economically important insect, being a primary producer of [[silk]]. A silkworm's preferred food is [[white mulberry]] leaves, though they may eat other mulberry species and even [[osage orange]]. Domestic silkmoths are closely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silkmoths are different from their domestic cousins as they have not been selectively bred; they are not as commercially viable in the production of silk.

[[Sericulture]], the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Prehistoric Textiles: the Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean |author=E. J. W. Barber |year=1992 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-00224-8 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnSlynSfeEIC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where it spread to [[India]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and the [[Western world|West]]. The silkworm was domesticated from the wild silkmoth ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'', which has a range from northern India to northern [[China]], Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of [[Russia]]. The domesticated silkworm derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=K. P. Arunkumar, Muralidhar Metta &amp; J.

Silkworms were unlikely to have been domestically bred before the [[Neolithic]] age. Before then, the tools to manufacture quantities of silk thread had not been developed. The domesticated ''B. mori'' and the wild ''[[Bombyx mandarina|B. mandarina]]'' can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution: Principles and Processes |author=Brian K. Hall |series=Topics in Biology |year=2010 |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |isbn=978-0-7637-6039-7 |page=400 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V24EHUgEl5EC&amp;lpg=PA342}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}

Domestic silkmoths are very different from most members in the genus ''[[Bombyx]]''; not only have they lost the ability to fly, but their [[Animal coloration|color pigments]] are also lost.&lt;ref&gt;https://phys.org/news/2013-11-captive-thousands-years-impaired-olfactory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Mulberry silkworms can be categorized into three different but connected groups or types. The major groups of silkworms fall under the univoltine ("uni-"=one, "voltine"=brood frequency) and bivoltine categories. The univoltine breed is generally linked with the geographical area within greater Europe. The eggs of this type hibernate during winter due to the cold climate, and cross-fertilize only by spring, generating silk only once annually. The second type is called bivoltine and is normally found in [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Korea]]. The breeding process of this type takes place twice annually, a feat made possible through the slightly warmer climates and the resulting two life cycles. The polyvoltine type of mulberry silkworm can only be found in the tropics. The eggs are laid by female moths and hatch within nine to 12 days, so the resulting type can have up to eight separate life cycles throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trevisan|first=Adrian|title=Cocoon Silk: A Natural Silk Architecture|url=http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|publisher=Sense of Nature|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507085636/http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 10746 An adult silkworm moth.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Adult silk moth]]
[[File:Silkmoth.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Wild silkmoth ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'']]

Eggs take about 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a preference for [[Morus alba|white mulberry]], having an attraction to the mulberry odorant [[jasmone|cis-jasmone]]. They are not [[monophagous]] since they can eat other species of ''[[Morus (plant)|Morus]]'', as well as some other [[Moraceae]], mostly [[Osage orange]]. They are covered with tiny black hairs. When the color of their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to [[ecdysis|molt]]. After molting, the [[larva|larval]] phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.

After they have molted four times, their bodies become slightly yellow and the skin becomes tighter. The larvae then prepare to enter the [[pupa]]l phase of their lifecycle, and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the [[salivary glands]]. The final molt from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon, which provides a vital layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state. Many other [[Lepidoptera]] produce cocoons, but only a few—the [[Bombycidae]], in particular the genus ''[[Bombyx]]'', and the [[Saturniidae]], in particular the genus ''[[Antheraea]]''—have been exploited for fabric production.

If the animal is allowed to survive after spinning its cocoon and through the pupal phase of its lifecycle, it  releases [[proteolytic enzyme]]s to make a hole in the cocoon so it can emerge as an adult moth. These enzymes are destructive to the silk and can cause the silk fibers to break down from over a mile in length to segments of random length, which seriously reduces the value of the silk [[yarn|threads]], but not silk cocoons used as "stuffing" available in China and elsewhere for doonas, jackets etc. To prevent this, silkworm cocoons are boiled. The heat kills the silkworms and the water makes the cocoons easier to unravel. Often, the silkworm itself is eaten.

As the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the larva, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was critical of silk production based on the [[Ahimsa]] philosophy "not to hurt any living thing". This led to Gandhi's promotion of cotton spinning machines, an example of which can be seen at the Gandhi Institute. He also promoted [[Ahimsa silk]], [[wild silk]] made from the cocoons of wild and semiwild silkmoths.&lt;ref&gt;"Mahatma Gandhi: 100 years", 1968, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LGVuAAAAMAAJ p. 349]&lt;/ref&gt;

The moth – the adult phase of the lifecycle – is not capable of functional flight, in contrast to the wild ''B. mandarina'' and other ''Bombyx'' species, whose males fly to meet females and for evasion from predators. Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved. This is because their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings. However, some silkmoths can still fly.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjK6k70xNA8&lt;/ref&gt; Silkmoths have a wingspan of {{convert|3|–|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a white, hairy body. Females are about two to three times bulkier than males (for they are carrying many eggs), but are similarly colored. Adult [[Bombycidae]] have reduced mouth parts and do not feed, though a human caretaker can feed them.

== Cocoon ==
[[File:Cocoon.jpg|thumb|right|Cocoon of ''B. mori'']]

The cocoon is made of a thread of raw silk from 300 to about 900 m (1,000 to 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft) long. The fibers are very fine and lustrous, about 10 μm (0.0004&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter. About 2,000 to 3,000 cocoons are required to make a pound of silk (0.4&amp;nbsp;kg). At least 70 million pounds of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/603/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=603#ancor|title=faostat.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Due to its small size and ease of culture, the silkworm has become a [[model organism]] in the study of lepidopteran and arthropod biology. Fundamental findings on [[pheromone]]s, [[hormone]]s, brain structures, and physiology have been made with the silkworm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} One example of this was the molecular identification of the first known pheromone, [[bombykol]], which required extracts from 500,000 individuals, due to the very small quantities of pheromone produced by any individual worm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Currently, research is focusing on genetics of silkworms and the possibility of genetic engineering. Many hundreds of strains are maintained, and over 400 [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian mutation]]s have been described.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Another source suggests 1,000 inbred domesticated strains are kept worldwide.&lt;ref name="silkworm08"/&gt; One useful development for the silk industry is silkworms that can feed on food other than mulberry leaves, including an artificial diet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Research on the genome also raises the possibility of genetically engineering silkworms to produce proteins, including pharmacological drugs, in the place of silk proteins. ''Bombyx mori'' females are also one of the few organisms with homologous chromosomes held together only by the [[synaptonemal complex]] (and not crossovers) during [[meiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerton and Hawley|title=Homologous Chromosome Interactions in Meiosis: Diversity Amidst Conservation|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2005|volume=6|pages=477–487|doi=10.1038/nrg1614|pmid=15931171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kraig Biocraft Laboratories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kraig Biocraft Laboratories|url=http://www.kraiglabs.com/spider-silk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
has used research from the [[University of Wyoming|Universities of Wyoming]] and [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in a collaborative effort to create a silkworm that is genetically altered to produce spider silk. In September 2010, the effort was announced as successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Notre Dame|url=http://science.nd.edu/news/34100-hybrid-silkworms-spin-stronger-spider-silk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Tufts Medical Center|Tufts]] developed scaffolds made of spongy silk that feel and look similar to human tissue. They are implanted during reconstructive surgery to support or restructure damaged ligaments, tendons, and other tissue. They also created implants made of silk and drug compounds which can be implanted under the skin for steady and gradual time release of medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolchover, Natalie|url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/the_silk_renaissance/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the [[MIT Media Lab]] experimented with silkworms to see what they would weave when left on surfaces with different curvatures. They found that on particularly straight webs of lines, the worms would connect neighboring lines with silk, weaving directly onto the given shape. Using this knowledge they built a [[Neri Oxman#Silk Pavilion|silk pavilion]] with 6,500 silkworms over a number of days.

Silkworms have been used in antibiotics discovery as they have several advantageous traits compared to other invertebrate models.&lt;ref&gt;Panthee, S., Paudel, A., Hamamoto, H., and Sekimizu, K. (2017). Advantages of the silkworm as an animal model for developing novel antimicrobial agents.

== Domestication ==
The domesticated form, compared to the wild form, has increased cocoon size, body size, growth rate, and efficiency of its digestion. It has gained tolerance to human presence and handling, and also to living in crowded conditions. The domesticated moth cannot fly, so it needs human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators. The native color pigments are also lost, so the domesticated moths are leucistic since camouflage isn't useful when they only live in captivity. These changes have made the domesticated strains entirely dependent upon humans for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Marian R. Goldsmith, Toru Shimada &amp; Hiroaki Abe |year=2005 |title=The genetics and genomics of the silkworm, ''Bombyx mori'' |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=50 |pages=71–100 |pmid=15355234 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.50.071803.130456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs are kept in [[Incubator (egg)|incubators]] to aid in their hatching.

=== Silkworm breeding ===
[[File:Women placing silkworms on trays together with mulberry leaves (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpg|thumb|280px|left|Silkworms and mulberry leaves placed on trays ([[Liang Kai]]'s ''Sericulture'' c. 13th century)]]

Silkworms were first domesticated in China over 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hong-Song Yu1, Yi-Hong Shen, Gang-Xiang Yuan, et al. |title=Evidence of selection at melanin synthesis pathway loci during silkworm domestication |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1785–99 |year=2011 |pmid =21212153 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msr002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennis Normile |title=Sequencing 40 Silkworm Genomes Unravels History of Cultivation |journal=Science |volume=325 |pages=1058–1059  |year=2009 |pmid=19713499 |doi=10.1126/science.325_1058a |bibcode = 2009Sci...325.1058N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the silk production capacity of the species has increased nearly tenfold. The silkworm is one of the few organisms wherein the principles of genetics and breeding were applied to harvest maximum output {{citation needed|reason=many domesticated plants and animals have evolved through heterosis and cross-breeding|date=December 2017}}. It is second only to [[maize]] in exploiting the principles of [[heterosis]] and [[cross breeding]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Silkworm breeding is aimed at the overall improvement of silkworm from a commercial point of view. The major objectives are improving [[fecundity]] (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better [[pupation]] rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountage: Meaning and Types {{!}} Sericulture|url=http://www.notesonzoology.com/sericulture/mountage-meaning-and-types-sericulture/200|website=Zoology Notes|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; shorter larval duration (shorter larval duration lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced are directly related to the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors including genetics.

=== Hobby raising and school projects ===
In the US, teachers may sometimes introduce the insect life cycle to their students by raising silkworms in the classroom as a science project. Students have a chance to observe complete life cycles of insect from egg stage to larvae, pupa, moth. &lt;!-- encyclopedic? In Israel this is done in kindergarten as well. --&gt;

The silkworm has been raised as a hobby in countries such as China, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Iran. Children often pass on the eggs, creating a non-commercial population. The experience provides children with the opportunity to witness the life cycle of silkworms. The practice of raising silkworms by children as pets has, in non-silk farming South Africa, led to the development of extremely hardy [[landrace]]s of silkworms, because they are invariably subjected to hardships not encountered by commercially farmed members of the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkwormeggs.net/resources/Silkworm-School-Science-Project-Instruction.pdf |title=Silkworm School Science Project Instruction |format=PDF |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314044223/http://www.silkwormeggs.net/resources/Silkworm-School-Science-Project-Instruction.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these worms, not being selectively bred as such, are possibly inferior in silk production and may exhibit other undesirable traits.

== Genome ==
The full [[genome]] of the silkworm was published in 2008 by the International Silkworm Genome Consortium.&lt;ref name="silkworm08"&gt;{{cite journal |author=The International Silkworm Genome Consortium |year=2008 |title=The genome of a lepidopteran model insect, the silkworm ''Bombyx mori'' |journal=Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1036–1045 |doi=10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.11.004 |pmid=19121390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Draft sequences were published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kazuei Mita |author2=Masahiro Kasahara |author3=Shin Sasaki |author4=Et al. |year=2004 |title=The genome sequence of silkworm, ''Bombyx mori'' |journal=[[DNA Research]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=27–35 |pmid=15141943 |doi=10.1093/dnares/11.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Xia Q, Zhou Z, Lu C, et al., Biology Analysis Group  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004 |title=A draft sequence for the genome of the domesticated silkworm (Bombyx mori) |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=306 |issue=5703 |pages=1937–40 |pmid=15591204 |doi=10.1126/science.1102210|bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1937X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genome of the silkworm is mid-range with a [[genome size]] around 432 megabase pairs.

High genetic variability has been found in domestic lines of silkworms, though this is less than that among wild silkmoths (about 83 percent of wild genetic variation). This suggests a single event of domestication, and that it happened over a short period of time, with a large number of wild worms having been collected for domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Qingyou Xia, Yiran Guo, Ze Zhang, et al. |year=2009 |title=Complete resequencing of 40 genomes reveals domestication events and genes in silkworm (''Bombyx'') |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=326 |issue=5951 |pages=433–436 |doi=10.1126/science.1176620 |pmid=19713493 |bibcode=2009Sci...326..433X |url=http://life.cqu.edu.cn/zezhang/silkwormDomest_Sci09-10-16.pdf |format=PDF |pmc=3951477 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major questions, however, remain unanswered: "Whether this event was in a single location or in a short period of time in several locations cannot be deciphered from the data". Research also has yet to identify the area in China where domestication arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennis Normile |year=2009 |title=Sequencing 40 silkworm genomes unravels history of cultivation |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5944 |pages=1058–1059 |doi=10.1126/science.325_1058a |bibcode=2009Sci...325.1058N |pmid=19713499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cuisine ==
[[File:Silkworm pupae to eat.jpg|thumb|Silkworm pupae dishes]]
Silkworm pupae are [[Entomophagy|eaten]] in some cultures.

* In [[Assam]], they are boiled for extracting silk and the boiled pupae are eaten directly with salt or fried with chilli pepper or herbs as a snack or dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timescity.com/blog/weird-foods-in-india/ |title=10 Weird Foods in India - Eri polu | date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Korea, they are boiled and seasoned to make a popular snack food known as ''[[beondegi]]'' (번데기).
* In China, street vendors sell roasted silkworm pupae.
* In Japan, silkworms are usually served as a ''[[tsukudani]]'' (佃煮), i.e., boiled in a sweet-sour sauce made with [[soy sauce]] and sugar.
* In [[Vietnam]], this is known as ''{{lang|vi|con nhộng}}''.
* Silkworms have also been proposed for cultivation by astronauts as [[space food]] on long-term missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/01/13-02.html |title=Care for a Silkworm With Your Tang? |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |date=13 January 2009 |work=ScienceNOW Daily News |accessdate=14 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225234236/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/01/13-02.html |archivedate=25 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silkworm legends ==
{{See also|Horse in Chinese mythology#Origins of sericulture}}
In China, a legend indicates the discovery of the silkworm's silk was by an ancient empress [[Lei Zu]], the wife of the [[Yellow Emperor]] and the daughter of XiLing-Shi. She was drinking tea under a tree when a silk cocoon fell into her tea. As she picked it out and started to wrap the silk thread around her finger, she slowly felt a warm sensation. When the silk ran out, she saw a small larva. In an instant, she realized this caterpillar larva was the source of the silk. She taught this to the people and it became widespread. Many more legends about the silkworm are told.

The Chinese guarded their knowledge of silk, but, according to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk manufacture, "hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry", probably in the first half of the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Underhill Wisseman, Wendell S. Williams. ''Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Materials ''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|2-88124-632-X}}. Page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  About AD 550, Christian monks are said to have smuggled silkworms, in a hollow stick, out of China and sold the secret to the [[Byzantine Empire]].

== Silkworm diseases ==
*''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', a fungus, destroys the entire silkworm body. This fungus usually appears when silkworms are raised under cold conditions with high humidity. This disease is not passed on to the eggs from moths, as the infected silkworms cannot survive to the moth stage. This fungus can spread to other insects.
*[[Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus|Grasserie]], also known as nuclear polyhedrosis, milky disease, or hanging disease, is caused by infection with the ''Bombyx mori'' nuclear polyhedrosis virus. If grasserie is observed in the chawkie stage, then the chawkie larvae must have been infected while hatching or during chawkie rearing. Infected eggs can be disinfected by cleaning their surfaces prior to hatching. Infections can occur as a result of improper hygiene in the chawkie rearing house. This disease develops faster in early instar rearing.
*[[Pébrine]] is a disease caused by a parasitic microsporidian, ''[[Nosema (microsporidian)|N. bombycis]]''. Diseased larvae show slow growth, undersized, pale and flaccid bodies, and poor appetite. Tiny black spots appear on larval integument. Additionally, dead larvae remain rubbery and do not undergo putrefaction after death. ''N. bombycis'' kills 100% of silkworms hatched from infected eggs. This disease can be carried over from worms to moths, then eggs and worms again. This microsporidium comes from the food the silkworms eat. Mother moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of worms hatching from the diseased eggs will die in their worm stage. To prevent this disease, it is extremely important to rule out all eggs from infected moths by checking the moth's body fluid under a microscope.
*[[Flacherie]] infected silkworms look weak and are colored dark brown before they die. The disease destroys the larva's gut and is caused by viruses or poisonous food.
*Several diseases caused by a variety of funguses are collectively named [[Muscardine]].

== Traditional Chinese medicine ==
In [[traditional Chinese medicine]], silkworm is the source of the "stiff silkworm", which is made from dried fourth- or fifth-instar [[larva]]e which have died of "white muscardine disease", the ''Beauveria bassiana'' fungal infection mentioned above. It is believed to dispel [[flatulence]], dissolve [[phlegm]], and relieve [[spasm]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13489">'''Brenda Dixon Gottschild''' is an American cultural historian, performer, choreographer, and anti-racist cultural worker.  She has used her background as a dance performer and as a professor of dance to create works that bring racism, gender, and societal questions to the forefront of discussions.  Her choreographic work is often in collaboration with her husband, Hellmut Gottschild, who is also a dancer/choreographer.  She publishes literary works and giving lectures in which she uses her own dancing body as a crucial part of her presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brenda Dixon Gottschild|url=http://www.leeway.org/grantee-info.html?action=granteeDetail&amp;GranteeID=726|publisher=Leeway Foundation|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Gottschild spent the early years of her career performing dance.  From 1964 to 1966, she was a member of the Mary Anthony Dance Theater.  Later, she became an independent choreographer, teacher, and performer.  Gottschild has worked in New York, Stockholm, Helsinki, and London from 1966 to 1968.  From 1968 to 1971, she was a member of the Open Theater (directed by [[Joseph Chaikin]]) and the Frank Silvera Writers’ Workshop.  She was a student at the Performance Studies Department of [[New York University]] and earned her Ph.D. in 1981.  Today, she uses her body and lecture as an instrument with which she demonstrates performance and kinesthetic principles.

She is a Professor Emerita of dance studies at [[Temple University]] and is collaborating with Joan Myers Brown in writing a book and giving lectures about the [[Philadelphia Dance Company]].  Gottschild performs with her husband Hellmut Gottschild in a form of somatic and research-based collaboration they have dubbed “movement theater discourse.”  Additionally, she is the Philadelphia correspondent for ''[[Dance Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gottschild|first=Brenda Dixon|title=About Brenda|url=http://bdixongottschild.com/about/|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===Books===
Gottschild's first solo book, ''Digging the Africanist Presence in American Performance: Dance and Other Contexts'', was the culmination of a circuitous journey in interdisciplinary research that began with the question, “What makes George Balanchine’s ballets different from European ballet?” She originated and continue to investigate a line of thought that had been ignored in previous socio-cultural and performance studies—namely, the Africanist presence in Europeanist concert dance culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gottschild|first=Brenda Dixon|title=Brenda Dixon Gottschild Writer on Dance and Culture|url=http://bdixongottschild.com/about/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second book, ''Waltzing in the Dark: African American Vaudeville and Race Politics in the Swing Era'', focuses on the social, racial, and artistic climate for African American performers from the late 1920s through the 1940s.  For this work she received the 2001 CORD (Congress on Research in Dance) Award for Outstanding Scholarly Dance Publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gottschild|first=Brenda Dixon|title=Brenda Dixon Gottschild Writer on Dance and Culture|url=http://bdixongottschild.com/about/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Gottschild regards her third book, ''The Black Dancing Body – A Geography From Coon to Cool'', as her third installment in her ongoing quest to bring to the fore the African American quotient in the American cultural equation. It is a map of American history as told through the “topography” of the black dancing body. The chapters are named for body parts or expressive attributes: feet, buttocks, skin, hair/face, and soul/spirit.  An introduction preceding these sections wrestles with the question, “What is black dance?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gottschild|first=Brenda Dixon|title=Brenda Dixon Gottschild Writer on Dance and Culture|url=http://bdixongottschild.com/about/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her book ''Joan Myers Brown &amp; The Audacious Hope of the Black Ballerina: A Biohistory of American Performance'' is about Joan Myers Brown and her legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gottschild|first=Brenda Dixon|title=Brenda Dixon Gottschild Writer on Dance and Culture|url=http://bdixongottschild.com/about/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centro Cultural de la Raza''' (Spanish for ''Cultural Center of the Race'') is a non-profit organization with the specific mission to create, preserve, promote and educate about [[Chicano]], [[Mexican people|Mexicano]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Latino]] art and culture. It is located in [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]] in [[San Diego, California]].The cultural center supports and encourages the creative expression “of the indigenous cultures of the Americas.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Made In Aztlan|last = Brookman|first = Philip|publisher = Centro Cultural de la Raza|year = 1986|isbn = 0938461001|location = San Diego, California|pages = 12–53|chapter = El Centro Cultural de la Raza: Fifteen Years|editor-last = Brookman|editor-first = Philip|editor-last2 = Gómez-Peña|last2 = |editor-first2 = Guillermo}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently a member of the [[American Alliance of Museums]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=centro-cultural-de-la-raza-cr.xml|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122135/http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=centro-cultural-de-la-raza-cr.xml|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2 April 2015|title = Biographical History|date = |accessdate = 30 March 2015|website = Centro Cultural de la Raza|publisher = Social Networks and Archival Context Project|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centro provides classes and presentations on drama, music, dance, and arts and crafts, many of which have origins in Mexico and "[[Aztlán]]," a term used by Chicanos to indicate the American Southwest. Programs include Azteca dance, Teatro Chicano, film screenings, exhibits, musical performances, installation art, readings, receptions and other events. The Centro's resident [[Ballet Folklorico]] company, [[Ballet Folklorico Aztlan|Ballet Folklorico en Aztlan]], also operates a dance academy at the Center.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture, Volume 1|last = |first = |publisher = Greenwood|date = 30 October 2004|isbn = 978-0313332104|location = |pages = 209|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=STjcB_f7CVcC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=centro%20cultural%20de%20la%20raza&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q=centro%20cultural%20de%20la%20raza&amp;f=false|editor-last = Candelaria|editor-first = Cordelia C.|editor-last2 = Aldama|editor-first2 = Arturo J.|editor-link2 = |editor-last3 = Garcia|editor-first3 = Peter J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Centro is available as a meeting place for community groups and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://centroculturaldelaraza.com/rental-space/|title = Special Event Rental Requests|date = |accessdate = 30 March 2015|website = Centro Cultural de la Raza|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centro's circular building has offices, workrooms, studios, and a theater.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The performance space seats 150 people and has a 2,000 square foot art gallery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Centro is one of the first community-based Chicano cultural centers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aztlan.sdsu.edu/chicanohistory/chapter10/c10s05.html|title = How Did Chicano Park and El Centro Cultural de la Raza Come Into Existence?|date = 7 November 2011|accessdate = 30 March 2015|website = San Diego Mexican &amp; Chicano History|publisher = San Diego State University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest in the Southwest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is identifiable by a number of [[mural]]s painted near the building's main entrance.

==History==
The origins of the Centro go back to the mid 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Social protests, such as [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam war]] demonstrations and work of activists like [[Dolores Huerta]] and [[Cesar Chavez]] leading with the [[United Farm Workers]] had given rise to grass-roots community movements in San Diego.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those involved with social protest saw that there would also be a need for a community center that was run by Chicanos and for Chicanos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Signs from the Heart: California Chicano Murals|last = Goldman|first = Shifra M.|publisher = Social and Public Art Resource Center|year = 1990|isbn = 0962641901|location = Venice, California|pages = 52–53|chapter = How, Why, Where and When it All Happened: Chicano Murals of California|author-link = Shifra Goldman|editor-last = Cockcroft|editor-first = Eva Sperling|editor-last2 = Barnet-Sanchez|editor-first2 = Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[San Diego State University]], the Mexican American Youth Association (MAYA) was formed to recruit Chicano students to the university and make sure that they were able to complete their studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This group, along with the Mexican American Liberation Art Front (MALAF) both recognized the need for a cultural center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, MALAF also noticed that there were few places for Chicanos to exhibit their art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Alurista]], a poet, and artists [[Guillermo Aranda]] and [[Salvador Torres|Salvador Roberto Torres]], were all involved with MAYA, later to become M.E.C.H.A. and were very active in working towards both a cultural space as well as a space to create and show art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1968, the San Diego Parks and Recreation Department gave Torres permission to use the abandoned Ford Building in Balboa Park as a studio space for 6 months.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating the Future: Art and Los Angeles in the 1970s|last = Fallon|first = Michael|publisher = Counterpoint|date = 18 August 2014|isbn = 9781619024045|location = |pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UtHpBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT38&amp;dq=centro%20cultural%20de%20la%20raza%20balboa%20park&amp;pg=PT38#v=onepage&amp;q=centro%20cultural%20de%20la%20raza%20balboa%20park&amp;f=false|access-date = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torres invited other visual artists and eventually the Ballet Foklorico en Aztlan, a folkloric dance group led by the Enrique family to use the space.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those involved included Alurista, Ochoa and Torres as well as Guillermo Aranda, Ruben de Anda, Leticia de Baca, the Auguilar sisters, Tomas Casteneda, Mario Acevedo Torero, Luis Espinoza, Ricardo Gonzalez and Antonio Rivas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Ford Building by 1969 was a "major center of activities for San Diego's Chicano artists."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other artists such as Guillermo Rosete and musicians such as the Trio Moreno became involved at this time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They formally named themselves "Los Toltecas en Aztlán" in order to be able to create a more solid group identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Los Toltecas en Aztlán wrote this as their founding principle: "The Tolecas en Aztlán shall be constituted of all those Chicano Artists dedicated to Human Truth and Chicano Beauty, which in our belief can only be lived up to through Mutual Self-Respect, Self-Determination in our endeavors, and the Self-Sacrifice of our individual differences for the sake of a Centro Cultural de la Raza where our indigenous ancestral spirit of brotherhood, justice and peace can flourish in contemporary Chicano Art Forms."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Los Toltecas en Aztlán had forty members by 1970.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Plans were begun to convert the Ford Building into Centro Cultural de la Raza. First, Los Toltecas en Aztlán petitioned the city of San Diego to use the building to create a cultural center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proposal for the Centro went before city council, to the current mayor, Frank Curran, and to other Chicano organizations and interested individuals in order to gain support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The city of San Diego, however, had begun making plans to turn the Ford Building into an aerospace museum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Ochoa, the city and the "establishment" were uncomfortable with what the Toltecas were doing in Balboa Park.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://sandiegofreepress.org/2013/04/victor-ochoa-mural-maestro-of-chicano-park/|title = Victor Ochoa - Mural Maestro of Chicano Park|last = Gormlie|first = Frank|date = 26 April 2013|work = San Diego Free Press|access-date = 1 April 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111342/http://sandiegofreepress.org/2013/04/victor-ochoa-mural-maestro-of-chicano-park/|archivedate = 2 April 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "At one time there was 300 cars outside the Ford Building -- all Mexicans. They never saw so many Mexicans in Balboa Park before."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

At the same time that Los Toltecas en Aztlán were petitioning the city to create a cultural center, in another part of San Diego where there had once been a vibrant Hispanic [[barrio]], citizens were occupying the former neighborhood and demanding the city turn the space into a park.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Torres and other members of Los Toltecas en Aztlán were involved in this protest, calling the area [[Chicano Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://chicano-park.com/cpscbattleof.html|title = The Battle of Chicano Park: A Brief History of the Takeover|date = |accessdate = 30 March 2015|website = Chicano Park Steering Committee|publisher = |last = Anguiano|first = Marco}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicano Park]] protest and other issues became part of a new proposal, citing a great need to create Centro Cultural de la Raza.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The new proposal was brought to the city by Alurista, Torres, and Aranda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Despite this, the city attempted to evict the artists from the Ford Building. Los Toltecas en Aztlan refused to leave.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In October, the Chicano Federation of San Diego County became involved and helped Los Toltecas en Aztlán express their concerns to the city manager, Walter Hahn.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Los Toltecas en Aztlán refused to leave the Ford Building until another site was given them for the center. Eventually the city offered to give them an abandoned water tank that was originally built in 1914.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alurista was largely responsible for the final negotiations which included use of the new facility and a city contribution of $22,000 to the new building.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The monetary contribution from the city included improvements to the building such as installing lights, heaters, water and a wood floor for the Ballet Folklorico.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Los Toltecas en Aztlán moved into the new building in May 1971 and worked hard to get the building ready for a grand inauguration on July 11, 1971.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The grand opening ceremonies attracted over 500 people and included music, dance and an art exhibition inside the building.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first mural "La Dualidad" in the new Centro building was created by Aranda and a team of volunteers and was completed in 1984.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Outside of the building are murals by Mario Aguilar, Aranda, Barajas, Arturo Roman, Neto del Sol, David Avalos, Antonio de Hermosillo, Samuel Llamas, Antonio Perez and Ochoa.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Centro was known internationally as a dynamic cultural center where academics such as [[Shifra Goldman]], Tomas Ybarra Frausto and Chon Noriega could be found conversing with community members as well as artists such as Magu, Luis Valdez, [[Judy Baca]], Sergio Arau, [[Lalo Guerrero]], Jose Montoya, Barbara Carrasco, [[Gabino Palomares]] and El Vez. Groups that formed through the work of the Centro include: Ballet Folklórico en Aztlán, founded by Herminia Enrique; Treatro Meztizo and Trio Moreno, a musical group,  BAWTAF (The Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo). In addition countless artists, musicians, performers, writers, dancers and activists were nurtured at the Centro, including Culture Clash, [[Gronk (artist)|Gronk]], Guillermo Gomez Peña, Lalo Lopez Alcaraz, the [[Taco Shop Poets]], [[Yareli Arizmendi]], [[James Luna]], David Avalos, Dora Areola, Chicano Secret Service, Richard A. Lou, Robert J. Sanchez, and Isaac Artenstein - all of whom have achieved prominence in the arts and culture community.

== Boycott ==
A seven-year boycott (2000-2007) of the center was carried out by many artists, supporters, community members and even one of the founders, Ochoa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dispute left the Centro in a "tenuous state."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/sep/11/centro-cultural-de-la-raza-curators-resign/|title = Curators Resign at Centro Cultural de la Raza|last = Chute|first = James|date = 11 September 2014|work = UT San Diego|access-date = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements with changes made by new administrators of the Centro caused the rift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://aztlan.sdsu.edu/chicanohistory/chapter10/c10s18.html|title = What Was the Controversy Surrounding the Centro Cultural?|date = 7 November 2011|accessdate = 30 March 2015|website = San Diego Mexican &amp; Chicano History|publisher = San Diego State University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
As a cultural center, the Centro not only promotes creative expression in art and formal art classes, but also includes in its busy schedule a variety of workshops in danza folklórica as well as other [[interpretive dance]] forms, music, theater, spoken word, drumming and more. In addition, numerous public presentations including exhibitions, concerts, installations, theater, dance, spoken word and multimedia events take place at the Centro.

The Centro currently operates on a budget of $30,000 a year with no employees and only volunteers working for the organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/sep/20/centro-cultural-de-la-raza-centennial/|title = Centro Cultural on the Precipice|last = Chute|first = James|date = 20 September 2014|work = UT San Diego|access-date = 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4124">A '''choke pear''' or '''chocky-pear''' is an [[astringent]] [[fruit]].  The term is used for the fruit of any variety of [[pear]] which has an astringent taste and is difficult to swallow.&lt;ref name=Imperial&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language]]|author=John Ogilvie|authorlink=John Ogilvie (lexicographer)|publisher=The Century co.|year=1883|pages=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionnaire anglais-francais: Et Français-anglais|author=Abel Boyer and Nicholas Salmon|pages=133|year=1821|publisher=Tardieu-Denesle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==

One variety of choke pear is '''poire d'Angoisse''', a variety of pear that was grown in [[Angoisse]], a commune in the [[Arrondissement of Nontron]] in [[Dordogne]], [[France]], in the [[Middle Ages]], which was hard, bad tasting, and almost impossible to eat raw.&lt;ref name="avaler"&gt;{{cite web|title=Avaler des poires d'angoisse|url=http://www.mon-expression.info/index.php/avaler-des-poires-d-angoisse|work=Encyclopédie des Expressions|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Etudes Sur LA Condition De LA Classe Agricole Et L'Etat De L'Agriculture En Normandie Au Moyen Age|author=Leopold V. Delisle|year=1965|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=0-8337-0820-1|pages=501|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Académie française|L'Académie française]], the pear is "''si âpre et si revèche au goût qu'on a de la peine à l'avaler''" ("so harsh and crabbed of taste that one can only with difficulty swallow it").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionnaire étymologique|author=Pierre-Marie Quitard|pages=62|year=1842|location=Paris|publisher=P. Bertrand|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These qualities, and the common meaning of ''angoisse'' in [[French language]] ("anguish") apparently originated the French idiom ''avaler des poires d'angoisse'' ("swallow pears of Angoisse/anguish") meaning "to suffer great displeasures".&lt;ref name="avaler"/&gt;  Possibly because of this idiom, the names "[[choke pear (torture)|choke pear]]" and "pear of anguish" have been used for a gagging device allegedly used in Europe, sometime before the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue; a.k.a.

Dalechamps has identified this with the species of pear that [[Pliny the Elder]] listed as "ampullaceum" in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Natural History of Pliny|author=[[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]|year=1855|publisher=Henry G. Bohn|location=London|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It, like most sour-tasting pear cultivars, was most likely used to make [[perry]].

== Similar fruits ==

Similarly named trees with astringent fruits include the [[choke cherry]] (the common name for several species of [[cherry]] tree that grow in North America and whose fruits are small and bitter tasting: ''Prunus virginiana'', ''Prunus demissa'', and ''Prunus serotina'') and the '''choke plum'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Newfoundland English|author=George Morley Story and W.

'''Christian tourism''' is a subcategory of [[religious tourism]] which is geared towards [[Christians]]. As one of the largest branches of religious tourism, it is estimated that seven percent of the world's Christians—about 168 million people—are "on the move as pilgrims" each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/24/AR2007062401422.html |title=Seeking Answers With Field Trips in Faith |last=Jordan |first=Mary |date=June 25, 2007 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Christian tourism refers to the entire industry of Christian travel, tourism, and hospitality. In recent years it has grown to include not only Christians embarking individually or in groups on [[pilgrimage]]s and missionary travel, but also on religion-based cruises, leisure (fellowship) vacations, crusades, rallies, retreats, monastery visits/guest-stays and Christian camps, as well as visiting Christian tourist attractions.

==Christian pilgrimage==
{{Main|Christian pilgrimage}}
Each year millions of Christians travel on pilgrimage. The most popular pilgrim destination is the [[Abraham]]ic [[Holy Land]], or [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. Most Christian pilgrimage destinations are based on the [[Roman Catholic]] faith, especially shrines devoted to apparitions of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] such as: [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in Mexico, [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima]] in Portugal, and [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in France. There is also interest in pilgrimage to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] at the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in [[Rome]], the capital of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].

==Statistics==
Although no definitive study has been completed on Christian tourism, some segments of the industry have been measured:
* According to the Religious Conference Management Association, in 2006 more than 14.7 million people attended religious meetings (RCMA members), an increase of more than 10 million from 1994 with 4.4 million attendees. [http://meetingsnet.com/religiousconferencemanager/mag/meetings_rcma_member_survey_2/]
* The [[United Methodist Church]] experienced an increase of 455% in [[Volunteers in Mission]] between 1992 with almost 20,000 volunteers and 2006 with 110,000 volunteers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* The Christian Camp and Conference Association states that more than eight million people are involved in CCCA member camps and conferences, including more than 120,000 churches. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070624152129/http://www.ccca.org/public/about/aboutus.asp]
* Short-term missions draw 1.6 million participants annually. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0525/p01s01-ussc.html]
* Christian attractions including [[Sight &amp; Sound Theatre]] attracts 800,000 visitors a year while the [[Holy Land Experience]] and [[Focus on the Family]] welcome center each receives about 250,000 guests annually. [https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-01-26-faith-based-travel_x.htm] Recently launched Christian attractions include the [[Creation Museum]] and [[Billy Graham]] Library, both of which are expected to receive about 250,000 visitors each year as well.

'''Christopher''' "'''Kit'''" '''Lasch''' (1932–1994) was an American [[historian]], [[moral philosopher|moralist]], and [[social critic]] who was a history professor at the [[University of Rochester]]. Lasch sought to use history as a tool to awaken American society to the pervasiveness with which major institutions, public and private, were eroding the competence and independence of families and communities. He strove to create a historically informed social criticism that could teach Americans how to deal with rampant consumerism, proletarianization, and what he famously labeled the "culture of narcissism".

His books, including ''The New Radicalism in America'' (1965), ''Haven in a Heartless World'' (1977), ''[[The Culture of Narcissism]]'' (1979), ''The True and Only Heaven'' (1991), and ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'' (published posthumously in 1996) were widely discussed and reviewed. ''The Culture of Narcissism'' became a surprise best-seller and won the [[National Book Award]] in the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Current|category Current Interest]] (paperback).&lt;ref name=nba1980&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1980 "National Book Awards – 1980"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-09. &lt;br /&gt;There was a "Contemporary" or "Current" award category from 1972 to 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;

From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Award#History|National Book Award history]] there were dual awards for hardcover and paperback books in many categories. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including this one (September 1979), but its first edition (January 1979) was eligible in the same award year.&lt;!-- source for publication months is Barnes &amp; Noble http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/culture-of-narcissism-christopher-lasch/1102258604 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasch was always a critic of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]] and a historian of liberalism's discontents, but over time his political perspective evolved dramatically. In the 1960s, he was a [[neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] and acerbic critic of [[Cold War]] liberalism. During the 1970s, he supported [[cultural conservatism]] with a Marxian critique of capitalism, and drew on [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]-influenced [[critical theory]] to diagnose the ongoing deterioration that he perceived in American culture and politics. His writings are sometimes denounced by feminists&lt;ref&gt;Hartman (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and hailed by conservatives&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Beer, "On Christopher Lasch," ''Modern Age'', Fall 2005, Vol. 47 Issue 4, pp 330-343&lt;/ref&gt; for his apparent defense of the traditional{{clarify|date=October 2018}} family.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

He eventually concluded that an often unspoken but pervasive faith in "Progress" tended to make Americans resistant to many of his arguments. In his last major works he explored this theme in depth, suggesting that Americans had much to learn from the suppressed and misunderstood populist and artisan movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born on June 1, 1932, in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], Christopher Lasch came from a highly political family rooted in the left. His father, Robert Lasch, was a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] and journalist; in St. Louis he won a Pulitzer prize for editorials criticizing the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Brown, David (2009-08-01) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2009/aug/01/00022/ Cold War Without End] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130203191246/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2009/aug/01/00022/ |date=2013-02-03 }}, ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Zora Lasch (née Schaupp), his mother, who held a philosophy doctorate, worked as a social worker and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ1r7WIN1hYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Zora+Lasch#v=onepage&amp;q=Zora%20 | title = Hope in a Scattering Time: A Life of Christopher Lasch | isbn = 9780802817693 | author1 = Miller | first1 = Eric | date = 2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacoby1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacoby |first=Russell| year=1994 |title=Christopher Lasch (1932-1994) |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=97 |pages=121–123}}, p123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beer |first=Jeremy| year=2005 |title=On Christopher Lasch |journal=Modern Age | url=http://www.mmisi.org/ma/47_04/beer.pdf |pages=330–343|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasch was active in the arts and letters early, publishing a neighborhood newspaper while in grade school, and writing the fully orchestrated "Rumpelstiltskin, Opera in D Major" at the age of thirteen.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

===Career===
Lasch studied at [[Harvard University]], where he roomed with [[John Updike]], and [[Columbia University]], where he worked with [[William Leuchtenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasch, Christopher. Plain Style : A Guide to Written English. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hofstadter]] was also a significant influence. He contributed a Foreword to later editions of Hofstadter's ''[[The American Political Tradition]]'' and an article on Hofstadter in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' in 1973. He taught at the [[University of Iowa]] and then was a professor of [[history]] at the [[University of Rochester]] from 1970 until his death from cancer in 1994. Lasch also took a conspicuous public role. [[Russell Jacoby]] acknowledged this in writing that "I do not think any other historian of his generation moved as forcefully into the public arena".&lt;ref name="Jacoby1994" /&gt; In 1986 he appeared on Channel 4 television in discussion with [[Michael Ignatieff]] and [[Cornelius Castoriadis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/389470 Voices: The Culture of Narcissism, Modernity and Its Discontents.] Partial transcribed version available as: "Beating the Retreat into Private Life," ''The Listener'', 27 March 1986: 20-21. http://www.magmaweb.fr/spip/IMG/pdf_CC-Lasch-BBC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, Lasch identified himself as a socialist, but one who found influence not just in the writers of the time such as [[C. Wright Mills]] but also in earlier independent voices such as [[Dwight Macdonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Lasch| first =Christopher| title =The True and Only Heaven: Progress and its Critics| publisher =Norton| year =1991| isbn =0-393-30795-6| page =26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasch became further influenced by writers of the [[Frankfurt School]] and the early ''[[New Left Review]]'' and felt that "Marxism seemed indispensable to me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Lasch| first =Christopher| title=The True and Only Heaven: Progress and its Critics| publisher =Norton| year =1991| isbn =0-393-30795-6| page =29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, however, he became disenchanted with the Left's belief in progress—a theme treated later by his student [[David F. Noble|David Noble]]—and increasingly identified this belief as the factor which explained the Left's failure to thrive despite the widespread discontent and conflict of the times.

At this point Lasch began to formulate what would become his signature style of social critique: a [[syncretic politics|syncretic]] synthesis of [[Sigmund Freud]] and the strand of [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] thinking that remained deeply suspicious of [[capitalism]] and its effects on [[tradition|traditional institutions]].

Besides Leuchtenburg, Hofstadter, and Freud, Lasch was especially influenced by [[Orestes Brownson]], [[Henry George]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], and [[Philip Rieff]].&lt;ref&gt;Beer, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable group of graduate students worked at the University of Rochester with Lasch, [[Eugene Genovese]], and, for a time, [[Herbert Gutman]], including [[Leon Fink]], [[Russell Jacoby]], Bruce Levine, [[David F. Noble|David Noble]], [[Maurice Isserman]], William Leach, Rochelle Gurstein, [[Kevin Mattson]], and Catherine Tumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Misa | first = Thomas J. | title = David F.

===Death===
After seemingly successful cancer surgery in 1992, Lasch was diagnosed with metastatic cancer in 1993. Upon learning that it was unlikely to significantly prolong his life, he refused chemotherapy, observing that it would rob him of the energy he needed to continue writing and teaching.  To one persistent specialist, he wrote: "I despise the cowardly clinging to life, purely for the sake of life, that seems so deeply ingrained in the American temperament."&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; Lasch succumbed to cancer in his [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], [[New York (state)|New York]], home on February 14, 1994, at age 61.&lt;ref name=Beer&gt;Beer, Jeremy (2006-03-27)[http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2006/mar/27/00021/ The Radical Lasch], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
===''The New Radicalism in America''===

Lasch's earliest argument, anticipated partly by Hofstadter's concern with the cycles of fragmentation among radical movements in the United States, was that American radicalism had at some point in the past become socially untenable.  Members of "the [[Left-wing politics|Left]]" had abandoned their former commitments to economic justice and suspicion of power, to assume professionalized roles and to support commoditized lifestyles which hollowed out communities' self-sustaining ethics.  His first major book, ''The New Radicalism in America: The Intellectual as a Social Type'', published in 1965 (with a promotional blurb from Hofstadter), expressed those ideas in the form of a bracing critique of twentieth-century liberalism's efforts to accrue power and restructure society, while failing to follow up on the promise of the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;David S. Brown, ''Beyond the Frontier: The Midwestern Voice in American Historical Writing'' (2009), 154&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his books, even the more strictly historical ones, include such sharp criticism of the priorities of alleged "radicals" who represented merely extreme formations of a rapacious capitalist ethos.

His basic thesis about the family, which he first expressed in 1965 and explored for the rest of his career, was:
{{quote|When government was centralized and politics became national in scope, as they had to be to cope with the energies let loose by industrialism, and when public life became faceless and anonymous and society an amorphous democratic mass, the old system of paternalism (in the home and out of it) collapsed, even when its semblance survived intact. The patriarch, though he might still preside in splendor at the head of his board, had come to resemble an emissary from a government which had been silently overthrown. The mere theoretical recognition of his authority by his family could not alter the fact that the government which was the source of all his ambassadorial powers had ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Lasch, ''The New Radicalism in America, 1889–1963'' (1965) p 111&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''The Culture of Narcissism''===

Lasch's most famous work, ''[[The Culture of Narcissism|The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations]]'' (1979), sought to relate the hegemony of modern-day capitalism to an encroachment of a "therapeutic" mindset into social and family life similar to that already theorized by [[Philip Rieff]]. Lasch posited that social developments in the 20th century (e.g., World War II and the rise of consumer culture in the years following) gave rise to a [[narcissistic]] personality structure, in which individuals’ fragile self-concepts had led, among other things, to a fear of commitment and lasting relationships (including religion), a dread of aging (i.e., the 1960s and 1970s "[[youth culture]]") and a boundless admiration for fame and celebrity (nurtured initially by the motion picture industry and furthered principally by television). He claimed, further, that this personality type conformed to structural changes in the world of work (e.g., the decline of agriculture and manufacturing in the US and the emergence of the "information age"). With those developments, he charged, inevitably there arose a certain therapeutic sensibility (and thus dependence) that, inadvertently or not, undermined older notions of self-help and individual initiative.  By the 1970s even pleas for "individualism" were desperate and essentially ineffectual cries which expressed a deeper lack of meaningful individuality.

===''The True and Only Heaven''===

Most explicitly in ''The True and Only Heaven'', Lasch developed a critique of social change among the middle classes in the US, explaining and seeking to counteract the fall of elements of  "[[Populism#Populism in the United States of America|populism]]". He sought to rehabilitate this populist or [[Producerism|producerist]] alternative tradition: "The tradition I am talking about&amp;nbsp;... tends to be skeptical of programs for the wholesale redemption of society&amp;nbsp;... It is very radically democratic and in that sense it clearly belongs on the Left. But on the other hand it has a good deal more respect for tradition than is common on the Left, and for religion too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brawer |first=Peggy |author2=Sergio Benvenuto | year=1993 |title=An interview with Christopher Lasch |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=97 |pages=124–135 |doi=10.3817/0993097124 |volume=1993}}, p125&lt;/ref&gt; And said that: "... any movement that offers any real hope for the future will have to find much of its moral inspiration in the plebeian radicalism of the past and more generally in the indictment of progress, large-scale production and bureaucracy that was drawn up by a long line of moralists whose perceptions were shaped by the producers' view of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lasch |first=Christopher | year=1991 |title=Liberalism and Civic Virtue |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=88 |pages=57–68 |doi=10.3817/0691088057 |volume=1991}}, p68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of progressivism and libertarianism===

By the 1980s, Lasch had poured scorn on the whole spectrum of contemporary mainstream American political thought, angering liberals with attacks on progressivism and [[feminism]]. He wrote that
{{quote|A feminist movement that respected the achievements of women in the past would not disparage housework, motherhood or unpaid civic and neighborly services. It would not make a paycheck the only symbol of accomplishment.&amp;nbsp;... It would insist that people need self-respecting honorable callings, not glamorous careers that carry high salaries but take them away from their families.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Kara (2006-04-24) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2006/apr/24/00007/ Room of Her Own], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The liberal{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} journalist [[Susan Faludi]] dubbed him explicitly anti-feminist for his criticism of the abortion rights movement and opposition to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Faludi, Susan.  ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women'', p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;  But Lasch viewed Ronald Reagan's conservatism as the antithesis of tradition and moral responsibility.  Lasch was not generally sympathetic to the cause of what was then known as the [[New Right]], particularly those elements of [[libertarianism]] most evident in its platform; he detested the encroachment of the capitalist marketplace into all aspects of American life.

Lasch rejected the dominant political constellation that emerged in the wake of the New Deal in which economic centralization and social tolerance formed the foundations of American liberal ideals, while also rebuking the diametrically opposed synthetic conservative ideology fashioned by [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] and [[Russell Kirk]].  Lasch also was surprisingly critical and at times dismissive toward his closest contemporary kin in social philosophy, [[communitarianism]] as elaborated by [[Amitai Etzioni]].  Only populism satisfied Lasch's criteria of economic justice (not necessarily equality, but minimizing class-based difference), participatory democracy, strong social cohesion and moral rigor; yet populism had made major mistakes during the New Deal and increasingly been co-opted by its enemies and ignored by its friends.  For instance, he praised the early work and thought of [[Martin Luther King]] as exemplary of American populism; yet in Lasch's view, King fell short of this radical vision by embracing in the last few years of his life an essentially bureaucratic solution to ongoing racial stratification.

He explained in one of his books ''The Minimal Self'',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lasch: The Minimal Self. W.W. Norton &amp; Company: New York and London, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; "it goes without saying that sexual equality in itself remains an eminently desirable objective&amp;nbsp;...". In ''Women and the Common Life'',&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lasch: Women and the Common Life. W.W. Norton &amp; Company: New York and London, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Lasch clarified that urging women to abandon the household and forcing them into a position of economic dependence, in the workplace, pointing out the importance of professional careers  does not entail liberation, as long as these careers are governed by the requirements of corporate economy.

===''The Revolt of the Elites: And the Betrayal of Democracy''===

In his last months, he worked closely with his daughter Elisabeth to complete ''The Revolt of the Elites: And the Betrayal of Democracy'', published in 1994, in which he "excoriated the new [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] class, a group that had achieved success through the upward-mobility of education and career and that increasingly came to be defined by rootlessness, cosmopolitanism, a thin sense of obligation, and diminishing reservoirs of [[patriotism]]," and "argued that this new class 'retained many of the vices of aristocracy without its virtues,' lacking the sense of 'reciprocal obligation' that had been a feature of the old order."&lt;ref&gt;Deneen, Patrick (2010-08-01) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2010/aug/01/00033/ When Red States Get Blue] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913065619/http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2010/aug/01/00033/ |date=2012-09-13 }}, ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Christopher Lasch analyzes&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The Revolt of the Masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]]. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20 percent in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.

Globalization, according to the historian, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalization of society tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting&amp;nbsp;... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information - make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".

Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

In addition, he finalized his intentions for the essays to be included in ''Women and the Common Life: Love, Marriage, and Feminism'', which was published, with his daughter's introduction, in 1997.

A '''Ciguapa''' (pronounced see-GWAH-pah) is a mythological creature of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] folklore. They are commonly described as having human female form with brown or dark blue skin, backward facing feet, and very long manes of smooth, glossy hair that covers their otherwise naked bodies. They supposedly inhabit the high mountains of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

== Overview ==
These creatures have nocturnal habits. Also, due to the position of their feet, one can never quite tell from which direction the beings are moving from by looking at their footprints. Some people believe that they bring death, and it is said that one should not look them in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Liza Phoenix| url=http://www.lizaphoenix.com/encyclopedia/ciguapa.shtml| title= Ciguapa| publisher= lizaphoenix| date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise the person is at risk of being bewitched permanently. Also, the only vocalization made by ciguapas is said to be a kind of whine or chirping.

Ciguapas are considered to be magical beings, beautiful in appearance to some, yet horrendous to others. All sources agree that they are wild creatures. They are compared in many cases to mermaids: beautiful yet cruel, and far from innocent. Deceitful and ready to capture the wayward traveler, they are said that they are so beautiful as to lure men into the forest, even though following footprints is misleading, to make love with them only to kill them afterwards. Even today, one can still find inhabitants who confirm having sighted a ciguapa.

Lore states that the only way to capture a ciguapa is by tracking them at night, during a [[full moon]], with a black and white [[polydactylic]]  dog (called ''cinqueño'' dog).&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many believe that the myth of the ciguapa is of [[Taíno people|Taino]] origin, it has been argued that is probably of more recent concoction, being possibly attributed to African beliefs brought to the island by enslaved peoples during the colonial period. More to the point, no known Taino artifacts or lore make reference to any creature even remotely similar to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the legend may have originated from other myths, as distant as the [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] ''Curupí'' or the [[Hindu]] [[Churel]], which was described by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in ''My Own True Ghost Story'' as having traits amazingly similar to those of the ciguapa. Nonetheless, the Hindu hypothesis may be far-fetched since there is no way to ascertain how this story got to the Dominican Republic during the nineteenth century, when no cultural exchange whatsoever occurred between these nations.

A Dominican film called "''El Mito de la Ciguapa''" (The Myth of the Ciguapa) is set to be produced by [[Xenda Films]].

{{wiktionary}}

'''Critique''' is a [[wikt:method|method]] of disciplined, systematic study of a written or oral [[discourse]]. Although critique is commonly understood as fault finding and negative judgment,&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"&gt;[[Rodolphe Gasché]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_CZVDv6bdXIC&amp;pg=PA12 ''The honor of thinking: critique, theory, philosophy''] pp. 12–13 quote: {{quotation|Let us also remind ourselves of the fact that throughout the eighteenth century, which Kant, in ''Critique of Pure Reason'', labeled "in especial degree, the age of criticism" and to which our use of "critique", today remains largely indebted, critique was above all critique of prejudice and established authority, and hence was intimately tied to a conception of the human being as capable of self-thinking, hence authonomous, and free from religious and political authorities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can also involve merit recognition, and in the philosophical tradition it also means a methodical practice of doubt.&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"/&gt; The contemporary sense of critique has been largely influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] critique of prejudice and authority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and political authorities.&lt;ref name="Gasche07p12"/&gt;

The term ''critique'' derives, via French, from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|κριτική}} ({{transl|grc|ISO|kritikē}}), meaning "the faculty of judgment", that is, discerning the value of persons or things.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{OED|critick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critique is also known as major [[logic]], as opposed to minor [[logic]] or [[dialectic]]s.

== Critique in philosophy ==
Philosophy is the application of critical thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, and is the disciplined practice of processing the ''theory/praxis problem''. In [[philosophy|philosophical]] contexts, such as law or academics, critique is most influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s use of the term to mean a reflective examination of the validity and limits of a human capacity or of a set of philosophical claims. This has been extended in [[modern philosophy]] to mean a systematic inquiry into the conditions and consequences of a [[concept]], a [[theory]], a [[discipline]], or an approach and/or attempt to understand the limitations and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of that. A ''critical perspective'', in this sense, is the opposite of a [[dogma]]tic one. Kant wrote:

{{quote|We deal with a concept dogmatically ... if we consider it as contained under another concept of the object which constitutes a principle of reason and determine it in conformity with this. But we deal with it merely critically if we consider it only in reference to our cognitive faculties and consequently to the subjective conditions of thinking it, without undertaking to decide anything about its object.&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' section 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later thinkers such as [[Hegel]] used the word 'critique' in a broader way than Kant's sense of the word, to mean the systematic inquiry into the limits of a [[doctrine]] or ''set'' of concepts. This referential expansion led, for instance, to the formulation of the idea of social critique, such as arose after [[Karl Marx]]'s theoretical work delineated in his [[Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]] (1859), which was a critique of the then-current models of economic theory and thought of that time. Further critique can then be applied after the fact, by using thorough critique as a basis for new argument. The idea of ''critique'' is elemental to legal, aesthetic, and literary theory and such practices, such as in the analysis and evaluation of [[writing]]s such as pictorial, musical, or expanded textual works.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of philosophical conceptions of critique from Spinoza to Rancière see K. de Boer and R. Sonderegger (eds.), ''Conceptions of Critique in Modern and Contemporary Philosophy'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique vs criticism ==
In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between 'critique' and '[[criticism]]': the two words both translate as ''critique'', ''Kritik'', and ''critica'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"&gt;[[Gianni Vattimo]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=i7QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 ''Postmodern criticism: postmodern critique''] in David Wood (1990) ''Writing the future'', pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; In the English language, according to philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]], ''criticism'' is used more frequently to denote [[literary criticism]] or [[art criticism]], that is the interpretation and evaluation of literature and art; while ''critique'' may be used to refer to more general and profound writing as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of pure reason]]''.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt; Another proposed distinction is that critique is never personalized nor [[ad hominem]], but is instead the analyses of the structure of the thought in the content of the item critiqued.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt; This analysis then offers by way of the critique method either a rebuttal or a suggestion of further expansion upon the problems presented by the topic of that specific written or oral argumentation. Even authors that believe there might be a distinction suggest that there is some ambiguity that is still unresolved.&lt;ref name="Vattimo90p57"/&gt;

==Critical theory==
{{main|Critical theory}}
Marx's work inspired the '[[Frankfurt School]]' of  [[critical theory]], now best exemplified in the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ingram, ''Habermas: Introduction and Analysis'', New York: Cornell University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, helped inspire the [[cultural studies]] form of social critique, which treats cultural products and their reception as evidence of wider social ills such as [[racism]] or [[gender bias]]. Social critique has been further extended in the work of [[Michel Foucault]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Was ist Kritik?'', Berlin: Merve Verlag 1992. {{ISBN|3-88396-093-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', Notre Dame: University of Notre Dama Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In their different and radically contrasting ways, MacIntyre and Foucault go well beyond the original Kantian meaning of the term ''critique'' in contesting legitimatory accounts of social power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9912">The '''Dante Society of America''' was founded in 1881 through the leadership of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], who in turn served as the society's first three presidents.  One of the oldest scholarly societies in North America, the DSA predates both the [[Modern Language Association]], founded in 1883, and the [[American Historical Association]], founded in 1884. The society's mission, first formulated at its founding and now renewed and reinvigorated for the twenty-first century,  is to encourage the study and appreciation of the time, life, works, and cultural legacy of [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dantesociety.org/|title=Welcome|date=|publisher=Dante Society|accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Deutsche Dante-Gesellschaft (founded in 1865) it is the second-oldest scholarly organization devoted to the study of this medieval Italian poet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/publisher/dsa Dante Society of America.] JSTOR. Retrieved 10 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dante Society of America is also one of the first scholarly societies in the United States to welcome women among its founding members. The current president is [http://italian.berkeley.edu/people/albert-ascoli/ Albert Russell Ascoli] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Early History==
The society was formally established in 1881 under the leadership of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], who also served as its first three presidents.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dantesociety.org/about-society|title=About the Society|last=|first=|date=2014-01-09|website=|publisher=Dante Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the impetus of Longfellow, both as a translator and as an educator, the Dante Society of America might never have come into being.  Scholar [[Karl Witte]] had initiated and sustained an early Deutsche Dante-Gesellschaft in Germany for a dozen years before it ceased its activities in 1877. One year earlier, a similar group had come together in Oxford, with scholar Edward Moore at its helm, but it was Longfellow, with his translation of the Italian epic poem, who first brought the Americans [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]] to his table at Craigie House (now a [https://www.nps.gov/long/index.htm national historic site]) to discuss Dante.

While Longfellow was designated the first president of the Society, the actual inauguration did not take place until May 16, 1882, two months after Longfellow's death. There, the forty-eight members mourned the loss of Longfellow, while electing Lowell to continue the leadership of the Society.

Founded in Cambridge, Mass., the society has always been closely associated with [[Harvard University]], due in no small part to the lasting influence of these three professors. Harvard was one of the first American universities to make instruction in modern languages (in addition to classical languages) part of its curriculum. [[Edward Everett Hale]], an early member of the Society, remembered his Italian lessons and Longfellow's lectures at Harvard: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Longfellow read the whole of Dante with us and we were well prepared for this by what we had read with [[Pietro Bachi|[Pietro] Bachi]] ... And I can say that when we came to hear Longfellow lecture, we were more than prepared for his lectures by the very thorough work which Bachi had done in this same subject with us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dante in America. A historical and bibliographical study.|last=Koch|first=Theodore|publisher=Ginn and Company|year=1896|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Russell Lowell took over Longfellow's course upon his resignation in 1855. Twenty-two years later, he would resign his chair at Harvard to accept the appointment of United States Minister to Spain and pass the course on to a professor in the history of art, Charles Eliot Norton. Norton's classes were described by another early member of the Society, [[William Roscoe Thayer]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;To read Dante with Norton was almost an act of worship. There was in his voice something wonderfully stirring and wholly incommunicable. As he reached a favorite passage his face became radiant and his tones more tender. He explained fully from every side,-- verbal, textual, literary, spiritual ... In his interpretation of Dante Norton had one immense advantage which neither Lowell nor any other English-speaking Dantist has possessed: he had a specialist's knowledge of mediaeval art. So the thirteenth century lived for him not merely in its poetry, theology, and chronicles, but in paintings and statues in its churches and town halls, and its palaces and dwellings ... he could compass the whole circle of experience and the ideals of that world of which the Divine Comedy is the supreme expression in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Letters of Charles Eliot Norton|last=Norton|first=Charles Eliot|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1913|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another early goal of the Society was to create a specialized library of Dante literature. Few works by Italian scholars on Dante were available in the United States. The three volume commentary on the Comedy by [[:it:Giosafatte Biagioli|G. Biagioli]] first published in Paris in 1816 and later reissued by Neapolitan publisher Rondinella in 1868, could be found on the [http://fig.lib.harvard.edu/fig/?bib=007459877 shelves] of the Harvard College Library. So too the 1887 edition of Pietro Fraticelli's commentary, originally published in 1860 by G. Barbera of Florence. These might have been supplemented by [[Cesare Balbo]]'s ''Vita di Dante'', or some of [[Ugo Foscolo|Foscolo's]] essays, but it was under the direction of [[William Coolidge Lane]], an assistant librarian at the Harvard College Library and member of the Society, that an extensive scholarly collection began to take shape.  Charles Eliot Norton's bequest would both broaden and deepen the collection. A 1890 catalog of the collection compiled by Lane and issued by the Harvard Library listed over 1200 volumes on Dante, including over three hundred different editions of the Divine Comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=William Coolidge|date=1890|title="The Dante Collection in the Harvard College Library and the Boston Public Library"|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044058115965|journal=Bibliographical Contributions|volume=XXIV|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the collection at Harvard is regarded as the third largest on the subject in the world.&lt;ref name="trecc"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dante-society-of-america_%28Enciclopedia-Dantesca%29/ "Dante Society Of America"], [[Tommaso Pisanti]], ''Enciclopedia Dantesca'' (1970). Treccani. Retrieved 10 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Women Members ==
From its founding, membership in the Dante Society of America was open to women. This was unusual for the time, as membership in other early scholarly societies in North America such as the [[American Philosophical Society]] and the [[Modern Language Association]] were not generally open to women. The first annual report of the Society listed Miss S.L. Butler, Mrs. C. Dupee, Miss Heloise Durant, Mrs. S. A. Gordon, Miss Fannie L. Payson, and Mrs. A.L. Wister as founding members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 16, 1882|title=First Annual Report of the Dante Society|jstor=40114201|journal=Annual Report of the Dante Society of America|volume=1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, Yale Ph.D. and Smith professor [[Mary Augusta Scott]] would become the first woman to serve on the Executive Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Twenty-first Annual Report of the Dante Society of America|jstor=40165834|journal=Annual Report of the Dante Society of America|volume=21|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was followed by Margaret Jackson in 1907, Anna Lyman Mason Gray in 1913 and Katherine V. Spencer in 1915. Other early female members of note include [[Anna Eliot Ticknor]], [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]], and [[Caroline Healey Dall]].

==Publications==
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Society  published an important series of concordances: E.A. Fay, ''Concordance of the Divine Comedy'' (1888); E.S. Sheldon and A.C. White, ''Concordanza delle opere italiane in prosa e del canzoniere di D.'' (1905); E.K. Rand, E.H. Wilkins, and A.C. White, ''D. Alagherii operum latinorum concordantiae'' (1912); E.H. Wilkins and T.G. Bergin, ''Concordance to the D. C.'' (1965).&lt;ref name=trecc/&gt;

Today the Society produces the peer-reviewed journal, ''Dante Studies,'' under the editorship of [https://rll.uchicago.edu/faculty/steinberg Justin Steinberg,]  published by [[Johns Hopkins University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/dante-studies Dante Studies.] Johns Hopkins University Press.

'''Daria Andreyevna Khaltourina''' ({{lang-ru|Дáрья Андрéевна Халтýрина}}; born 4 January 1979 in [[Chelyabinsk]]) is a Russian sociologist, anthropologist, demographer, and a public figure.  She is the head of the Group of the Monitoring of Global and Regional Risks of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], co-chairperson of the Russian Coalition for Alcohol Control,&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2009/0375/nauka02.php Круглый стол "Влияние государственной политики производства алкоголя на смертность населения: законодательный аспект"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as  the Russian Coalition for Tobacco Control. She is a laureate of the Russian Science Support Foundation Award in "The Best Economists of the Russian Academy of Sciences" nomination (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;page=Book&amp;id=37485 URSS.ru – Buy the book: Korotayev A., Khaltourina D. / Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends in Africa / Korotayev A., Khaltourina D. / IS...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field she has proposed one of the most convincing mathematical explanations for [[Heinz von Foerster|von Foerster's]] [[Doomsday Equation]].&lt;ref name=cliodynamics&gt;Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

Moscow: URSS, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with her colleagues, Artemy Malkov and [[Andrey Korotayev]], she has shown that till the 1970s the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] growth of the [[world population]] was accompanied by [[Quadratic growth|quadratic]]-hyperbolic growth of the world [[GDP]], and developed a number of [[mathematical model]]s describing both this phenomenon, and the [[World-system theory|World System]] withdrawal from the blow-up regime observed in the recent decades. The hyperbolic growth of the [[world population]] and quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP observed till the 1970s have been correlated by him and his colleagues to a non-linear second order [[positive feedback]] between the [[demographic]] growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows: technological growth – increase in the [[carrying capacity]] of land for people – demographic growth – more people – more potential inventors – acceleration of technological growth – accelerating growth of the carrying capacity – the faster [[population growth]] – accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors – faster technological growth – hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.academia.edu/32757085/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics._Models_of_the_World_System_Development._Moscow_KomKniga_URSS_2006 '''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth'''].

[[Image:Russian Cross ENG.jpg|thumb|right|240px|"''Russian Cross''"; the black curve reflects the death rate dynamics, the {{color|#FF3300|red one}} corresponds to the birth rate (per thousand)]]
In collaboration with Andrey Korotayev she has made a significant contribution to the study of the factors of the [[Russian Cross|current Russian demographic crisis]]. They have demonstrated that post-Soviet Russia experiences one of the world's highest prevalence of alcohol-related problems, which contributes to high mortality rates in this region. Reduction in alcohol-related problems in Russia can have strong effects on mortality decline. They have analyzed the plausibility of application of general principles of alcohol policy translated in the [[Russian Federation]]. Khaltourina has shown that alcohol policy approaches could be implemented in the same ways as they have been in other countries. In addition, according to Khaltourina, there should be special attention to decreasing distilled spirits consumption, illegal alcohol production, nonbeverage alcohol consumption, and enforcement of current governmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=376&amp;Itemid=1 Russian Demographic Crisis in Cross-National Perspective.

==Myths, genes, and deep history==
Khaltourina was also one of the pioneers (together with Andrey Korotayev) of the study of correlation between spatial distributions of [[folklore]]-mythological motifs and genetic markers, as well as linguistic and sociostructural characteristics, and produced in this area significant results with respect to the [[deep history]] reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/32351421/%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%84%D1%8B_%D0%B8_%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B._%D0%93%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9C._%D0%9B%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC_2011_ ''Myths and Genes.

== Literacy and the Spirit of Capitalism ==

Khaltourina and her colleagues have demonstrated that [[Protestantism]] has indeed influenced positively the [[capitalist]] development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" (as was suggested by [[Max Weber]]) but rather through the promotion of literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([https://www.academia.edu/15328502/Reconsidering_Weber_Literacy_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]). P.87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|left|150px]] They draw attention to the fact that the ability to read was essential for [[Protestants]] (unlike [[Catholics]]) to perform their religious duty − to read the [[Bible]]. The reading of Holy Scripture was not necessary for Catholic laymen. The edict of the Toulouse [[Synod]] (1229) prohibited the Catholic laymen from possessing copies of the Bible. Soon after that, a decision by the Tarragon Synod spread this prohibition to ecclesiastic people as well. In 1408, the Oxford Synod absolutely prohibited translations of the Holy Scripture. From the very beginning, Protestant groups did not accept this prohibition. Thus, [[Martin Luther|Luther]] translated in 1522–1534 first the [[New Testament]], and then the [[Old Testament]], into German, so that any German-speaking person could read the Holy Scripture in his or her native language. Moreover, the Protestants viewed reading the Holy Scripture as a religious duty of any Christian. As a result, the level of literacy and education was, in general, higher for Protestants than it was for Catholics and for followers of other confessions that did not provide religious stimuli for learning literacy. It has been shown that literate populations have many more opportunities to obtain and utilize the achievements of modernization than illiterate ones. On the other hand, literate people could be characterized by a greater innovative-activity level, which provides opportunities for [[modernization]], development, and economic growth. Empirical tests performed by Korotayev and his colleagues have confirmed the presence of a rather strong and highly significant [[correlation]] between the early introduction of mass literacy and subsequent high rates of capitalist economic development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]).

'''Empègues''' are small images [[stencil]]led on doorways in southern [[France]].&lt;ref name=beau/&gt; The empègue symbolises that the household has contributed to groups of youths gathering funds for celebrations each August.&lt;ref name=les/&gt;

The drawings are made by the youths of a village and are said to date from the early part of the twentieth century when the local male youths would be conscripted into the military. [[Conscription]] is no longer practised in France but the tradition continues. The images are of traditional subjects which symbolise the local area. In the [[Petite Camargue]] the images frequently involve horses, flamingoes and of course bulls, because of the local version of bullfighting ''([[Course_camarguaise#French|Course camarguaise]])''.&lt;ref name=beau/&gt; In the version of bullfighting licensed in France the bull is merely decorated with prizes which youths attempt to steal from the long-horned bull. The bull gets to fight another day.

==Etymology==
The word is said to have derived from a word in [[Occitan]], empeguar, which means ''"stick"''.&lt;ref name=beau&gt;[http://www.beauvoisin2008.fr/fr/beauvoisin-un-avenir-pour-tous-a-beauvoisin-franquevaux.php Beauvoisin 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112133654/http://www.beauvoisin2008.fr/fr/beauvoisin-un-avenir-pour-tous-a-beauvoisin-franquevaux.php |date=2008-11-12 }},  [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.beauvoisin2008.fr/fr/beauvoisin-un-avenir-pour-tous-a-beauvoisin-franquevaux.php&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DEmp%25C3%25A8gue%26start%3D30%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26channel%3Ds%26rls%3Dcom.google:en-US:official%26sa%3DN%26pwst%3D1 translation], accessed 15 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish the meaning is to mark with pitch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomisimo.org/dictionary/spanish_english/empegar Spanish-English dictionary], tomisino.org, accessed 15 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion is that it comes from Pegare - the word for paste. The original Empègues were made from a mixture of soot and paste.&lt;ref name=les/&gt;

==Detail==
The images frequently include the abbreviation V.L.J. which stands for ''Vive La Jeunesse'' and the year of creation. In this way it is possible to date the development of the designs over many years. The samples included here date back over 40 years to 1964 (when conscription was still practised). Many of these images are from the village of Beauvoisin, but they could have come from any of the villages in Southern France where many of the smallest villages will have their own arena for bullfighting.

Groups are formed which fund raise for the season of celebrations of youth called the [[aubade (festival)|aubade]] in August.&lt;ref name=les/&gt; Groups will form to support their teams, to gather funds and to place their empègues around their area and at their base.&lt;ref name=ver&gt;[http://vergeze.24hactus.com/archive/2008/07/24/fete-votive-le-programme-de-la-journee1.html La jeunesse de la Fête Votive 2008 sera sur tous les fronts!], 24 July 2008, [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://vergeze.24hactus.com/archive/2008/07/24/fete-votive-le-programme-de-la-journee1.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DEmp%25C3%25A8gue%26start%3D30%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26channel%3Ds%26rls%3Dcom.google:en-US:official%26sa%3DN%26pwst%3D1 translation], Vergèze 24Hactive.com, accessed 15 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the images is to record which houses have contributed to the funds for the festival. This is why the images vary from year to year and why the design is important. The Empègue is the ''brand'' of the group that collected money from you.&lt;ref name=les&gt;[http://www.leschantiersboitenoire.com/artiste-texte.php?id=9&amp;idTxt=35 Blasons, plis mimétiques et topologiques], Christian Besson, LesChantiersBoiteNoire.com, August 2007, [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.leschantiersboitenoire.com/artiste-texte.php%3Fid%3D9%26idTxt%3D35&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DEmp%25C3%25A8gue%26start%3D40%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26channel%3Ds%26rls%3Dcom.google:en-US:official%26sa%3DN%26pwst%3D1 translation] accessed 15 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generative art''' refers to [[art]] that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the [[Generative systems|generative system]] represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

"Generative art" often refers to [[algorithmic art]] (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork), but artists can also make it using systems of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mechanics]] and [[robotics]], [[smart materials]], manual [[randomization]], [[mathematics]], [[data mapping]], [[symmetry]], [[Tessellation|tiling]], and more.

== History ==

The use of the word "generative" in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of "[[Artificial DNA]]" defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of [[autonomous robot|autonomous systems]], required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named "emergent". [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term "generative art" in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by [[Georg Nees]] and [[Frieder Nake]] in 1965:&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boden, Margaret |author2=Edmonds, Ernest |author1link=Margaret Boden |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233128802_What_is_generative_art |title=What is Generative Art? |journal=Digital Creativity |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1/2 |pages=21–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 {{quotation | The  terms  "generative art"  and  "computer  art"  have been  used  in  tandem,  and  more  or  less interchangeably, since the very earliest days.&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;}}

The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled "Generative Computergrafik".&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later.&lt;ref name=Nake12&gt;{{cite web |last=Nake |first=Frieder |title=Georg Nees: Generative Computergrafik |url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/node/3280 |publisher=University of Bremen |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was "computer-grafik".&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Georg; Bense, Max: ''computer-grafik''; Edition Rot 19; Stuttgart, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; "Generative art" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including [[Manfred Mohr]].&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; The term "Generative Art" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the "Generative Art" conference in Milan in 1998.

The term has also been used to describe geometric [[abstract art]] where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practised by the Argentinian artists Eduardo McEntyre and Miguel Ángel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as "Hunsy Belmood" and "Edward Larsocchi." In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled 'Generative Art Forms' at the [[Queen's University, Belfast]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Art'', Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. A. ''Glossary of art, architecture, and design since 1945 (3rd ed.)'', London; Boston: Library Association Publishing; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] created a department called "Generative Systems." As described by [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Sonia Landy. ''Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas'', Leonardo, 16(2), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Clauser &lt;ref&gt;Clauser, H. R. ''Towards a Dynamic, Generative Computer Art'', Leonardo, 21(2), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art:

 {{quotation | It should be evident from the above description of the evolution of generative art that process (or structuring) and change (or transformation) are among its most definitive features, and that these features and the very term 'generative' imply dynamic development and motion. ...

(the result) is not a creation by the artist but rather the product of the generative process - a self-precipitating structure. }}

In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book ''Citta' Aleatorie''.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C.  Citta' Aleatorie, Masson Publisher 1989 "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/cittaaleatorie_book.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Franke referred to "generative mathematics" as "the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images."&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W.''Mathematics As an Artistic-Generative Principle'', Leonardo, Supplemental Issue, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s [[Brian Eno]] popularized the terms [[generative music]] and generative systems, making a connection with earlier [[experimental music]] by [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Eno, B. ''[http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html  Generative Music]'', In Motion Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross-disciplinary perspectives.  
The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C. and Colabella, E. ed.s "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/ga98_book.htm Generative Art]", Dedalo&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~iterate/FI/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
On-line discussion has centred around the eu-gene mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727083144/http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field.&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  These activities have more recently been joined by the [http://www.generatorx.no/generatorx-introduction/ Generator.x] conference in Berlin starting in 2005.
In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasathj.com  GASATHJ]&lt;/ref&gt; jointing several generative artists and scientists in the Editorial Board.

Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term.  As Boden and Edmonds&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; put it in 2011:

{{quotation | Today, the term "Generative Art" is still current within the relevant artistic community. Since 1998  a series  of  conferences  have been  held  in Milan with  that  title (Generativeart.com), and Brian Eno has been inﬂuential in promoting and using generative art methods (Eno, 1996). Both in music and in visual art, the use of the term has now converged on work that has been produced by the activation of a set of rules and where the artist lets a computer system take over at least some of the decision-making (although, of course, the artist determines the rules).}}

In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu:

{{quotation | Generative Art is the idea realized as genetic code of artificial events, as construction of dynamic complex systems able to generate endless variations. Each Generative Project is a concept-software that works producing unique and non-repeatable events, like music or 3D Objects, as possible and manifold expressions of the generating idea strongly recognizable as a vision belonging to an artist / designer / musician / architect /mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generativeart.com Generative Art]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] from 1999:

{{quotation | Generative art is a term given to work which stems from concentrating on the processes involved in producing an artwork, usually (although not strictly) automated by the use of a machine or computer, or by using mathematic or pragmatic instructions to define the rules by which such artworks are executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000901084825/http://www.generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene eu-gene mailing list welcome page]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter:&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;
{{quotation | Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.}}

==Types==

===Music===
{{Main article|Generative music}}
[[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s "[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]" (Musical Dice Game) 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fugues]] of [[J.S. Bach]] could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tim|title=Fugue 9: E Major. Well-Tempered Clavier, book 1. The Fugue is Generative|url=http://bach.nau.edu/clavier/nature/fugues/Fugue09.html|publisher=NAU.edu|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[serialism]] follows strict procedures which, in some cases, can be set up to generate entire compositions with limited human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Lerdahl|Lerdahl, Fred]]. 1988. "Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems". In ''Generative Processes in Music'', ed. John Sloboda. Oxford University Press. Reprinted in ''Contemporary Music Review'' 6, no. 2 (1992):97–121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred, and [[Ray Jackendoff]]. 1983. ''A Generative Theory of Tonal Music''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composers such as [[John Cage]],&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–15}} [[Farmers Manual]] and [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|133}} have used [[generative systems]] in their works.

===Visual art===
The artist [[Ellsworth Kelly]] created paintings by using chance operations to assign colors in a grid.

Artists such as [[Hans Haacke]] have explored processes of physical and social systems in artistic context.  
[[François Morellet]] has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork.  Some of his paintings feature regular systems of radial or parallel lines to create [[Moiré Patterns]]. In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm Tate Online Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325054818/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm |date=2012-03-25 }} about [[François Morellet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck "Francois Morellet, Austere Abtractionism", New York Times, Feb. 22, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol LeWitt]] created generative art in the form of systems expressed in [[natural language]] and systems of geometric [[permutation]].

[[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] are video art pioneers who used analog video feedback to create generative art. Video feedback is now cited as an example of deterministic chaos, and the early explorations by the Vasulkas anticipated contemporary science by many years.

[[Jean-Pierre Hebert]] and [[Roman Verostko]] are founding members of the [[Algorists]], a group of artists who create their own algorithms to create art.

The French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]], beside environmental sculptures like ''Iapetus'',&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, Jean-Max Albert «Iapetus», L’art abstrait vol.5, Éditions Maeght, Paris, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and ''O=C=O'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Max Albert O=C=O, Franco Torriani, Dalla Land arte alla bioarte, Hopefulmonster editore Torino, 2007, p. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt; developed a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The ''Calmoduline Monument'' project is based on the property of a protein, [[calmodulin]], to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene.&lt;ref&gt;Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet &amp; Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its « typical » growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant’s « decisions » suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]] is a pioneer in data mapping, creating works based on the streams of zeros and ones in ethernet traffic, as part of the "Carnivore" project. [[Martin M.

===Software art===
{{Main article|Software Art}}
For some artists, graphic user interfaces and computer code have become an independent art form in themselves. [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] created Auto-Illustrator as a commentary on software and generative methods applied to art and design.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Architecture===

===Literature===
{{further information|Oulipo|The Eureka|Electronic literature|Spam Lit|Informationist poetry|Language game|Prehistoric Digital Poetry}}

Writers such as [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Brion Gysin]], and [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. [[Jackson Mac Low]] produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; [[Philip M. Parker#Automatically generated books|Philip M. Parker]] has written software to automatically generate entire books. [[Jason Nelson]] used generative methods with Speech-to-Text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Leonardo |title=The Battery Life of Meaning: Speech to Text Poetry” |url=http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |website=I love E-Poetry |accessdate=9 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704155151/http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |archivedate=4 July 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live coding===
{{Main article|Live coding}}
Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as [[Max/MSP]], [[vvvv]], [[Fluxus (programming environment)|Fluxus]], [[Isadora (software)|Isadora]], [[Quartz Composer]] and [[openFrameworks]]. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as [[live coding]]. As with many examples of [[software art]], because live coding emphasises human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art.&lt;ref name=McLean11&gt;{{cite book |last=McLean |first=Alex |title=Artist-Programmers and Programming Languages for the Arts |year=2011 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London (PhD Thesis)|pages=16–17 |url=http://yaxu.org/writing/thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Philip Galanter===

In the most widely cited theory of generative art, in 2003 Philip Galanter&lt;ref name="Galanter2003"&gt;Philip Galanter [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/ga2003_what_is_genart.pdf ''What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory''], 2003 International Conference on Generative Art&lt;/ref&gt; describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Seth Lloyd]]'s [[effective complexity]] is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes [[entropy]] and allows maximal [[data compression]], and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier [[information theory]] influenced views of [[Max Bense]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Bense|Bense, Max]] ''Aesthetica; Einfuehrung in die neue Aesthetik'', Agis-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Moles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Moles|Moles, Abraham]]. ''Information theory and esthetic perception'', University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; where complexity in art increases with disorder.

Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they don't assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/vague_terrain_2006.pdf ''Generative art and rules-based art.''], Vague Terrain (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds===

In their 2009 article, [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art ([[computer art]]), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art).&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;
&lt;!--
In both accounts the term generative art does not describe an [[art movement]], [[ideology]], or theory of [[aesthetics]]. The term refers to how the art is made, and does not take into account why it was made or what the content of the artwork is.--&gt;&lt;!--this is WP:OR, an editor's opinion--&gt;

=== Questions ===

The discourse around generative art can be characterised by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important:&lt;ref name=McC&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCormack |first=Jon |author2=Oliver Bown |author3=Alan Dorin |author4=Jonathan McCabe |author5=Gordon Monro |author6=Mitchell Whitelaw |title=Ten Questions Concerning Generative Computer Art |journal=Leonardo |year=forthcoming |url=http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129225520/http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |archivedate=2012-11-29 |date=2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Can a machine originate anything?  ''Related to [[machine intelligence]] - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is it like to be a computer that makes art?  ''If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# Can human aesthetics be formalised?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What new kinds of art does the computer enable?  ''Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is the role of randomness in generative art? ''For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? ''How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What characterises good generative art? ''How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can we learn about art from generative art? ''For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market.''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What future developments would force us to rethink our answers?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;

Another question is of postmodernism—are generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/complexism_chapter.pdf ''Complexism and the role of evolutionary art''] in "The art of artificial evolution : a handbook on evolutionary art and music", Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yiorgos Sapounidis''' better known as '''George Sapounidis''' is a [[Greek Canadians|Greek Canadian]] musician / [[troubadour]], statistician and a [[Sinophile]] living in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada. He was also subject of 2005 Canadian documentary film entitled ''[[Chairman George]]''. The documentary, directed by [[Daniel Cross (filmmaker)|Daniel Cross]] and [[Mila Aung-Thwin]] and produced by [[EyeSteelFilm]] in association with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/show/CTVShows/1116597529441_112006522 CTV page on the Chairman George documentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822114939/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/show/CTVShows/1116597529441_112006522 |date=22 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]]'s "[[Storyville (television series)|Storyville]]" series&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/chairman-george.shtml BBC Storyville page on the documentary]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]], tells the story of Sapounidis as a musician popular in China campaigning for approval to perform at the closing ceremonies of [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]] when the flag was to be given to Beijing for organizing the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]]. In addition to [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]], he sings in more than five other languages.

Yet, by day, this Montreal-born, Ottawa-based folksinger is a graduate from [[University of Toronto]] earning a PhD in [[Mathematical Statistics]]. He recently retired from [[Statistics Canada]] to concentrate on his music.

==Early musical career==
Sapounidis founded his multicultural band "Ouzo Power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgam.com/artists/ouzo_power/biography.html Story of Ouzo Power and biography of its members]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988, giving a new spin to [[Greek music]] on the Canadian scene, bringing in jazz elements and translating the songs of the likes of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] into Greek for audiences at folk and multicultural music festivals as well as [[CBC Television]] and [[CBC Radio]] producing two albums, including a successful CD of international folk songs.

Although he has been performing regularly at all manner of folk festivals, awards ceremonies, multicultural events, variety shows and special events as well as on Canadian radio and television for over 20 years, it's George Sapounidis' concert tours of China that have catapulted him to stardom in China.

==Popularity in China==
Oddly enough, the Greek-Canadian Sapounidis became a Chinese folk-singing sensation who has appeared at international festivals across China; on stage at Beijing's Forbidden City Concert Hall, and for China Central Television.

Ever since the [[Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Canada]] invited Sapounidis to perform at an international folk festival in Shanghai in the fall of 2000, the Chinese people have not been able to get enough of the Greek-Canadian. They have invited him back some 30 times since then – beginning with the Nanning International Arts Festival of Folksongs the same year, a Beijing tour in May 2002 and again, four months later in September 2002. Another music tour followed in the fall of 2003, a concert in December and the ten-day Shanghai Baoshan International Folk Arts Festival again in the fall of 2004.

Sapounidis attributes his success to a special affinity for Chinese culture. He was already skilled at performing in several languages when first asked to sing in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Intrigued, and with help from his Chinese girlfriend, herself an acclaimed poet, he learned a traditional Mandarin folk song over the next few weeks. He was hooked. His repertoire of Chinese folk songs began to grow – as did his Mandarin language skills. Soon he was performing for Chinese Embassy officials in Ottawa, which in turn led to an invitation to perform in China. Audiences loved him, disarmed and enchanted that a westerner would come into their midst and perform their songs with such depth and emotion.

Upon returning to Ottawa, George formed a new band, The George Sapounidis Trio, with percussionist Ken Easton and Jeremy Moyer, another [[Sinophile]] who plays a variety of Chinese stringed instruments. They performed songs, new and old, from around the world. The songs Sapounidis composes in Chinese, by contrast, are sweet and simple reflecting yearning, friendship, loneliness and love. In 2002 he released a CD called '''Songs about China and Greece''' to be followed in summer of 2005 with '''George from Athens to Beijing''', comprising a variety of traditional Greek and Chinese folks songs along with personal compositions reflecting the latest twists in his personal and musical quest. Some of the songs were recorded in China with Chinese backup musicians and singers – one was recorded live on the [[Great Wall]] – and others were recorded in Canada with Canadian and Greek guest artists using a wide variety of international instruments. His folk songs express the universality of human emotion – the Greek in a passionate extroverted style, the Chinese in a poetic ethereal and far more introverted manner. Yet they complement one another "on stage and within myself." George explains. It's these contradictions, he adds, that feed the artist's soul.

==Campaign for the Olympics==

In 2001, when Beijing won the 2008 Olympics bid, Sapounidis saw an opportunity to "build bridges between cultures" in 2004, when the Olympic flag would be passed from Athens to Beijing. And so began a journey – and a documentary, EyeSteelFilm's "Chairman George," chronicling the singer's unrelenting pursuit of his dream to perform at the closing ceremonies. Director [[Daniel Cross (filmmaker)|Daniel Cross]] and his crew followed Sapounidis across three continents as he tracked down and lobbied Canadian, Greek and Chinese officials,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|zqjIf5JNsFc|George Sapounidis and the Chinese officials}}&lt;/ref&gt; dogging them even onto the Great Wall.

In the end it was not meant to be. But new unexpected paths appeared. George was an Olympic relay torch-bearer in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|stEDSzUg98Q|George Sapounidis torch bearing speech}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the Athens Olympics in the Olympic Village as a National Olympic Committee Assistant, capitalizing on his Greek and Chinese language skills to assist the Chinese team. It didn't take long before his impromptu performances again attracted both Greek and Chinese radio and television attention. This was followed by an invitation from the Humanistic Olympics Studies Centre at [[Renmin University]] to teach a series of classes on Olympic volunteering in Beijing.

==Synopsis of ''Chairman George''==
{{main|Chairman George}}
The documentary ''Chairman George'' follows George's efforts to get to the Olympics. The film synopsis states that:
   
{{quote|In Canada, George is a statistician. But in China, George is Elvis... ''Chairman George'' is a documentary feature about a Greek-Canadian troubadour who refuses to live anything but an extraordinary life. In [[Ottawa]], Ontario, George is a statistician who lives with his mother. But every few months, he takes an extended leave from his job and heads to China where he metamorphoses into an international man of culture. Armed only with his [[bouzouki]], guitar and cellular phone, he becomes a star in China (with both the critics and the ladies) singing Greek songs in Chinese. He concludes that since he is "the only Greek in the world who can sing in Chinese," it is his duty to perform at the closing ceremonies of the [[Athens]] [[2004 Summer Olympics]], as the torch is passed from Athens to Beijing [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eyesteelfilm.com/projects.html Eye-SteelFilm official synopsis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310160119/http://eyesteelfilm.com/projects.html |date=10 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Music for the documentary==
To accompany the documentary, in 2005 George Sapounidis released his CD '''George: From Athens to Beijing'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdbaby.com/cd/sapounidis CD Baby page on the album ''George: From Athens to Beijing''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004140609/http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/sapounidis |date=4 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chairman George'' won awards at the AFI/Silverdocs and at Guangzhou Documentary Festival.

The CD ''George: From Athens to Beijing'' was nominated for Best World Music album at the 2005 Canadian Folk Music Awards.

==Greek-Chinese Fusion==
With his band — bassist Stuart Watkins, guitarist Fred Guignion and drummer/producer Ross Murray — Sapounidis revived the Ouzo Power project, to create an album of rocked-up Greek folk songs. Perhaps inevitably, this led to the artist's most recent evolution: a fusion of Greek and Chinese musical influences that finds Sapounidis and band, including new members Yadong Guan (pipa) and Cindy Yang (ghuzeng), offering a mix of Greek and Chinese songs performed in Mandarin. A full-length album of Sapounidis — now billed as Chairman George, in deference to the documentary — and his band's unique mash of Greek and Chinese influences is to be released internationally in October 2014, to coincide with a 10-city tour of China.

'''''Glen or Glenda''''' is a 1953 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, directed by and starring [[Ed Wood]] (credited in his starring role as "Daniel Davis"), and featuring [[Bela Lugosi]] and Wood's then-girlfriend [[Dolores Fuller]]. It was produced by [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]] who also made the exploitation film ''Test Tube Babies'' that same year&lt;ref&gt;Weldon, Michael (1983). "The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film". Ballantine Books. ISBN 345-34345-5. Page 284&lt;/ref&gt;.

The film is a [[docudrama]] about [[cross-dressing]] and [[transsexuality]], and is semi-[[Autobiography|autobiographical]] in nature. Wood himself was a cross-dresser, and the film is a plea for tolerance. It is widely considered [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films ever]]. However, it has become a [[cult film]] due to its low-budget production values and [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] style.

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=April 2016}}
The film begins with a narrator, called The Scientist ([[Bela Lugosi]]), making cryptic comments about humanity. He first comments that humanity's constant search for the unknown results in startling things coming to light. But most of these "new" discoveries are actually quite old, which he refers to as "the signs of the ages". Later, the scene turns to the streets of a city, with the narrator commenting that each human has his/her own thoughts, ideas, and personality. He makes further comments on human life, while sounds accompany some comments. The cries of a newborn baby are followed by the sirens of an ambulance. One is a sign that a new life has begun, the other that a life has ended.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radiation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radiationcinema.com/2009/06/unbroken-dream-of-edward-d-wood-jr.html |title=''The Unbroken Dream of Edward D. Wood, Jr.' |date=  June 14, 2009 |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |author= Mykal |publisher=Radiation Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This last comment starts the narrative of the film. The life which has ended is that of a [[Transvestism|transvestite]] named Patrick/Patricia, who has committed [[suicide]]. A scene opens with their corpse in a small room. Within the room is an unidentified man who opens the door to a physician, a photographer, and the police. A [[suicide note]] explains the reasons behind the suicide. Patrick/Patricia had been arrested four times for [[cross-dressing]] in public, and had spent time in prison. Since they would continue wearing women's clothing, subsequent arrests and imprisonment were only a matter of time. So they ended their own life and wished to be buried with their women's clothing. "''Let my body rest in death forever, in the things I cannot wear in life.''"&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radiation"/&gt;

Inspector Warren is puzzled and wants to know more about cross-dressing. So he seeks the office of Dr. Alton, who narrates for him the story of Glen/Glenda. Glen is shown studying women's clothes in a shop window. Dr. Alton points out that men's clothes are dull and restrictive, whereas women can adorn themselves with attractive and comfortable clothing.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radiation"/&gt; A flashback scene reveals that a young Glen started out by asking to wear his sister's dress for a [[Halloween]] party. And he did, despite his father's protests. But he then continued wearing his sister's clothing, and Sheila (the sister) eventually caught him in the act.  She shuns him afterward.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative explains that Glen is a transvestite, but not a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. He hides his cross-dressing from his fiancée, Barbara, fearing that she will reject him.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radiation"/&gt; She has no idea that certain of her clothes are [[Sexual fetishism|fetish objects]] for him. When Barbara notices that something is bothering him, Glen does not have the courage to explain his secret to her. She voices her suspicion that there is another woman in his life, unaware that the woman is his feminine inner self, Glenda.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; The scene shifts from a speechless Glen to footage of a stampeding herd of [[bison]], while the Scientist calls for Glen to ''"Pull the string''". The meaning of the call is unclear, though it could be a call for opening the proverbial curtain and revealing the truth.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

Alton narrates that Glen is torn between the idea of being honest with Barbara before their wedding, or waiting until after. The narrative shifts briefly from Glen's story to how society reacts to [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change operations]]. A conversation between two "average joes", concludes that society should be more "lenient" when it comes to people with tranvestite tendencies.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; The story returns to Glen, who confides in a transvestite friend of his, John, whose wife left him after catching him wearing her clothes.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a scene opens with Glen/Glenda walking the city streets at night. They return home in obvious anguish, when the sound of [[thunder]] causes them to collapse to the floor. The Scientist cryptically comments ''"Beware! Beware! Beware of the big, green dragon that sits on your doorstep! He eats little boys, puppy dog tails, and big, fat snails! Take care! Beware!''"&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; This serves as the introduction to an extended [[dream sequence]]. The dream opens with Barbara anguished at seeing Glenda. Then Barbara is depicted trapped under a tree, while the room around is in a chaotic state. Glenda fails to lift the tree and rescue Barbara. Glenda is replaced by Glen, who completes the task with ease.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; The dream then depicts Glen and Barbara getting married. The priest seems normal but the [[Groomsman|best man]] is a stereotypical [[devil]], smiling ominously, suggesting that this marriage is [[Damnation|damned]].&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;  The dream shifts to the Scientist, who seems to speak to the unseen dragon, asking it what it eats. The voice of a little girl provides the answers in an apparently mocking tone.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The dreams continues with a strange series of vignettes. A woman is [[whip]]ped by a shirtless man in a [[BDSM]]-themed vignette. Several women "flirt and partially disrobe" for an unseen audience. A woman tears apart her dress in a dramatic manner, then starts a coy [[striptease]].&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; The whipped woman from an earlier vignette appears alone in an [[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]] session. Her pleasure is interrupted by another woman who forcibly binds and gags her.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; Another woman has a similar autoerotic session and then falls asleep. As she sleeps, a predatory male approaches and [[rape]]s her, with the victim seeming partially willing by the end of it.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout these vignettes, the faces of Glen and the Scientist appear. They seem to be silently reacting to the various images.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The dream returns to Glen, who is haunted by sounds of mocking voices and howling winds. He is soon confronted by two spectral figures. A [[blackboard]] appears, with messages recording what the Scientist or the mocking voices said in previous scenes. A large number of spectres appear, all gazing at him with disapproval, as if serving as the jury of [[public opinion]] on his perceived [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. The mocking voices return.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; The Devil and the various spectres menacingly approach Glen. Then the Devil departs, Glen turns into Glenda, and the spectres retreat.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; A victorious Glenda sees Barbara and approaches her, but she turns into a mocking Devil. Barbara starts appearing and disappearing, always evading Glenda's embrace. Then she starts mocking her lover. The Devil and spectres also shift to mocking Glenda. The dream sequence ends.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen/Glenda wakes and stares at their mirror reflection. They decide to tell Barbara the truth. She initially reacts with distress, but ultimately decides to stay with him.  She offers them an [[Angora wool|angora]] sweater as a sign of acceptance. The scene effectively concludes their story.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Dr. Alton's office, he starts another narrative. This one concerns another tranvestite, called Alan/Ann. He was born a boy, but his mother wanted a girl and raised him as such. Their father did not care either way. They were an outsider as a child, trying to be one of the girls and consequently rejected by schoolmates of both sexes. As a teenager, they self-identified as a woman. They were [[Conscription|conscripted]] in [[World War II]], maintaining a secret life throughout their military service. They first heard of [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change operations]] during the War while recovering from combat wounds in a hospital.  They eventually did have a sex change operation, enduring the associated pains to fulfill their dreams. The [[World War II]] veteran becomes a "lovely young lady".&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; Following a brief epilogue, the film ends.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
Shot in four days, the film was loosely inspired by the [[sex reassignment surgery]] of [[Christine Jorgensen]], which made national headlines in the U.S. in 1952. Posters for the film publicize the movie as being based on Jorgensen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wrongsideoftheart.com/wp-content/gallery/posters-g/glen_or_glenda_poster_03.jpg |title="I Led 2 Lives" Based on the Lives of Christine Jorgensen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]], a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] producer of low-budget films, commissioned a movie to exploit it. Originally Weiss made Jorgensen several offers to appear in the film, but these were turned down.&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;
{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Gary D. | authorlink = | title = Lugosi: His Life in Films, on Stage, and in the Hearts of Horror Lovers | year = 1997 | publisher = McFarland| location = | isbn = 0-7864-0257-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood convinced Weiss that his own transvestism made him the perfect director despite his modest resume. Wood was given the job, but instead made a movie about transvestism.

Wood persuaded Lugosi, at the time poor and [[drug addiction|drug-addicted]], to appear in the movie. Lugosi's scenes were shot at the Jack Miles Studios in [[Los Angeles]]. He was reportedly paid $5000 for the role, although some stories state the actual amount was only $1000.&lt;ref name="rhodes"/&gt; Lugosi is credited as "The Scientist", a character whose purpose is unclear. He acts as a sort of narrator but gives no narration relevant to the plot; that job is reserved for the film's primary narrator, [[Timothy Farrell]].&lt;ref name="Peary"/&gt;

This was the only film Wood directed but did not also produce. Wood played the eponymous character, but under the [[pseudonym]] "Daniel Davis".&lt;ref name="Peary"&gt;{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 97–101 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His then-girlfriend, [[Dolores Fuller]], played Glen's girlfriend/fiancée Barbara. Wood later returned to ''Glen or Glenda'' in his [[pulp novel]] ''Killer in Drag'' (1963). The plot features a transvestite called Glen whose alter-ego is called Glenda. He is executed in the sequel ''Death of a Transvestite'' (1967) after a struggle for the right to go to the [[electric chair]] dressed as Glenda.

The erotic-themed vignettes were not created by Wood. They were reportedly added by producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]]. He needed extra scenes to add to what he felt was an overtly -short film.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; While not organic parts of the narrative, they seem to tell their own tales of gender dynamics and so fit in the general themes of the film.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; The [[whip]]ping scene suggests a [[Master/slave (BDSM)|Master/slave]] relationship. That the man is [[Top (BDSM)|dominant]] and the woman [[Bottom (BDSM)|submissive]], seems to reflect [[Chauvinism|male chauvinism]].&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt; The flirtatious and striptease-themed vignettes were typical of 1950s [[exploitation film]]s and [[grindhouse]] films, as was the rape scene.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig (2009), p. 30-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has [[deleted scene]]s. In the theatrical trailer, included in [[laserdisc]] and [[DVD]] editions, the scene in which Fuller hands over her [[Angora wool|angora]] sweater, is a different take than the one in the release version — in the trailer, she tosses it to Wood in a huff, while the release version shows her handing it over more acceptingly. There is also a shot of Wood in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], mouthing the word "Cut!"

The second part of the film, titled ''Alan or Anne'', is much shorter, told largely through [[stock footage]], and was made to meet the distributor's demand for a [[sex change]] film. Alan is a [[Intersex|pseudo-hermaphrodite]] who fights in [[World War II]] wearing women's underwear. After his return, Alan undergoes surgery to become a woman.

==Release==
Domestically, the film was [[Limited release|limited in release]], having been pre-sold to some theaters (under alternative titles such including ''I Led Two Lives'', ''He or She?'' and ''I Changed My Sex''). Internationally, the film was also limited, and in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], the title was translated as ''Louis ou Louise'' and in [[Argentina]] as ''Yo Cambié Mi Sexo''; the film had a brief &lt;!-- A few minutes? A few days? --&gt; screening in the [[Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="rhodes"/&gt; It was re-released to theaters in 1981 by Paramount&lt;ref&gt;Weldon, Michael (1983). "The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film". Ballantine Books. ISBN 345-34345-5. Page 284 &lt;/ref&gt;.

According to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of "cheap teen movies" released for the [[Drive-in theater|drive-in market]]. They consisted of "exploitative, cheap fare created especially for them [teens] in a newly-established teen/drive-in genre."&lt;ref&gt;Dirks,Tim.

Accessed March 16, 2015,http://www.filmsite.org/50sintro.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It was [[List of films banned in the United Kingdom|denied classification]] by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] upon submission on February 26, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/glen-or-glenda-1970-0 | title=''Glen or Glenda'' | work=[[British Board of Film Classification]] | date=February 26, 1958 | accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
In 1980, Wood was posthumously given the accolade of 'Worst Director of All Time' at the [[Golden Turkey Awards]], and revival of interest in his work followed. This led to ''Glen or Glenda'' being reissued in 1982. This cut included six minutes of additional footage. One of the restored scenes features Glen rejecting a pass made to him by a man. At this point, the film was reviewed seriously, and reclaimed as a radical work, by Steve Jenkins in the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]''.

The critic [[Leonard Maltin]] names ''Glen or Glenda'' as "possibly the worst movie ever made".

In 1994, [[Tim Burton]] chronicled the troubled production of ''Glen or Glenda'' in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. The film includes re-creations of several key scenes, including Lugosi's narration and Glen's plea for his girlfriend's understanding at the end of the film.
A remake of the film, entitled ''Glen &amp; Glenda'', was released the same year as ''Ed Wood'' and featured much the same script as the original film, as well as explicit scenes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137784/ IMDB entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 horror comedy film ''[[Seed of Chucky]]'', main characters [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] and [[Tiffany (Child's Play)|Tiffany]] spend the duration of the film feuding over whether they should call their male child "Glen or Glenda" as he lacks genitalia.

In 2006, the [[distributed operating system]] [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]] had a mascot, [[Glenda, the Plan 9 Bunny]], named after ''Glen or Glenda'' and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''.

In 2011, the film ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'' was nominated for every award at the [[32nd Golden Raspberry Awards]], including Worst Prequel, Remake, Ripoff or Sequel, where it was declared a Remake/Ripoff of ''Glen or Glenda'', despite having nothing to do with the film, other than the lead actor dressed as a woman.

[[File:Section through railway track and foundation.png|520px|thumb|right|Section through railway track and foundation showing the sub-grade]]
'''Grading''' in [[civil engineering]] and landscape architectural construction is the work of ensuring a level base, or one with a specified [[Grade (slope)|slope]],&lt;ref&gt;"Grade.1.". def. 2. Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia'' vol.3. New York: Century Co., 1901. 2589. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; for a construction work such as a [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], the [[base course]] for a [[road]] or a [[Rail tracks|railway]], or [[landscape]] and [[garden]] improvements, or surface drainage.  The earthworks created for such a purpose are often called the '''sub-grade''' or '''finished contouring'''  (see diagram).

==Transportation==
In the case of [[gravel road]]s and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] for certain purposes, grading forms not just the base but the cover and surface of the finished construction, and is often called '''finished grade'''.

==Process==
[[File:Motoniveladora 01.jpg|thumb|right|Modern road [[grader]]]]
It is often done using heavy machinery like [[bulldozer]]s and [[excavator]]s to roughly prepare an area and then using a [[grader]] for a finer finish.

==Environmental design==
In the [[environmental design]] professions grading and [[regrading]] are a specifications and construction component in [[landscape design]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[architecture]] projects. It is used for buildings or outdoor amenities regarding [[Foundation (architecture)|foundations and footings]],  [[Grade (slope)|slope]] [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]] and stabilizing, aesthetic contouring, and directing [[surface runoff]] drainage of [[stormwater]] and domestic/irrigation runoff flows.

In [[organic chemistry]], '''Hückel's rule''' estimates whether a [[Plane (geometry)|planar]] ring [[molecule]] will have [[aromaticity|aromatic]] properties. The [[quantum mechanic]]al basis for its formulation was first worked out  by  [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[Erich Hückel]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;

VON E.|last2=Detert|first2=Francis L.|date=1951-02-01|title=CYCLOHEPTATRIENYLIUM OXIDE|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja01146a537|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=73|issue=2|pages=876–877|doi=10.1021/ja01146a537|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Doering | first = W. v. E. | title = Abstracts of the American Chemical Society Meeting, New York | date = September 1951 | page = 24M}}&lt;/ref&gt; although several authors were using this form at around the same time.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

In keeping with the [[Möbius-Hückel concept]], a [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]] ring molecule follows Hückel's rule when the number of its [[pi electron|π-electron]]s equals 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 where ''n'' is a non-negative [[integer]], although clearcut examples are really only established for values of ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 up to about ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref&gt;{{March3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hückel's rule was originally based on calculations using the [[Hückel method]], although it can also be justified by considering a [[particle in a ring]] system, by the [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method|LCAO method]]&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = John D. | last1 = Roberts | first2 = Andrew, Jr. | last2 = Streitwieser | first3 = Clare M. | last3 = Regan | title = Small-Ring Compounds. X. Molecular Orbital Calculations of Properties of Some Small-Ring Hydrocarbons and Free Radicals | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | year = 1952 | volume = 74 | issue = 18 | pages = 4579–82 | doi = 10.1021/ja01138a038 | authorlink2 = Andrew Streitwieser}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Pariser–Parr–Pople method]].

Aromatic compounds are more stable than theoretically predicted using hydrogenation data of simple [[alkene]]s; the additional stability is due to the delocalized cloud of electrons, called ''[[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] energy''. Criteria for simple aromatics are:
# the molecule must have 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 electrons in a [[conjugated system]] of ''p'' orbitals (usually on sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-[[Orbital hybridisation|hybridized]] atoms, but sometimes sp-hybridized);
# the molecule must be (close to) planar (p orbitals must be roughly parallel and able to interact, implicit in the requirement for conjugation);
# the molecule must be cyclic (as opposed to linear);
# the molecule must have a continuous ring of p atomic orbitals (there cannot be any sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; atoms in the ring).

==Monocyclic hydrocarbons==
The rule can be used to understand the stability of completely conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons (known as [[annulene]]s) as well as their cations and anions.
The best-known example is [[benzene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) with a conjugated system of six pi-electrons, which equals 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The molecule undergoes [[substitution reaction]]s which preserve the six pi-electron system rather than [[addition reaction]]s which would destroy it. The stability of this pi-electron system is referred to as [[aromaticity]]. Still, in most cases, catalysts are necessary for substitution reactions to occur.

The [[cyclopentadienyl anion]] ({{chem|C|5|H|5|–}}) with six pi electrons is considerably more stable than either the neutral [[cyclopentadienyl]] radical with five pi electrons or the corresponding cation with four.&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=I. N. |title=Quantum chemistry |edition=4th |publisher=Prentice-Hall |date=1991 |pages=559–560 |ISBN=0-205-12770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the [[tropylium cation]] ({{chem|C|7|H|7|+}}) has six pi electrons and is more stable than either the cycloheptatrienyl radical ({{chem|C|7|H|7|•}}) or its anion.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; The [[cyclopropenyl cation]] ({{chem|C|3|H|3|+}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{JerryMarch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyclopropenyl cation.

Soc.]] |date=1970 |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages=984–987 |doi=10.1021/ja00707a040}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the triboracyclopropenyl dianion ({{chem|B|3|H|3|2–}}) are considered examples of a 2π-electron system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wrackmeyer |first=B. |date=2016 |title=A Cyclotriborane Dianion and the Triboron Cation: "Light Ends" of the Hückel Rule |journal=[[Angew.

Chem. Int. Ed.]] |volume=54 |pages=15084–15088 |doi=10.1002/anie.201508670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planar ring molecules with 4''n'' pi electrons do not obey Hückel's rule, and theory predicts that they are less stable and have [[triplet state|triplet ground state]]s with two unpaired electrons. In practice such molecules distort from planar regular polygons. [[Cyclobutadiene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with four pi electrons is stable only at temperatures below 35&amp;nbsp;K and is rectangular rather than square.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt; [[Cyclooctatetraene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) with eight pi electrons has a nonplanar "tub" structure. However the dianion {{chem|C|8|H|8|2–}} ([[Cyclooctatetraenide anion]]), with ten pi electrons obeys the 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 rule for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and is planar.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt;

==Refinement==
Hückel's rule is not valid for many compounds containing more than three fused aromatic nuclei in a cyclic fashion. For example, [[pyrene]] contains 16 [[Conjugated system|conjugated electrons]] (8 bonds), and [[coronene]] contains 24 conjugated electrons (12 bonds). Both of these polycyclic molecules are aromatic, even though they fail the 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 rule. Indeed, Hückel's rule can only be theoretically justified for monocyclic systems.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

==Three-dimensional rule==
{{Main|Spherical aromaticity}}
In 2000, Andreas Hirsch and coworkers in [[Erlangen]], [[Germany]], formulated a rule to determine when a [[fullerene]] would be aromatic. They found that if there were 2(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; π-[[electrons]], then the fullerene would display aromatic properties. This follows from the fact that an aromatic fullerene must have full [[icosahedral]] (or other appropriate) symmetry, so the molecular orbitals must be entirely filled. This is possible only if there are exactly 2(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons, where ''n'' is a nonnegative integer. In particular, for example, [[buckminsterfullerene]], with 60 π-electrons, is non-aromatic, since 60&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;= 30, which is not a [[Square number|perfect square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Spherical Aromaticity in ''I''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; Symmetrical Fullerenes: The 2(''N''+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Rule | pages = 3915–17 | first1 = Andreas | last1 = Hirsch | first2 = Zhongfang | last2 = Chen | first3 = Haijun | last3 = Jiao | journal = Angew.

In 2011, Jordi Poater and Miquel Solà, expanded the rule to determine when a [[fullerene]] species would be aromatic. They found that if there were 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 π-[[electrons]], then the fullerene would display aromatic properties. This follows from the fact that an spherical species having a same-spin half-filled last energy level with the whole inner levels being fully filled is also aromatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Open-shell spherical aromaticity: the 2''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''N'' + 1 (with ''S'' = ''N'' + {{1/2}}) rule | pages = 11647–11649 | first1 = Jordi | last1 = Poater | first2 = Miquel | last2 = Solà | journal = [[Chem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1297">In [[communication studies]], the notion of an '''interface''' in the work environment is used for a point of interaction between a number of systems or work groups. In the manufacturing environment, the coordination and interaction between several work groups is used to communicate plans and control production activity. This interaction can be schedules, [[human interaction]]s, [[computer systems]], or any other medium of communication. A physical interface is the interconnection between two items of hardware or machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''International Association of Astronomical Artists''' (IAAA), is a non-profit organization whose members implement and participate in [[astronomical]] and [[space]] art projects, promote education about [[space art]] and foster [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] in artistic work inspired by the exploration of the [[Universe]].

The IAAA was founded in 1982 and was formally registered as an association of astronomical artists in 1986. Since its founding, the IAAA has grown to number over 120 members, representing twenty countries. The organization serves the community of artists creating works inspired by astronomy and outer space, serving as a networking resource on topics specific to the trade as well as issues common to professional artists. Although the early practitioners in the 1930s and 40s, such as Lucian Rudaux and Chesley Bonestell, (see [[Space Art]]) were realists, many IAAA artists produce work which is impressionistic, expressionistic, abstract or surreal; however, the majority (unlike science fiction and fantasy artists, who work almost purely from imagination) do have a background in astronomy, physics and mathematics which enables them to interpret accurately the data from observatories and space probes, and convert them into believable images.

They may also be called upon to depict those very probes and satellites (often working with NASA or JPL scientists) – for who is out there to photograph them? They paint in oils, acrylics, gouache and markers, use pens, pastels or coloured pencils, or the latest digital technology. But these artists have an advantage over mere technology, for they can travel where machines cannot; and this includes into the past, the future and faster than light.

A major activity of the IAAA is space art workshops, in most cases at remote locations with geology common to what has been discovered on other worlds. Iceland, Death Valley, Hawaii, The Colorado Plateau including Meteor Crater, and other locations with a sense of the unworldly about them have been visited in workshops. Painting and sketching such scenery outdoors helps in training the artist to know the landscape and the forces shaping it, as well as to reinforce the sensory impressions one is putting into their work of the effects of light and shade in the atmosphere.

The '''International Congress of Orientalists''', initiated in Paris in 1873, was an international [[meeting|conference]] of [[Orientalism|Orientalists]] (initially mostly scholars from Europe and the USA). The first thirteen meetings were held in Europe; the fourteenth congress was held in Algiers in 1905. Papers were primarily about philology and archaeology. The Proceedings of the Congresses were published. The work of the International Congress of Orientalists is carried on by the International Congress of Asian and North African Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Orientalists, International Congress Of, in Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa, 2004. https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/orientalists-international-congress - accessed 4 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''It was a dark and stormy night'''" is an often-mocked and parodied phrase&lt;ref name="finder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/it-was-a-dark-and-stormy-night.html|title=It was a dark and stormy night|work=The Phrase Finder|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered to represent "the archetypal example of a florid, melodramatic style of fiction writing",&lt;ref name = "finder"/&gt; also known as [[purple prose]].

==Origin==
The phrase was first used by [[Washington Irving]] in his 1809 "A History of New York".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irving|first=Washington|title=The Beauties of Washington Irving, Esq.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjMgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1830|publisher=Richard Griffin &amp; Co.|location=Glasgow|page=261|chapter=A Doleful Disaster of Anthony the Trumpeter}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its status as a catchphrase for bad writing comes from the opening sentence of [[English people|English]] novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s 1830 novel ''[[Paul Clifford]]'':&lt;ref name="Clifford"&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul Clifford|last=Lytton|first=Edward Bulwer|publisher=Cassell Pub. Co|year=1830|location=New York|oclc=19091989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents — except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.}}

== Evaluations of the opening sentence ==
''[[Writer's Digest]]'' described this sentence as "the literary posterchild for bad story starters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/famous-first-lines-learn-how-to-start-a-novel|title=Famous First Lines Reveal How to Start a Novel|last=Petit|first=Zachary|date=January 18, 2013|work=Literary Digest|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ''[[American Book Review]]'' ranked it as No.&amp;nbsp;22 on its "Best first lines from novels list".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanbookreview.org/100bestlines.asp|title=100 Best First Lines from Novels|work=American Book Review|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the great-great-great-grandson of Bulwer-Lytton, [[Henry Lytton-Cobbold]], participated in a debate in the town of [[Lytton, British Columbia]], with Scott Rice, the founder of the International [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]]. Rice accused Bulwer-Lytton of penning "27 novels whose perfervid turgidity I intend to expose, denude, and generally make visible". Lytton-Cobbold defended his ancestor, noting that he had coined many other phrases widely used today such as "[[the pen is mightier than the sword]]", "[[the great unwashed]]", and "[[the almighty dollar]]", and said it was "rather unfair that Professor Rice decided to name the competition after him for entirely the wrong reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Literary tragedy' of Bulwer-Lytton's dark and stormy night under debate |author=Alison Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/19/2 |newspaper=Guardian |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=29 May 2013}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later usage==

===Literature===
The ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip character [[Snoopy]], in his imagined persona as the World Famous Author, always begins his novels with the phrase "It was a dark and stormy night."&lt;ref name = "about" /&gt; Cartoonist [[Charles Schulz]] made Snoopy use this phrase because "it was a cliché, and had been one for a very long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Thomas C.|title=How to Read Literature Like a Professor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKeOyeZdVKwC&amp;pg=PA74|year=2003|publisher=Harper-Collins|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book by Schulz, titled ''It Was a Dark and Stormy Night, Snoopy,'' and credited to Snoopy as author, was published by [[Holt, Rinehart, and Winston]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schulz|first=Charles M.|title=My Life with Charlie Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DV8NvhEX2LYC&amp;pg=PR18|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the opening line in the popular 1962 novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'' by [[Madeleine L'Engle]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/books/07cnd-lengle.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Madeleine L'Engle, Writer of Children's Classics, Is Dead at 88|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=September 8, 2007|work=New York Times|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|It was a dark and stormy night.&lt;br /&gt;
 In her attic bedroom Margaret Murry, wrapped in an old patchwork quilt, sat on the foot of her bed and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind. Behind the trees clouds scudded frantically across the sky. Every few moments the moon ripped through them, creating wraithlike shadows that raced along the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=L'Engle| first=Madeleine | title=A Wrinkle in Time | location=New York | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | year=1962 | oclc=22421788}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

L'Engle biographer Leonard Marcus notes that "With a wink to the reader, she chose for the opening line of ''A Wrinkle in Time'', her most audaciously original work of fiction, that hoariest of cliches&amp;nbsp;... L'Engle herself was certainly aware of old warhorse's literary provenance as&amp;nbsp;... Edward Bulwer-Lytton's much maligned much parodied repository of Victorian purple prose, ''Paul Clifford''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=Leonard |authorlink= |title=Listening for Madeleine: A Portrait of Madeleine L'Engle in Many Voices |url= |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn=0374298971 |page=14}} This is an anthology of multiple biographical essays. The quote is from the introduction by the editor.&lt;/ref&gt; While discussing the importance of establishing the tone of voice at the beginning of fiction, Judy Morris notes that L'Engle's ''A Wrinkle in Time'' opens with "Snoopy's signature phrase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Judy |authorlink= |title=Writing fiction for children: stories only you can tell |url= |accessdate= |year= 2001 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[Joni Mitchell]]'s song "Crazy Cries of Love" on her album ''[[Taming the Tiger]]'' opens with "It was a dark and stormy night". In the December 1998 issue of ''Musician'', Mitchell discusses her idea of using several cliche lines in the lyrics of multiple songs on the album, such as "the old man is snoring" in the title song ''Taming the Tiger''. Her co-lyricist, Don Fried, had read of a competition in ''The New Yorker'' to write a story opening with "It was a dark and stormy night" and was inspired to put it in the song lyrics. Mitchell states {{quote|But the second line is a brilliant deviation from the cliché: "Everyone was at the wing-ding." It's a beautiful out, but that was because it was competition to dig yourself out of a cliché hole in an original way. He never sent it in to ''The New Yorker'', but he just did it as an original exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=196|title=Joni Mitchell Library - Embrace the Tiger: Musician On-Line, December 1998|website=jonimitchell.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Christian rock/ska band [[Five Iron Frenzy]] announced their reunion in 2011 by releasing the song "It Was a Dark and Stormy Night," which opens with the line.  The song was included on their 2013 album, ''[[Engine of a Million Plots]]''.

===Board game===
In the board game titled ''It Was a Dark and Stormy Night'', contestants are given first lines of various famous novels and must guess their origin. Originally sold independently in bookstores in the Chicago area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bright sunny day for new game: It Was a Dark and Stormy Night |author=Ruth Solomon |url= |newspaper=Libertyville Review |date=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was later picked up by the online book reading club Goodreads.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreadgames.com/|title=Goodreadgames.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing contest===
The annual [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]] was formed in 1982. The contest, sponsored by the English Department at [[San Jose State University]], recognizes the worst examples of "dark and stormy night" writing. It challenges entrants to compose "the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels."&lt;ref name = "about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulwer-lytton.com/about.html|title=About The Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest|website=bulwer-lytton.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "best" of the resulting entries have been published in a series of paperback books, starting with ''It Was a Dark and Stormy Night'' in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Scott|title=It Was a Dark and Stormy Night: The Best (?) from the Bulwer-Lytton Contest|url=https://www.amazon.com/Was-Dark-Stormy-Night-Bulwer-Lytton/dp/0140075569/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361982929&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=it+was+a+dark+and+stormy+night+1984|year=1984|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0140075564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kendell Geers''' is a [[South Africa]]n conceptual artist.

==Life==
Kendell Geers was born in Johannesburg into a white working-class Afrikaans family during the time of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Salon | Artist Talk | Manifesta 9: FIRED UP by Kendell Geers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGJDXFKIz0U&lt;/ref&gt; 

Becoming aware of the political struggles in his country, he ran away from home at the age of 15 to get involved in the anti-apartheid movement. 
Kendell finished his schooling at the end of 1984. At the beginning of 1985, to avoid conscription, he enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for a Fine Arts degree.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Siebrits,States of Emergency 1985-1990, "Irrespektiv." BOM / Actar, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1988, Kendell Geers was one of 143 young men who publicly refused to serve in the South African Defence Force and faced either a life in exile or six years' imprisonment in a civilian jail.&lt;ref&gt;Merret, C., Saunders, C., in Switzer L., Adhikari M., ''South Africa's Resistance'', Ohio University Press, 2000, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he left South Africa and lived for a brief period in exile in the United Kingdom and New York where he worked as an assistant to artist [[Richard Prince]].&lt;ref&gt;Clive Kellner, Kendell Geers 1988-2012, Prestel, 2012, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was only after [[Nelson Mandela]] and other political prisoners' release from prison, that Geers could return from exile to Johannesburg without fear of being imprisoned. In 1990, he returned to [[Johannesburg]] where he worked as an artist, and art critic, curator and performance artist. The first work of art he created back on South African soil was "Bloody Hell", a ritual washing of his white [[Afrikaaner]] [[Boer]] body with his own fresh blood.&lt;ref name="Fin de Partie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sans|first=Jerome|title=Hang Grenades From My Heart|year=2012|publisher=Blue Kingfisher|isbn=9789881506474|pages=23–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rejecting everything his family and his community stood for, in 1993 he changed his name to Kendell Geers and his date of birth to May 1968 as a political act, reclaiming his identity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Bourriaud, ''Kendell Geers: A Proletarian Gnosis'', ''Kendell Geers 1988-2012'', Munich, Prestel, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Brussels in 2003.

==Work==
Sometimes described as a political artist, Kendell Geers is known best for using a variety of colors and materials that signal danger such as sirens, broken glass, and barbed wire in an attempt to examine power structures, social injustices, and establishment values. Geers has worked with different media ranging from objects to large scale installation, neon works, performances and video.
Geers also uses words as a means to explore the coding and reinterpretation of language and its meaning and to communicate with his audience.

===Early work===
His work had heavily political elements from 1988 to 2000, during which time Geers, explored the moral and ethical contradictions of the apartheid system through his practice.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; He developed a visual vocabulary characterized by provocation as well as humor by using found objects such as barbed wire or glass shards. By appropriating historical events and ideas, he focused on questions of relationship between individual and society. It was in this context that Geers changed his date of birth to May 1968, the start of the student and civil revolution, and joined every political party in the period before South Africa’s first democratic elections, from the extreme right-wing to the Communist party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition traces the shift and the development of Kendell Geers' aesthetic language|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=59989#.US94rjdhAqA|work=Art Daily|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, he expressed his doubts about the fetishization of party politics.

He participated in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1993, the first time since the anti-[[Apartheid]] boycotts that South African artists had been invited.

From 1999 until 2004, Geers worked as the curator and art consult for [[Gencor]] which was later bought out by [[BHP Billiton]]. The collection focused on artists and works of art that were central to the [[apartheid|Anti-Apartheid Movement]] spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Williamson, South African Art in the Nineties: Part I, II &amp; III, [http://www.artthrob.co.za/00jan/news.html Artthrob]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Geers edited and published ''Contemporary South African Art,'' with essays by [[Okwui Enwezor]], [[Olu Oguibe]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary South African Art'', Jonathan Ball Publishers, 1997, {{ISBN|978-1-86842-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiated by his move to Brussels in 2000, his later European period is characterized by a more poetic aesthetic.&lt;ref name=welt/&gt; Here, Geers transferred his incendiary practice into a post-colonial and increasingly global context, suggesting more universal themes like terrorism, spirituality, and mortality. As such, the artist’s life and work can be said to constitute a living archive composed of political events, photographs, letters, and literary texts that serve as a source of inspiration and represent a continuation of his oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=haus der kunst|url=http://www.hausderkunst.de/index.php?id=132&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 a Geers retrospective called "1988-2012" opened at the [[Haus der Kunst]] in Munich.&lt;ref name=welt&gt;{{cite news|last=Reitter-Welter|first=Barbara|title=Hinweis warnt vor Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article113480460/Hinweis-warnt-vor-Kendell-Geers-Ausstellung.html|newspaper=Die Welt|date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The exhibition divided his life and work into two decade-long periods, the first political phase until 2000, and the later more poetic phase.

===Manifesto===
In 2011 Geers wrote a Manifesto in which through a series of statements, he explores the link between political and natural revolutions, mourns the loss of our talent for revolution and the underlying causes, and gives us clues on how to remember our inner selves to live a more true life.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Arts: A Journal of South-North Cultural and Media Studies 27(6), An Van Dienderen &amp; Kris Rutten, 2013, p. 655-660.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side projects==
Together with musician Patrick Codenys ([[Front 242]]) Kendell Geers formed the Belgium Audio-Visual group "[[thefucKINGFUCKS]]" in 2007. The project grew out of the now defunct "[[Red Snyper]]" collaboration between Geers and Codenys.

==Exhibitions==
He has exhibited globally since 1993 and participated in numerous exhibitions including [[Documenta]], the [[Carnegie International]], Havana Biennial, Istanbul Biennial, Kwang Ju Biennial, Taipei Biennial, [[Gwangju Biennale]], Lyon Biennial, [[Glasstress]] at the Venice Biennale, as well as presented solo exhibitions in the CCA Cincinnati, [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst]] Gent, [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltic Museum Presents Kendell Geers|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/10544/Baltic-Museum-Presents-Kendell-Geers/?month=&amp;year=|work=Design Taxi|accessdate=28 February 2013|date=3 Aug 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspen Art Museum, MOCA in Rome, Migros Museum, Palais de Tokyo, the CAC in Lyon and Haus der Kunst in Munich.

This is a '''list of endangered languages of the Pacific''', based on [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|the definitions used by UNESCO]].

An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that it is at risk of falling out of use because there is little transmission of the language to younger generations. If a language loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]].

"'''Mother's Day'''", also known as the "'''Rugrats Mother's Day Special'''"{{sfn|Lenburg|2006|p=54}} or "'''Rugrats Mother's Day'''",&lt;ref name="Name2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/videos/clip/mothers-day-clip.html|title=Rugrats: 'Rugrats Mother's Day'|publisher=[[Nickelodeon]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116110246/http://www.nick.com/videos/clip/mothers-day-clip.html|archivedate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the second episode of the fourth season of the American [[Animated series|animated]] television series ''[[Rugrats]]'' and the show's 67th episode overall. Released as a [[Mother's Day]] [[television special|special]], it revolves around the holiday from the perspective of a group of babies—[[Tommy Pickles]], [[List of Rugrats characters#Chuckie Finster|Chuckie Finster]], and [[List of Rugrats characters#Phil and Lil DeVille|Phil and Lil Deville]]. Tommy, Phil, and Lil attempt to find the perfect mother for Chuckie (who is raised only by his father [[Chaz Finster|Chaz]]) while sharing their favorite memories about their moms. At the end of the episode, Chuckie's mother is revealed to have died of a terminal illness. It concludes with Chuckie and Chaz looking through a box of her belongings, including a poem she had written for her son. Meanwhile, [[Didi Pickles]] tries to plan the perfect Mother's Day with her mom [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Minka]], while [[Betty DeVille]] helps [[Stu Pickles]] with his invention to help mothers.

Norton Virgien and Toni Vian directed the episode from a script by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, [[David N. Weiss]], Susan Hood, and Ed Resto. Series co-creator [[Paul Germain]] had [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] two potential storylines to explain the absence of Chuckie's mother, but  [[Nickelodeon]] executives rejected his proposed ideas that the mother was either divorced from Chaz or had died. Before "Mother's Day" premiered, only minor references to Chuckie's mother had been made. Germain left the show in 1993, and several new writers replaced him. The concept was later revised and approved as a Mother's Day special. Germain said that he was disappointed at being unable to cover the topic during his time on the series.

Broadcast on May 6, 1997, in the United States, "Mother's Day" was one of several half-hour specials that Nickelodeon commissioned for ''Rugrats''. The episode was featured on the 1998 [[VHS]] release ''Rugrats: Mommy Mania'', and was later made available for [[Digital distribution|digital download]] along with the rest of the fourth season. "Mother's Day" was praised by critics and has been the subject of several retrospective reviews for its treatment of the death of a parent. It was also praised for its positive representation of [[breastfeeding]] and expansion on the definition of motherhood. It won the [[CableACE Award]] for Writing a Children's Special or Series, and was nominated for the [[Humanitas Prize]] for the Children's Animation Category. The series received a nomination for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]] for the [[49th Primetime Emmy Awards]] after Nickelodeon submitted "Mother's Day" for consideration.

==Plot==
On [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]], toddler [[Angelica Pickles]] constructs a [[macaroni]] sculpture of her head as a present to her mother, telling [[List of Rugrats characters#Main characters|the Rugrats]] the meaning of the holiday. After dropping off his son [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]], [[Chaz Finster]] gives his friend [[Didi Pickles]] a box of his wife's belongings as he fears that Chuckie will find it. Chaz does not feel he is ready to talk to Chuckie about his mother. While helping the other babies [[Phil and Lil|Phil and Lil DeVille]] and [[Tommy Pickles]] look for the perfect gifts for their mothers, Chuckie feels uncertain about how he should celebrate Mother's Day. Tommy, Phil, and Lil share their favorite memories of their mothers with Chuckie. Phil and Lil say that the best gift they gave their mom was their first laugh. Tommy reminisces about his mom comforting him while he was in a [[neonatal intensive care unit]]. The babies think of a plan to find Chuckie a new mother. Their attempts to have Tommy's dog [[Spike (Rugrats)|Spike]] and Lil act as his mom are unsuccessful. Angelica agrees to act as Chuckie's mother only if he completes her macaroni sculpture. Meanwhile, Didi takes her mom [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Minka]] to a [[health spa|spa]], and [[Betty DeVille]] helps [[Stu Pickles]] with his invention to help mothers.

Angelica tasks Chuckie to pick a [[dandelion]] to decorate her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys a majority of the lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a [[spade]], a journal of [[Pressed flower craft|pressed flowers]], and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.&lt;ref name="Mother3"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Mother's Day | series=[[Rugrats]] | author=Writer: Jon Cooksey &amp; Ali Marie Matheson &amp; J.

The 23-minute and 46-second episode was written by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, [[David N. Weiss]], Susan Hood, and Ed Resto.&lt;ref name="ITunes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/rugrats-season-4/id794055092 |title=Rugrats, Season 4 |date=January 27, 2014 |publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (US) |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308010058/https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/rugrats-season-4/id794055092 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StuffAndThings1" /&gt; Directed by Norton Virgien and Toni Vian, it was produced by the animation studio [[Klasky Csupo|Klasky Csupo Productions]], a part of [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]. Cella Nichols Duffy, Gabor Csupo, [[Arlene Klasky]], Paul De Meyer, Stem, and Weiss also produced the episode. [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] and [[Ruby Andrews]] contributed to the music.&lt;ref name="StuffAndThings1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/29603-Mothers-Day |title=Mother's Day (1997) Season 4 Episode 67- Rugrats Cartoon Episode Guide |publisher=[[The Big Cartoon DataBase]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308011236/https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/29603-Mothers-Day |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, co-creator [[Paul Germain]] revealed that the concept for the episode, and the discussion about the status of Chuckie's mother, was previously [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] to [[Nickelodeon]] executives. She was not included in the first season to avoid the need to animate a completely new character. During the production of the show's second and third seasons, Germain noticed that questions about the character's absence became more prominent. He consulted with fellow co-creator Arlene Klasky, and they concluded that the only two possible ways to address the character was that she was divorced from Chaz, or had died before the series' debut.&lt;ref name="EW1" /&gt;

Germain and Klasky initially planned to portray the character as divorced, but Nickelodeon executives rejected the idea, feeling that the subject would be inappropriate for younger viewers. The studio also vetoed a reveal that the mother was dead, contending that such an idea would be "scary" and that "children [would not] want to see that."&lt;ref name="EW1" /&gt; Germain stated this prevented them from saying much about the character in earlier seasons, adding: "We mention that she exists but we don't tell you what happened to her. We even made a joke out of it in one episode. But we weren't allowed to go into the subject."&lt;ref name="EW1" /&gt; Even when the show did portray Chuckie's mother as having died from a terminal illness, the word "dead" was never used by any of the characters.&lt;ref name="MP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/4032876 |title='90s Nostalgia: 'Rugrats' And The Tragic Story Of Melinda Finster! |last=Chapman |first=Tom |date=August 16, 2016 |publisher=[[Moviepilot]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308001703/https://moviepilot.com/posts/4032876 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character had been briefly mentioned before in the episodes "[[Real or Robots?]]" (1991), "[[Chuckie vs. the Potty]]" (1992), and "[[My Friend Barney]]" (1993).&lt;ref name="Mother1"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Real or Robots? | series=[[Rugrats]] | author=Writer: Steve Viksen, Joe Ansolabehere, Patric M.

==Critical response==
In 1998, Eric Schmuckler of ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed to the "Mother's Day" special as an example of the show's balance between featuring an "always sunny and usually silly" tone while also being "poignant". Schmuckler described Chaz's interactions with Chuckie as "an age-appropriate version of the loss of his mother".&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/30/arts/television-in-rugrats-babies-know-best.html |title=Television; In 'Rugrats,' Babies Know Best |last=Schmuckler |first=Eric |date=August 30, 1998 |work=[[The New York Times]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308004922/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/30/arts/television-in-rugrats-babies-know-best.html |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rugrats'' was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]] for the [[49th Primetime Emmy Awards]], after Nickelodeon submitted the special for consideration,&lt;ref name="StuffAndThings1" /&gt; but lost to ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref name="Winner1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/simpsons |title=Simpsons |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525153316/http://www.emmys.com/shows/simpsons |archivedate=May 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was also nominated for the [[Humanitas Prize]] for the Children's Animation Category in 1998,&lt;ref name="StuffAndThings1" /&gt; which went to the ''[[Life with Louie]]'' episode "Blinded by Love".&lt;ref name="Winner2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanitasprize.info/HUMANITAS-NEWS-90s/1998%20July%20-%20%20HUMANITAS%20spreads%20'Good%20Will'.pdf |title=Humanitas |publisher=[[Humanitas Prize]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170405131615/http://humanitasprize.info/HUMANITAS-NEWS-90s/1998%20July%20-%20%20HUMANITAS%20spreads%20'Good%20Will'.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J.

"Mother's Day" has been the subject of several retrospective reviews of the series. Philip Lewis of Arts.Mic praised the episode as an example of Nickelodeon's potential to cover a serious subject, noting its treatment of "the loss of a parent" as one of the series' most memorable moments.&lt;ref name="Mic1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/132324/5-times-nickelodeon-cartoons-tackled-real-issues#.3TEqOo2os |title=5 Times Nickelodeon Cartoons Tackled Real Issues |last=Lewis |first=Philip |date=January 12, 2016 |publisher=Art.Mic |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308002521/https://mic.com/articles/132324/5-times-nickelodeon-cartoons-tackled-real-issues%23.3TEqOo2os |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moviepilot]]'s Kristy Anderson wrote that the development of Chuckie's backstory was a surprise as "[f]ew would have expected to be confronted by the topic of death while watching a cartoon about babies".&lt;ref name="MPSomethingDark"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/4102801 |title=10 Animated Characters With Horribly Tragic Backstories |last=Anderson |first=Kristy |date=October 3, 2016 |publisher=[[Moviepilot]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170310212500/https://moviepilot.com/posts/4102801 |archivedate=March 10, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book ''Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim'', authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin echoed Anderson's sentiment, commenting that the episode could "hit you like a truck if you let it".{{sfn|Atkinson|Shifrin|2007|p=37}}

"Mother's Day" has been cited in several lists of commentators' favorite episodes or moments from ''Rugrats''. Anderson placed it on her list of must-watch episodes from the show's third, fourth, and fifth seasons, suggesting that "[y]ou will need tissues".&lt;ref name="MP2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/4026124 |title=25 Years Of 'Rugrats' 21 Episodes You Need To Watch Part 2: Seasons 3, 4, &amp; 5 |last=Anderson |first=Kristy |date=August 18, 2016 |publisher=[[Moviepilot]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308002403/https://moviepilot.com/posts/4026124 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem written and narrated by Chuckie's mother was praised by Moviepilot's Daniel Pearson,&lt;ref name="MP3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/2814884 |title=This Little Known 'Rugrats' Trivia Will Break Your Heart: The Devastatingly Beautiful Poem Left by Chuckie's Mom! |last=Pearson |first=Daniel |date=March 27, 2015 |publisher=[[Moviepilot]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308002719/https://moviepilot.com/posts/2814884 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included in a list of the top eight most heartfelt moments in animated television by Mara Mullikin of the same publication.&lt;ref name="MP5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/3513467 |title=8 Heartfelt Animated TV Moments |last=Mullikin |first=Mara |date=October 2, 2015 |publisher=[[Moviepilot]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308003106/https://moviepilot.com/posts/3513467 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Beigelman of [[A Plus (aplus.com)|A Plus]] put the episode on his list of seven Mother's Day-themed television episodes, citing it as a "heavy dose of nostalgia".&lt;ref name="APlus1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aplus.com/a/7-mothers-day-tv-episodes?no_monetization=true |title=7 Mother's Day-Themed TV Episodes To Make You Appreciate Your Mom Even More |last=Beigelman |first=Victor |date=May 4, 2016 |publisher=[[A Plus (aplus.com)|A Plus]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308001345/http://aplus.com/a/7-mothers-day-tv-episodes?no_monetization=true |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have also commented on other aspects of the episode. In 2016, Caroline Bologna from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' praised the episode for showing "a joyful depiction of [[breastfeeding]]" and for normalizing it to a wider audience. Bologna contrasted the scene with the lack of images of breastfeeding in contemporary children's television, writing that the show had a "positive legacy" and proved that "this topic was deemed perfectly suitable for a children's show 20 years ago".&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/remember-when-rugrats-normalized-breastfeeding_us_57befba7e4b04193420db778 |title=Remember When 'Rugrats' Normalized Breastfeeding? |last=Bologna |first=Caroline |date=August 25, 2016 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308001525/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/remember-when-rugrats-normalized-breastfeeding_us_57befba7e4b04193420db778 |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priscilla Blossom of the motherhood website Romper.com also praised the scene as addressing [[reproductive health]], along with the portrayal of Tommy's premature birth and time in a neonatal intensive care unit.&lt;ref name="Romper1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.romper.com/p/13-reasons-rugrats-was-the-most-feminist-socially-conscious-cartoon-ever-1665 |title=13 Reasons 'Rugrats' Was The Most Feminist, Socially Conscious Cartoon Ever |last=Bloom |first=Priscilla |date=November 24, 2015 |publisher=Romper.com |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170311000002/https://www.romper.com/p/13-reasons-rugrats-was-the-most-feminist-socially-conscious-cartoon-ever-1665 |archivedate=March 11, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2013 essay "What Is a Mother? Gay and Lesbian Perspectives on Parenting", scholars [[Jack Drescher]], Deborah F. Glazer, Lee Crespi, and David Schwartz analyzed "Mother's Day" as an extension of [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Donald Winnicott]]'s theories on early childhood. They highlighted Chuckie's realization that his father acts like a mother as "a moment of [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] insight" that expands the definition of motherhood.{{sfn|Drescher| Glazer|Crespi|Schwartz|2013|p=96}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19993">The '''National Pledge''' is an [[oath of allegiance]] to the [[Republic of India]]. It is commonly recited by Indians in unison at public events, especially in schools, and during the [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]] and [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]] celebrations. It is commonly found printed in the opening pages of school textbooks and calendars. It is recited in the morning assembly of most Indian schools. However, Pledge is not part of Indian Constitution.

The pledge was originally composed in [[Telugu language]] by writer [[Pydimarri Venkata Subba Rao]] in 1962. It was first read out in a school in [[Visakhapatnam]] in 1963 and was subsequently translated into various regional languages. &lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nalgonda re=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Origin==
The Indian national pledge was composed by [[Pydimarri Venkata Subba Rao]]. Subbarao, a noted author in Telugu and a bureaucrat, composed the pledge while serving as the District Treasury Officer of [[Visakhapatnam District]] in 1962. He presented it to the senior Congress leader Tenneti Viswanadam who forwarded it to the then Education Minister P.V.G. Raju. Subba Rao was born in Anneparti, [[Nalgonda District]], [[Telangana]]. He was an expert in Telugu, Sanskrit, Hindi, English, Arabic languages. He worked as Treasury officer in the state of Hyderabad. After the formation of AP, He worked in [[Khammam]], [[Nizamabad, Telangana|Nizamabad]], Nellore, Visakhapatnam, Nalgonda Districts.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'Pledge', now 50, is the pride of Telugus!|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/article3896153.ece?homepage=true|newspaper=The Hindu|date=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pledge was introduced in many schools in 1963.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes" /&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The Indian National Pledge is commonly recited by Indians at public events, during daily assemblies in many Indian schools, and during the [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]] and [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]] commemoration ceremonies. Unlike the [[National anthem of India|National Anthem]] or the [[National song of India|National Song]], whose authors are well known in India, P.V. Subbarao, the author of the pledge remains largely a little-known figure, his name being mentioned neither in the books nor in any documents. Records with the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Human Resources Development Ministry]] of the [[Government of India]] however record Subbarao as the author of the pledge. Subbarao himself is thought to have been unaware of its status as the National Pledge with a position on par with the National Anthem and the National Song. Apparently, he came to know about this when his granddaughter was reading the pledge from her textbook.&lt;ref name="thehindu" /&gt;

==The Pledge==
{{Commons-inline|National Pledge (India)}}

India is my country. All Indians are my brothers and sisters. &lt;br/&gt;
I love my country and I am proud of its rich and varied heritage. &lt;br/&gt;
I shall always strive to be worthy of it. &lt;br/&gt;
I shall give my parents, teachers and all elders respect and treat everyone with courtesy. &lt;br/&gt;
To my country and my people, I pledge my devotion. &lt;br/&gt;
In their well being and prosperity alone, lies my happiness. &lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5951">'''Neuroarthistory''' is a term coined by Professor [[John Onians]], an [[art history|art historian]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 2005. Neuroarthistory is an approach that concerns the [[neurological]] study of artists, both living and dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2004 Onians taught the [[Postgraduate]] module "Art and the Brain" named after the 1999 paper by Professor [[Semir Zeki]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2005, he began working with Zeki, who is a professor of [[Neurobiology]] at [[University College London]] (and founder of Neuroesthetics) to study what goes on in the brains of artists. They used [[neuroimaging]] and studied the [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes of artists such as the [[painting|painters]] of the [[paleolithic]] [[Chauvet Cave]] art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2005 Onians founded Neuroarthistory in a lecture at the Neuroaesthetics Conference Goldsmiths May 2005. &lt;ref&gt; Onians J (2005) Neuroarthistory: First Principles (A paper presented at the Neuroaesthetics Conference Goldsmith Conference May 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, he wrote and presented the paper 'Neuroarthistory: making more sense of art' which, according to [[The Art Book]] "explored the ways in which our ever-expanding knowledge of the brain invites art historians to reconsider the interaction between the senses and cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In September 2006, Onians presented the results of the research to the [[BA Festival of Science]] in a lecture called 'Cracking the real Da Vinci Code: what happens in the artist’s brain?'.&lt;ref name="UEArelease"&gt;{{cite press release

The reason is that '[[Synaptic plasticity|neural plasticity]]' ensured that passive exposure to different natural and man-made environments caused the formation of different visual preferences."&lt;ref name="UEArelease"/&gt;

A book, ''Neuroarthistory: From Aristotle and Pliny to Baxandall and Zeki'' was published in 2008 by Yale University Press, discussing a number of [[case study|case studies]] from art history, and being the 'preface' to a further two books on the subject. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''polemic''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|m|ɪ|k}}) is contentious [[rhetoric]] that is intended to support a specific position by aggressive claims and undermining of the opposing position.  Polemics are mostly seen in arguments about controversial topics. The practice of such argumentation is called ''polemics''. A person who often writes polemics, or who speaks polemically, is called a ''polemicist''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (Merriam-Webster, Springfield, MA, 2005), s.v. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/polemic "polemic"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word is derived {{ety|gre|''πολεμικός'' (polemikos)|warlike, hostile}},&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American College Dictionary (Random House, New York)&lt;/ref&gt; {{ety||''πόλεμος'' (polemos)|war}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpo%2Flemos πόλεμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

Polemics often concern issues in [[religion]] or [[politics]]. A polemic style of writing was common in [[Ancient Greece]], as in the writings of the historian [[Polybius]]. Polemic again became common in [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] times. Since then, famous polemicists have included the satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]], the socialist philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], the [[novelist]] [[George Orwell]], the psycholinguist [[Noam Chomsky]], the social critic [[Christopher Hitchens]], the existential philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], author of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality|On the Genealogy of Morality: A Polemic]]''.

==Overview==
Polemics are usually addressed to important issues in [[religion]] and [[politics]]. Polemic journalism was common in [[continental Europe]] at a time when [[libel]] laws were not as stringent as they are now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-467241/polemic |title=polemic, or polemical literature, or polemics (rhetoric) |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2008-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411123116/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-467241/polemic |archivedate=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To support the study of the controversies of the 17th–19th centuries, a British research project has placed online thousands of polemical pamphlets from that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/collections/rarebooks/named/hayflemingcollection/ | title=Pamphlet and polemic: Pamphlets as a guide to the controversies of the 17th-19th centuries |publisher= St Andrews University Library| accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Discussions around [[atheism]], [[humanism]] and Christianity have remained capable of polemic into the 21st century; for example, in 2007 Brian McClinton argued in ''[[Humani (organisation)|Humani]]'' that anti-religious books such as [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The God Delusion]]'' are part of the polemic tradition.&lt;ref name=McClinton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClinton|first1=Brian|title=A Defence of Polemics|journal=Humani|date=July 2007|issue=105|pages=12–13|url=http://humanistni.org/filestore/image/polemics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]] published a book titled ''Against All Gods: Six Polemics on Religion and an Essay on Kindness'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grayling|first1=A. C.|title=Against All Gods: Six Polemics on Religion and an Essay on Kindness|date=2008|publisher=Oberon Books|isbn=978-1-840-02728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Ancient Greece]], writing was characterised by what Geoffrey Lloyd and Nathan Sivin called "strident adversariality" and "rationalistic aggressiveness", summed up by McClinton as polemic.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Geoffrey |last2=Sivin |first2=Nathan |title=The Way and the Word: Science and Medicine in Early China and Greece |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10160-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ancient historian [[Polybius]] practised "quite bitter self-righteous polemic" against some twenty philosophers, orators, and historians.&lt;ref name=Walbank&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walbank |first1=F. W. |title=Polemic in Polybius |journal=The Journal of Roman Studies |date=1962 |volume=52 |issue=Parts 1 and 2 |pages=1–12 |jstor=297872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polemical writings were common in [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] times.&lt;ref name=Suerbaum&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suerbaum |first1=Almut |last2=Southcombe |first2=George |title=Polemic: Language as Violence in Medieval and Early Modern Discourse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFWrCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT39 |year=2016 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-07929-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, polemic had a religious dimension, as in [[Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages|Jewish texts written to protect and dissuade Jewish communities from converting to other religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chazan, Robert |title=Fashioning Jewish identity in medieval western Christendom |page=7 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages|Medieval Christian writings]] were also often polemical; for example in their disagreements on Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tolan, John Victor |title=Medieval Christian perceptions of Islam |page=420 |publisher=Routledge |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]], famously nailed to the door of the church in [[Wittenburg]], was a powerful polemic launched against the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt; [[Robert Carliell]]'s 1619 defence of the new [[Church of England]] and diatribe against the [[Roman Catholic Church]] – ''Britaine's glorie, or An allegoricall dreame with the exposition thereof: containing The Heathens infidelitie in religion...'' – took the form of a 250-line poem.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Lee, "Carleill, Robert (fl. 1619)", rev. Reavley Gair (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4680. Retrieved 27 May 2017. Pay-walled.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major political polemicists of the 18th century include [[Jonathan Swift]], with pamphlets such as his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', and [[Edmund Burke]], with his attack on the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]].&lt;ref name=Indie&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulin|first1=Tom|title=The Art of Criticism: 12 Polemic|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-art-of-criticism-12-polemic-1612930.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 November 2016|date=26 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s 1848 ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' was extremely polemical.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt; Friedrich Engels's famous work [[Anti-Dühring]] was also a polemic against [[Eugen Dühring]].

In the 20th century, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' was a polemic against [[totalitarianism]], in particular of [[Stalinism]] in the [[Soviet Union]].  According to McClinton, other prominent polemicists of the same century include such diverse figures as [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[John Pilger]] and [[Michael Moore]].&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt;

==Summary==
Once upon a time, in a timeless place, there were three kingdoms: one blue, one red, and one gold. In the blue kingdom, everything was blue, because blue was beautiful. And besides, ''everyone'' who was ''anyone'' loved blue. In the red land, everything was red, because they trusted red, but they were afraid of everything else. The golden kingdom was dominated by yellow. Other colours were to be eliminated on sight. Blue and red were censored, covered up, thus yellow reigned supreme.

But it really didn't matter if the kingdoms didn't like each other, for, you see, travel between the kingdoms was impossible. So they never came into contact. In isolation, each kingdom taught its young what to like and dislike. Other ideas were discouraged, but it couldn't last forever. In time, there came a new idea... a moving new idea... and the world would never be the same! 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/rainbow-war/oclc/220368864 WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
   
In the Golden kingdom, a young boy creates a flying golden ring, large enough to carry a man. Using it, he leaves the Golden kingdom to explore the other lands. The Blue king sees him in his ring, leaving a trail of yellow light through the air, and gets an idea of his own; a blue [[hot air balloon]], which his people can also use to visit the other lands! After he has seen enough of the Blue kingdom, the Yellow boy lands in the Red kingdom, and falls in love with the Red princess, and she with him. He gives her his golden scarf, and in return, she gives him a red flower. When the Red guards see this yellow intruder, they attempt to detain him, but he escapes on his golden ring, and heads back to the Golden kingdom.
   
    
Upon arriving, the Yellow queen hails him as a hero. But when he offers the red flower to her, she is offended, and the Yellow guards take the boy away. The Yellow queen then realizes that with the golden rings the boy has created, she can invade the other kingdoms.
   

Back in the Red kingdom, the princess looks at the Golden Kingdom in the sky, pining for the Yellow boy. The Red king is concerned though, and does not approve of her feelings for him, as he fears for her safety. The Red king is then called away, and through a giant red telescope, he spots the Blue Kingdom and Golden Kingdom's soldiers and leaders coming to his land... with paintbrushes! He rallies his men, and they prepare for war.
   

The Blue king is the first to arrive. The Red king peers at him through a [[periscope]] below the surface, and the Blue king smiles into it, offering to trade with the Reds. The periscope squirts him with red paint. Outraged at this treachery, the Blues retaliate, and begin to paint everything in sight blue. They then meet the Golden army, and their queen. The Blue king attempts to be diplomatic with them, but despite his many offers (A blue necklace, flowers, and a nightie), he only offends the queen and they attack, resulting in a very colorful three-way paint battle for supremacy between the Red, Blue, and Yellow army.
   
 
Meanwhile, in the Golden Kingdom, the Yellow boy is being forced to make golden rings for the army. He manages to outsmart the slavemaster though, and escapes. Back at the front, the battle is still going colorful and strong. But when a volley of blue and yellow paint collides, ''green'' is created, and the soldiers from both sides stop fighting, very interested and happy at what they have created. The Golden queen will have none of it however, and commands her troops to continue fighting. The battle resumes. The Red army, using a giant fire hydrant, coats the whole area with red paint, and when it mixes with the other paints on the field, they discover orange and purple, and the soldiers from all sides again are entranced and overjoyed over these new ideas.
   
  
However, all the fighting has not just created a huge mess. It has also created real danger. While standing on a bridge, the Red princess falls into the river, which is now flowing with paint from all three kingdoms. Before she can fall into the void between the worlds, she grabs the branch of a cliffside tree. When they see what their stupid war has caused, the soldiers of all three kingdoms throw down their paintbrushes and join forces to reach the princess. But as the Blue sentry reaches out to her and she attempts to reach out to him, the tree branch cracks, and she falls screaming into the void along with the colorful runoff of the battle.
   
  
But just in time, the Yellow boy soars through the air on his ring, saving the princess, and splashing through the paint waterfall in the process. Now the ring leaves a trail of all colors, both primary and secondary, and the soldiers and kings are overjoyed at the sight of the very first [[rainbow]], not to mention the rescue of the princess. The Blue King, though he looks skeptical at first at the rainbow, slowly smiles in appreciation of its beauty. The Yellow queen still wants to wage war, and once again commands her troops to keep fighting, but they ignore her commands and splash her with all the paint colors, thus deposing her as ruler. All celebrate, and the Blue King even has a rainbow painted on his clothes as they rejoice together.
   

In the aftermath, all sides celebrate, trading colors with each other, combining their colors to make new colors, and reveling in the beauty of colors in harmony. Rainbow bridges are created to connect the three kingdoms, a symbol of the beauty that is created when all people come together. The Rainbow War has ended, and all kingdoms now live together, happily ever after.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4117">The '''Roseto effect''' is the phenomenon by which a close-knit community experiences a reduced rate of heart disease.  The effect is named for [[Roseto, Pennsylvania]].  The Roseto effect was first noticed in 1961 when the local Roseto doctor encountered Dr. [[Stewart Wolf]], then head of Medicine of the [[University of Oklahoma]], and they discussed, over a couple of beers, the unusually low rate of [[myocardial infarction]] in the [[Italian American]] community of Roseto compared with other locations.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-10-11/news/9610110254_1_satellite-dishes-outsiders-town | title=A New 'Roseto Effect': 'People Are Nourished By Other People' | work=Chicago Tribune | date=October 11, 1996 | accessdate=January 18, 2014 | author=Grossman, Ron | location=Roseto, Pa. | author2=Leroux, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CholesterolMyth"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IHE2vK3-fwC&amp;lpg=PA149 | title=The Great Cholesterol Myth | publisher=Fair Winds Press | author=Bowden, Johnny | year=2012 | pages=240 | isbn=9781592335213 | author2=Sinatra, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1721083 | title=Unusually Low Incidence of Death From Myocardial Infarction: Study of an Italian American Community in Pennsylvania | author=Stout, Clarke | journal=JAMA | year=1964 | volume=188 | issue=10 | pages=845–849 | doi=10.1001/jama.1964.03060360005001 | author2=Morrow, Jerry | author3=Brandt, Edward N. Jr. | author4=Wolf, Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies followed, including a 50-year study comparing Roseto to nearby [[Bangor, Pennsylvania|Bangor]].  As the original authors had predicted, as the Roseto cohort shed their Italian social structure and became more Americanized in the years following the initial study, heart disease rates increased, becoming similar to those of neighboring towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1695733/pdf/amjph00545-0027.pdf | title=The Roseto Effect: A 50-Year Comparison of Mortality Rates | author=Egolf, B | journal=American Journal of Public Health | year=1992 | volume=82 | issue=8 | pages=1089–1092 | author2=Lasker, J | author3=Wolf, S | author4=Potvin, L | pmc=1695733 | pmid=1636828 | doi=10.2105/ajph.82.8.1089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1954 to 1961, Roseto had nearly no heart attacks for the otherwise high-risk group of men 55 to 64, and men over 65 had a death rate of 1% while the national average was 2%.  Widowers outnumbered widows, as well.&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt;

These statistics were at odds with a number of other factors observed in the community.  They smoked unfiltered [[stogie]]s, drank [[wine]] "with seeming abandon" in lieu of [[milk]] and [[soft drink]]s, skipped the [[Mediterranean diet]] in favor of meatballs and sausages fried in lard with hard and soft cheeses.  The men worked in the [[slate]] quarries where they contracted illnesses from gases and dust.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-rock-positano/the-mystery-of-the-roseta_b_73260.html | title=The Mystery of the Rosetan People | work=Huffington Post | date=November 23, 2007 | accessdate=January 18, 2014 | author=Positano, Rock}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roseto also had no crime, and very few applications for public assistance.&lt;ref name="HuffPo"/&gt;

Wolf attributed Rosetans' lower heart disease rate to lower stress.  "'The community,' Wolf says, 'was very cohesive. There was no [[keeping up with the Joneses]]. Houses were very close together, and everyone lived more or less alike.'"  Elders were revered and incorporated into community life.  Housewives were respected, and fathers ran the families.&lt;ref name="CholesterolMyth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20076736,00.html | title=Stress Has Hit Roseto, Pa., Once the Town Heart Disease Passed by | author=Cassill, Kay | journal=People | date=June 16, 1980 | volume=13 | issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Valentine’s key''' is a [[amulet|charm]] used in the province of [[Padua]], [[Italy]]. It is a metal key named after [[Saint Valentine]], the [[patron saint]] of love and marriage, but also believed to offer a cure for [[epilepsy]], traditionally known as ''"Saint Valentine's Malady"''.&lt;ref name="Illes2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Illes|first=Judika|title=Encyclopedia of Mystics, Saints &amp; Sages|date=11 October 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-209854-2|page=1238|quote=Saint picture of saint valentine's keys is invoked for healing as well as love. He protects against fainting and is requested to heal epilepsy and other seizure disorders. In northern Italy, epilepsy was once traditionally known as Saint Valentine's Malady.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once common in southern [[Germany]], eastern [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], and northern [[Italy]] to appeal to him to heal the latter condition, known for that reason as Saint Valentine's affliction.

The key is gifted as a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] symbol and an invitation to "unlock the giver's heart".

In a ceremony at the Oratorio di San Giorgio, a small chapel in [[Monselice]], Padua, on [[Saint Valentine's Day]] each year, small golden keys are given to children to ward off epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/amulets/index.php/keys-amulet2/index.html Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, "St Valentine Key, Italy"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sherlock Holmes in New York''''' is a 1976 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[mystery film]] about [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Doctor Watson]], played by [[Roger Moore]] and [[Patrick Macnee]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/show/61081/Sherlock-Holmes-in-New-York/overview|title=The New York Times|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the film's title the production was shot entirely in [[Southern California]] at the 20th Century-Fox lot in [[West Los Angeles]], with some scenes filmed at the [[Mayfair Music Hall]] in [[Santa Monica]].

==Plot==
The great detective Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion Dr. John Watson travel to [[New York City]] to investigate a recent threat made by [[Professor Moriarty]].

During their investigation, Holmes and Watson are reunited with their old acquaintance [[Irene Adler]], now a popular music-hall singer, who reveals that Moriarty has kidnapped her son. Moriarty has also left a note for Holmes informing him that he will be approached by the police soon for aid in a crime, and should he not refuse – Moriarty also informing him that he should provide no reason for his refusal – the boy will die.

Holmes is subsequently contacted by the [[NYPD]] regarding the recent apparent theft of the international gold exchange at the New York bank, with the entire vault of gold bars having vanished seemingly overnight, the theft only secret until a planned transaction between Italy and Germany in three days' time. To protect the child, Holmes refuses the case, but a chance comment by Watson inspires Holmes to shift his attention to finding Scott to remove the blackmail card. While Watson departs with Irene disguised as Holmes to draw away the agent Moriarty has assigned to watch him, Holmes determines that Scott was tricked into cooperating with the kidnapping as an apparent joke, allowing him to find the kidnapper.

Investigating the vaults, and quickly ruling as impossible the actual removal of many tonnes of gold via a narrow tunnel in the time available, Holmes swiftly determines what has taken place; based on the speed of the lift's descent, it should take them 45 seconds to reach the vaults, but they stopped after only 42 seconds. From this, Holmes deduces that Moriarty had an empty, duplicate vault built a few meters above the real one, subsequently planting iron bars to stop the lift reaching the real vault. While everyone puzzled over how the bars of gold were stolen from the false vault, Moriarty would actually be stealing them from the real one below.  In a final confrontation in New York's underground, Moriarty escapes.

The case is solved. As Holmes and Adler say their goodbyes, Adler comments that her son has a keen intellect and a certain knack for solving puzzles, implying that Holmes may be his father. The two nevertheless part ways with Adler giving Holmes a picture of her son to keep.

'''''Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street: A Life of the World's First Consulting Detective''''' is a 1962 novel by [[William S. Baring-Gould]]. The book purports to be a [[biography]] of [[Sherlock Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Phil|title=The BFI Companion to Crime|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1997|page=168|ISBN=9780520215382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''So Young''''' ({{zh|t=致我們終將逝去的青春|s=致我们终将逝去的青春}}) is a 2013 Chinese drama film directed by [[Zhao Wei]]. It is based on the best-selling novel of the same name ''To Our Youth that is Fading Away'' by Xin Yiwu. The film is Zhao's [[directorial debut]].

In addition to the novel, the film was also based in part by Zhao's own personal college experience in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/china-box-office-gi-joe-443910|title=China Box Office: ‘G.I.

==Plot==
Zheng Wei starts her college freshman year as a civil engineer major to be in the same city as her childhood playmate, Lin Jing, whom she is determined to marry one day. When Wei visits Jing at his college dormitory however, Jing's roommate tells her Jing left for America. Unable to understand why Jing abruptly left without saying goodbye, Wei is left confused and heartbroken.

Back in her college dormitory, Wei becomes close friends with her three roommates, Ruan Guan, the most beautiful and popular girl in the class; Li Weijuan, a practical and realistic girl who comes from a poor town but determined to marry well; and Zhu Xiaobei, a tomboy. The four girls talk about their goals in life, and all cheer to Ruan Guan's ambition—to have a youth that never fades away.

Wei is befriended by Lao Zhang and his roommate Xu Kaiyang, architecture majors, during the college clubs and activities fair. Kaiyang came from a well-to-do family and starts a romantic pursuit for Wei, but Wei only regards him as a friend. One evening Wei goes to Lao Zhang and Kaiyang's dorm room to borrow their DVDs. Wei is amazed and disgusted by the messy condition of the male dormroom, except one bed and corner that is uncannily neat and clean. Lao Zhang explains that this spot belongs to their disciplined and hardworking roommate, Chen Xiaozheng. Laozhang exits for a moment to find his DVDs, leaving Wei alone in the room. Wei sees a near finished building model on the table and curiously starts fumbling with the parts. At this moment Xiaozheng comes back and angrily yells out, "What are you doing?" Startled and swinging around to see yelled, Wei knocks the model off the table. Xiaozheng manages to save his model by shoving Wei out of the way, who falls in a mess to the floor. Enraged in humiliation, Wei angrily demands an apology from Xiaozheng, but Xiaozheng coolly replies that he has nothing to apologize for and that it was her fault for touching his model. From this moment, Wei becomes determined to repeatedly humiliate and bring trouble to Xiaozheng until she gets the apology she believes she deserves. Through her attempts Wei comes to the startling realization that in fact, she likes Xiaozheng. From Lao Zhang and Weijuan, Wei learns that Xiaozheng comes from a poor family and was raised by a strict mother, hence his aloof and disciplined personality. Wei declares her interest in Xiaozheng, then openly, relentlessly, and shamelessly stalks Xiaozheng to get his attention, much to his annoyance. Eventually, Xiaozheng, impressed by her enthusiasm, determination, and spirit finds that he has come to like Wei too, and the two start going together.

During the rest of their college life and relationship, Xiaozheng and Wei find that they have starkly contrasting personalities. Although he appreciates Wei's fiery enthusiastic personality, Xiaozheng also reprimands Wei at times for her laid-back and undisciplined attitude towards her coursework. Wei asks Xiaozheng why he is always so serious about everything. Xiaozheng replies, "I don't know what your attitude towards your life is, but my life is like a building that can only be built once, so I cannot afford any margin of error, not even a centimeter's width." Due to his family's modest financial circumstances, Xiaozheng feels that he needs to do anything and everything he can to ensure the best possible professional future for himself.

Eventually graduation comes upon Wei and Xiaozheng. At the on-campus recruitment and interview fair, Wei hopes she and Xiaozheng can find work at the same institute thus remain together. Unbeknownst to Wei, Xiaozheng has applied to and obtained a graduate fellowship to study architecture in America. When Wei finally learns of his plan, she confronts Xiaozheng to ask why she was the last one to know. Xiaozheng attempts to explain with difficulty that he could not tell her because he was afraid of hurting her and reiterates that he can not make any mistake in his life. He then apologizes, saying that he had to make this choice of leaving her to make a better future for himself.

A few years later, Wei has now become a mature professional who excels in her work, and is much different from her bygone youthful days. One day she suddenly encounters Lin Jing. Jing explains that he left abruptly because he learned his father was having an affair with Wei's mother, so he could not face Wei. He never went to America, but avoided contact with Wei.  The one time when he saw Wei on at her campus, she was happy with Xiaozheng. Now however, he wants to come back and rekindle their friendship and, if possible, romance. At this time, Xiaozheng also returns from America, now as a renowned and accomplished architect. Though he has everything professionally that he was determined to get, Xiaozheng finds the life that he has gained empty and crippled. He deeply regrets letting go of Wei, realizing his time with her was the only time he was himself, thus he also wants to rekindle their relationship. However, Wei on their first meeting firmly rejects Xiaocheng. Not long afterward, Ruan Guan is killed in a car accident when trying to meet her university boyfriend for one last time before she is getting married to another man. Wei, in grief, asks Lin Jing to marry her. However, she later calls it off when Lin Jing tells Wei about another girl that loved him during their time apart. Afterwards, Xiaocheng and Wei meet once more at the aquarium to reminisce. There Xiaozheng asks Wei, "Can I start over, and love you again?" to which Wei replies, "Xiaozheng, we spent our youth together, we owe each other nothing... youth is something you can only relive in memory."

==Casting==
Xin Yiwu, author of the novel, has mentioned that Zhao Wei was actually her choice to play the lead character of "Zheng Wei". However, Zhao declined the offer, and opted to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Clair (China Edition): February, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Mark Chao and Han Geng, a majority of the cast are newcomers, including Yang Zishan, who played the story's protagonist Zheng Wei.&lt;ref&gt;ELLE (China Edition): October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao stated, "They're very green and new. Sometimes they even lack common sense. But I like working with them because they're down-to-earth...What they lack in experience, they replace with enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.news.yahoo.com/vicki-zhao-confident-young-063700870.html Vicki Zhao confident with "So Young"].

==Production==
For this film, Zhao Wei intended to take the story in a panorama view to the life of college students in the 1990s, "not just a love triangle", "I'd like to devote this film to everyone out there who had a similar youth... It’s a memory shared by those who were born on the Chinese Mainland between the 1970s and early 80s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeoutbeijing.com/features/Books__Film/20358/Preview-So-Young.html Preview: So Young].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
After the premiere of the film in Beijing, it has gained favorable reviews from critics and audience, and has been dubbed a "mature directorial debut".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ent.sina.com.cn/m/c/w/2013-04-22/10563905325.shtml 赵薇《致青春》获好评：成熟的处女作] Sina.com April 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also gained positive reviews from English-language critics. Dereke Elley of ''[[Film Business Asia]]'' gave the film a 7 out of 10,  describes the film as "an impressive directorial debut" and praised the film's "powerhouse first 90 minutes" as "that draw an involving portrait of love, friendship, ambition and broken dreams among a group of university students..." However, Elley criticized the last portion of the film, and states "as the film abruptly flashes forward several years to pick up the characters in the big city, all the dramatic credit accumulated to that point is squandered by a final 40 minutes that seem rushed and fabricated, with none of the earlier dramatic traction."  Elley summoned up "As a two-part movie running some three hours, ''So Young'' could have been a truly epic portrait of youthful emotional errors and their later consequences. As it stands, it's a remarkable directorial debut by Zhao that's well acted by its ensemble cast but is more of an ambitious, great-looking torso than a single movie." Elley also states "One can only hope that one day an extended Director's Cut of the film will eventually emerge on ancillary."&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/so-young|title=Review: So Young|publisher=''Film Business Asia''|date=16 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926025547/http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/so-young|archivedate=26 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggie Lee of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as an "accomplished directing debut" and "a lyrical ode to youth at its most fearless and foolhardy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-so-young-1200491146/|title=So Young Review|work=Variety|date=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Kerr of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote "Anchored by an engaging performance by Yang Zishan in her first lead role, Zhao's film proves the actress turned director adept with images and actors." "The film’s first 90 minutes make for a complete enough film that the bloated, soapy final 40 become a distraction from Zhao and Li’s careful character construction earlier on. It’s been rumored that Zhao’s original cut clocked in at three hours, and so in that light the rushed, half-baked feel of the last act becomes clear. But even with more time the “adult” segment of the film feels out of place, tonally and stylistically. Thankfully Zhao makes the most of her cast, who carry the film farther than it has a right to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/young-film-review-563017|title=So Young: Film Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tay Huizhen of ''MovieXclusive'' (Singapore) gave the film a rating of 4.5/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviexclusive.com/detail.php?c=42&amp;desc=S&amp;p=2393&amp;t=so-young-33268251052020432456235583689321435303403873826149-2013_2393|title=Review: So Young|publisher=MovieXclusive|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many references to '''stuttering in popular culture'''. Because of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced, as well as the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, [[stuttering]] has been a subject of scientific interest, curiosity, discrimination, and ridicule.

Stuttering was, and essentially still is, a riddle with a long history of interest and speculation into its causes and cures. Stutterers can be traced back centuries to the likes of [[Demosthenes]],&lt;ref name=brosch&gt;{{cite journal | author= Brosch S, Pirsigb W

Although George VI went through years of speech therapy for his stammer, Churchill thought that his own very mild stutter added an interesting element to his voice: "Sometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience..."&lt;ref name="fn 10"&gt;{{cite web | title=Churchill: A Study in Oratory | work=The Churchill Centre | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | accessdate=2005-04-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419061110/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | archivedate=2005-04-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stuttering Foundation has a list of Famous People Who Stutter.&lt;ref name=stutteringhelp/&gt;

==Variable expression==
The disorder is variable, which means that in certain situations, such as talking on the telephone, the stuttering might be more severe or less, depending on the anxiety level connected with that activity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In other situations, such as singing (as with [[country music]] star [[Mel Tillis]] or pop singer [[Gareth Gates]]) or speaking alone (or reading from a script, as with actor [[James Earl Jones]] and broadcast journalist [[John Stossel]]), fluency improves. (It is thought that speech production in these situations, as opposed to normal spontaneous speech, may involve a different neurological function.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}})  
Some very mild stutterers, such as [[Bob Newhart]], have used the disorder to their advantage,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} although more severe stutterers very often face serious hurdles in their social and professional lives.

==Literature==
[[Image:LewisCarrollSelfPhoto.jpg|thumb|The well-known author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Lewis Carroll]] hoped to become a priest but was not allowed to because of his stuttering.]]
The well-known author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Lewis Carroll]] hoped to become a priest but was not allowed to because of his stuttering. In response, he wrote a poem which mentions stuttering:&lt;br/&gt;''Learn well your grammar / And never stammer / Write well and neatly / And sing soft sweetly / Drink tea, not coffee; Never eat toffy / Eat bread with butter / Once more don't stutter.''&lt;br/&gt; (Excerpt from ''[http://www.fairrosa.info/carroll.poem.html Rules &amp; Regulations]'') Carroll's well-known stuttering trait is subliminally referenced in ''Alice'', which features a [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] character in one scene. As [[Martin Gardner]] pointed out in ''The Annotated Alice'', the bird is drawn to vaguely resemble Carroll, and Carroll often tended to say his own real last name "Do-Do-Dodgson".

A minor character in the ''[[Codex Alera]]'' series has a pronounced stutter, and it is assumed by other characters that he is simply intimidated by the situation he finds himself in. However, he soon proves that this is not the case, and that he is a brave, intelligent and resourceful young man who just happens to have a speech disfluency. After showing his competence, he is able to give reports and warnings that are taken completely seriously even though his stutter remains as strong as ever.

==Film==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Porky Pig1.jpg|thumb|One of the most famous stuttering fictional characters is the animated cartoon character  [[Porky Pig]] from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' theatrical cartoon series.]] --&gt;
One of the most famous stuttering fictional characters is the animated cartoon character  "[[Porky Pig]]" from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]''/''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' theatrical cartoon series. The creators of Porky wanted a character with a "timid" voice. Originally, an [[Joe Dougherty|actual stutterer]] voiced the pig, but could not control his stutter. [[Mel Blanc]], who had no speech impediments, took over the role and affected the stutter. In 1991, the National Stuttering Project picketed [[Warner Bros.]] demanding that they stop "belittling" stutterers and instead use Porky Pig as an advocate for child stutterers. The studio eventually agreed to grant $12,000 to the Stuttering Foundation of America and released a series of public service announcement posters speaking out against bullying, featuring Porky saying "Everyone's unique and th-th-that's good, folks!".&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/31/news/mn-8914 Porky Pig Lawsuit is No Laughing Matter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, movies such as ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' (1988) and ''[[A Family Thing]]'' (1996) have dealt with contemporary reactions to and portrayals of stuttering. In ''A Fish Called Wanda'', a lead character, played by [[Michael Palin]], has a severe stutter and low self-esteem. His character&amp;mdash;who is socially awkward, nervous, an animal lover, and reclusive&amp;mdash;portrays a prevalent stereotypical image of stutterers. The three other characters in the movie generally make up the spectrum of reactions to stuttering: [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]'s character is sympathetic and sees past it, [[John Cleese]]'s character is polite but indifferent, and [[Kevin Kline]]'s is malicious and sadistic. Upon release the film caused controversy among some stutterers who disliked the film for its portrayal of Palin's character as a pushover amid the [[bullying]] his character receives, and received favor from others who valued the film for showing the difficulties stutterers commonly face. Palin, whose father was a stutterer, stated that in playing the role he intended to show how difficult and painful stuttering can be. He also donated to various stuttering-related causes and later allowed the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children in [[London]] to use his name.

In the 1986 movie ''[[Attention bandits!]]'', Marie-Sophie, the main character's daughter, has a stutter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-12-10/lifestyle/0090050250_1_marie-sophie-claude-lelouch-simon Cops And Robbers With French Rules 'Bandits' Adds Dash Of Humanity To Crime-story Formula]&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was noted for its positive portrayal of stuttering: it was presented as the heroine's distinctive trait, rather than a drawback or a disability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/media/movietext.html#bandits Movies That Portray Stuttering]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1983 movie ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' referenced the real-life stuttering problem of [[John Glenn]]'s wife [[Annie Glenn|Annie]], and how it rendered her fearful and unwilling to do a news conference during his initial space flight.  As he reported in his autobiography, ''John Glenn: A Memoir'', and as shown on-screen in ''The Right Stuff'', her stuttering was never a problem between the two of them, he "just thought of it as something Annie did". But she grew frustrated with it, and some years later put herself through intense speech therapy and was largely successful in masking the outward symptoms of stuttering. A proud moment for the both of them was the first public speech she gave on her experiences as a stutterer.

The novel (and film) ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' has a major character named Billy Bibbit who suffers from a pronounced stutter. Through the story it is revealed that it has very negatively impacted his self-esteem (even leading to a suicide attempt when he stuttered through a marriage proposal and the woman laughed at him). The stutter abruptly disappears after he has sex with a prostitute that another patient smuggles on the ward.

In the film ''[[Rocket Science (2007 film)|Rocket Science]]'', the main character Hal Hefner suffers from stuttering.

In M. Night Shyamalan's 2006 film ''[[Lady in the Water]]'', [[Paul Giamatti]]'s character has a pronounced stutter that selectively disappears when he interacts with [[Bryce Dallas Howard]]'s character.

In the 2012 film ''[[Parental Guidance (film)|Parental Guidance]]'', a major character named Turner has a light stutter which he resolved with practice.

In [[It (2017 film)]], as well as the 1986 [[It (novel)|book]] and 1990 [[It (miniseries)|miniseries]], the character William 'Stuttering Bill' Denbrough suffers with a severe stuttering issue, which was described as having "got worse since his kid brother died." Throughout the movie he stutters profusely, the impediment worsening when he is scared or nervous. In the second half of the film, adult Bill has been seen to have overcome his speech impediment, but it recurs in mere seconds after Mike Hanlon calls to tell Bill the news of Pennywise's return. However, despite stuttering traditionally being associated in popular culture with weak willpower, cowardice and low intelligence, 'Big Bill' was instinctively recognized as the de facto leader of the gang, (even while his stutter was in full effect) and he shows great determination, courage, compassion, and cleverness in every iteration.

In the 2006 film ''[[Buddy Boy]]'', [[Aidan Gillen]]'s character Francis deals with stuttering, isolation, poverty, and a verbally abusive mother. He helps a woman and they eventually become romantically involved. As their relationship grows, he doubts whether she truly loves him despite his flaws. A series of events happen and it is unclear whether Francis makes a discovery or is ill.    

The Academy Award-winning film ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010) also features [[George VI]] as played by [[Colin Firth]] stutter, based on original screenplay by [[David Seidler]] who also used to stutter as a child until age 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the 'naughty word' cured the King's stutter (and mine)|author=David Seidler|authorlink=David Seidler|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1339509/The-Kings-Speech-How-naughty-word-cured-King-George-VIs-stutter.html |publisher=''Daily Mail'' |date=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1339509/The-Kings-Speech-How-naughty-word-cured-King-George-VIs-stutter.html|title=How the 'naughty word' cured the King's stutter (and mine)|author=David Seidler |date=20 December 2010|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 Indian film ''[[Su.. Su... Sudhi Vathmeekam ]]'' starring  [[jayasurya]] had portrayed the life of a real life person who overcomes the challenges faced in life due to stammering.

Benicio Del Toros character in [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]] known only as “DJ” frequently stutters.

==Television==
An episode of the hit TV show ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' involved a stuttering soldier who was convinced he was unintelligent and constantly harassed by his fellow soldiers - and by his commanding officer. The usually pompous [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Charles Winchester|Major Charles Winchester]] ([[David Ogden Stiers]], himself a reformed stutterer) takes it upon himself to prove the soldier is just as intelligent (if not more, since Winchester discovers the young man has a very high IQ) as the rest of his unit, even giving him a treasured copy of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' to read. Winchester had earlier told off the CO for mocking the stuttering, threatening to report his "inhumanity". At the end of the episode, Winchester retires to his tent and listens happily to a tape-recorded letter from his sister, who is revealed to have a pronounced stutter.

[[Ronnie Barker]]'s character in ''[[Open All Hours]]'' has a stutter, which sometimes gets him into trouble. His nephew mocks him for it.

On ''[[South Park]]'', a physically disabled character named [[Jimmy Vulmer]] suffers a severe stutter that has been used to comic effect on the show especially when he is delivering the punchline of a joke or to make otherwise inoffensive words sound offensive.

The character Jeremy, from the late 1960s TV series ''Here Come the Brides'' and played by [[Bobby Sherman]], is another example of a fictional stutterer on TV.

Actor [[Nicholas Brendon]], who played [[Xander Harris]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' for seven consecutive seasons, overcame his stuttering problem and is now a spokesperson for the Stuttering Foundation of America.

In the UK [[Channel 4]] TV documentary series [[Educating Yorkshire]] one followed pupil ''Musharaf Asghar'' has a strong stutter which in the program is helped by load music played through headphones and in a follow-up program ''Stutter School'' by diagram breathing

==Music==
"[[K-K-K-Katy]]" was published in 1918 by [[Geoffrey O'Hara]] and became a huge hit in wartime America, referred to as "The Sensational Stammering Song Success Sung by the Soldiers and Sailors". Anyone who had either a stutter or a [[lisp (speech)|lisp]] was covered. The song uses stuttered lyrics in every line of the chorus, and refers to the stuttering of a stereotypically bashful suitor.

[[Alvin Lucier]]'s 1969 experimental piece ''[[I Am Sitting in a Room]]'' prominently features his stuttering, as well as making reference to it in the spoken lyrics: "I regard this activity ... as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have."

A stylized form of stuttering has frequently appeared in [[popular music]] over the past few decades. [[Buddy Holly]] was a notable user of this technique in many of his songs, as well as supplementing the stutters with other verbal 'tics' and 'hiccups'. In some songs from the 1960s and 1970s the vocalist would rapidly repeat the first syllable of a word. An early example is [[The Who]]'s 1965 song "[[My Generation]]", in which lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]] sings the line "Just talkin' 'bout my G-g-g-generation". In that particular case, the song's stuttering style provides a framework leading up to the sly lyric, "Why don't you just ff-ff-fffffffffade away!". [[The Rasmus]] used a similar technique in their song "[[F-F-F-Falling]]".

Another example was the affected stuttering by [[Canada]]'s [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] in their 1974 hit song "[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]". The stutter was not intended to be part of the final release, it was originally done as a joke about [[Randy Bachman]]'s brother George, who stuttered.

Three songs have gone to #1 on the Billboard charts that include stuttering in the lyrics. "Bennie &amp; The Jets" by Elton John (04/13/1974), "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive (11/9/1974), and "My Sharona" by The Knack (08/25/1979-09/29/1979). "Sussudio" by Phil Collins is another song that went to #1 on 07/06/1985, but he really sings the lyric rather than stuttering through it.

By the early 1980s producers were creating the same effect synthetically using [[tape editing]] and [[sampling (music)|sampling]] of lyrics. [[Paul Hardcastle]]'s 1985 song "[[19 (song)|19]]" features it throughout in both the spoken word and vocal segments. [[Remix]]es of songs very frequently employed the effect. Starting in the 1990s stuttering effects fell out of popular use in music.

In 1995, stutterer [[Scatman John]] turned his problem into his asset and wrote the hit song "[[Scatman (song)|Scatman]]". Stuttering assisted him to [[scat singing|scat sing]] and create incredible sounds. The lyrics are inspirational and directed at stutterers:
:''Everybody stutters one way or the other so check out my message to you''
:''As a matter of fact, don't let nothin' hold you back''
:''If the Scatman can do it, so can you.''

In 2001, "[[Stutter (Joe song)|Stutter]]" by American [[R&amp;B]] singer [[Joe (singer)|Joe]] featuring [[Mystikal]], held the number-one spot for four weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

[[Placebo (band)|Placebo]] used a stammering man's voice on their song "Swallow" featured on their 1996 debut album, [[Placebo (album)|Placebo]].

The song "For You I Will (Confidence)" by [[American pop]] singer [[Teddy Geiger]] features the line "forgive me if i st– stutter from all of the clutter in my head"

The lead singer of indie band [[Bloc Party]], [[Kele Okereke]], has a very pronounced stutter when speaking, but it is not identifiable whilst singing.

The song "[[Boom! Shake the Room]]" by [[DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince]] has a few lines featuring stuttering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metrolyrics.com/boom-shake-the-room-lyrics-dj-jazzy-jeff.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris Minor and the Majors]] led by British comedian [[Tony Hawks]] reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart with [[Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime)]], a style parody of [[The Beastie Boys]]. It contains the lines, "'Cause rappin', it's my bread and butter/But it's hard to rap when you're born with a stutter".&lt;ref&gt;https://genius.com/14027153&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Stuttering John"==
Though a stutterer might seem to be an unlikely radio star, [[Howard Stern]] hired a mild stutterer sight unseen ("He stutters? Hire him.") to conduct celebrity interviews. Known on the [[Howard Stern Show|Stern show]] as [[Stuttering John]], John Melendez worked for Stern for 15 years before taking a position as the [[announcer]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Howard Stern also has a collection of [[The Wack Pack|frequent guests]], many of whom have speech impediments of some type; while their afflictions are exploited for comedic purposes, members of [[The Wack Pack]] are well loved by Howard Stern and his fans. John is on the Stuttering Foundation's list of Famous People Who Stutter.&lt;ref name=stutteringhelp/&gt;

==Discrimination and awareness==

In addition to personal feelings of shame or anxiety, discrimination is a significant problem for stutterers. The majority of stutterers experience or have experienced [[bullying]], harassment, or ridicule to some degree during their school years from both peers and teachers who do not understand the condition.&lt;ref name="fn 11"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hugh-Jones S, Smith PK |title=Self-reports of short- and long-term effects of bullying on children who stammer |journal=The British journal of educational psychology |volume=69 ( Pt 2) |issue= 2|pages=141–58 |year=1999 |pmid=10405616 | laysummary = https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,292176,00.html | laysource = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | laydate =  1999-06-04 |doi=10.1348/000709999157626}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be especially difficult for stutterers to form friendships or romantic relationships,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} both because stutterers may avoid social exposure and because non-stutterers may find the disorder unattractive. There is evidence of negative attitudes to people who stutter on the part of employers and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein JF, Hood SB |title=The impact of stuttering on employment opportunities and job performance |journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders |volume=29 |pages=255–273 |year=2004 |pmid=15639081 |doi=10.1016/j.jfludis.2004.08.001 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of people who stutter,&lt;ref&gt;Rice M, Kroll R. [http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/isad9/papers/rice9.html The impact of stuttering at work: challenges and discrimination] From International Stuttering Awareness Day Online Conference 2006. Retrieved 2011-02-26&lt;/ref&gt; 67.6% of respondents believed their capabilities had at times been misjudged by supervisors, and 28.3% considered they had not received a job promotion due to their stutter.

Accordingly, stuttering may be legally classified as a disability in many parts of the world, affording stutterers the same protection from wrongful discrimination as for people with other disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrer, Allan. [http://www.stammeringlaw.org.uk/links.htm Disability discrimination links.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Different jurisdictions have different tests and it will depend on whether these are met in the particular case. People who stutter may, for example, be protected in the U.S. by the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (and/or by state/local legislation),&lt;ref&gt;Parry, William D. [http://www.stutterlaw.com Stuttering and the Law.]&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[Great Britain]] by the [[Equality Act 2010]],&lt;ref&gt;Tyrer, Allan. [http://www.stammeringlaw.org.uk stammeringlaw.org.uk.]&lt;/ref&gt; through the person either having a disability as defined or being 'regarded' or 'perceived' as having one. The Australian Human Rights Commission says stuttering is within the Australian [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Human Rights Commission. [http://www.hreoc.gov.au/disability_rights/faq/who_is_protected_/who_is_protected_.html#stutter Frequently asked questions: Who is protected by the DDA?] Retrieved 2011-02-25&lt;/ref&gt; Legal protection from disability discrimination sometimes extends beyond [[employment discrimination]], for example to provision of services and education, and may include a right to [[reasonable accommodation]].

The [[U.S. Congress]] passed a resolution in May 1988 designating the second week of May as Stuttering Awareness Week, while  [[International Stuttering Awareness Day]] (ISAD), is held internationally on October 22. In September 2005, ISAD was recognised and supported by over 30 Members of the European Parliament (MEPS) at a reception given by the European League of Stuttering Associations.

Even though public awareness of stuttering has improved markedly over the years,{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} misconceptions are still common, usually reinforced by inaccurate media portrayals of stuttering and through popular misconception. A 2002 study focusing on college-age students conducted by the [[University of Minnesota Duluth]] found that a large majority viewed the cause of stuttering as either nervousness or low self-confidence, and many recommended simply "slowing down" as the best course of action for recovery.&lt;ref name="fn 7"&gt;{{cite web | author=Spillers, Cindy | title=Public Perceptions 2002 | work=The University of Minnesota Duluth Stuttering Home Page | url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~cspiller/stutteringpage/publicperceptions02.html | accessdate=2005-04-03 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408013301/http://www.d.umn.edu/~cspiller/stutteringpage/publicperceptions02.html | archivedate=2005-04-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While these misconceptions are damaging and may actually worsen the symptoms of stuttering, groups and organizations are making significant progress towards a greater public awareness.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

'''''Tambu''''' (also '''''tambú''''') is a drum, music genre and dance form, found on [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], and is a major part of the [[music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles|Dutch Antillean music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xb2ibVAXO9sC&amp;pg=PA994&amp;dq=Garland+Encyclopedia+of+World+Music+tambu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN0bv66Y3TAhWlAcAKHbZ_CiAQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Garland%20Encyclopedia%20of%20World%20Music%20tambu&amp;f=false|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: Southeast Asia|last=Nettl|first=Bruno|last2=Miller|first2=Terry E.|last3=Stone|first3=Ruth M.|last4=Williams|first4=Sean|last5=Porter|first5=James|last6=Rice|first6=Timothy|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=|isbn=9780824060404|location=|pages=994|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Bonaire, it is also known as ''bari''. Curaçaoan tambu is a major part of that island's culture, and is there a genre that is considered ''muziek di zumbi'' (literally, ''spirit music'', referring to music of African origin), and is accompanied by instruments like the ''wiri'', ''agan'' and [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]. The word ''tambu'' derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for drum, ''tambor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EH8ESDc9FAUC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=tambu+aruba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizyPXL6Y3TAhVEBMAKHeYDDa4Q6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=tambu%20aruba&amp;f=false|title=African Caribbeans: A Reference Guide|last=West|first=Alan|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780313312403|location=|pages=150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tambu'' can refer to the small drum on which the music is played, the dance that accompanies the music, or the event where the music and dance take place. In modern ''tambu'', the lyrics are usually in the [[Papiamento|Papiamento language]] and are sung along with a ''chapi'' (hoe), the ''tambu'' drum and sometimes other singers, while the audience claps to the rhythm. The ''tambu'' rhythm is complicated and is passed down orally from generation to generation. ''Tambu'' consists of two beats; ''sla habri'' and ''sla será'', the open and closed beat respectively. These beats alternate to create a musical dialogue. Additionally, there are two types of ''tambu'' music; ''telele'', which is a long, slow rising and falling melody, and ''tambu'' itself, which is faster paced and shorter in duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uCigiQGl1fwC&amp;pg=PT37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Aruba, Bonaire &amp; Curacao Alive!|last=Brushaber|first=Susan|last2=Greenberg|first2=Arnold|date=2001-10-01|publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc|year=|isbn=9781588432599|location=|pages=242|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lawnmower Man''''' is a 1992 [[science fiction film|science-fiction]] [[action film|action]]-[[horror film]] directed by [[Brett Leonard]] and written by Brett Leonard and Gimel Everett. The movie is supposedly an adaptation of [[Stephen King]] short story [[The Lawnmower Man|of the same name]], but aside from a single scene, the two are completely different. The film stars [[Jeff Fahey]] as Jobe Smith, a simple-minded gardener, and [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, the scientist who decides to experiment on him.

The film was originally titled ''Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man'', but King successfully sued the producers for attaching his name to the film and stated in court documents that the film "bore no meaningful resemblance" to his story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19920529&amp;id=Lu0xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qX0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6686,8379215 "Stephen King suing producers"], ''The Prescott Courier'', 29 May 1992. retrieved on April 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier short film, also titled ''The Lawnmower Man'', is a more faithful adaptation of the short story. It was directed by Jim Gonis in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-king.tk/lawnmowerman.htm The Lawnmower Man] at Stephen-King.tk&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Leonard would direct another [[virtual reality]] film called ''[[Virtuosity]]'' starring Oscar winners [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]] made in 1995.  

A sequel, ''[[Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace]]'', was released in 1996, with [[Austin O'Brien]] as the only returning actor from the original film.

==Plot==
Dr. Lawrence Angelo works for Virtual Space Industries, running experiments in increasing the intelligence of [[chimpanzee]]s using drugs and [[virtual reality]]. One of the chimps escapes using the warfare tactics for which he was being trained.  Dr. Angelo is generally a [[pacifism|pacifist]], who would rather explore the intelligence-enhancing potential of his research without applying it for military purposes. His wife Caroline is unhappy with the way he is ignoring her to focus on this project.

Jobe Smith, a local [[greenskeeper]] with an [[intellectual disability]], lives in the garden shed owned by the local priest, Father Francis McKeen. McKeen's brother, Terry, is a local landscape gardener and employs Jobe to help him with odd jobs. Father McKeen punishes the challenged Jobe with a belt and "Hail Marys" whenever he fails to complete his chores.

Dr. Angelo realizes he needs a human subject to work with, and he spots Jobe mowing his lawn.  Peter Parkette, Dr. Angelo's young  neighbor, is friends with Jobe. Dr. Angelo invites both of them over to play some virtual reality games. Learning more about Jobe, Angelo persuades him to participate in his experiments, letting him know it will make him smarter. Jobe agrees and begins the program. Dr. Angelo makes it a point to redesign all the intelligence-boosting treatments without the "aggression factors" used in the chimpanzee experiments.

Jobe soon becomes smarter, for example, learning [[Latin]] in only two hours. Meanwhile, Jobe also begins a sexual relationship with a young rich widow, Marnie. However, Jobe begins to display [[telepathic]] abilities and has [[hallucinatory|hallucinations]]. He continues training at the lab, until an accident makes Dr. Angelo shut the program down. The project director, Sebastian Timms, employed by a mysterious agency known as [[The Shop (Stephen King)|The Shop]], keeps tabs on the progress of the experiment, and discreetly swaps Dr. Angelo's new medications with the old Project 5 supply (reintroducing the "aggression factors" into the treatment).

Jobe develops [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] and [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] powers and takes Marnie to the lab to make love to her while in virtual reality. Something goes wrong in the simulation when Jobe's virtual avatar shapeshifts, attacking her mind directly; Marnie is driven insane, laughing endlessly at nothing.

Jobe's powers continue to grow, but the treatments are also affecting his mental stability, and he decides to exact revenge on those who abused him when he was "dumb": Father McKeen is burned alive, a bully named Jake is put into a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state by a mental "lawnmower man" continually mowing his brain, and a lawnmower invention of Jobe's runs down Harold, Peter's abusive father. Jobe uses his telepathic abilities to make the investigating police attribute it all to "bizarre accidents" in front of Dr. Angelo.

Jobe believes his final stage of [[evolution]] is to become "pure energy" in the VSI computer [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]], and from there reach into all the systems of the world. He promises his "birth" will be signaled by every telephone on the planet ringing simultaneously. The Shop sends a team to capture Jobe, but they are ineffective against his abilities and he scatters their molecules. Jobe uses the lab equipment to enter the mainframe computer, abandoning his body to become a completely virtual being, leaving his body behind like a [[husk]].

Dr. Angelo remotely infects the VSI computer, encrypting all of the links to the outside world, trapping Jobe in the mainframe. As Jobe searches for an unencrypted network connection, Dr. Angelo primes bombs to destroy the building. Feeling responsible for what has happened to Jobe, Angelo then joins him in virtual reality to try to reason with him. Jobe overpowers and [[crucifixion|crucifies]] him, then continues to search for a network connection. Peter runs into the building; Jobe still cares for him and allows Dr. Angelo to go free to rescue Peter. Jobe forces a computer-connected security door to open, allowing Peter and Dr. Angelo to escape. Jobe finally escapes through a [[backdoor (computing)|maintenance line]] before the building is destroyed in multiple explosions.

Back at home with Peter, Dr. Angelo and Peter's mother Carla (who has become a romantic interest) are about to leave when their telephone rings, followed by the noise of a second, and then hundreds of telephones ring, all around the globe.

==Production==
The plot of Stephen King's 1975 short story "[[The Lawnmower Man]]" concerns Harold Parkette, who hires "Pastoral Greenery and Outdoor Services Inc." to cut his lawn. The serviceman who arrives to do the job has a lawnmower that mows the lawn by itself while he crawls, naked, behind the mower, eating the grass. The serviceman himself is actually a [[satyr]] who worships the Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. When Parkette tries to call the police, the mower and its owner ritually kill him as a [[sacrifice]] to Pan.

The film's original script, written by director [[Brett Leonard]] and producer [[Gimel Everett]], was titled ''Cyber God'' and had nothing to do with King's short story. [[New Line Cinema]] held the film rights to King's story, and decided to combine ''Cyber God'' with some minor elements of King's "The Lawnmower Man". The resulting film, originally titled ''Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man'', differed so much from the source material that King sued the filmmakers to remove his name from the title.

After two court rulings in King's favor, New Line still did not comply and initially released the home video version as ''Stephen King's The Lawnmower Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Stephen. ''Creepshows: the Illustrated Stephen King Movie Guide'', Titan Books, 2001, pp. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/65/65.F3d.1051.94-7225.94-7409.1996.1997.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517024911/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/65/65.F3d.1051.94-7225.94-7409.1996.1997.html |archivedate=2010-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On King's official website, the film is not listed among the films based on his work. ''The Lawnmower Man'' was released in [[Japan]] under the title ''Virtual Wars''; [[Fuji TV|Fuji Creative]]'s [[Masao Takiyama]] is also credited as a co-producer.

References to the short story include the scene where Jobe kills Peter's father with the lawnmower "Big Red", the aftermath in which the police state that they found some of his remains in the birdbath, and the name of Terry McKeen's company, Pastoral Greenery.

The film has several elements in common with the 1959 [[Daniel Keyes]] novel ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'', which also deals with a mentally disabled man whose intelligence is technologically boosted to genius levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|work= TVTropes.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) was created for the film by [[Angel Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Ultra 64 'Dream Team'|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supervising sound editor was [[Frank Serafine]], who was hired as a result of his sound creation work in the 1982 film ''[[Tron]]''.

Some of the computer-generated scenes were used in ''[[Beyond the Mind's Eye]]'', a video in the ''[[Mind's Eye (series)|Mind's Eye]]'' series.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
{{Asof|July 2018}}, the film held a 34% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 38 reviews with the consensus: "''The Lawnmower Man'' suffers from a predictable, melodramatic script, and its once-groundbreaking visual effects look dated today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lawnmower_man|title=The Lawnmower Man (1992)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The movie debuted at number two at the box office with $7.7 million in its opening weekend behind ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= On the Ropes Columbia Execs Under Fire Over Costly Flops 'Gladiator,' 'Radio Flyer' |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1992-03-17|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-17/entertainment/ca-4047_1_radio-flyer/2|accessdate=2010-11-18|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office 'Lawnmower Man' Cuts the Mustard |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1992-03-10|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-10/entertainment/ca-3604_1_box-offices|accessdate=2010-11-18|first=David J.|last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to gross $32.1 million domestically, making it a moderate financial success against its $10 million budget.

==Sequel and other media==
A sequel ''[[Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace]]'' was released in 1996. It was retitled ''Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe's War'' for its video release. The film received negative reviews from critics and fans of the first movie.

This film had spawned two video games, ''[[The Lawnmower Man (video game)|The Lawnmower Man]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Cyberwar (video game)|Cyberwar]]'' in 1994.

[[Comic book]] writer [[Grant Morrison]] said in an interview&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popimage.com/profile/morrison/012501_grant4.html Grant Morrison interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519150305/http://www.popimage.com/profile/morrison/012501_grant4.html |date=2006-05-19 }} at popimage.com&lt;/ref&gt; that he was contacted by the owners of the ''Lawnmower Man'' franchise in 1995 and asked to write treatments for ''Lawnmower Man 2''. Morrison claims he was asked to "bend the ''Lawnmower Man'' series in an [[X-Men]] superhero-type direction." Neither of Morrison's script treatments was used and ''Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace'' was produced without his involvement.

Some of the  CGI footage of ''The Lawnmower Man'' was featured in ''[[Mind's Eye (film series)|Beyond the Mind's Eye]]''.

[[Jaunt VR]], a virtual reality studio, is adapting the feature into a virtual reality experience with the original rights holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/lawnmower-man-vr-1201963942/|title=Jaunt to Remake ‘Lawnmower Man’ as Virtual Reality Series|first=Janko|last=Roettgers|date=19 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The theatrical version of the film was initially released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] on August 26, 1992. Alongside the 103-minute version, New Line Home Video also released an unrated [[director's cut]] running 141 minutes on VHS and Laserdisc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/21675/75896/Lawnmower-Man-The:-Unrated-Director's-Cut-(1992|title=LaserDisc Database - Lawnmower Man, The: Unrated Director's Cut [75896]|website=www.lddb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the unrated version alerted King to New Line's continued defiance of the order that his name be stricken from the film's credits and all marketing as the back covers stated "Based on a Story by Stephen King". A third court order was needed to force the studio's compliance. As before, the court upheld the two prior judgments, but it took the extra step of imposing a penalty of $10,000 directly payable to King for every day New Line remained in contempt by defying the order. Additionally, the studio would have to forfeit all profits earned on the film during that same period.

The film was released on [[VCD]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=CD Films/Music|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=12 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=October 1996|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DVD]], released in December 1997, contains only the theatrical cut, with scenes from the unrated edition being presented on the DVD as deleted scenes.

The director's cut was released on DVD with the inclusion of the sequel ''Lawnmower Man 2'' on October 25, 2010, in the [[United Kingdom]], however this release suffered from poor NTSC quality transfer with the aspect ratio of 4:3 pan and scan, the extended scenes spliced-in but in the aspect ratio of 16:9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonslater.co.uk/2010/10/01/new-release-the-lawnmower-man-directors-cut The Lawnmower Man Director’s Cut] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101094504/http://www.jasonslater.co.uk/2010/10/01/new-release-the-lawnmower-man-directors-cut/ |date=2011-01-01 }} at jasonslater.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the US Shout! Factory release, [[Blu-ray]] versions of the film were only available in Italy through Minerva Pictures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B004KPC1YE/ref=s9_simh_gw_p74_d3_i1?pf_rd_m=A11IL2PNWYJU7H&amp;pf_rd_s=center-4&amp;pf_rd_r=0E1BJCG8D5TP5EN8VD45&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=451014987&amp;pf_rd_i=426865031|title=Il tagliaerbe|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Germany under the Alive brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Lawnmower-Man-Blu-ray/102313/|title=The Lawnmower Man Blu-ray|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian release contains edited Italian credits at the beginning, which are taken from the DVD version as the difference in quality from the rest of the movie  can be seen (interlaced framing notably).

Shout! Factory released ''The Lawnmower Man'' on Blu-ray for the first time in the United States in June 2017. The two-disc set includes new 4k digital restorations of the theatrical and director's cuts, audio commentary with director Brett Leonard and producer Gimel Everett, an all-new retrospective documentary featuring Leonard and star Jeff Fahey, and all of the bonus features from the original New Line DVD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5215">'''The Ritual of Embalming Papyrus''' or ''Papyrus of the Embalming Ritual'' is one of only two extant papyri which detail anything at all about the practices of [[mummification]] used within the burial practices of Ancient Egyptian culture.

One version of the papyri is contained within the [[Egyptian museum]] Cairo (''Pap. Boulaq No.3'') and the other is within the [[Louvre]] (No. 5158).&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;Robert (''Bob'') Brier, Ronald S.

==The papyri==

==The ritual==
The act of mummification described was to be done while religious acts of [[Prayer|praying]] and [[Incantations|incantation]] were performed [[ritual]]istically.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sXiMtMnPHikC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=The+Ritual+of+Embalming+Papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OhuTVfLnLsPbU8aTofgM&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ritual%20of%20Embalming%20Papyrus&amp;f=false Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary (p.267)] ''Études préliminaires aux religions orientales dans l'Empire romain'', BRILL, 1973, 301 pages, {{ISBN|9004035141}} [Retrieved 2015-06-30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons necessarily present and participating within a performance of the ritual were a ''master of secrets'' or ''[[stolist]]'' (both refer to the same person), a ''[[lector]]'', and a divine chancellor or seal-bearer (''hetemu-netjer''). Of the persons present, the individual who was the   ''hery-sheshta'' fulfilled the most important and superior position, the ''hetemu-netjer'' was next in importance,  then the  ''wetiu'', who were to wrap the embalmed corpse in material.&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Riggs, Christina"/&gt;

The text proceeds in the direction of the embalming the head, toward the feet.&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"/&gt;

The head was to be wrapped firstly in linen, of this first linen, the embalmer was to obtain the linen from [[Sais]], with a second layer added afterwards.&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"/&gt;

'''''The Strange Case of the End of Civilisation as We Know It''''' is a 1977 [[Comedy film|comedy]] directed by [[Joseph McGrath (film director)|Joseph McGrath]] and starring [[John Cleese]]. It is a low-budget [[parody|spoof]] of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] detective series, as well as the [[mystery fiction|mystery]] genre in general.

==Plot==
The film begins aboard a luxury aircraft as Dr. Gropinger ([[Ron Moody]]) (an obvious parody{{opinion|date=December 2014}} of [[Henry Kissinger]]){{fact|date=December 2014}} travels on a goodwill tour. He misplaces his diary and is thrown into a panic as, without the diary, he no longer knows where he is or is supposed to be next. Stepping off the plane, he is shot dead after extending greetings in [[Hebrew]] to a congregation of [[Arabs]]. Soon after, the U.S. President ([[Joss Ackland]] in a caricature of [[Gerald Ford]]) receives a threatening letter signed only "Moriarty", claiming responsibility for the death. The letter also claims Moriarty has set in motion a plan that will allow him to gain control of the world. The president dispatches a top agent to [[London]] to work with the world's top law enforcement officials and find a strategy to combat Moriarty. 

Headed by an incompetent Englishman ([[Denholm Elliott]]), the committee settles on contacting the "present-day" Sherlock Holmes ([[John Cleese]]). He is enrolled by the Commissioner of Police ([[Stratford Johns]]) to lay plans for the capture of the descendant of [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]] before he gains control of the world. Holmes reveals himself to be a great eccentric, with an affinity for certain addictive drugs (a nod to the literary [[Sherlock Holmes]]' experience with [[cocaine]]). He is accompanied by the descendant of [[Dr. Watson]] ([[Arthur Lowe]]), both a medical doctor and utter fool. Unfortunately, the commissioner is murdered before leaving the Holmes residence, his death mainly the result of Watson's rampant stupidity.

The duo then proceed to [[Scotland Yard]] to discuss the situation with the committee. Before any plans can be made, much of the committee is murdered by a distant sniper. Without their help, Holmes dreams up a plan to invite all of the great detectives in the world to a party, with the hope of discovering the true identity of Moriarty. He reasons that Moriarty will be unable to pass up a chance at attacking all of them in one fell swoop. Many fictional detectives are parodied and handed gruesome deaths while Holmes and Watson wait in a suite. The murderer is revealed to be none other than an exact copy of Watson. Due to Watson's ineptitude and the impersonator's great skill in deception, Holmes is faced with a quandary in determining the real culprit (who is actually Moriarty).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2249">A '''type scene''' is a literary convention employed by a narrator across a set of scenes, or related to scenes (place, action) already familiar to the audience. The similarities with, and differences from, the established type are used to illuminate developments in plot and character. As [[Robert Louis Fowler]] wrote, "The technique of the type-scene offers the poet a basic scaffolding, but it also allows the poet to adapt each scene for specific purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fowler | first=Robert Louis | title=The Cambridge companion to Homer | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-521-01246-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}}

Much of the foundational work for such analysis was by Walter Arend in his 1933 ''Die typischen Scenen bei Homer'' book on the ''[[Iliad]]'' of [[Homer]].  Later work by [[Robert Alter]] employed similar examination to parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]], in particular to the betrothal type-scene at the well in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bach | first=Alice | title=Women in the Hebrew Bible | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-415-91561-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}} Another type scene that Alter identifies is the annunciation of the birth of the hero to a barren woman, such as the birth of [[Samson]] to the [[wife of Manoah]], or the birth of [[Samuel]] to [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]]. Other scholars have suggested other type scenes in the Hebrew Bible, such as the [[Divine Council|heavenly council]], [[theophany]], prophetic concealment and the dying monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Benjamin J.

'''''Xenogears'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|ゼノギアス|Zenogiasu|lead=yes}}}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square Co.|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] [[video game console]]. The debut entry in the wider ''[[Xeno (series)|Xeno]]'' franchise, it was released in Japan in February 1998, and in North America in October the same year. The gameplay of ''Xenogears'' revolves around navigating 3D environments both on-foot and using humanoid [[mecha]] dubbed "Gears". Combat is governed by a version of the turn-based "Active Time Battle" system. The story follows protagonist Fei Fong Wong and several others as they journey across the world in an attempt to overthrow the all-powerful rule of Deus. The story incorporates themes of [[Jungian psychology]], Freudian thought, and religious symbolism.

Created by [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] and his wife [[Soraya Saga|Kaori Tanaka]] as a proposal for ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', it was allowed to be developed as its own project, first as a sequel to ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and then as a wholly original game with a [[science fiction]] premise. It was developed under the working title "Project Noah". The characters and mecha were designed by [[Kunihiko Tanaka]], whose designs were portrayed during in-game cinematics through the use of anime cutscenes. Due to time constraints and the team's general inexperience, the second half of the game's plot was primarily told through [[cutscene]]s.

The game was nearly left unlocalized due to its religious content; its localization was handled entirely by Square Electronic Arts staff and translator Richard Honeywood, who described it as one of the most troublesome games of his career. The game received critical acclaim, with praise particularly going towards the storyline, gameplay, characters, and psychological and religious themes, but received criticism for the rushed pace of the second disc, due to a lack of gameplay and excessive narration. By 2003, the game had shipped over a million copies worldwide. It has since gained a [[cult following]]. While a direct sequel was never developed, Takahashi would later found the studio [[Monolith Soft]] and develop the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' trilogy as a [[spiritual successor]].

==Gameplay==
''Xenogears'' combines traditional [[role-playing video game]] structures such as Square's signature Active Time Battle system with new features particular to the game's martial-arts combat style. It features two slightly different battle systems: in the first the user controls human characters in [[turn-based]] combat manipulated through the sequencing of learned combos. The second, making use of "gears", introduces different sets of statistics and abilities for each character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/world.html|title=Xenogears - World|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2008-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001002653/http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/world.html|archivedate=2008-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Xenogears'' features both traditional [[anime]] and pre-rendered [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] movie clips by [[Production I.G]] to illustrate important plot points.&lt;ref name="firstlook"&gt;{{cite web | first=Peter|last=Bartholow | date=1997-09-06 | title=First Look at Xenogears | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2467580.html |publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2008-08-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103170700/http://www.gamespot.com/news/first-look-at-xenogears-2467580 |archivedate=2012-11-03|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player advances the protagonist and his companions through a fully three-dimensional fictional world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/fields.html|title=Xenogears Fields|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2008-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916150335/http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/fields.html|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an [[overworld]] map with visitable cities, geographical sites, and other important locations spread out across several continents. A couple of locations encountered throughout the game exist not on the original world map, but in the sky. At first, the party only travels on foot, but is eventually permitted to make use of a variety of vehicles, including their gears and the "sand submarine" Yggdrasil.

===Battle system===
[[File:Xenogearsbattlescene.jpg|thumb|left|Typical battles make use of the [[Active Time Battle]] system. Once the ATB gauge fills completely for a character, the player will be able to input a battle command for that character]]

Battle in ''Xenogears'' is a variant of the [[Final Fantasy gameplay#Parties and battles|Active Time Battle]] system found in games such as ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series.&lt;ref name="Battle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/xenogears/features.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515105952/http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/xenogears/features.html |archivedate=2009-05-15|title=Xenogears Features|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|accessdate=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most enemy encounters in ''Xenogears'' are [[random encounter|random]]. When a battle begins, there is a transition to a separate screen with a combat interface. Player-characters use a combination of martial arts moves, "Ether" (magical) attacks, and special "Deathblow" combinations which are learned through the repetition of specific proportions of strong, moderate, and weak hits. All offensive actions use [[action point (video gaming)|Action Points]] (AP), costing either three points, two points, or one point, corresponding to the intensity of the attack.&lt;ref name="imbattle"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Square Enix |title=Xenosaga Instruction Booklet |year=1998 |publisher=Square Enix |isbn= |pages=22–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each character can initially use only three AP per turn, but at higher levels, they can eventually use up to seven AP per turn. At a certain point in the game, characters can begin using "Elemental Deathblows", which, as the name implies, attach elemental attributes to physical combos. In addition to being used for attacks, AP may be saved and allocated to Attack Points for combo attacks during later turns. A total of 28 AP may be accumulated for combo attacks.

Characters can also use a variety of magical abilities for both offense and ally-support. These abilities are limited by the number of [[magic point|Ether Points]] (EP) that are available to a character, which must be replenished using items during exploration (non-combat) sequences. For most characters, these abilities are attributed to "Ether," a mysterious power to which (presumably) all humans have access. Some characters' magical abilities are referred to by different names, implying differences in their origins. For example, Fei's magic is called "[[Qi|Chi]]" and Citan's is called "[[Esotericism|Arcane]]". While fighting in gears, human Ether abilities are amplified, though some change or become unavailable during this type of combat.&lt;ref name="Battle"/&gt;

===Gear battle===
In addition to small-scale, hand-to-hand combat, the characters sometimes fight from within their respective giant robots, called gears.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; In gear combat, the limiting factor of AP is replaced by fuel, with each attack consuming an amount corresponding to its power.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; For these battles, "deathblows" may only be executed after first building up the "Attack Level"—an abstract concept represented by a number in the bottom-left of the gear combat interface—through the execution of simple strong, moderate, or weak attacks. One deathblow is allowed per point on the Attack Level gauge. There are three levels for normal gear deathblows and, beyond the third level, an "infinite" level with its own set of deathblows. To reach "Infinity Mode", a character has to stay at attack level 3 while performing any other action. With each turn, there is a chance that Infinity Mode will be reached. Having a duration of three turns, Infinity Mode allows fuel to be recharged in much larger quantities and, while in this mode, gears have access to "Infinity" attacks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Squaresoft |publisher=Squaresoft  |date=1998-02-11 |platform=PlayStation |quote='''Character/Text-box:''' Please insert the text here.  Thank you.}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Gears can regain fuel with a "Charge" command. The gears can also activate "Boosters" which enable them to act faster at a cost of extra fuel per turn.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; The "Special Option" command allows for gear [[health (game mechanic)|HP]] restoration abilities and special, fuel-consuming attacks. When a gear has no fuel left, it can no longer execute attacks, use special options, or use boosters. They can, however, Charge to regain fuel and use Ether abilities. Gear fuel, parts, and upgrades may be purchased in shops or from certain individual vendors.

===Setting===
''Xenogears'' initially takes place on Ignas, the largest continent of the ''Xenogears'' world, and the site of a centuries-long war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first= | last=IGN staff | date=1998-08-18 | title=Xenogears Preview | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/122/122230p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2009-11-18 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423034519/http://psx.ign.com/articles/122/122230p1.html | archivedate=2011-04-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A church-like organization known as the Ethos has excavated [[Mecha|gears]] (giant robot suits), ostensibly for the preservation of the world's culture. Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to provide assistance to Aveh. With Gebler's help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev's territory. As the story unfolds, the setting broadens to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and an AI collective known as the Gazel Ministry, commands the Gebler army and the Ethos and secretly uses both to dominate the land-dwellers. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.

Much of ''Xenogears'' plot and backstory is detailed in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-only book ''Xenogears Perfect Works.''

===Characters===
{{Main|Characters of Xenogears}}
''Xenogears''{{'}} nine playable [[Fictional characters|characters]] hail from different areas of the game's world. The game begins on Ignas, a continent with two countries, Aveh and Kislev. Fei and Citan at first appear to be from this land, although it is later learned that they originate from the capital cities Aphel Aura and Etrenank of the floating countries of Shevat and Solaris, respectively. Fei is the story's protagonist, and has initially lost his memories of his past. Citan is a man whose knowledge of the world and technology often aids in the party's quest. Bart, a desert pirate, is also from Ignas and is the rightful heir to the throne of Aveh. Rico, a [[demi-human]] with incredible strength, lives in a Kislev prison, spending his days as a gear-battling champion. Solaris, a hidden city of advanced technology, is home to several characters in the game. Billy, a pious worker for the Ethos religious group, was originally from Solaris. Elly, a beautiful Gebler officer of Solaris, is destined to be near Fei and falls in love with him by the end of the game. Maria and Chu-Chu are both from Shevat, the floating city and the only place resisting Solaris' domination. Emeralda is a humanoid being constructed by an ancient civilization from a colony of [[nanomachines]], and was retrieved from the ruins of the ancient civilization Zeboim.&lt;ref&gt;'''Krelian''': A nanomachine... a molecular machine... Until recently, we were only able to produce... materials which were several times the size of this. Thanks to that girl, the one we obtained from the ruins of the Zeboim civilization, we are now able to make it this compact and elaborate. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=2008-08-17 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant non-playable characters include Krelian and Miang, both leaders of Solaris who seek to revive Deus, a mechanical weapon that fell to earth thousands of years ago. They serve as the game's main [[antagonist]]s. Grahf, a mysterious man with immense power, serves as a major antagonist ; he follows Fei and his group and often fights them, though his goals remain a mystery until very late in the game. As being ''the Contact'', ''the Anti-type'' and ''the Complement'', Fei, Elly, and Miang have been reincarnated several times throughout the game's history.&lt;ref name="parish"/&gt;

===Story=== 
''Xenogears'' centers around the protagonist Fei Fong Wong, an adopted young male in the village of Lahan, brought by a mysterious "masked man" three years ago.&lt;ref name="characters"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Brady Games |title=Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide |year=1998 |publisher=BradyGames |isbn=1-56686-825-4 |pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events surrounding Fei's arrival at the village cause him to have [[retrograde amnesia]]. During an attack on Lahan from Gebler, Fei pilots an empty gear and fights the enemy, accidentally destroying the village. As a result, Fei and Citan, the village's doctor, decide to leave with the abandoned gear to get it away from the village.&lt;ref&gt;'''Citan''':And Fei... it may be a good idea for you to leave this place. There is no guarantee that reinforcements from yesterday's units are not going to come.{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fei meets Elly, a Gebler officer, and Grahf, who claims to know about Fei's past and admits to spearheading the attack on Lahan to unlock Fei's abilities. Eventually, Fei and Citan are picked up by Bart, a desert pirate and heir to the throne of Aveh. Fei again loses control of himself inside his gear while Bart and Citan are attacked by an unknown red gear. Fei wakes up in a Kislev prison and meets Wiseman, a mysterious masked man, who originally brought Fei to Lahan.&lt;ref&gt;'''Citan''': The Yggdrasil was badly damaged and sank...I jumped in an escape-pod. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fei is able to escape with the help of his friends, including a new one, prisoner Rico, but he and Elly are separated from the rest of the party and accidentally shot down by Bart.&lt;ref&gt;'''Bart''':Rah hah hah!! That's the power of the Bart Missiles!! Even Kislev's prototype can't stand up to it!! ...Uh, hey... S-stay back... Keep away!{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are rescued by the Thames, a mobile floating city. After learning Elly's whereabouts, Gebler attacks Thames to kidnap Elly and Miang, a Gebler officer, unsuccessfully attempts to brainwash her. Gebler leader Ramsus, who holds a vendetta against Fei, attacks Thames, searching for him.&lt;ref&gt;'''Ramsus''': Right. I've got him! I have been looking for you! My arch rival! {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Billy, an Ethos worker onboard Thames, allows Fei to use the Ethos' advanced medical technology. Bishop Stone, Ethos' leader, reveals to the party Ethos's true purpose of controlling the land dwellers, or "Lambs", for Solaris.&lt;ref&gt;'''Stone''': You believed that you were saving wandering souls weren't you? That's why you carried out your cleansing of the 'Reapers', -Wels- from the earth, right? In fact it was all just another control system put in place by Solaris. But what's more, your 'saving' work... that very activity you believed in so much, was in reality...{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group follows Stone to Zeboim, an excavation site. They discover a young girl composed of [[nanomachine]]s, which is what Krelian, a Solarian leader, seeks. Stone takes the girl while the group fights Id, the mysterious red gear's pilot, who wants the girl, but is stopped by Wiseman.&lt;ref&gt;'''Id''': To you, it is just a used-up toy. So give it back. It belongs to me... {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group returns and finds Fei awake and standing at his gear with a case of [[anterograde amnesia]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Fei''': I don't know what I'm doing here myself... I don't have a clear head yet. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fei and his friends decide to ally themselves with the floating city of Shevat, the only remaining city capable of resisting Solaris, joined by Shevat locals Maria and Chu-Chu. During this time, Bart regains his throne and initiates peace between the two countries and Stone is destroyed. Upon entering Solaris, they encounter Emeralda, the nanomachine colony. She attacks at first, but recognizes Fei, referring to him as "Kim", much to Fei's confusion.&lt;ref&gt;'''Rattan''': With that, excuse me. I must report the results. Oh yes, go ahead and take the girl. Use her anyway you like. After all, she is your daughter... {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Solaris, Fei learns that Citan has been working for Emperor Cain, though he's actually a double agent on their side, and that Solaris has been producing food and medicine out of [[Cannibalism|recycled humans]] in the Soylent System facility.&lt;ref&gt;'''Citan''': Soylent System. The organism experiment lab and its disposal facility in Solaris. And the production facility for food and medicine to maintain the Limiter seal. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also learns that the Gazel Ministry seeks to revive God and achieve eternal life, while Krelian seeks to possess Elly. Back at Shevat, Citan informs his friends that Id is actually Fei's [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]], with Fei's gear turning red when he switches to Id due to their connection.&lt;ref&gt;'''Citan''': Yes, if it were only Id and Fei. But that does not seem to be the case. Id only manifests when Fei's mental energy is in a weakened state. It is a mystery in itself that the lower level personality of Fei...has any control over the upper level personality of Id. It is obvious that there exists a third personality. Id calls this existence the coward. In my observation, this coward may be the fundamental personality of Fei. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gazel Ministry uses the Gaetia Key, an artifact that manipulates the DNA of massive amounts of humans around the world, turning them into mutants called Wels in order to collect flesh to reconstruct their god, an all-powerful Gear called Deus that crash-landed on the planet ten thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;'''Elly as Miang''': Yes, but there is more... The core that was detached from Zohar, the 'Biological ComputerKadomony' crashed onto this primitive planet. It activated -Persona-, its lifesupport plant, that can generate organic material. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other.&lt;ref&gt;'''Elly''': I also learned that I really do need you... It's not because I need you as a sanctuary for my problems. I need you because I truly love you. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; They learn that they are the reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan. Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan around the time of the war between Shevat and Solaris five-hundred years earlier. Lacan blamed himself for Sophia's death during the war and, with the help of Miang, became Grahf and sought to destroy the world. Although defeated, he and Miang have transmigrated their minds into other humans since. Krelian and Miang dispose of the Emperor and the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap Elly, the ''Mother'', who must be sacrificed in order to revive Deus. Miang is killed by an enraged Ramsus as he realizes he has been used, and Elly turns into Miang, becoming absorbed by Deus. Fei, as Id, attempts to make contact with the Zohar. Wiseman, who reveals himself to be Fei's father, stops him, giving peace to Fei's other personalities. Fei's gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears, revealing that he had been inside Fei's father's body.&lt;ref&gt;'''Grahf''': I hear you Fei... You see, He and I are one. I am Khan, Khan is me. He has become one with me, so you too should open your heart and unite with me. Then we can go onto eliminate everything! {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Fei makes contact with the Wave Existence—an extra-dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the source of power for all gears—and learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity. Grahf tries to merge with Fei and is defeated.

Fei discovers that he is a descendant of Abel, a young boy who was a passenger on board the Eldridge, a spaceship that was being used to transport Deus, the core of an interplanetary invasion system created by a federation of spacefaring humans, one that was deemed far too dangerous for use and was therefore dismantled.&lt;ref name="parish"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]| publisher = [[Ziff Davis]] Media| issue = 221|date=November 2007| title = Retronauts Presents: WTFiction!?| first = Jeremy| last = Parish| pages = 132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deus, however, had become [[self-aware]] and took over the Eldridge. Amidst the confusion, Abel was separated from his mother and accidentally made contact with the Wave Existence through the Zohar, Deus' power source. It gave him the power to one day destroy Deus and the Zohar in order to free itself. The Wave Existence also sensed Abel's longing for his mother and used the biological computer Kadomony to create a woman for a companion.&lt;ref&gt;'''Wave Existence''': As a contact, being but only a child, you defined my existence with your desire to return to your mother. Thus I came to prepare the mother's will... that will is Elhaym.{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Deus gained full control over the Eldridge, the captain decided to initiate the self-destruct sequence in an attempt to destroy it. Both Deus and the Zohar survived the explosion and landed on a nearby planet along with Abel, under the protection of the Wave Existence. He was the sole survivor, but was soon united with the woman that the Wave Existence had created for him as a companion, Elly. Abel and Elly, at first, led a happy life, but Deus had also created Miang, Cain, and the Gazel Ministry to begin a human civilization on the planet, one which would be under their control to one day be turned into Wels and be absorbed into Deus to recover its strength. When the now-adult Abel and Elly discovered this, they openly challenged Cain and the Gazel Ministry, but lost. However, through the power of the Wave Existence, they are able to be reincarnated in later eras to combat Deus.&lt;ref name="parish"/&gt; One of these incarnations lived during an ancient technologically advanced era in Zeboim, where Abel's incarnation went by the name Kim and created Emeralda. Ramsus, revealed to be a biologically engineered clone of Emperor Cain created by Solaris scientists as a means of controlling Deus who was rejected in favor of Fei, hence his hatred of the latter, attacks one more time and is finally defeated. He is later rescued during an attack and convinced to let go of his anger and aid the group.

Fei sets out to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy released from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet.&lt;ref&gt;'''Citan''': It is like a shock wave that is induced by the dimensional displacement. But... so much energy!? If this much energy is unleashed here now...{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elly, inside Deus, tries to move it away from the planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;'''Elly''': Yes. I came to understand after becoming one with Krelian... His heart was so full of sadness. That is why he desired for he and I to become one with god... Because that would be the return to the beginning of everything... He told me... "You should be with him..." That is what he said... You see... He already knew! Yes, he already knew... how I felt, how you felt... But there was nothing we or he could do... He had no choice but to go forward... even if it meant he lost all feelings, lost everything that was human! For all humankind's sake... There was no going back... Even looking back held too many memories... And he would have... just wanted to go back... Even though he couldn't... So please forgive him... Krelian loved people more than anyone else...{{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plane of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite with the rest of the party.&lt;ref&gt;'''Krelian''': Since that time, I have stopped being human. I have committed so many sins that any attempt at living as a human is impossible. The only one who could have forgiven me is god. {{cite video game|title=Xenogears |developer=Square Company, Ltd. |publisher=Square Electronic Arts |date=1998-08-21 |platform=PlayStation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xenogears'' was produced by [[Hiromichi Tanaka]], who previously worked on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game ''[[Secret of Mana]]''. The scenario of the game was written by director [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] and by [[Soraya Saga|Kaori Tanaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Xenogears |developer=[[Square (company)|Square]] |publisher=Square |date=1998-02-11 |language=Japanese |scene=staff credits}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soraya" /&gt; [[Yasuyuki Honne]] served as art director,&lt;ref name="firstlook"/&gt; while [[Kunihiko Tanaka]] was responsible for the character designs.&lt;ref name="credits"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Square Enix |title=Xenosaga Instruction Booklet |year=1998 |publisher=Square Enix |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tetsuo Mizuno, [[Tomoyuki Takechi]], and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] were executive producers for ''Xenogears''.&lt;ref name="credits"/&gt; [[Koichi Mashimo]], an animation director and his studio [[Bee Train]], was in charge of the anime cut scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=[[Square Enix]]| title=Xenogears Anime| url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/anime.html| accessdate=2008-08-17| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930234300/http://na.square-enix.com/games/xenogears/anime.html| archivedate=2008-09-30| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Xenogears'' started out as an early concept conceived by Tetsuya Takahashi and Kaori Tanaka for the Square game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.&lt;ref name="soraya"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/06/11/soraya-saga-on-xenogears-and-xenosaga/ |title=Soraya Saga On Xenogears And Xenosaga |author=Yip, Spencer |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2011-05-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222161735/http://www.siliconera.com/2010/06/11/soraya-saga-on-xenogears-and-xenosaga/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their superior in the company deemed it "too dark and complicated for a fantasy", but Takahashi was allowed to develop it as a separate project.&lt;ref name="soraya" /&gt; The project began under the working title "Project Noah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playonline.com/archives/psgame/Xenogears/staff.html|title=Xenogears - Inside Staff|language=Japanese|publisher=Xenogears Japanese website|date=2002|accessdate=2015-12-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011113231926/http://www.playonline.com/archives/psgame/Xenogears/staff.html |archivedate=2001-11-13|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main impetus for Takahashi was that he was growing frustrated with the ''Final Fantasy'' series.&lt;ref name="CreatorInterview"/&gt; The initial concept was to make ''Xenogears'' a sequel to ''Chrono Trigger'', but after multiple clashes with the company over this and unspecified practical difficulties, it was decided to make it a completely original title. Due to this initial development idea, there were concepts unsuited for a fantasy world, so a compromise was made by incorporating both fantasy and science fiction into the game's world.&lt;ref name="CreatorInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstation.jp/psstyle/talk/02/01.html|title=Creator's Talk - Tetsuya Takahashi|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Sony]]|date=2002|accessdate=2015-12-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205173819/http://www.playstation.jp/psstyle/talk/02/01.html |archivedate=2005-02-05|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development took approximately two years, and included a staff of thirty developers. Preliminary planning and creation of the backstory extended to several years before that.&lt;ref name="CreatorInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XenoPerfect2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Xenogears Perfect Works |publisher=Digital Cube |isbn=4-9250-7532-2|language=Japanese |pages=288–294|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Xeno" had been decided between staff from an early stage, with its meaning being "something strange or alien". "Gears" was chosen from multiple suggested words. The game's Gears were not present during early stages, with their places being filled by traditional summoned monsters. The game's use of anime cutscenes was chosen as it was difficult to properly recreate Tanaka's Gear artwork into 3D CGI. The game's engine was also designed to be best suited for the 3D map displays and battle arenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=|script-title=ja:『ゼノギアス』を作った男たち - Interview with Xenogears Staff|trans-title=The Men who made "Xenogears" - Interview with Xenogears Staff|journal=[[Famitsu|Famitsu PS]]|issue=1998-02-20|pages=109–111|publisher=[[Enterbrain]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takahashi had wanted to create the game in full 3D, but the PlayStation's capacities meant this could not be managed, resulting in the current mesh of 2D sprites against 3D backgrounds.&lt;ref name="CreatorInterview"/&gt; The themes and story were greatly influenced by the works and philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. According to Tanaka, the reason for this correlation was simply due to a common interest with her husband. According to her, the story revolved around "where do we come from, what are we, where are we going". There was a large portion of story and artwork that did not make it into the final game.&lt;ref name="soraya" /&gt; The game's second disc consisted mainly of narration by Fei and Elly of events following the party's escape from Solaris. While it was popularly assumed to be due to budget constraints, Takahashi later revealed the full reason; as his team was inexperienced they were unable to create the entire proposed game in the expected two-year development time, so instead of ending prematurely with the end of the first disc, Takahashi offered up a compromise which became the second disc's content, allowing the staff to finish the game within time and budget deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-real-story-behind-xenogears-unfinished-disc-2-1796151112|title=The Real Story Behind Xenogears' 'Unfinished' Disc 2|last=Schreler|first=Jason|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=2017-06-15|accessdate=2017-06-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616051709/http://kotaku.com/the-real-story-behind-xenogears-unfinished-disc-2-1796151112|archivedate=2017-06-16|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Square had announced that ''Xenogears'' may not have come out in the United States due to "sensitive religious issues".&lt;ref name="nextgen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web| first=Francesca| last=Reyes| date=1997-09-06| title=TGS: No Xenogears for US| url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/1997/09/06/tgs-no-xenogears-for-us| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2015-10-02| deadurl=no| archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151003060926/http://ca.ign.com/articles/1997/09/06/tgs-no-xenogears-for-us| archivedate=2015-10-03| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English translation of ''Xenogears'' was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It also was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Cidolfas | date=2004-05-30 | title=Interview with Richard Honeywood | url=http://www.ffcompendium.com/low/interview.shtml | publisher=FFCompendium | accessdate=2008-09-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602083814/http://www.ffcompendium.com/low/interview.shtml | archivedate=2015-06-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of "killing God", which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood unintentionally had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally going to call it [[Yahweh]], and during his argument against it he said "yabeh-o", a Japanese phrase meaning something dangerous. Seeing it as a good pun, the staff used Yabeh as the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5794922/how-one-man-stopped-square-enix-from-letting-gamers-kill-yahweh|title=How One Man Stopped Square-Enix From Letting Gamers Kill Yahweh|author=Cohen, Drew|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=2011-04-22|accessdate=2015-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222075924/http://kotaku.com/5794922/how-one-man-stopped-square-enix-from-letting-gamers-kill-yahweh|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score contains 41 instrumental tracks, in addition to a [[choir|choral]] track and two songs. According to Mitsuda, the music of ''Xenogears'' belongs to the [[traditional music]] genre.&lt;ref name="linernotes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Xenogears Original Soundtrack |others=[[Yasunori Mitsuda]] |year=1998 |type=booklet, Japanese |publisher=[[DigiCube]] |id=SSCX-10013 |location=[[Tokyo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he first described it as stemming from "a world of [his] own imagining" rather than any specific country,&lt;ref name="linernotes" /&gt; he has also claimed a strong [[Music of Ireland|Irish]] or [[Celtic music]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=352&amp;page=3 |title=Play!

An arranged soundtrack of ''Xenogears'' also composed and arranged by Mitsuda was released as ''[[Creid]]''.

''Xenogears'' was a commercial success in both Japan and North America.&lt;ref name="xgtwoquestion"/&gt; It sold over 890,000 copies in Japan by the end of 1998.&lt;ref name="EBsales"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Famitsū Gēmu Hakusho 1999 |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=1999 |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |script-title=ja:ファミ通ゲーム白書1999 |trans-title=Famitsu Game Whitebook 1999 |chapter=1998年ゲームソフト年間売上TOP100 |trans-chapter=1998 Game Software Annual Sales Top 100 |url=http://geimin.net/da/db/1998_ne_fa/index.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807132243/http://geimin.net/da/db/1998_ne_fa/index.php |archivedate=2015-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 31, 2003, the game had shipped 1.19 million copies worldwide, with 910,000 of those copies being shipped in Japan and 280,000 abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.square-enix.com/jp/ir/e/explanatory/download/0404-200402090000-01.pdf#page=27 |title=Titles of game software with worldwide shipments exceeding 1 million copies |date=2004-02-09 |accessdate=2008-03-01 |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |page=27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213144948/http://www.square-enix.com/jp/ir/e/explanatory/download/0404-200402090000-01.pdf#page=27 |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these sales, it was re-released as a [[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]] title in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2003/2114.html|title=Square Enix Sends Many PSOne Titles to Greatest Hits Factory|publisher=RPGFan|first=John|last=McCarroll|date=2003-11-04|accessdate=2008-08-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524035407/http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2003/2114.html|archivedate=2011-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''Xenogears'' was voted the 16th best video game of all time by its readers in a poll held in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edge Staff |date=2006-03-03 |title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/japan-votes-all-time-top-100 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723051728/http://www.edge-online.com/features/japan-votes-all-time-top-100 |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar poll at [[GameFAQs]], users of the website voted ''Xenogears'' the 32nd "Best Game Ever" in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall 2005: 10-Year Anniversary Contest - The 10 Best Games Ever |publisher=[[GameFAQs]] |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/top10 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716111618/http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/top10 |archivedate=2015-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was placed in the same position in [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Games - Readers Choice" feature in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2006/031-040.html|title=Readers' Picks Top 100 Games: 31-40|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-08-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QsHmHICY?url=http://top100.ign.com/2006/031-040.html|archivedate=2014-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as number 28 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top100.ign.com/2008/ign_top_game_28.html|title=IGN Top 100 Games 2008|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124165930/http://top100.ign.com/2008/ign_top_game_28.html|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''Xenogears'' was met with critical acclaim. ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' praised the story, characters, gameplay, graphics, and soundtrack.&lt;ref name="egm"/&gt; IGN described it as the "hands-down best RPG" of the year, praising the storyline, gameplay, graphics, presentation, and soundtrack.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] described it as one of Squaresoft's best role-playing games, praising the story, gameplay, and audio, but criticized the lack of graphical polish.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; [[Allgame]] pointed out in a positive light that the character battles are "unlike most role-playing games from this company".&lt;ref name="allgame"&gt;{{cite web| first=Matthew| last=House| title=Xenogears| url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14104| publisher=[[Allgame]]| accessdate=2008-08-07| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212135754/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14104| archivedate=2010-02-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively, ''Edge'' commented that although it is "considered by some to be a multimillion-yen, convoluted science-fiction vanity project, ''Xenogears'' nevertheless remains one of the most keenly eulogized PlayStation RPGs."&lt;ref name="timeextend"/&gt; The magazine also noted that it was Takahashi's "most challenging and pure work" and that the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' series never quite matched up to ''Xenogears''.&lt;ref name="timeextend"/&gt;

The game's story and characters were well received. ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' said it is "rich in story and character development."&lt;ref name="egm"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' and ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' agreed that the plot was one of the game's highlights, the former drawing comparisons to ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Blazers]]'', the [[Old Testament]], and many other Square games, making it "a game every RPG fanatic must play."&lt;ref name="nextgen"&gt;{{cite web | author=Next Generation staff | date=1998-10-20 | title=Rumored to never see the light of US day... | url=http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/reviews/2230.html |work=[[Next Generation Magazine]]| accessdate=2010-04-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508192304/http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/reviews/2230.html |archivedate=1999-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gameinformer"&gt;{{cite web | author=Game Informer staff | date=November 1998 | title=On the 7th Day, They Created Square | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/cgi-bin/review.cgi?sys=psx&amp;path=nov98&amp;doc=xenogear |work=[[Game Informer]]| accessdate=2010-04-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990912001402/http://www.gameinformer.com/cgi-bin/review.cgi?sys=psx&amp;path=nov98&amp;doc=xenogear |archivedate=1999-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN said the storyline is intricate, engrossing, "deep, complex, and once in a while even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered."&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; GameSpot said the story is "excellent" and "thought-provoking" but said it can be "a little preachy at times", but went on to say that the religious and existential themes "enhance the story and [our] understanding of the game's deep characterizations".&lt;ref name="GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Bartholow |date=1998-04-02 |title=Xenogears Review |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/xenogears/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;review |accessdate=2008-08-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613013310/http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/xenogears/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Breview |archivedate=2007-06-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Game Revolution]] described the storyline as "epic" and "fabulous" with "many twists and turns" and a large cast of characters.&lt;ref name="gamerev"/&gt; RPGFan said "the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG", giving it a 99% rating for the story.&lt;ref name=rpgfan/&gt; Retrospectively, ''Edge'' praised the plot's scope and ambition and the protagonist as the "most complicated Freudian hero" in video games, but said it has a "flawed" script and "muddied" translation, as well as too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases.&lt;ref name="timeextend"&gt;{{cite web | author=Edge Staff | date=2007-10-10 | title=Time Extend: Xenogears | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/time-extend-xenogears |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| accessdate=2008-08-24 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003023044/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/time-extend-xenogears | archivedate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years after the game's release, Jeremy Parish of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' called the game's plot "one of the wackiest game plotlines ever", but said that it "actually makes sense" if the player ignores all of the sideplots.&lt;ref name="parish"/&gt; IGN, however, stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot, "immersion is a key factor in ''Xenogears'' and the questions you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game."&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; Following the PSN release, RPGFan's James Quentin Clark said ''Xenogears'' has "hands down the best single story I have seen in any video game," giving it a 100% rating for the story.&lt;ref name=rpgfanpsn/&gt;

Reviewers largely praised ''Xenogears''' gameplay. ''Next Generation'' praised Square's [[Active Time Battle]] gauge and said that inclusion of the AP meter and combo attacks "is not only refreshing in a turn-based RPG, but gives players a higher level of interaction during battle."&lt;ref name="nextgen"/&gt; IGN claimed that "the most impressive feature in combat is the ability to use massive "Gears" or mechs", noting that Square's attention to programming these battles is made evident by how "visually satisfying" they are.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; IGN praised the game's exploration, saying that the ability to jump and climb "adds even more depth to exploration of different environments and distances Xenogears from being too straightforward of a traditional RPG", the only complaint being that the rotating camera is sometimes "clumsy".&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

The soundtrack was well received. ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' said the game sounds as "beautiful" as it looks.&lt;ref name=egm/&gt; GameSpot said it "expertly uses audio to push the story along" and noted that many of the games' tracks "include voice or chanting and all are appropriately uppity or low with the game's mood", but said there were many areas with silence or ambience making the "game's soundtrack a tad sparse."&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; ''Xenogears'' was the first Square game to feature voice overs and anime cut scenes.&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' said they are "some of the slickest animation cinemas" they have seen.&lt;ref name="egm"/&gt; Game Revolution praised the "absolutely spectacular and stunning" hand-drawn anime cut-scenes, but stated that they were sparse and poorly synched with the voice acting.&lt;ref name="gamerev"/&gt;

===Legacy===
Shortly after ''Xenogears'' was released, there was speculation of a sequel being released, although this never occurred.&lt;ref name="xgtwoquestion"&gt;{{cite web|date=1999-06-25 |title=Square Developing Xenogears 2? |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |author=GameSpot Staff |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-developing-xenogears-2/1100-2451155/ |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111224434/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-developing-xenogears-2/1100-2451155/ |archivedate=January 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Tanaka said that a project related to ''Xenogears'' was being developed. He also revealed that a sequel to ''Xenogears'' was initially planned, but never came to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/1999/668.html|title=A New Xenogears Game?|publisher=RPGFan|date=1999-10-22|accessdate=2015-12-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905231859/http://www.rpgfan.com/news/1999/668.html |archivedate=2015-09-05|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Xenogears'' has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was wide speculation that [[Namco]] and [[Monolith Soft]]'s ''[[Xenosaga]]'' was a prequel when it was first announced. [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] was the director and writer for both ''Xenogears'' and ''Xenosaga'' and has noted that "with our relation between Square, I think it is difficult for us to say it is a direct sequel or prequel". Approximately twenty members of the ''Xenosaga'' development staff had previously worked on ''Xenogears''.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sato|first=Ike|title=Xenosaga Interview |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenosaga-interview/1100-2823598/ |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2001-11-08|accessdate=2008-08-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205032858/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenosaga-interview/1100-2823598/ |archivedate=2015-12-05|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the connection between ''Xenogears'' and ''Xenosaga'', Takahashi has stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;It's probably more suitable to say that it follows the direction and style of ''Xenogears''. [...] Now that we are under a different company, we figured we should start everything from scratch all over again. Though there are familiar faces that serve as important characters in ''Xenosaga'', others are more like self-parodies, so we don't really want ''Xenogears'' fans to overreact. Like movies, sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos, so it's similar to that.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several members of the ''Xenogears'' staff came together in 2008 to work on ''[[Sands of Destruction]]'', a [[role-playing game]] published by [[Sega]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. These staff members include Masato Kato, Kunihiko Tanaka, and Yasunori Mitsuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jean |last=Snow |title=Sega Reunites Xenogears Staff For DS Game |work=[[Wired News]] |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/04/rpg-world-of-de/ |date=2008-04-28 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908090429/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/04/rpg-world-of-de/ |archivedate=2010-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, gears from the game, along with avatars of Fei and Bart, were included as pre-order cosmetic bonuses in Square Enix's mecha shooting game, ''Figureheads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sato|title=Square Enix’s PC Mecha Shooter Figureheads Headed To PS4 With A Xenogears Bonus Set|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/02/07/square-enixs-pc-mecha-shooter-figureheads-headed-ps4-xenogears-bonus-set/|website=Siliconera|accessdate=8 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207141416/http://www.siliconera.com/2017/02/07/square-enixs-pc-mecha-shooter-figureheads-headed-ps4-xenogears-bonus-set/|archivedate=7 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
