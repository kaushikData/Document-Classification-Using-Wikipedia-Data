'''{{mp|2015 HM|10}}''' is an irregular shaped [[asteroid]] and sub-kilometer [[near-Earth object]] that passed near the Earth on 7 July 2015, at a distance of 442,000 kilometers or 1.15 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].

First observed on 19 April 2015, by astronomers of [[The Dark Energy Survey]] at [[Cerro Tololo Observatory]] in Chile, the asteroid measures approximately 60 meters in diameter and is classified as a member of the [[Apollo asteroids|Apollo]] and [[Amor asteroids|Amor]] group, respectively. It is a [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]] with a [[rotation period]] of 22.6 minutes.

== Discovery ==

It was first observed on 19 April 2015, by astronomers of [[The Dark Energy Survey]], using the [[Dark Energy Camera]] (DECam, {{small|[[IAU code#W84|W84]]}}) mounted on the [[Victor M. Blanco Telescope]] located at [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory]] in Chile.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phys-Org" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2015 HM|10}} has been classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo]] and [[Amor asteroids|Amor]] group, respectively.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–4.0&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4.01 years (1,465 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.60 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 1[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins with a [[precovery]] taken at Cerro Tololo, the night prior to its official first observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close encounters ===

{{mp|2015 HM|10}} has an Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] of {{convert |0.0022 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}} which corresponds to 0.9 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; On 7 July 2015, it passed Earth at {{convert |0.00295299 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}}, or 1.15 lunar distances. On the following day, it passed the Moon at {{convert |0.00276|AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; This was the asteroid’s closest approach to Earth until at least 2419.&lt;ref name="Busch-2015" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

{{mp|2015 HM|10}} is an assumed stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Rotation and shape ===

During 2015, two rotational [[lightcurve]]s of {{mp|2015 HM|10}} were obtained from [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations by [[Brian D. Warner|Brian Warner]] at the Palmer Divide Station ({{small|[[IAU code#U82|U82]]}}) in California and by astronomers of the Mission Accessible Near-Earth Objects Survey (MANOS). Lightcurve analysis gave a [[rotation period]] of 0.3761 and 0.3763 hours (22.6 minutes) with a brightness amplitude of 1.50 and 1.29 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3/3-]]}}), indicative of a non-spheroidal shape.&lt;ref name="Warner-2016a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thirouin-2016" /&gt; It is among the [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fastest rotator]]s known to exists.

In July 2015, high-resolution images of {{mp|2015 HM|10}} were obtained from [[Radiometry|radiometric]] observations made with the [[Very Long Baseline Array]], the [[Arecibo Observatory]], and the 34 and 70-meter antennas at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]].&lt;ref name="Busch-2015" /&gt; These observations confirmed the body's short rotation period and complex and irregular, and revealed, that it has a long-axis extent of 80–100 meters with an equatorial aspect ratio of about 2:1.&lt;ref name="Busch-2015" /&gt; Any significant non-principal axis rotation, commonly known as "tumbling" could be ruled out. The radar images also showed angular features up to approximately 30 meters across, with a cluster of radar-bright pixels following its rotation, and consistent with a high standing, 15 to 20 meters wide feature.&lt;ref name="Busch-2015" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a mean-diameter of 57.0 meters based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 23.6.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; At its widest point, the object is 80 meters long.&lt;ref name="Phys-Org" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

As of 2017, this [[minor planet]] has neither been numbered nor named.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''Charles Joseph Lambert''' / '''Carlos José Lambert''' (1826 - 1888) was a [[Chile|Chilean]]-born mining entrepreneur and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gaceta de los tribunales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGQvAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA87| year=1865|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Family provenance and early years===
Carlos José Lambert is believed to have been born in or near [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]].   However, surviving records of his birth and baptism have not been identified.  (In the 1820s members of the European expatriate community frequently attended to baptismal formalities not in [[Roman Catholic]] churches onshore, but on British ships moored offshore.)

His father {{ill|Charles Saint Lambert|es|Carlos Lambert}} (1793-1876), was a prominent, and increasingly prosperous, mining entrepreneur who had been born in [[Strasbourg]] and emigrated to [[Chile]] in 1817.&lt;ref name=Lamberts&amp;BathsperMJ&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.henrybath.com/assets/_files/documents/jun_11/HENRYBATH__1308588481_Complete_Henry_Bath_History.pdf| date=October 2010| author=Mike Jackson| title=Henry Bath &amp; Son - A Company and family History| accessdate=1 November 2016}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   He established contacts in England, acquired British nationality and returned to Chile in 1823 as a representative of a British company called the "Chilean Mining Association", which later went bankrupt.&lt;ref name=JM&amp;SConCLambert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistahistoria.uc.cl/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mayo-collier-couyoumdjian-32.pdf|author1=John Mayo and Simon Collier (authors)|author2=Juan Ricardo Couyoumdjian (translator into Spanish - currently the only version of the text location online)|title=Mining in Chile's Norte Chico.

|date=1998|publisher=Publication of the Instituto de Historia, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The career of Charles Saint Lambert (the father) continued to prosper, however.  Little is known of his mother, who is frequently described as "English", although at least one source indicates that she was born further north, in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=MomselonGeni&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/n-n-Spears/6000000030736249152|title=n.n. Spears|publisher=Geni.com|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Charles Joseph Lambert spent much of his childhood in Britain.   Around 1840 his father relocated the family base to [[Swansea]] which was becoming the principal smelting centre for industrial scale copper (and other) ores from [[Chile]], following the exhaustion of principal mines closer to hand in Cornwall.&lt;ref name=Lamberts&amp;BathsperMJ/&gt;   In Swansea he was involved in regular commercial negotiations with Edward Bath, scion of a major industrial family in the area (and subsequently his brother-in-law twice over).&lt;ref name=Lamberts&amp;BathsperMJ/&gt;   In practice, he appears to have divided his time between Chile and South Wales throughout his working life.

===Activities in Chile===
As a mining engineer he exploited new  copper-smelting technology employing "coal-using reverbatory furnaces"&lt;ref name="Minchinton2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=W.E Minchinton|title=Industrial South Wales 1750-1914: Essays in Welsh Economic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXD_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141|date=5 November 2013| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-136-61779-9|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; which his father had introduced to Chile in 1848,&lt;ref name=CLperJM&amp;SC&gt;{{cite book|title=Mining in Chile's Norte Chico: Journal of Charles Lambert, 1825-1830 (Dellplain Latin American Studies)| author1=John Mayo |author2=Simon Collier |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mining-Chiles-Norte-Chico-1825-1830/dp/0813335841| publisher=Westview Press Inc|isbn=978-0-813-33584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which at this stage gave an important competitive advantage.   He was also active as a farmer, with an extensive property in the valley of the [[Rapel River]], centred on a Welsh style farmhouse.   This farm also included silver deposits which he exploited.

He actively promoted the construction of the railway connecting [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] with the port of [[Coquimbo]], taking a significant shareholding in the project, which also linked up two of the family's smelting locations.   He promoted the exploitation of sheep imported from [[England]] and [[Australia]], as well as raising sheep himself.   In La Serena has also backed the drainage project, proposing the construction of a canal to divert water from the [[Elqui River]] to an outlet near the port which would drain the coastal area of the Bay of Coquimbo.

At the start of the [[War of the Pacific|Pacific War]] in 1879 he is identified as the originator of fortifications along the Bay of Coquimbo.&lt;ref name=FLsegunHab&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuerte Coquimbo|url=http://fuertecoquimbo.jimdo.com/antecedentes/|publisher= Jaime Patricio Espejo Rojas|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This involved (at least) three gun emplacements covering the bay.   There were good strategic reasons to protect the port in order to avoid the interruption of the transport of ores from the Lambert mines to the industrial processing plants in [[Swansea]] and to prevent an attack on the domestic smelting works at "La Compañía", a couple of kilometers inland from the bay.   It was thought likely that Peruvian forces would attempt to paralyse the mining industry in the region which was seen as vital to sustaining the economy in wartime.

===Philanthropy===
Lambert was an active philanthropist, funding the construction and operation of hospitals in [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] and [[Vicuña, Chile|Vicuña]].   He funded the health commission to combat cholera and smallpox.   At Christmas he was in the habit of appearing on the city streets accompanied by his family loaded with parcels for distribution to the poor families of La Serena.

===Round the world in 713 days===
On 5 May 1880, embarking from [[Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] ([[England]]), Charles Joseph Lambert set sail aboard the company yacht for a round the world trip, accompanied by his wife, their four youngest children, a governess, a nurse, a maid, a valet, a footman, a minister of the church and an artist called Robert Prichett.   Their boat, "The Wanderer", was coal powered, also capable of sail propulsion when the wind blew appropriately.   Lambert kept a detailed record of the adventure in which he recorded that 1265&lt;small&gt;½&lt;/small&gt; [[Long ton|(British) tons]] were consumed by the voyage.&lt;ref name=Wandererjournals&gt;{{cite web| url=https://archive.org/stream/voyagewandererf00unkngoog#page/n26/mode/1up|title="The voyage of the "Wanderer," from the journals and letters of C. and S. Lambert" |author=Gerald Young (compiler)|publisher=Macmillan, London|date=1883|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The ship was operated by 8 officers and 35 crewmen (not necessarily all at once) and the staff also included 7 ships' stewards.&lt;ref name=Wandererjournals/&gt;   It may have been this voyage that inspired William Stanley Lambert, the couple's youngest son, who celebrated his eleventh and twelfth birthdays during the voyage, regarding his subsequent decision to join the [[Royal Navy|British navy]], which he did in 1885.&lt;ref name="Demaus2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ed. A. B. Demaus|title=Letters from HMS Britannia: William Lambert &amp; The Late Vic| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L26oAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|date=30 November 2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |isbn=978-1-4456-1256-0|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the voyage the family were able to visit [[Hawaii]] to pay their respects to their dead son Carlos who had drowned there on 20 November 1870 while serving in the navy. The family had already erected a memorial to their dead son back home at "La Compañía" outside [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]], and now they were able to erect another "cenotaph" with a cross near the site of his death.

===Death===
Charles Joseph Lambert himself died on 11 July 1888.   He suffered "an epidemic of ‘choleric diarrhoea’" and booked a passage on a steamship to [[Liverpool]] where he spent his final months staying in an hotel beside the [[Royal Yacht Club]].&lt;ref name=Lamberts&amp;BathsperMJ/&gt;   The actual death took place not in Liverpool, however, but at [[Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=n1duTmYW6cgg8wNLsFpGzg&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=1 November 2016|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:India Coromandel Coast locator map.svg|thumb|350px|Districts along the Coromandel Coast]]
[[File:Coromandel Coast 1753.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of the coast {{fr icon}}]]
The '''Coromandel Coast''' is the southeastern coast region of the [[Indian subcontinent]], bounded by the [[Utkal Plains]] to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, the [[Kaveri]] delta to the south, and the [[Eastern Ghats]] to the west, extending over an area of about 22,800 square kilometres.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Coromandel-Coast Encyclopædia Britannica entry on Coromandel Coast]&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition can also include the northwestern coast of the island of [[Sri Lanka]].{{cn|date=November 2017}} The coast has an average elevation of 80 metres and is backed by the [[Eastern Ghats]], a chain of low, flat-topped hills.

==Etymology==
Coromondel is the Dutch pronunciation of "Karimanal", a village in the Sriharikota island in the north of Pazhavercadu (Pulecat Lake).&lt;ref&gt;Topographic Map of India "66C/7 &amp; 66C/11" by Survey of India&lt;/ref&gt; Pazhavercadu (Pulecat) was an early Dutch settlement along with Masoolipatnam in present-day Andhra Pradesh. There is a Dutch Cemetery belonging to the seventeenth Century at Pulecat. It is said that the first Dutch ship stopped here for fresh drinking water, and upon asking the name of the place Karimanal was spelled as Corimondal (K replaced with C and d inserted).&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mag/2003/10/19/stories/2003101900280700.htm"&lt;/ref&gt;

The land of the [[Chola dynasty]] was called ''Cholamandalam'' (சோழ மண்டலம்) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], literally translated as ''The realm of the Cholas'', from which the Portuguese derived the name ''Coromandel''.&lt;ref name="TheLandoftheTamuliansandItsMissions"&gt;''The Land of the Tamulians and Its Missions'', by Eduard Raimund Baierlein, James Dunning Baker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="South Indian Coins - Page 61"&gt;South Indian Coins – Page 61 by T. Desikachari – Coins, Indic – 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian History - Page 112"&gt;Indian History – Page 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annals of Oriental Research - Page 1"&gt;''Annals of Oriental Research'' – Page 1 by University of Madras – 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Periplus of the Erythræan Sea"&gt;''The Periplus of the Erythræan Sea'' by [[Wilfred Harvey Schoff]]&lt;/ref&gt; The name could also be derived from ''Kurumandalam'', meaning ''The realm of the Kurus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edgar Thurston|title=The Madras Presidency with Mysore, Coorg and the Associated States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4VLY1KcltcC&amp;pg=PA11|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-60068-3|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
===Economy===
Agriculture is the mainstay of the coastal economy. Rice, pulses (legumes), sugarcane, cotton, and peanuts (groundnuts) are grown. Bananas and betel nuts are grown together with rice in the low-rainfall region of the interior. There are casuarina and coconut plantations along the coast.

Large-scale industries produce fertilizers, chemicals, film projectors, amplifiers, trucks, and automobiles. There is a [[Heavy Vehicles Factory|heavy vehicle and armoured car factory]] at Avadi and a [[Madras Atomic Power Station|nuclear power station]] at Kalpakkam.

Roads and railways linking Chennai, Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Chengalpattu, and Puducherry run parallel to the coast.

===Geography===
The coast is generally low, and punctuated by the deltas of several large rivers, including the [[Kaveri]], [[Palar River|Palar]], [[Penner River|Penner]], and [[Krishna River]], which rise in the highlands of the [[Western Ghats]] and flow across the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] Plateau to drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[alluvial plains]] created by these rivers are fertile and favour agriculture. The rivers remain dry during most of the year. There is little forest cover, but marshes, swamps, scrub woodlands, and thorny thickets are common.

The coastline forms a part of [[Coastline of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu]] and [[Coastline of Andhra Pradesh|Andhra Pradesh]]. The important ports include [[Chennai]], [[Thoothukkudi]], [[Nellore]], [[Ennore]] and [[Nagapattinam]], which take advantage of their close proximity with regions rich in natural and mineral resources and good transport infrastructure.

===Climate===
The Coromandel Coast falls in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Western Ghats]] mountain range, and receives a good deal less rainfall during the summer [[southwest monsoon]]s, which contributes heavy rainfall in the rest of India. The region averages 800&amp;nbsp;mm/year, most of which falls between October and December. The topography of the Bay of Bengal, and the staggered weather pattern prevalent during the season favours [[northeast monsoon]]s, which have a tendency to cause [[cyclone]]s and [[hurricane]]s rather than a steady precipitation. As a result, the coast is hit by inclement weather almost every year between October and January.

The high variability of rainfall patterns is also responsible for water scarcity and famine in most areas not served by the great rivers. For example, the city of Chennai is one of the driest cities in the country in terms of potable water availability, despite high percentage of moisture in the air, due to the unpredictable, seasonal nature of the monsoon.

===Flora===
The Coromandel Coast is home to the [[East Deccan dry evergreen forests]] [[ecoregion]], which runs in a narrow strip along the coast. Unlike most of the other [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]] [[Biome]] regions of India, where the trees lose their leaves during the dry season, the East Deccan dry evergreen forests retain their leathery leaves year round.

The Coromandel Coast is also home to extensive [[mangrove]] forests along the low-lying coast and [[river delta]]s, and several important [[wetland]]s, notably [[Kaliveli Lake]] and [[Pulicat Lake]], that provide habitat to thousands of migrating and resident birds.

==History==
[[File:Sarasa chintz.jpg|thumb|upright|Sarasa [[chintz]] from the Coromandel Coast, 17th or 18th century, made for the Japanese market. Private collection, [[Nara Prefecture]]. ]]
By late 1530 the Coromandel Coast was home to three Portuguese settlements at [[Nagapattinam]], [[Dioceses of Saint Thomas of Mylapore|São Tomé de Meliapore]], and Pulicat. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Coromandel Coast was the scene of rivalries among European powers for control of the India trade. The British established themselves at [[Fort St George]] (Madras) and [[Masulipatnam]], the [[Dutch Coromandel|Dutch]] at Pulicat, [[Sadras]] and [[Covelong]], the French at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], [[Karaikal]] and [[Nizampatnam]], the [[Denmark|Danish]] in [[Tharangambadi|Dansborg]] at Tharangambadi.

The Coromandel Coast supplied [[Indian Muslim]] [[eunuch]]s to the Thai palace and court of [[History of Thailand|Siam]] (modern Thailand).&lt;ref&gt;Peletz (2009), p. 73 {{Google books|BFXpi5ZKKF8C|Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peletz (2009), p. 73 {{Google books|-YnQJXxspJUC|Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thai at times asked eunuchs from China to visit the court in Thailand and advise them on court ritual since they held them in high regard.&lt;ref&gt;Peletz (2009), p. 75 {{Google books|BFXpi5ZKKF8C|Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peletz (2009), p. 75 {{Google books|-YnQJXxspJUC|Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the British won out, although France retained the tiny enclaves of [[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]] and [[Karaikal district|Karaikal]] until 1954. [[China|Chinese]] [[Lacquerware|lacquer goods]], including boxes, screens, and chests, became known as "Coromandel" goods in the 18th century, because many Chinese exports were consolidated at the Coromandel ports.

Two of the famous books on the economic history of the Coromandel Coast are ''Merchants, companies, and commerce on the Coromandel Coast, 1650–1740'' (Arasaratnam,  Oxford University Press, 1986) and ''The World of the Weaver in Northern Coromandel, c.1750-c.1850'' (P. Swarnalatha, Orient Longman, 2005).

On 26 December 2004, one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history, the [[Indian Ocean earthquake]], struck off the western coast of [[Sumatra]] (Indonesia). The [[earthquake]] and subsequent tsunami reportedly killed over 220,000 people around the rim of the [[Indian Ocean]]. The tsunami devastated the Coromandel Coast, killing many and sweeping away many coastal communities.

==Applications of the name==
Four ships of the [[Royal Navy]] have borne the name {{HMS|Coromandel}} after the Indian coast. The [[Coromandel Peninsula]] in New Zealand was named after one of these ships, and the town of [[Coromandel, New Zealand]] was named after the peninsula. [[Coromandel Valley, South Australia]], and its neighbouring suburb, Coromandel East, gain their name from the ship ''[[Coromandel (1834 ship)|Coromandel]]'', which arrived in Holdfast Bay from London in 1837 with 156 English settlers. After the ship reached the shore, some of its sailors deserted, intending to remain behind in South Australia, and took refuge in the hills in the Coromandel Valley region.

A red [[nail varnish]] made by [[Chanel]] is named coromandel due to its suggestions of exoticism.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} One of the earliest superfast trains of Indian Railways that runs between Howrah and Chennai is named [[Coromandel Express]].

In [[Slovenian language|Slovene]] the [[idiom]] ''Indija Koromandija'' (India Coromandel) means a land of plenty,&lt;ref&gt;Slovar slovenskega knjižnega jezika [http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/a03.exe?name=sskj_testa&amp;expression=indija+koromandija&amp;hs=1 "Indija Koromandija"]&lt;/ref&gt; a promised land, a utopia where "Houses are bleached with cheese and covered with cake".&lt;ref&gt;[http://razvezanijezik.org/?page=indija+koromandija "Razvezani jezik" From: [http://razvezanijezik.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
The 1955 historical novel ''Coromandel!'' by [[John Masters]] describes a young English adventurer arriving in the 17th century at the Coromandel Coast. He is the founder of the Savage family, whose descendants live during British rule in India and appear in other books of Masters' series.

There is a well-known poem by the Indian poet and freedom fighter [[Sarojini Naidu]] titled 'Coromandel Fishers'. The little-known early 20th-century poet [[Walter J. Turner]] wrote a poem titled 'Coromandel'.

"The Courtship of the Yonghy-bonghy-bo" by [[Edward Lear]] is set on the Coast of Coromandel.

Coromandel wood is referred to by [[Dame Edith Sitwell]] in her poem "Black Mrs. Behemoth", part of "Façade".  She likens the wood's grain to the rolling, curling smoke of a blown out candle.  Sir Osbert Sitwell (Dame Edith's brother) composed a poem titled "On the coast of Coromandel".

''Coromandel Sea Change'' is a 1991 novel by [[Rumer Godden]] about a diverse group of guests staying at a hotel on the Coromandel coast during an election campaign.

The coast is noted in M.M. Kaye's novel ''The Far Pavilions''. A work of fiction, the lead character, Ashton Hilary Akbar Pelham-Martyn, retires to the Coromandel Coast early in the tale.

Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, several [[Reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] and [[dams]] were built in the area now covered by [[Dartmoor]] National Park in [[Devon]], England to supply [[drinking water]] to the rapidly growing towns in the surrounding [[lowland]]s. With its deep valleys and high rainfall, Dartmoor was an inevitable location. New reservoirs continued construction even after the establishment of the [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]] in 1951.

Early schemes to use the moors as a source of drinking water involved the construction of water channels called [[leat]]s. For example, [[Drake's Leat]] (completed 1591) took water to [[Plymouth]] and the [[Devonport Leat]] (1793) to the docks at [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]. Rapid population growth of the seaside communities in the late 19th century and the birth of tourism required a significant improvement in quality and quantity of fresh water.&lt;ref name=future&gt;{{cite web|title=What Future for Dartmoor’s Water Resources?|url=https://www.dartmoorsociety.com/files/debates/water.htm|publisher=The Dartmoor Society|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Dartmoor reservoir (Tottiford) opened in 1861 and heralded a busy era of dam construction which continued through to 1907, by which time the Dartmoor area was the site of five reservoirs. Three more were to follow during the course of the mid to late 20th century. A fourth, in the valley of the [[River Swincombe]] was rejected by the [[Dartmoor National Park Authority|advisory committee]] of the [[Devon County Council|County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A few long-established Dartmoor farms had to be abandoned and disappeared under the water as a result. During years of drought, some ruins can once again become visible. At Fernworthy, for example, low water levels often reveal the remains of Fernworthy Farm and a small [[granite]] [[Clapper bridge]] which once crossed the South [[River Teign|Teign]] River.  At Avon dam, [[hut circle]]s are visible at very low water levels. In 2011 [[Time Team (series 18)|an episode of ''Time Team'']] was devoted to archaeological features discovered in the bed of Tottiford Reservoir.

A '''Dreikanter''' is a type of [[ventifact]] that typically forms in [[desert]] or [[periglacial]] environments due to the abrasive action of [[Saltation (geology)|blowing sand]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade, A. 1910. On the formation of dreikanter in desert regions. The Geological Magazine, Decade V, 7(9):394-398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-efron|Трехгранники}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreikanters exhibit a characteristic [[pyramid]]al shape with three wind-abrased facets. The word ''Dreikanter'' is a [[German language|German word]] meaning "three-edged."&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.umn.edu/cawap/mpr/jargon.htm WeatherTalk - Jargon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019191704/http://climate.umn.edu/cawap/mpr/jargon.htm |date=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similarly, a zweikanter has  two wind facets, an einkanter, has only one wind facet. &lt;ref name=GreeleyBridges&gt;Greeley, R., N. T. Bridges, R. O. Kuzmin, and J. E. Laity, Terrestrial analogs to wind-related features at the Viking and Pathfinder landing sites on Mars, J. Geophys. Res., 107(E1), 10.1029/2000JE001481, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most places on the planet have several weathering processes acting at the same time, so finding good examples of Dreikanters is often difficult. Antarctica is a good location for finding such ventifacts since wind is usually the only active weathering agent. Many specimens in the Northeastern United States were formed during the Pleistocene era when the absence of vegetation made for little cover from wind-blown sediment.&lt;ref name=dutch1&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutch|first=Steven|title=Wind Erosion|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/EarthSC202Slides/windslid.htm|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common features==

Some common features of Dreikanters include [[Fluting_(geology)|fluting]], high polish, sharp ridges, pits, grooves, and helical forms.&lt;ref name=dutch1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GreeleyBridges /&gt;
[[image:Bradley_1930_dreikanter.jpg|right|thumb|300px| Unusually large dreikanter of granite, Sweetwater County, Wyoming. This dreikanter measures 71 cm by 46 cm deep and 37 cm wide. Photo by Bradley, W.H., USGS (1930).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey Photographic Library ( http://libraryphoto.cr.usgs.gov/ )&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Formation==

In areas where there is a prevailing wind, sand and debris cause a rock face to become flattened and polished. This changes the mass distribution of the rock, and may cause it to turn another surface toward the wind. If this process continues undisturbed, the resulting rock will have three distinct flattened and polished faces.&lt;ref name=britannica1&gt;{{cite web|title=Ventifact (stone)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/625506/ventifact?anchor=ref166111|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreikanters generally form in dry, arid environments from hard rocks.&lt;ref name=britannica1 /&gt;

In the field of [[electronics]], the '''EF50''' is an early all-glass wideband [[Cut-off (electronics)#Remote cutoff|remote cutoff]] [[pentode]] designed in 1938 by [[Philips]]. It was a landmark in the development of [[vacuum tube]] technology, departing from construction ideas of the time essentially unchanged from light bulb designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The EF50, the Tube that helped to Win the War|url=http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/EF50.html|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially used in television receivers, it quickly gained a vital role in British [[radar]] and great efforts were made to secure a continuing supply of the device as Holland fell in [[World War II]].

The EF50 tube is a [[Tube socket#Other Loctals|9-pin Loctal]]-socket device with short internal wires to nine short chromium-iron pins, making it suitable for [[Very high frequency|Very High Frequency]] (VHF) use.&lt;ref name="r-type1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Famous EF50 of WW2 by Keith Thrower|url=http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-021.htm|access-date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The EF50 was preceded by [[RCA]]'s [[acorn tube|acorn]] design and several other attempts, such as the "Stahlröhre" (~steel tube) from [[Telefunken]], to reduce inductance in the wire leads, all with some disadvantages.  Philips had been working since 1934–1935 on an alternative that would solve the problems of the other bases, and a design that could be produced cheaply and in large quantities. A presentation given by M.J.O. Strutt from the tube development group at Philips Research at the first "Internationale Fernseh-Tagung in Zürich" (international television conference in Zürich) described their work in September 1938. A few months later Professor J.L.H. Jonker, who had a leading role in the development of the EF50, published an internal Philips Research Technical Note, Titled: "New radio Tube Constructions". Jonker's role was confirmed decades later by Th. P. Tromp, head of radio-valve manufacturing and production: "Prof. Dr. Jonker (head of development lab of electronic valves in the mid thirties) was the originator of the EF50 and this development started as early as 1934–1935. It was, indeed ,developed in view of possible television application."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=letter of Th. P. Tromp to Mr Bell|url=http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/letter_Tromp.htm|access-date=22 May 2014|author=Th.P.Tromp|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television requirements===
[[Pye Ltd.]], a leading British electronics firm of the time, had pioneered television receiver design, and in the late 1930s wanted to market receivers that would allow reception further and further from the single [[Alexandra Palace]] television transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dekker|first=Ronald|title=The EF50, the tube that helped to win the War|url=http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/EF50.html|access-date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Encouraged by their 1937 success with a novel [[Tuned radio frequency receiver|tuned radio frequency]] (TRF) design, Pye wanted a higher quality valve than they could produce on their own, and so talked to [[Mullard]], which meant the research of Philips in Holland, plus some tweaking from Baden John Edwards and Donald Jackson from Pye (for example the metal shield),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dicker|first=Graham|title=The Secret Radar Valve the EF50 Part 1|url=http://www.philipstorr.id.au/radio/technical/EF50_1.pdf|access-date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the EF50 pentode that was needed in the Pye 45 MHz [[Intermediate frequency|IF]] Strip, and created a stable television receiver that captured a good market, being able to receive transmissions at up to five times the distance than the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dicker|first=Graham|title=The secret radar valve the EF50 Part 2|url=http://www.philipstorr.id.au/radio/technical/EF50_2.pdf|access-date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radar uses===
[[Hugh Dowding]] had already seen the value of [[radar]] for his [[Dowding system|Air Defence system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RADAR – The Battle Winner?|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/history-of-the-battle-of-britain/radar-the-battle-winner.aspx|publisher=The Royal Airforce Museum|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments progressed at [[Bawdsey Manor]] from the mid-1930s; the early ground-based radar chains worked well but needed to be improved in accuracy, and Dowding saw the need for an airborne radar. At Bawdsey, [[Edward George Bowen|Taffey Bowen]] had also needed a wideband [[vacuum tube|valve]] for [[Airborne Interception radar|Airborne Interception]] (AI) radar; he had just one working set. So he contacted Tom Goldup, a senior director of [[Mullard]],&lt;ref name="r-type1"/&gt; and "quite by chance in April or May of 1939" he heard of the Pye set from his old Professor at King's College, [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]]. Visiting Pye, Bowen saw scores of what he sought, their 45MHz TRF chassis using the very new EF50, which he later described as "a valve that was to play almost as important a part in the radar war as the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Edward G|title=Radar Days|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0586-0 |pages=77,231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight from Holland===
Because the EF50 had to come from Holland, yet was vital for the RDF ([[radar]]), great efforts were made to secure a continuing supply as the risk of Holland being overrun increased. Mullard in England did not have the ability to manufacture the special glass base, for example, and just before Germany invaded Holland, a truckload with 25,000 complete EF50s and many more of their special bases were successfully sent to England.&lt;ref name="r-type1"/&gt; The entire EF50 production line was hurriedly relocated to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EF50|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_ef50.html|access-date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May, the day before the Germans flattened Rotterdam in 1940, members of the Philips family escaped together with the Dutch government on the British [[destroyer]] [[HMS Windsor (D42)|HMS ''Windsor'']], taking with them a small wooden box containing the industrial diamond [[die (manufacturing)#Wire pulling|die]]s needed to make the fine tungsten wires in the valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dekker|first=Ronald|title=The EF50, the Tube that helped to Win the War|url=http://www.dos4ever.com/EF50/EF50_klein.html|access-date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalents==
To meet great wartime demand the EF50 was also made by [[Marconi-Osram Valve|Marconi-Osram]] (with the name Z90) and [[A.C. Cossor|Cossor]] (their version named 63SPT) in the United Kingdom as well as Mullard (who were effectively using the Philips production line after it was moved from Holland). Versions were also made in Canada by [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company]] and in the United States by [[Sylvania Electric Products]].

British military (Ministry of Aircraft Production Specification) and U.S. JAN type numbers assigned to the EF50 include:
* '''ARP35''' (Army Receiving Pentode 35)
* '''VR91'''  (Original A.M. Name)
* '''CV1091''' (from 1943)
* '''ZA3058''' (Army)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10327">'''Electroacoustic phenomena''' arise when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] containing [[ions]]. The associated particle motion generates [[electric]] signals because ions have [[electric charge]]. This coupling between ultrasound and [[electric field]] is called electroacoustic phenomena. The fluid might be a simple [[Newtonian liquid]], or complex [[heterogeneous]] [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], [[emulsion]] or even a porous body. There are several different electroacoustic effects depending on the nature of the fluid.

*[[Ion vibration current]] (IVI) and potential, an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.
*[[Streaming vibration current]] (SVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when an acoustic wave propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.
*[[Colloid vibration current]] (CVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when ultrasound propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid, such as a [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] or [[emulsion]].
*[[Electric sonic amplitude]] (ESA), the inverse of the CVI effect, in which an acoustic field arises when an [[electric field]] propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid.

==Ion vibration current==
{{main|Ion vibration current}}
Historically, the IVI was the first known electroacoustic effect. It was predicted by Debye in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Debye.P."A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions"J. Chem. Phys., 1,13-16,1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Streaming vibration current==
{{main|Streaming vibration current}}
The streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.M. " An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640-646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz'menko, B.B and Il'in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875-881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies. A similar effect can be observed at a non-porous surface, when sound is bounced off at an oblique angle. The incident and reflected waves superimpose to cause oscillatory fluid motion in the plane of the interface, thereby generating an AC streaming current at the frequency of the sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Glauser, A.R., Robertson P.A., Lowe, C.R., "An electrokinetic sensor for studying immersed surfaces, using focused ultrasound" Sensors Actuators B, 80, 1, 68-82, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double layer compression==
The [[electrical double layer]] can be regarded as behaving like a parallel plate capacitor with a compressible dielectric filling. When sound waves induce a local pressure variation, the spacing of the plates varies at the frequency of the excitation, generating an AC displacement current normal to the interface. For practical reasons this is most readily observed at a conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;F.I. Kukoz, L.A. Kukoz, "The nature of audioelectro-chemical phenomena" Russ. J. Phys. Chem. 36 (1962) pp. 367-369&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible to use an electrode immersed in a conducting electrolyte as a microphone, or indeed as a loudspeaker when the effect is applied in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tankovsky, "Capacitive ultrasound transducer, based on the electrical double layer in electrolytes" J. App. Phys. 87 (2000) pp. 538-542&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloid vibration potential and current==
{{main|Colloid vibration current}}
Colloid vibration potential measures the AC potential difference generated between two identical relaxed electrodes, placed in the dispersion, if the latter is subjected to an ultrasonic field. When a sound wave travels through a colloidal suspension of particles whose density differs from that of the surrounding medium, inertial forces induced by the vibration of the suspension give rise to a motion of the charged particles relative to the liquid, causing an alternating electromotive force. The manifestations of this electromotive force may be measured, depending on the relation between the impedance of the suspension and that of the measuring instrument, either as colloid vibration potential or as ''colloid vibration current''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Colloid vibration potential and current was first reported by Hermans and then independently by Rutgers in 1938. It is widely used for characterizing the ζ-potential of various dispersions and emulsions. The effect, theory, experimental verification and multiple applications are discussed in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |accessdate=2007-10-03 |date=2002 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=153 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/electroacoustictheory/electoracoustictheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric sonic amplitude==
{{main|Electric sonic amplitude}}
Electric sonic amplitude was experimentally discovered by Cannon with co-authors in early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Oja, T., Petersen, G., and Cannon, D. "Measurement of Electric-Kinetic Properties of a Solution", US Patent 4,497,208,1985&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used for characterizing ζ-potential in dispersions and emulsions. There is review of this effect theory, experimental verification and multiple applications published by Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Review. Recent developments in the electroacoustic characterization of colloidal suspensions and emulsions", Colloids and Surfaces, 141, 37-65, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of CVI and ESA==
With regard to the theory of CVI and ESA, there was an important observation made by O'Brien,&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, R.W. "Electro-acoustic effects in a dilute suspension of spherical particles" J. Fluid Mech., 190, 71-86,1988&lt;/ref&gt; who linked these measured parameters with [[dynamic electrophoretic mobility]] μ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\mu_d\frac{\rho_p-\rho_m}{\rho_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: A is calibration constant, depending on frequency, but not particles properties;
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is particle density,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; density of the fluid,
: φ is volume fraction of dispersed phase,

Dynamic electrophoretic mobility is similar to [[electrophoretic mobility]] that appears in [[electrophoresis]] theory. They are identical at low frequencies and/or for sufficiently small particles.

There are several theories of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility. Their overview is given in the Ref.5. Two of them are the most important.

The first one corresponds to the Smoluchowski limit. It yields following simple expression for CVI for sufficiently small particles with negligible CVI frequency dependence:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\frac{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m\zeta\Kappa_s}{\eta\Kappa_m}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; is vacuum dielectric permittivity,
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity,
: ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
: η is dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the system,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the fluid,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is density of the system.

This remarkably simple equation has same wide range of applicability as Smoluchowski equation  for [[electrophoresis]]. It is independent on shape of the particles, their concentration.

Validity of this equation is restricted with the following two requirements.
  
First, it is valid only for a thin [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]], when the [[Debye length]] is much smaller than particle's radius a:
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, it neglects the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]]. This assumes a small [[Dukhin number]]:
:&lt;math&gt; Du &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction of the thin double layer limits applicability of this Smoluchowski type theory only to aqueous systems with sufficiently large particles and not very low ionic strength. This theory does not work well for nano-colloids, including proteins and polymers at low ionic strength. It is not valid for low- or non-polar fluids.

There is another theory that is applicable for the other extreme case of a thick double layer, when  
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

This theory takes into consideration the double layer overlap that inevitably occurs for concentrated systems with thick double layer. This allows introduction of so-called "quasi-homogeneous" approach, when overlapped diffuse layers of particles cover the complete interparticle space. The theory becomes much simplified in this extreme case, as shown by Shilov and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shilov, V.N., Borkovskaya, Y.B. and Dukhin A.S. "Electroacoustic theory for concentrated colloids with overlapped DLs at arbitrary ka. Application to nanocolloids and nonaqueous colloids". JCIS, 277, 347-358 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation predicts that surface charge density σ is a better parameter than ζ-potential for characterizing electroacoustic phenomena in such systems. An expression for CVI simplified for small particles follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI = A\frac{2{\sigma}a}{3\eta}\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

{{main|Rossby wave }}

'''Equatorial Rossby waves''', often called planetary waves, are very long, low frequency waves found near the equator and are derived using the equatorial beta plane approximation.

==Mathematics==

Using the equatorial beta plane approximation,  &lt;math&gt;f = \beta y&lt;/math&gt;, where ''β'' is the variation of the [[Coriolis parameter]] with latitude, &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;.  With this approximation, the [[primitive equations]] become the following:

* the continuity equation (accounting for the effects of horizontal convergence and divergence and written with geopotential height):

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} + c^2 \left ( \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right ) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* the U-momentum equation (zonal component):

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{dt} - v \beta y = -\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

* the V-momentum equation (meridional component):

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt} + u \beta y = -\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Holton"&gt;Holton, James R., 2004: ''An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology.''  Elsevier Academic Press, Burlington, MA, pp. 394–400.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In order to fully linearize the primitive equations, one must assume the following solution:

::&lt;math&gt; \begin{Bmatrix}u, v, \varphi \end{Bmatrix} = \begin{Bmatrix}\hat \varphi \end{Bmatrix} e^{i(k x + \ell y - \omega t)}. &lt;/math&gt;

Upon linearization, the primitive equations yield the following dispersion relation:

&lt;math&gt;\omega = -\beta k/(k^2 + (2n + 1)\beta/c)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''c'' is the phase speed of an equatorial Kelvin wave (&lt;math&gt;c^2 = g H&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;Gill, Adrian E., 1982: ''Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics,'' International Geophysics Series, Volume 30, Academic Press, 662 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their frequencies are much lower than that of [[gravity waves]] and represent motion that occurs as a result of the undisturbed [[potential vorticity]] varying (not constant) with latitude on the curved surface of the earth.  For very long waves (as the zonal wavenumber approaches zero), the non-dispersive phase speed is approximately:

&lt;math&gt;\omega/k = -c/(2n + 1)&lt;/math&gt;, which indicates that these long equatorial Rossby waves move in the opposite direction (westward) of Kelvin waves (which move eastward) with speeds reduced by factors of 3, 5, 7, etc.  To illustrate, suppose c = 2.8 m/s for the first baroclinic mode in the Pacific; then the Rossby wave speed would correspond to ~0.9 m/s, requiring a 6-month time frame to cross the Pacific basin from east to west.&lt;ref name ="Gill" /&gt;  For very short waves (as the zonal wavenumber increases), the group velocity (energy packet) is eastward and opposite to the phase speed, both of which are given by the following relations:

*Frequency relation:

:: &lt;math&gt;\omega = -\beta/k, \, &lt;/math&gt;

*Group velocity:

:: &lt;math&gt;c_g = \beta/k^2.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

Thus, the phase and group speeds are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (phase speed is westward and group velocity is eastward); note that is often useful to use [[potential vorticity]] as a tracer for these planetary waves, due to its invertibility (especially in the quasi-geostrophic framework).  Therefore, the physical mechanism responsible for the propagation of these equatorial Rossby waves is none other than the conservation of potential vorticity:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\beta y + \zeta}{H} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;  

Thus, as a fluid parcel moves equatorward (βy approaches zero), the relative vorticity must increase and become more cyclonic in nature.  Conversely, if the same fluid parcel moves poleward, (βy becomes larger), the relative vorticity must decrease and become more anticyclonic in nature.  

As a side note, these equatorial Rossby waves can also be vertically-propagating waves when the [[Brunt–Vaisala frequency]] ([[buoyancy]] frequency) is held constant, ultimately resulting in solutions proportional to &lt;math&gt;e^{i(k x + m z - \omega t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is the vertical wavenumber and ''k'' is the zonal wavenumber.  

Equatorial Rossby waves can also adjust to equilibrium under gravity in the [[tropics]]; because the planetary waves have frequencies much lower than gravity waves. The adjustment process tends to take place in two distinct stages where the first stage is a rapid change due to the fast propagation of gravity waves, the same as that on an ''f''-plane (Coriolis parameter held constant), resulting in a flow that is close to [[geostrophic]] equilibrium. This stage could be thought of as the mass field adjusting to the wave field (due to the wavelengths being smaller than the [[Rossby_radius_of_deformation|Rossby deformation radius]].  The second stage is one where quasi-geostrophic adjustment takes place by means of planetary waves; this process can be comparable to the wave field adjusting to the mass field (due to the wavelengths being larger than the Rossby deformation radius.&lt;ref name="Holton" /&gt;

'''Eskolaite''' is an uncommon [[chromium]] [[oxide mineral]] ([[chromium(III) oxide]] Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Discovery and occurrence==
It was first described in 1958 for an occurrence in the [[Outokumpu, Finland|Outokumpu]] ore deposit of eastern [[Finland]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; It occurs in chromium bearing [[tremolite]] [[skarn]]s, [[metamorphosed]] [[quartzite]]s and [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] bearing [[Vein (geology)|veins]] in Finland; in [[Glacier|glacial]] boulder clays in [[Ireland]] and in stream pebbles in the [[Merume River]] of [[Guyana]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; It has also been recognized as a rare component in [[chondrite meteorite]]s.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

The mineral is named after the Finnish geologist [[Pentti Eskola]] (1883–1964).

==Structure and physical properties==
[[Image:Eskolaite-pV.svg|thumb|250 px|left|Molar volume vs. pressure at room temperature.]]
Eskolaite crystallizes with trigonal symmetry in the space group ''R''{{overline|3}}''c'' and has the lattice parameters a = 4.95 Å and c = 13.58 Å at standard conditions. The unit cell contains six formula units. The lattice is analogous to that of [[corundum]], with Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; replacing Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Such a cavity has a large number of resonances but in the resonant mode used, large RF fields are developed in the gaps between the rungs. The [[phase (waves)|phase]] advance from gap to gap is selected in such a way that an electron sees the same field at every gap, and it is described as being [[synchronous]]. In this context, the same field means a field of the same phase but not necessarily the same [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]].

An electron beam which enters an RF excited cavity with approximately synchronous velocity will receive cumulative velocity modulation at each gap. After some distance into the resonator, repeatedly [[Acceleration|accelerated]] [[electron]]s will be catching up with electrons repeatedly decelerated, and bunches will form. These bunches will have a velocity close to the beam velocity. If the electron velocity is somewhat greater than synchronous, the bunches will start to cross gaps when the field is retarding, rather than zero. When this happens, the electrons are slowed; their lost [[energy]] is gained by the cavity and sustained oscillations become possible. As the velocity of the beam entering the cavity is increased further, more energy is transferred to the cavity and the [[frequency]] of [[oscillation]] rises somewhat. Eventually, however, the bunches punch through the retarding fields and oscillations cease abruptly. Reducing the beam velocity (voltage) will cause the tube to resume oscillation. However, it is necessary to reduce the beam velocity below the value at which oscillations ceased before oscillation will start again. This phenomenon is known as [[hysteresis]] and is similar to that observed in many [[Klystron#Reflex klystron|reflex klystrons]].

The frequency change which occurs as the beam voltage is raised is referred to as electronic tuning, and is typically 0.2% of the operating frequency measured from half power to cessation of oscillation. For larger frequency changes mechanical tuning is used which is obtained by moving one wall of the cavity. The moveable wall is, in fact, a piston which can be moved in a tunnel whose cross-section is that of the wall which it replaces. The range of mechanical tuning is usually limited by parasitic resonances which occur when the oscillating frequency and the frequency of one of the many other cavity resonances coincide. When this happens, serious loss is introduced, often sufficient enough to suppress oscillation completely. Typically, a mechanical tuning range of 4% can be obtained&lt;ref&gt;Roitman et al, High Power CW 264 GHz tunable Extended Interaction Oscillator, 14th International Vacuum Electronics Conference (IVEC), Paris, France 2013&lt;/ref&gt; but greater ranges have been demonstrated.

Apart from the resonant cavity, the Extended Interaction Oscillator is very similar to more conventional [[klystron]]s. An electron gun produces a narrow beam of electrons which is maintained at the required [[diameter]] by a [[magnetic field]] while it passes through the RF section. Thereafter, the beam enters a relatively field-free region where it spreads out and is collected by an appropriately cooled collector. Many of these oscillators have electrically isolated [[anode]]s and in these cases, the [[voltage]] between the [[cathode]] and anode determines the tube current which in turn determines the maximum power output.

'''Freezing drizzle''' is [[drizzle]] that freezes on contact with the ground or an object at or near the surface. Its [[METAR]] code is '''FZDZ'''.&lt;ref name="Spence2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spence|first1=Charles F.|title=Aim/Far|date=2006|publisher=[[McGraw Hill Professional]]|isbn=9780071479240|page=294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0vp1WORkJEC&amp;q=%22freezing+drizzle%22&amp;dq=%22freezing+drizzle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit9-vrqezWAhVR-lQKHTpEAxkQ6AEIRTAF|accessdate=13 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Although freezing drizzle and [[freezing rain]] are similar in that they both involve liquid precipitation at the surface during subfreezing temperatures, the mechanisms leading to their development are entirely different. Where freezing rain forms when frozen precipitation falls through a melting layer, freezing drizzle forms via the ''supercooled warm rain process'' in which cloud droplets coalesce until they become heavy enough to fall out of the cloud.&lt;ref name=severe&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9_8YLgEACAAJ&amp;dq=severe+%26+hazardous+weather|title=Severe &amp; Hazardous Weather|isbn=9780757597725|author1=Rauber|first1=Robert M|last2=Walsh|first2=John E|last3=Charlevoix|first3=Donna Jean|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this process taking place in a subfreezing environment, the liquid water will not freeze if the environmental temperature is above {{convert|18|°F|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weather.gov/lot/2015jan26 |title=Freezing Drizzle on January 26th; A Look Into Why |website=National Weather Service |access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If [[ice crystals]] are already present in this environment, the liquid droplets will freeze onto these crystals and be effectively removed before they can grow large enough to fall out of the cloud. As a result, freezing drizzle develops in shallow [[stratus cloud|stratus-type]] clouds where saturation occurs entirely below the layer in which ice crystals can develop and grow.&lt;ref name=severe&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
When freezing drizzle accumulates on land it creates an icy layer of [[glaze ice|glaze]]. Freezing drizzle alone does not generally result in significant [[ice]] accumulations due to its light, low-intensity nature.  However, even thin layers of slick ice deposited on roads as [[black ice]] can cause extremely hazardous conditions resulting in vehicle crashes.

Freezing drizzle is extremely dangerous to aircraft as the supercooled water droplets will freeze onto the airframe, degrading aircraft performance considerably. The loss of [[American Eagle Flight 4184]] on October 31, 1994 has been attributed to ice buildup due to freezing drizzle aloft.&lt;ref name=severe&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the moth|Glauce (moth){{!}}''Glauce'' (moth)}}
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Glauce''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|l|ɔː|s|iː}}; Ancient Greek: Γλαυκή "blue-gray" or "gleaming"), [[Latin]] '''Glauca''', refers to different people:

*Glauce, twin sister of [[Pluto_(mythology)#Euhemerism_and_Latinization|Pluto]] who died as an infant according to [[Euhemerus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''Institutiones Divinae'', 1. 14. 5, citing [[Ennius]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Glauce, an [[Arcadia]]n [[nymph]], one of the nurses of [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 8. 47. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
*Glauce, one of the [[Nereids]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''Iliad'', 18. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'', 244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', Preface&lt;/ref&gt;
*Glauce, one of the [[Meliae|Melia]]n nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on ''Theogony'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;
*Glauce, mother, by Upis, of "the third" [[Artemis]] in [[Cicero]]'s rationalized genealogy of the Greek gods.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[De natura deorum]]'', 3. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
*Glauce, one of the [[Danaids]], daughter of [[Danaus]]. She married Alces, son of [[Aegyptus]] and an Arabian woman.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 2. 1. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Creusa (daughter of Creon)|Glauce]], daughter of [[Creon (king of Corinth)|Creon]]. She married [[Jason]]. She was killed, along with her father, by [[Medea]], who either sent her a [[peplos]] steeped in flammable poison or set fire to the royal palace.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 1. 9. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4. 54. 2 - 6&lt;/ref&gt; In the local [[Corinth]]ian tradition, Glauce threw herself into a well in a vain attempt to wash off Medea's poison; from this circumstance the well became known as the Well of Glauce.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 2. 3. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Also known by the name [[Creusa]], predominantly in Latin authors, e.g. Seneca (''Medea'') and Propertius (2.16.30). [[Hyginus]] (Fab. 25) uses both names interchangeably. In [[Cherubini|Cherubini's]] [[opera]] [[Médée (Cherubini)|  Medea]] she is known as Dircé.
*Glauce, an [[Amazons|Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 163&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that it was she, and not [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], who was abducted by [[Theseus]] and became his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', Epitome of Book 4, 5. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on ''[[Iliad]]'', 3. 189&lt;/ref&gt;
*Glauce, daughter of [[Cychreus]], son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Salamis (mythology)|Salamis]]. Some sources say that Glauce married Actaeus and bore him a son [[Telamon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3. 12. 6 with reference to [[Pherecydes of Leros|Pherecydes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that Telamon was her husband and that, after her death, he married [[Periboea]], mother of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4. 72. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
*Glauce, daughter of [[Cycnus]], sister of Cobis and Corianus. During the Trojan campaign, she was taken captive by the Greeks and was given to [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictys Cretensis]], 2. 13&lt;/ref&gt; by whom she became mother of Aeantides.&lt;ref&gt;Dictys Cretensis, 5. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HZE ions''' are the high-energy [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] component of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s (GCRs) which have an [[electric charge]] greater than +2. The abbreviation "HZE" comes from high (H) [[atomic number]] (Z) and [[energy]] (E). HZE ions include the nuclei of all [[Chemical element|elements]] heavier than [[hydrogen]] (which has a +1 charge) and [[helium]] (which has a +2 charge). Each HZE ion consists of a nucleus with no orbiting [[electron]]s, meaning that the charge on the [[ion]] is the same as the atomic number of the nucleus.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

HZE ions are rare compared to [[protons]], for example, composing only 1% of GCRs versus 85% for protons.&lt;ref name="Schimmerling"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://three.jsc.nasa.gov/concepts/SpaceRadiationEnviron.pdf|title=The Space Radiation Environment: An Introduction|last=Schimmerling|first=Walter|date=5 February 2011|publisher=Universities Space Research Association Division of Space Life Sciences|access-date=8 January 2013|work=The Health Risks of Extraterrestrial Environments}}&lt;/ref&gt; HZE ions, like other GCRs, travel near the [[speed of light]]. Their source is likely to be [[supernova]] explosions.&lt;ref name="Mars"&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2004/17feb_radiation Can People go to Mars?] Science@NASA, February 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the HZE ions from cosmic sources, HZE ions are produced by the [[Sun]]. During [[solar flare]]s and other solar storms, HZE ions are sometimes produced in small amounts along with the more typical protons,&lt;ref name="NASA/TP-1999-209320" /&gt; but their energy level is substantially smaller than HZE ions from [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name=Mars /&gt;

[[Space radiation]] is composed mostly of high-energy [[protons]], [[helium]] nuclei, and high-Z high-energy ions (HZE ions).  The ionization patterns in [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], and the resulting biological harm are distinct from high-energy [[photon]] radiation—[[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s, which produce low-[[linear energy transfer]] (low-LET) radiation from [[secondary electrons]]. While in [[space]], [[astronaut]]s are exposed to protons, helium nuclei, and HZE ions, as well as [[secondary radiation]] from [[nuclear reaction]]s from [[spacecraft]] parts or tissue.&lt;ref name="122-123"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cucinotta|first=F.A. |last2=Durante|first2=M. |title=Risk of Radiation Carcinogenesis |url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/Carcinogenesis.pdf |work=Human Health and Performance Risks of Space Exploration Missions Evidence reviewed by the NASA Human Research Program |publisher=NASA |accessdate=6 June 2012 |pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent HZE ions:
* [[Carbon|Carbon (C)]]
* [[Oxygen|Oxygen (O)]]
* [[Magnesium|Magnesium (Mg)]]
* [[Silicon|Silicon (Si)]]
* [[Iron|Iron (Fe)]]
GCRs typically originate from outside the [[Solar System]] and within the [[Milky Way|Milky Way galaxy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galactic Cosmic Rays|url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcr.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but those from outside of the Milky Way consist mostly of highly energetic protons with a small component of HZE ions.&lt;ref name=122-123 /&gt; GCR energy spectra peaks, with median energy peaks up to 1,000 [[Electronvolt|MeV]]/[[atomic mass unit|amu]], and nuclei (with energies up to 10,000 [[Electronvolt|MeV]]/[[atomic mass unit|amu]]) are important contributors to the dose equivalent.&lt;ref name=122-123 /&gt;

==Health concerns of HZE ions==
{{main|Health threat from cosmic rays}}
Although HZE ions make up a small proportion of cosmic rays, their high charge and high energies cause them to contribute significantly to the overall biological impact of cosmic rays, making them as significant as protons in regard to biological impact.&lt;ref name="Schimmerling" /&gt; The most dangerous GCRs are heavy ionized nuclei such as Fe +26, an [[iron (element)|iron]] nucleus with a charge of +26. Such heavy particles are "much more energetic (millions of [[MeV]]) than typical protons accelerated by solar flares (tens to hundreds of MeV)."&lt;ref name=Mars /&gt;  HZE ions can therefore penetrate through thick layers of shielding and body tissue, "breaking the strands of DNA molecules, damaging genes and killing cells."&lt;ref name=Mars /&gt;

For HZE ions that originate from [[solar particle event]]s (SPEs), there is only a small contribution toward a person's [[absorbed dose]] of radiation.  During a SPE, there is such a small amount of heavy ions generated that their effects are limited. Their energies per [[atomic mass unit]] are all significantly less than protons found in the same SPE, meaning that protons are by far the largest contribution to astronaut body exposure during SPEs.&lt;ref name="NASA/TP-1999-209320"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19990051001 Contribution of High Charge and Energy (HZE) Ions During Solar-Particle Event of September 29, 1989] Kim, Myung-Hee Y.; Wilson, John W.; Cucinotta, Francis A.; Simonsen, Lisa C.; Atwell, William; Badavi, Francis F.; Miller, Jack, NASA Johnson Space Center; Langley Research Center, May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Home Plate''' is a plateau roughly 90 m across within the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]], [[Mars]]. It is informally named for its similarity in shape to a [[baseball]] [[home plate]]. Home Plate is a rocky outcrop that appears to show layered feature.

The plateau has been extensively studied by [[Spirit rover|''Spirit'']], one of the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, since 2006. The rover became stuck in loose granular material alongside the northeast side of the plateau. The rover last communicated with Earth on March 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/pia15037.html|title=Spirit Remains Silent at Troy|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
''Spirit'' arrived at Home Plate on [[Timekeeping on Mars|sol]] 744 (February 7, 2006) and has completed a scientific investigation with her robotic arm before moving to Low Ridge Haven due to power concerns. She returned on sol 1126 to resume those studies.

''Spirit'' spent her third Martian winter on Home Plate's north edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12884-mars-rover-spirit-to-head-north-for-the-winter.html|title=Mars rover Spirit to head north for the winter|author=Maggie McKee|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wide image|Sol594A P2281 L257atc-A597R1 br2.jpg|600px|Home Plate (upper center), as seen from the summit of Husband Hill.}}
==Origins==
Scientists now believe that Home Plate is an explosive volcanic deposit. It is surrounded by deposits of [[basalt]], which are believed to have exploded on contact with water. The presence of brine is further supported by the high concentration of [[chloride ion]]s in the surrounding rocks. The presence of [[bomb sag]]s (laminae typically found in beds of volcanish ash) seems to confirm this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|title=Pyroclastic Activity at Home Plate in Gusev Crater, Mars|pages=738–742|volume=316|doi=10.1126/science.1139045|date=2007|pmid=17478719|issue=5825|bibcode = 2007Sci...316..738S |last2=Aharonson|first2=O.|last3=Clark|first3=B.C.|last4=Cohen|first4=B.

A patch of 90% pure [[opal]]ine [[silicon dioxide]] was unearthed by ''Spirit'' in the vicinity of Home Plate. The patch is believed to be formed in acidic [[Hot spring|hydrothermal conditions]], which supports the theory that Home Plate is of an explosive volcanic origin. Water is also present as mineral [[hydrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|accessdate=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|volume=320|pages=1063–1067|author=Squyres, et al.|title=Detection of Silica-Rich Deposits on Mars|doi=10.1126/science.1155429|date=2008|pmid=18497295|issue=5879|last2=Arvidson|first2=RE|last3=Ruff|first3=S|last4=Gellert|first4=R|last5=Morris|first5=RV|last6=Ming|first6=DW|last7=Crumpler|first7=L|last8=Farmer|first8=JD|last9=Marais|first9=DJ|last10=Yen|first10=A.|last11=McLennan|first11=S.

[[File:International Date Line.png|thumb|The International Date Line around the [[antimeridian]] (180° longitude)]]

The '''International Date Line''' ('''IDL''') is an imaginary line of demarcation on the [[Earth#Surface|surface of Earth]] that runs from the [[North Pole]] to the [[South Pole]] and demarcates the change of one [[calendar day]] to the next. It passes through the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean]], roughly following the [[180th meridian|180°]] [[line of longitude]] but deviating to pass around some territories and island groups.

==Geography==
[[File:Dateline-animation-3deg-borderonly-180px.gif|thumb|A simplified illustration of the relation between date line, date and time of day. Each color represents a different date.]]
[[File:international date line.png|thumb|280px|Example depicting situation at 04:00 GMT Tuesday. (Times are approximate, since time zone boundaries generally do not exactly coincide with meridians. Night and day is illustrative only; daylight hours depend on latitude and time of year.)]]

===Description===
:''This description is based on the most common understanding of the ''de facto'' International Date Line. See {{slink||De facto and de jure date lines}} below, and map above at right.''
The IDL is roughly based on the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 180° longitude, roughly down the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and halfway around the world from the [[Greenwich meridian]]. In many places, the IDL follows the 180° meridian exactly. In other places, however, the IDL deviates east or west away from that meridian. These various deviations generally accommodate the political and/or economic affiliations of the affected areas.

Proceeding from north to south, the first deviation of the IDL from 180° is to pass to the east of [[Wrangel Island]] and the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], the easternmost part of Russian [[Siberia]]. (Wrangel Island lies directly on the meridian at 71°32′N 180°0′E, also noted as 71°32′N 180°0′W.)&lt;ref name="wrengell"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Arctic Expeditions Commanded by Americans |journal=The National Geographic Magazine |volume=18 |pages=459–468 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RAOAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA459|year=1907 |access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then passes through the [[Bering Strait]] between the [[Diomede Islands]] at a distance of {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} from each island at 168°58′37″ W.&lt;ref name="Russia-US maritime boundary"&gt;{{cite |last=Allen |first=Jared |date=11 January 2012 |title=United States – Russian Maritime Boundary and Exclusive Economic Zones |website=ArcticEcon  |url=https://arcticecon.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/united-states-russian-maritime-boundary-and-exclusive-economic-zones/|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then bends considerably west of 180°, passing west of [[St. Lawrence Island]] and [[St. Matthew Island]].

The IDL crosses between the U.S. [[Aleutian Islands]] ([[Attu Island]] being the westernmost) and the [[Commander Islands]], which belong to Russia. It then bends southeast again to return to 180°. Thus, all of Russia is to the west of the IDL, and all of the United States is to the east except for the insular areas of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Wake Island.

The IDL remains on the 180° meridian until passing the [[equator]]. Two US-owned uninhabited atolls, [[Howland Island]] and [[Baker Island]], just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean (and ships at sea between 172.5°W and 180°), have the latest time on Earth ([[UTC−12:00|UTC−12]] hours).

The IDL circumscribes [[Kiribati]] by swinging far to the east, almost reaching the [[150th meridian west|150°W meridian]]. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern [[Line Islands]] south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth, [[UTC+14]] hours. South of Kiribati, the IDL returns westwards but remains east of 180°, passing between [[Samoa]] and [[American Samoa]].&lt;ref name=BorneoPost&gt;[http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/06/30/samoa-confirms-dateline-switch/ Samoa confirms dateline switch] Borneo Post online.

In much of this area, the IDL follows the [[165th meridian west|165°W meridian]]. Accordingly, Samoa, [[Tokelau]], [[Wallis and Futuna]], [[Fiji]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]] and New Zealand's [[Kermadec Islands]] and [[Chatham Islands]] are all west of the IDL and have the same date. American Samoa, the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and [[French Polynesia]] are east of the IDL and one day behind.

The IDL then bends southwest to return to 180°. It follows that meridian until reaching [[Antarctica]], which has [[Time in Antarctica|multiple time zones]]. Conventionally, the IDL is not drawn into Antarctica on most maps. (See {{slink||Cartographic practice and convention}} below.)

===Circumnavigating the globe===
A person who goes [[circumnavigation|around the world]] from east to west (the same direction as [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan's voyage]]) would gain or set their clock back one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and would gain 24 hours for one circuit of the globe from east to west if they did not compensate by setting their clock forward one day when they crossed the IDL. In contrast, a west-to-east circumnavigation of the globe loses an hour for every 15° of longitude crossed but gains back a day when crossing the IDL. The IDL must therefore be observed in conjunction with the Earth's time zones: on crossing it in either direction, the calendar ''date'' is adjusted by one day.

===Facts dependent on the IDL===
For the two hours between 10:00 and 11:59 [[UTC]] each day, three different calendar dates are observed at the same time in different places on Earth. For example, at 10:15 UTC Thursday, it is 23:15 Wednesday in American Samoa ([[UTC−11:00|UTC−11]]), Thursday in most of the world, and 00:15 Friday in [[Kiritimati]] ([[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]]).

During the first hour (UTC 10:00–10:59), all three calendar dates include inhabited places.  During the second hour (UTC 11:00–11:59) one of the calendar dates is limited to an uninhabited maritime time zone twelve hours behind UTC ([[UTC−12]]).

According to the clock, the first areas to experience a new day and a [[New Year]] are islands that use UTC+14. These include portions of the [[Republic of Kiribati]], including [[Millennium Island]] in the [[Line Islands]], as well as Samoa during the southern summer. The first major cities to experience a new day are [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], New Zealand ([[UTC+12:00|UTC+12]]; [[UTC+13:00|UTC+13]] with daylight saving time).

A 1995 realignment of the IDL made Caroline Island one of the first points of land on Earth to reach January 1, 2000 on the calendar ([[UTC+14]]). As a result, this [[atoll]] was renamed [[Millennium Island]].&lt;ref name="Millennium"&gt;{{cite web |work= Pacific Islands Report |title= Kiribati's Caroline Island renamed Millennium Island |date= September 2002 |url=  http://www.pireport.org/articles/1997/08/11/kiribatis-caroline-island-renamed-millennium-island |accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The areas that are the first to see the daylight of a new day vary by the season. Around the [[June solstice]], the first area would be anyplace within the [[Kamchatka Time|Kamchatka Time Zone]] ([[UTC+12]]) that is far enough north to experience [[midnight sun]] on the given date. At the [[equinox]]es, the first place to see daylight would be the uninhabited [[Millennium Island]] in Kiribati, which is the easternmost land located west of the IDL.

Near the [[December solstice]], the first places would be [[Research stations in Antarctica|Antarctic research stations]] using [[New Zealand Time]] (UTC+13) during summer that experience midnight sun. These include [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]], [[McMurdo Station]], [[Scott Base]] and [[Mario Zucchelli Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Clock-Query Results|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/?query=Antarctica|website=Time and date.com|accessdate=20 May 2016|postscript=,}} and click through to the individual stations' pages. With respect to Scott Base, see [[Ross Dependency]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== De facto and de jure date lines ==
There are two ways [[time zone]]s and thereby the location of the International Date Line are determined, one on land and adjacent [[territorial waters]], and the other on open seas.

All nations unilaterally determine their standard [[time zone]]s, applicable only on land and adjacent territorial waters. This date line can be called ''[[de facto]]'' since it is not based on international law, but on national laws. These national zones do not extend into international waters.

The [[nautical date line]], not the same as the IDL, is a ''[[de jure]]'' construction determined by international agreement. It is the result of the 1917 [[Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea]], which recommended that all ships, both military and civilian, adopt hourly standard time zones on the high seas. The United States adopted its recommendation for U.S. military and merchant marine ships in 1920. This date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the [[180th meridian|180° meridian]] except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land, forming gaps—it is a pole-to-pole dashed line. The 15° gore that is offset from UTC by 12 hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5° gores that differ from UTC by ±12 hours.

Ships are supposed to adopt the standard time of a country if they are within its territorial waters within {{convert|12|nmi|mi km}} of land, then revert to international time zones (15° wide pole-to-pole [[Gore (segment)|gore]]s) as soon as they leave. In reality, ships use these time zones only for radio communication and similar purposes. For internal purposes, such as work and meal hours, ships use a time zone of their own choosing.

===Cartographic practice and convention===
The IDL on the map on this page and all other maps is based on the ''de facto'' line and is an artificial construct of cartographers, as the precise course of the line in international waters is arbitrary. The IDL does not extend into Antarctica on the world time zone maps by the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/ref_maps/physical/pdf/standard_time_zones_of_the_world.pdf |title=Standard Time Zones of the World by the CIA |format=PDF |accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the United Kingdom's [[HM Nautical Almanac Office|Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]] (HMNAO).&lt;ref name=HMNAO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/nao/miscellanea/WMTZ/Wmtz160224.pdf |title=Standard Time Zones by HM Nautical Almanac Office |publisher=HM Nautical Almanac Office and US Naval Observatory (jointly) |accessdate=20 May 2016|postscript=.}} {{selfref inline|Note that this map uses the opposite sign convention for time zones from that used in Wikipedia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDL on modern CIA maps now reflects the most recent shifts in the IDL&lt;ref name=CIA /&gt; (see {{slink||Historical alterations}} below). The current HMNAO map does not draw the IDL in conformity with recent shifts in the IDL; it draws a line virtually identical to that adopted by the UK's Hydrographic Office about 1900.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. W. Downing, [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1900JBAA...10..176D "Where the day changes"], ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'', vol x, no 4, 1906, pp. 176–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, HMNAO labels island groups with their time zones, which do reflect the most recent IDL shifts.&lt;ref name=HMNAO /&gt; This approach is consistent with the principle of national and nautical time zones: the islands of eastern Kiribati are actually "islands" of Asian date (west side of IDL) in a sea of American date (east side of IDL).

No international organization, nor any treaty between nations, has fixed the IDL drawn by cartographers: the 1884 [[International Meridian Conference]] explicitly refused to propose or agree to any time zones, stating that they were outside its [[wikt:purview#Noun|purview]]. The conference resolved that the Universal Day, midnight-to-midnight [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (now known as [[Coordinated Universal Time|Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC]]), which it did agree to, "shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable".&lt;ref name=imc&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference Held at Washington for the Purpose of Fixing a Prime Meridian and a Universal Day.

==Historical alterations==
[[File:Datumsgrenze MK1888.png|thumb|left|Erroneous International Date Line from the 1888 [[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]. The Philippine Islands are shown pre-1845, while Alaska is shown post-1867.]]

==={{anchor|Philippines}}Philippines (1521 and 1844)===

As part of [[New Spain]], the [[Philippines]] long had its most important communication with [[Acapulco]] in [[Mexico]] and was accordingly on the ''east'' side of the IDL despite being at the far western edge of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. From 1521 to 1844, the [[Philippine Standard Time|Philippines was one day behind]] its [[Asia]]n neighbors (Saturday, {{nowrap|16 March 1521}} was the first European visit, when [[Ferdinand Magellan]] claimed the area for Spain; colonization began on Friday, {{nowrap|27 April 1565}}). After Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, Philippine trade interests turned to [[Ming Dynasty|Imperial China]], the [[Dutch East Indies]] and adjacent areas, so the Philippines decided to shift back to the west side of the IDL by removing Tuesday, {{nowrap|31 December 1844}} from its calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/idl/idl_philippines.htm|title=A History of the International Date Line |author=R.

Effective Wednesday, {{nowrap|1 January 1845}}, the Philippines, Guam, Mariana Islands and Caroline Islands switched back to Asian date. Western publications were generally unaware of this change until the early 1890s, so erroneously gave the International Date Line a large western bulge for the next half century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schedler |first=Joseph |date=1878 |title=An illustrated manual for the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedmanua00sche |location=New York |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Alaska}}Alaska (1740s and 1867)===
The [[Russian Empire]] settled northwest North America from [[Siberia]], from the west with its own [[Julian calendar]] (it did not adopt the [[Gregorian calendar]] until 1918). The United States purchased [[Russian America]] while based in the [[contiguous United States]], from the east with its own Gregorian calendar (adopted in 1752 while several British colonies). The transfer ceremony occurred on the day that the commissioners appointed by the governments of Russia and the United States for that purpose arrived via the {{USS|Ossipee|1861|6}} at New Archangel ([[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]), the capital of Russian America.&lt;ref name=transfer&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n2lHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA75 Alaska: ...

Senator [[Charles Sumner]] stated during his three-hour ratification speech (an encyclopedic discussion of Russian America) on Tuesday, {{nowrap|9 April 1867}}, that this day of the week and calendar discord should be changed.&lt;ref name=Sumner&gt;Charles Sumner, [https://books.google.cl/books?id=KawSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 The cession of Russian America to the United States] in ''The Works of Charles Sumner'', vol. 11, Boston: 1875, pp. 181–349, p. 348. Sumner released the written version of his speech on Thursday,{{nowrap|24 May 1867}}, having written it during the immediately preceding Congressional recess following notes on a single page that he actually used on Tuesday, {{nowrap|9 April}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the transfer of ownership officially occurred at {{nowrap|3:30 [[12-hour clock|p.m.]]}} Sitka [[mean solar time]] (time zones were not yet in use),&lt;ref name=transfer/&gt; that was the date and time that Alaska changed from an Asian and Julian date to an American and Gregorian date. If the transfer had occurred at the preceding midnight then Friday, {{nowrap|6 October 1867}} (Julian) would have been followed by Friday, {{nowrap|18 October 1867}} (Gregorian), a duplicate day with a 12-day difference appropriate both for changing from an Asian date to an American date (equivalent to moving the IDL from the east to the west of Alaska) and for changing from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar during the 19th century.

==={{anchor|Samoan Islands and Tokelau}}Samoan Islands and Tokelau (1892 and 2011)===
The [[Samoan Islands]], now divided into [[Samoa]] and [[American Samoa]], were on the west side of the IDL until 1892.  In that year, King [[Malietoa Laupepa]] was persuaded by American traders to adopt the American date (three hours behind California) to replace the former Asian date (four hours ahead of Japan). The change was made by repeating {{nowrap|Monday, 4 July 1892}}, [[Independence Day (United States)|American Independence Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe Lamont, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1921PA.....29..340L "The International Date Line"], ''Popular Astronomy: A Review of Astronomy and Allied Sciences'', '''29''' (1921), 340–348 [cf. pp.&amp;nbsp;344–345].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Samoa shifted back to the west side of the IDL by removing Friday, {{nowrap|30 December 2011}} from its calendar.&lt;ref name=nypost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/where_day_go_QeLR87EP23V9wJrdvAXJdO| title=Where'd Day Go? |publisher=[[Associated Press]] via the [[New York Post]]|date=31 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231000000/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/where_day_go_QeLR87EP23V9wJrdvAXJdO|archivedate=31 December 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed the timezone from [[UTC−11:00|UTC−11]] to [[UTC+13:00|UTC+13]].&lt;ref name=HeraldSun&gt;{{cite news|first=Tamara|last= McLean|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/samoas-dateline-jump-passes-into-law/story-e6frf7jx-1226083970021 |title=Samoa's dateline jump passes into law|location=Melbourne, Australia| publisher=[[Australian Associated Press]] via the [[Herald Sun]]| accessdate=11 August 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111231000000/http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/samoas-dateline-jump-passes-into-law/story-e6frf7jx-1226083970021| archivedate=31 December 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Samoa made the change because [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have become its biggest trading partners, and also have large communities of expatriates. Being 21 hours behind made business difficult because having weekends on backward days meant only four days of the week were shared [[Workweek|workday]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13330592 |title=Samoa to Jump Forward in Time by One Day |publisher=BBC News |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=27 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231000000/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13330592|archivedate=31 December 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDL now passes between Samoa and American Samoa, which remains on the east (American) side of the line.

[[Tokelau]] is a territory of New Zealand north of Samoa whose principal transportation and communications links with the rest of the world pass through [[Samoa]]. For that reason, Tokelau crossed the IDL along with Samoa in 2011.&lt;ref name=Tokelau&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/tokelau-wrong-time.html Tokelau: Wrong local time for over 100 years] TimeAndDate.com.

==={{anchor|Kwajalein}}Kwajalein (c. 1945 and 1993)===
[[Kwajalein]] atoll, like the rest of the [[Marshall Islands]], passed from Spanish to German to Japanese control during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. During that period it was west of the IDL. Although Kwajalein formally became part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] with the rest of the Marshalls after World War II, the United States established a military installation there. Because of that, Kwajalein used the Hawaiian date, so was effectively east of the International Date Line (unlike the rest of the Marshalls). Kwajalein returned to the west side of the IDL by removing Saturday, {{nowrap|21 August 1993}} from its calendar to match the dates used by the rest of the Marshall Islands, at the request of its government. Along with the shift, Kwajalein's work week was changed to Tuesday through Saturday to match the Hawaiian work week of Monday through Friday on the other side of the IDL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1D6163EF931A1575BC0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |title=In Marshall Islands, Friday Is Followed by Sunday |publisher=New York Times |date=22 August 1993 |accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Eastern Kiribati}}Eastern Kiribati (1994)===
As a British colony, the now-Republic of [[Kiribati]] was centered in the [[Gilbert Islands]], just west of the IDL of the time. Upon independence in 1979, it acquired the [[Phoenix Islands|Phoenix]] and [[Line Islands]], east of the IDL, from the United States. As a result, the country straddled the IDL. Government and commercial concerns on opposite sides of the line could only conduct routine business by radio or telephone on the four days of the week which were weekdays on both sides. To eliminate this anomaly, [[Kiribati]] introduced a change of date for its eastern half by removing Saturday, {{nowrap|31 December 1994}} from its calendar. After the change, the IDL in effect moved eastwards to go around the entire country. Strictly legal, the 1917 nautical IDL convention is still valid. When the land time zone says it's Monday, these islands would form enclaves of Monday in an ocean which has Sunday. Maps are usually not drawn this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ariel |first=Avraham |last2=Berger |first2=Nora Ariel |title=Plotting the Globe: Stories of Meridians, Parallels, and the International Date Line |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2xTJt3b3SHUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=Fz3kfjNIusmuKbZ3yEBlF6xRrA4#PRA1-PA149,M1 |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=2005 |page=149 |isbn=0275988953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the 1994 change, Kiribati's easternmost territory, the [[Line Islands]], including the inhabited island of [[Kiritimati|Kiritimati (Christmas Island)]]&lt;!--All areas in UTC+14 have midnight and new year simultaneously--&gt;, started the year 2000 before any other country, a feature the Kiribati government capitalized upon as a potential tourist draw.

==Date lines according to religious principles==

===Christianity===
{{further|Seventh-day Adventist Church of Tonga#Date Line controversy}}
Generally, the Christian calendar  and Christian churches recognize the IDL.  [[Christmas]] for example, is celebrated on 25 December (according to either the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] or the [[Julian calendar]], depending upon which of the two is used by the particular church) as that date falls in countries located on either side of the Date Line.  Thus, whether it is Western Christmas or Orthodox Christmas, Christians in Samoa, immediately west of the Date Line, will celebrate the holiday a day before Christians in ''American'' Samoa, which is immediately ''east'' of the Date Line.

A problem with the general rule above arises in certain Christian churches that solemnly observe a Sabbath day as a particular day of the week, when those churches are located in countries near the Date Line. Notwithstanding the difference in dates, the same sunrise happened over American Samoa as happens over Samoa a few minutes later, and the same sunset happens over Samoa as happened over American Samoa a few minutes earlier.  In other words, the secular days are ''legally'' different but they are ''physically'' the same; and that causes questions to arise under religious law.

Because the Date Line was an arbitrary imposition, the question can arise as to which Saturday on either side of the Date Line (or, more fundamentally, on either side of 180 degrees longitude) is the "real" Saturday.  This issue (which also arises in [[#Judaism|Judaism]]) is a particular problem for Seventh Day Adventists, Seventh Day Baptists, and similar churches located in countries near the Date Line.

In [[Tonga]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church of Tonga|Seventh Day Adventists]] (who usually observe Saturday, the [[seventh-day Sabbath]]) observe Sunday due to their understanding of the International Date Line, as Tonga lies east of the 180° meridian. Sunday as observed in Tonga (as with Kiribati, Samoa, and parts of Fiji and Tuvalu) is considered by the Seventh-day Adventist Church to be the same day as Saturday observed in most other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hay | first = Davi  | title = Tonga's Common Day of Worship | journal = Record  | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | page =6 | publisher = Signs Publishing Company | location = Warburton, Victoria, Australia | date = 30 January 1988| url=http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/AAR/AAR19880130-V93-03__C.pdf#view=fit | accessdate =2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |publisher=Record |url=http://record.adventistconnect.org/site_data/88/assets/0034/6941/RECORD_2_lowrez.pdf |title=Date Line Changed in Somoa |date= 4 Feb 2012 |pp=3 &amp; 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Seventh Day Adventists in [[Samoa]] planned to observe Sabbath on Sunday after Samoa's crossing the date line in December 2011, but SDA groups in Samatau village and other places (approx. 300 members) decided to accept the IDL adjustment and observe the Sabbath on Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Samoa Seventh Day Adventists diverge over impact of Dateline switch|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=65275|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=Radio New Zealand International|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate continues within the Seventh-day Adventist community in the Pacific as to which day is really the seventh-day Sabbath.

The Samoan Independent Seventh-day Adventist Church, which is not affiliated to the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church, has decided to continue worshiping on Saturday, after a six-day week at the end of 2011.

===Islam===
Similarly, the [[Islamic calendar]] and [[Muslim]] communities recognize the convention of the IDL. In particular, the day for holding the ''[[Jumu'ah]]'' prayer appears to be local Friday everywhere in the world.{{refn|There has been some discussion that the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] directly opposite [[Mecca]], approximately 140°W, would be an appropriate date line for Islam.  See {{cite web|last1=Deen|first1=Prof. S.M.|title=Ramadan and Prayer Times in the Lands under Midnight Sun|url=http://scienceunderislam.blogspot.com/2011/05/scid03-ramadan-and-prayer-times-in.html|website=Science Digest for Muslim Thinkers|accessdate=18 May 2016|postscript=.}} However, this appears to be an unusual, or at least only a theoretical, position. Muslims in areas that would be affected, such as Alaska&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Praying Time|url=http://alaskamasjid.com/PrayingTimes.html|website=Islamic Community Center Anchorage Alaska|accessdate=15 November 2017|postscript=.|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.iio.org/the-masjid/about-us|website=Muslim Association of Hawaii|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fact hold ''Jumu'ah'' on local Friday, not local Thursday.}}

The IDL is not a factor in the start and end of Islamic lunar months. These depend solely on sighting the [[Hilal (crescent moon)|new crescent moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quran 2:185|url=http://quran.com/2/185}} , [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-2/verse-185/ Quran Surah Al-Baqara ( Verse 185 )]&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, the fasts of the month of [[Ramadan]] begin the morning after the crescent is sighted. That this day may vary in different parts of the world is well known in Islam. (See {{slink|Ramadan|Beginning}}.)

===Judaism===
{{Details|International date line in Judaism}}
The concept of an international date line in Jewish law is first mentioned by 12th-century decisors.&lt;ref name=kashrus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not until the introduction of improved transportation and communications systems in the 20th century that the question of an international date line truly became a question of practical Jewish law.{{refn|The fleeing of [[Jewish refugees]], including members of the [[Mir Yeshiva (Jerusalem)#Establishment in Jerusalem|Mir Yeshiva]], from the Nazis to China and Japan during World War II was a major impetus to the codification of this aspect of Jewish law. Many of the modern-era opinions cited in &lt;ref name=kashrus /&gt; and &lt;ref name=chabad /&gt; were produced in response to this situation.}}

As a practical matter, the conventional International Date Line—or another line in the Pacific Ocean close to it—serves as a ''de facto'' date line for purposes of Jewish law, at least in existing Jewish communities. For example, residents of the Jewish communities of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai].

However, there is not unanimity as to how Jewish law reaches that conclusion. For this reason, some authorities rule that certain aspects of Sabbath observance are required on Sunday (in Japan and New Zealand) or Friday (in Hawaii and French Polynesia) in addition to Saturday. Additionally, there are differences of opinion as to which day or days individual Jews traveling in the Pacific region away from established Jewish communities should observe Shabbat.&lt;ref name=kashrus /&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad /&gt;

For individuals crossing the date line, the change of calendar date influences some aspects of practice under Jewish law. Yet other aspects depend on an individual's experience of sunsets and sunrises to count days, notwithstanding the calendar date.&lt;ref name=kashrus /&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad /&gt;

==Cultural references and traditions==

===''The Island of the Day Before''===
The date line is a central factor in [[Umberto Eco]]'s book ''[[The Island of the Day Before]]'' (1994), in which the protagonist finds himself on a becalmed ship, with an island close at hand on the other side of the IDL. Unable to swim, the protagonist indulges in increasingly confused speculation regarding the physical, metaphysical and religious import of the date line.

===''Around the World in Eighty Days''===
The concept behind the IDL (though not the IDL itself, which did not yet exist) appears as a plot device in [[Jules Verne]]'s book ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (1873). The main protagonist, [[Phileas Fogg]], travels eastward around the world. He had bet with his friends that he could do it in 80 days. To win the wager, Fogg must return by 8:45&amp;nbsp;pm on Saturday, 21 December 1872. However, the journey suffers a series of delays and when Fogg reaches London, it's 8:50&amp;nbsp;pm on Friday, 20 December, although he believes it's Saturday, 21 December and that he has lost the wager by a margin of only five minutes. The next day, however, it is revealed that the day is Saturday, not Sunday, and Fogg arrives at his club just in time to win the bet. Verne explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In journeying eastward he [Fogg] had gone towards the sun, and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction. There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty degrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four hours—that is, the day unconsciously gained. In other words, while Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/103/103-h/103-h.htm Project Gutenberg, "Around the World in Eighty Days".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fogg had thought it was one day more than it actually was, because he had forgotten this simple fact. During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, the concept of a ''de jure'' International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware that it would be a day less than it used to be once he reached this line. Thus, the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a ''de facto'' date line did exist since the UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have noticed when he arrived to the US that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his clock in London time, despite the tips of his surroundings).

===Line-crossing ceremonies relating to the IDL===
{{See also|Line-crossing ceremony}}
Ceremonies aboard ships to mark a sailor's or passenger's first crossing of the Equator, as well as crossing the International Date Line, have been long-held traditions in navies and in other maritime services around the world.

==Mathematical description==
The need for a temporal discontinuity on the globe can be described mathematically as following from the [[Borsuk-Ulam Theorem]] in dimension 1: It is a [[topology|topological]] fact that there does not exist any [[continuous function|continuous]], [[Injective function|one-to-one function]] mapping from a ''circle'' onto an ''interval.''&lt;ref&gt;

'''Jean Galbraith''' (28 March 1906 – 2 January 1999) was an [[Australian]] [[Botany|botanist]], gardener, writer of children's books and poet.

Galbraith was born at Tyers, [[Gippsland]], where she lived for the rest of life. The family's sprawling native garden at their cottage "Dunedin" formed the backdrop to her first articles on growing native flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/03/19/2520819.htm Author Meredith Fletcher working on biography of Jean Galbraith ABC 19 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Galbraith joined the [[Field Naturalists Club of Victoria|Field Naturalist Club]] and began to train herself in botany. Despite her lack of formal qualifications, Galbraith became a highly respected botanist.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;Holmes, K., (1997) 'A literary gardener', ''Australian Garden History'', 9 (1), pp. 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt; She was counted an "important and influential woman gardener",&lt;ref&gt;Bev Roberts. Treasures of the State Library of Victoria 2003 Page158&lt;/ref&gt; and "natural successor" to [[Edna Walling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/galbraith-jean.html Obituary. The Sydney Morning Herald, 11 January 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Galbraith used the [[pseudonym]] "Correa" for her early works.&lt;ref&gt;John Arnold, John A. Hay, Sally Batten The bibliography of Australian literature, Volume 2 2001 p119&lt;/ref&gt; She first started writing at the age of 19, and was widely published from the age of 26. For 50 years she contributed monthly to two magazines, ''The Garden Lover'' and the ''Victorian Naturalist'', as well as occasional articles for ''[[The Age]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Trisha Dixon Under the Spell of the Ages: Australian Country Gardens 2007 p64&lt;/ref&gt; Galbraith collected some of her ''Garden Lover'' articles and published them in 1939 as ''Garden in a Valley'''.&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;

The species [[Prostanthera galbraithiae]] was named for Galbraith as co-discover of the species and advocate for its protection. In 1936 she donated the first wildflower sanctuary in Victoria, established by the Native Plants Preservation Society of Victoria at Tyers, near Traralgon in Victoria's [[LaTrobe Valley]].&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt; She was recipient of the 1970 [[Australian Natural History Medallion]]

In addition to poetry Galbraith also wrote the lyrics for hymns, such as "O Christ our Lord whose beauty"&lt;ref&gt;(set to music by Ian Hyndman) in ''Hymns from Christadelphian Conferences and Youth Conferences,1957-1984''&lt;/ref&gt; "She held a deep Christian ([[Christadelphian]]) faith which sustained her at all times".&lt;ref&gt;Helen I. Aston. ''Jean Galbraith 28 March 1906-2 January 1999 A Tribute''  The Victorian naturalist, Volumes 116-118 1999 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kame''' is a [[glacial landform]], an irregularly shaped [[hill]] or [[mound]] composed of [[sand]], [[gravel]] and [[till]] that accumulates in a depression on a retreating [[glacier]], and is then deposited on the land surface with further melting of the glacier. Kames are often associated with [[kettle (landform)|kettle]]s, and this is referred to as ''kame and kettle'' [[topography]]. The word ''kame'' is a variant of ''comb'' (''kame'', or ''kaim'' is the Old Scotch word for ''comb''), which has the meaning "crest" among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|kame}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geological term was introduced by [[Thomas Jamieson]] in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Goudie, Andrew|title=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|volume=vol. 2|year=2004|chapter=''Kame'' by Eric A. Colhoun|pages=581–582|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHRU_6nUSR4C&amp;pg=PA581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to White, "kames were formed by meltwater which deposited more or less washed material at irregular places in and along melting ice.  At places the material is very well washed and stratified; at others it is more poorly washed, with inclusions of till masses that fell from ice but were covered before they were completely washed.  Kame gravels thus tend to be variable and range from fine to coarse grained and even to cobbly and boulder."&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

With the melting of the glacier, streams carry [[sediment]] to glacial [[lake]]s, building kame [[river delta|delta]]s on top of the [[ice]].  However, with the continuous [[melting]] of the glacier, the kame delta eventually collapses onto the land surface, furthering the "kame and kettle" topography.

Kame terraces are frequently found along the side of a glacial [[valley]] and are stratified deposits of [[meltwater]] [[stream]]s flowing between the ice and the adjacent valley side.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=George|title=Glacial Geology of Northeastern Ohio, Ohio Geological Survey|date=1982|publisher=State of Ohio|location=Columbus|pages=18-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kame terraces tend to look like long flat benches, with a lot of pits on the surface made by kettles. They tend to slope downvalley with [[slope|gradients]] similar to the glacier surface along which they formed, and can sometimes be found paired on opposite sides of a valley. 

Kames are sometimes compared to [[drumlin]]s, but their formation is distinctively different. A drumlin is not originally shaped by meltwater, but by the ice itself and has a quite regular shape. It occurs in fine-grained material, such as [[clay]] or [[shale]], not in sands and gravels. And drumlins usually have concentric layers of material, as the ice successively plasters new layers in its movement.

==Examples==
{{Globalize|section|date=October 2016}}
Kames are not normally located in proximity to one another, however in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], numerous kames are found nearby, forming the [[Prosser Archaeological Site]]. The [[Fonthill Kame]] in southern [[Ontario]] is in a densely populated area. Examples can also be found in [[Wisconsin]] and at the [[Sims Corner Eskers and Kames|Sims Corner Eskers and Kames National Natural Landscape]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. They are also located in Mendon Ponds Park, SE of Rochester, NY. This park is on the National Registry of Natural Landmarks due to geological history &amp; presence of significant kames, eskers &amp; kettles.

In Ontario, there are two [[provincial park]]s, both designated as [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] category the [[nature reserve]]s, which were created to protect important and undisturbed kame features. They are [[Minnitaki Kames Provincial Park]] and [[Bonheur River Kame Provincial Park]].

Pyroclastic material with particles less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter is referred to as [[volcanic ash]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/images/pglossary/lapilli.php VHP Photo Glossary: Laplli] in USGS Photo Glossary of volcano terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Tephra.html How Volcanoes Work]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Accretionary Lapilli - geograph.org.uk - 831917.jpg|thumb|Accretionary lapilli in the [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[Stac Fada Member]] of the [[Torridonian]], of probable impact origin]]
Lapilli are spheroid-, teardrop-, dumbbell- or button-shaped droplets of molten or semi-molten [[lava]] ejected from a volcanic eruption that fall to earth while still at least partially molten.  These granules are not accretionary, but instead the direct result of liquid rock cooling as it travels through the air.

Lapilli [[tuff]]s are a very common form of volcanic rock typical of [[rhyolite]], [[andesite]] and [[dacite]] pyroclastic eruptions, where thick layers of lapilli can be deposited during a basal surge eruption.  Most lapilli tuffs which remain in ancient terrains are formed by the accumulation and ''welding'' of semi-molten lapilli into what is known as a [[Tuff#Welded tuff|welded tuff]].

The heat of the newly deposited volcanic pile tends to cause the semi-molten material to flatten out and then become welded. Welded tuff [[rock microstructure|textures]] are distinctive (termed ''[[eutaxitic]]''), with flattened lapilli, [[fiamme]], blocks and bombs forming oblate to discus-shaped forms within layers.  These rocks are quite indurated and tough, as opposed to non-welded lapilli tuffs, which are unconsolidated and easily [[eroded]].

===Accretionary lapilli===
Rounded [[tephra]] balls are called ''accretionary lapilli'' if they consist of [[volcanic ash]] particles.  Accretionary lapilli are formed in an eruption column or cloud by moisture or electrostatic forces, with the volcanic ash nucleating on some object and then accreting to it in layers before the accretionary lapillus falls from the cloud.  Accretionary lapilli are like volcanic hailstones that form by the addition of concentric layers of moist ash around a central nucleus.

This texture can be confused with [[spherulitic]] and [[axiolitic]] texture.

===Armoured (or cored) lapilli===
These lapilli are a variety of accretionary lapilli, though they contain lithic or crystal cores coated by rinds of coarse to fine ash.  Armoured lapilli only form in hydroclastic eruptions, where significant moisture is present.  The vapour column contains cohesive ash which sticks to particles within it.

The '''''Last Voices of World War 1''''' was a six-part series screened on [[History (UK TV channel)|The History Channel]] in the UK from Sunday 9 November 2008 to Sunday 14 December 2008 with a repeat during the week. Its initial episode was screened on [[Remembrance Sunday]] 2008. The series was made by Testimony Films.
*9 November 2008 - The Call to Arms
*16 November 2008 - The Battle of the Somme
*23 November 2008 - Saving the Wounded
*30 November 2008 - Horror in the Mud
*7 December 2008 - The Home Front
*14 December 2008 - The Boys of 1918

The show featured interviews shot by Steve Humphries and [[Richard van Emden]] in the early 1990s with many of the then surviving veterans who were, at that stage, well into their 90s. All of these veterans have subsequently died.

[[Harry Patch]] appeared in episodes 4 and 6, [[Henry Allingham]] appeared in episode 4. [[George Littlefair]] of the Durham Light Infantry appeared in episode 1.

The series was narrated by the actress [[Nimmy March]].

The series was screened by [[Channel 4]] in the UK daily from 2 November 2009.

The music for this series is called "Passage of Time" and was written by Terry Devine-King.

A '''lava cone''' is a type of [[volcano]] composed primarily of viscous lava flows. The [[volcanic cone]] can contain a convex profile due to the flank flows of viscous lava.

==Locations==
Lava cones are nearly unique to [[Bougainville Island]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], within the [[Melanesia]] subregion of [[Oceania]].

However, an unnamed group of seven lava cones is located in the Obul-Samarask upland of southern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], in [[Western Asia]]. The cones are early [[Pleistocene]] to [[Holocene]] in age. Many of the craters have a well-preserved morphology. The tallest is {{convert|3400|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/georgia/unnamed-volcano2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light''' is [[electromagnetic radiation]] within a certain portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The word usually refers to '''visible light''', which is the [[visible spectrum]] that is visible to the [[human eye]] and is responsible for the sense of [[visual perception|sight]].&lt;ref&gt;[[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] (1987). [http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html ''International Lighting Vocabulary'']. Number 17.4. CIE, 4th edition. {{ISBN|978-3-900734-07-7}}.&lt;br&gt;By the ''International Lighting Vocabulary'', the definition of ''light'' is: “Any radiation capable of causing a visual sensation directly.”&lt;/ref&gt; Visible light is usually defined as having [[wavelength]]s in the range of 400–700 [[nanometre]]s (nm), or 4.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; to 7.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m, between the [[infrared]] (with longer wavelengths) and the [[ultraviolet]] (with shorter wavelengths).&lt;ref name="Pal2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pal |first1=G.

The main source of light on Earth is the [[Sun]]. [[Sunlight]] provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of [[photosynthesis]] provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of [[electric light]]s and [[history of electric power transmission|power systems]], electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates, and vampire squids use it to hide themselves from prey.

The primary properties of visible light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], propagation direction, frequency or wavelength [[spectrum]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], while its [[speed of light|speed]] in a vacuum, 299,792,458 metres per second, is one of the fundamental [[Mathematical constant|constants]] of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum.&lt;ref name=LeClerq&gt;{{Cite book |last=Uzan |first=J-P |last2=Leclercq |first2=B |year=2008 |title=The Natural Laws of the Universe: Understanding Fundamental Constants |journal=The Natural Laws of the Universe: Understanding Fundamental Constants |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSAWX8TNpScC&amp;pg=PA43 |pages=43–4 |isbn=978-0-387-73454-5|bibcode=2008nlu..book.....U |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74081-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], the term ''light'' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Camera lenses: from box camera to digital |author=Gregory Hallock Smith |publisher=SPIE Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8194-6093-6 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6mb0C0cFCEYC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Comprehensive Physics XII |author=Narinder Kumar |publisher=Laxmi Publications |year=2008 |isbn=978-81-7008-592-8 |page=1416 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IryMtwHHngIC&amp;pg=PA1416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[microwave]]s and [[radio wave]]s are also light. Like all types of EM radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon, and represents the quanta of light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location, and this location is where the photon "arrives." This is what is called the [[wave function collapse]]. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the [[wave–particle duality]]. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics.

==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==
[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|The [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with the [[visible spectrum|visible portion]] highlighted]]
{{Main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}

Generally, EM radiation (the designation "radiation" excludes static electric, magnetic, and [[near and far field|near fields]]), or EMR, is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], the [[visible spectrum]] that we perceive as [[light]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.

The behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.

EMR in the visible light region consists of quanta (called [[photon]]s) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule [[retinal]] in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.

There exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. [[Infrared sensing in snakes]] depends on a kind of natural [[thermal imaging]], in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.

Above the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 [[nanometer|nm]] and the internal lens below 400 nm. Furthermore, the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] located in the [[retina]] of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360&amp;nbsp;nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.

Various sources define visible light as narrowly as 420–680&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laufer |first=Gabriel |title=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |journal=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MxLPYMS5TUC&amp;pg=PA11 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=13 July 1996 |isbn=978-0-521-45233-5 |page=11|bibcode=1996iole.book.....L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradt2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradt |first=Hale |title=Astronomy Methods: A Physical Approach to Astronomical Observations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp7vyaGvhLMC&amp;pg=PA26 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-53551-9 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; to as broadly as 380–800&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="OhannesianStreeter2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ohannesian |first1=Lena |last2=Streeter |first2=Anthony |title=Handbook of Pharmaceutical Analysis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwPb4wgqseYC&amp;pg=PA187 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=9 November 2001 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-4194-5 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AhluwaliaGoyal2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ahluwalia |first1=V.

Plant growth is also affected by the color spectrum of light, a process known as [[photomorphogenesis]].

== Speed of light ==
{{Main|Speed of light}}

The speed of light in a [[vacuum]] is defined to be exactly 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;[[Metre per second|m/s]] (approx. 186,282 miles per second). The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the metre is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.

Different [[physicist]]s have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by [[Ole Rømer]], a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a [[telescope]], Rømer observed the motions of [[Jupiter]] and one of its [[natural satellite|moons]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of [[Earth]]'s orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.ss/1009212817 |title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light |journal=Statistical Science |year=2000 |volume=15 |pages=254–278 |issue=3 |doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817 |mr=1847825|last1=Oldford |first1=R. W |last2=MacKay |first2=R. J }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its size was not known at that time. If Rømer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000&amp;nbsp;m/s.

Another, more accurate, measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [[cog wheel]] was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000&amp;nbsp;m/s.

[[Léon Foucault]] carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000&amp;nbsp;m/s in 1862. [[Albert A. Michelson]] conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] to [[Mount San Antonio]] in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Michelson, |first=A. A. |title=Measurements of the velocity of light between Mount Wilson and Mount  San Antonio |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=January 1927 |volume=65 |pages=1 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1927ApJ....65....1M |accessdate=12 March 2014 |doi=10.1086/143021 |bibcode=1927ApJ....65....1M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary [[matter]], is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.

Two independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a "complete standstill" by passing it through a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the other at the [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Researchers now able to stop, restart light |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=2001-01-24 |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028041346/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |archivedate=28 October 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the popular description of light being "stopped" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had "stopped" it had ceased to be light.

==Optics==
{{Main|Optics}}

The study of light and the interaction of light and [[matter]] is termed [[optics]]. The observation and study of [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] such as [[rainbow]]s and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] offer many clues as to the nature of light.

===Refraction===
{{Main|Refraction}}
[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|250 px|An example of refraction of light. The straw appears bent, because of refraction of light as it enters liquid from air.]]
[[File:Cloud in the sunlight.jpg|thumb|250px|A cloud illuminated by [[sunlight]]]]

Refraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by [[Snell's Law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2\ .&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the angle between the ray and the [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]] in the first medium, &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium, and n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[index of refraction|indices of refraction]], ''n'' = 1 in a [[vacuum]] and ''n'' &gt; 1 in a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[Chemical substance|substance]].

When a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as [[refraction]].

The refractive quality of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. [[Magnifying glass]]es, [[Glasses|spectacles]], [[contact lens]]es, [[microscope]]s and [[refracting telescope]]s are all examples of this manipulation.

==Light sources== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Source]] --&gt;
{{Further|List of light sources}}
There are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of [[black-body]] radiation. A simple thermal source is [[sunlight]], the radiation emitted by the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]] at around  {{convert|6,000|K|C F|abbr=off}} peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&amp;%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf |format=PDF |title=Spectrum and the Color Sensitivity of the Eye |website=Thulescientific.com |accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance:  Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in [[fire|flames]], but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.

The peak of the blackbody spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 [[micrometre]] wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal is heated to "red hot" or "white hot". Blue-white [[thermal emission]] is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a [[natural gas|gas]] flame or a [[Welding|welder's]] torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425&amp;nbsp;nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).

Atoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces "[[emission line]]s" in the spectrum of each atom. [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] can be [[spontaneous emission|spontaneous]], as in [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[gas discharge]] lamps (such as [[neon lamp]]s and [[neon sign]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself—so, for example, [[sodium]] in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be [[stimulated emission|stimulated]], as in a [[laser]] or a microwave [[maser]].

Deceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [[electron]], can produce visible radiation: [[cyclotron radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], and [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible [[Cherenkov radiation]]. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by [[chemoluminescence]]. In living things, this process is called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[firefly|fireflies]] produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.

Certain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as [[fluorescence]]. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as [[phosphorescence]]. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. [[Cathodoluminescence]] is one example. This mechanism is used in [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s.

[[File:Colorful artificial lighting at night.jpg|thumb|250px|A city illuminated by colorful [[lighting|artificial lighting]]]]

Certain other mechanisms can produce light:
* [[Bioluminescence]]
* [[Cherenkov radiation]]
* [[Electroluminescence]]
* [[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillation]]
* [[Sonoluminescence]]
* [[Triboluminescence]]

When the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:
* Particle–[[antiparticle]] annihilation
* [[Radioactive decay]]

==Units and measures==
{{Main|Photometry (optics)|Radiometry}}

Light is measured with two main alternative sets of units: [[radiometry]] consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardised model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify [[Illumination (lighting)]] intended for human use.  The SI units for both systems are summarised in the following tables.

{{SI radiometry units|1|self|nb}}&lt;!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group --&gt;
{{SI light units|2|self|nb}}&lt;!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group --&gt;

The photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The [[cone cell]]s in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555&amp;nbsp;nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how "bright" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw [[power (physics)|power]] by a quantity called [[luminous efficacy]], and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a [[photocell]] sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD) tend to respond to some [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] or both.

==Light pressure==
{{Main|Radiation pressure}}
Light exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by ''[[speed of light|c]]'', the speed of light.{{nbsp}} Due to the magnitude of ''c'', the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.{{nbsp}} For example, a one-milliwatt [[laser pointer]] exerts a force of about 3.3 [[newton (unit)|piconewtons]] on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]] with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tang |first=Hong |title=May The Force of Light Be With You |journal=IEEE Spectrum |date=1 October 2009 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=46–51 |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5268000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nbsp}} However, in [[nanometre]]-scale applications such as [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.eng.yale.edu/tanglab/research.htm nano-opto-mechanical systems research at Yale University].&lt;/ref&gt; At larger scales, light pressure can cause [[asteroid]]s to spin faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/feb/asteroids-get-spun-by-the-sun/ |title=Asteroids Get Spun By the Sun |author=Kathy A. |website=Discover Magazine |date=2004-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a [[windmill]].{{nbsp}} The possibility of making [[solar sail]]s that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/solar_sails.html |title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space |website=[[NASA]] |date=2004-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2004/04-208.html |title=NASA team successfully deploys two solar sail systems |website=NASA |date=2004-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the motion of the [[Crookes radiometer]] was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;P. Lebedev, Untersuchungen über die Druckkräfte des Lichtes, Ann. Phys. 6, 433 (1901).&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with the [[Nichols radiometer]], in which the (slight) motion caused by torque (though not enough for full rotation against friction) ''is'' directly caused by light pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nichols |first=E.F |last2=Hull |first2=G.F. |year=1903 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8n8OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA327&amp;dq=torsion+balance+radiation |title=The Pressure due to Radiation |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=17 |pages=315–351 |issue=5 |bibcode=1903ApJ....17..315N |doi=10.1086/141035}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a consequence of light pressure, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Einstein, A. |title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation. Translated in: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, vol. 2 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1989) |date=1909 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1909 predicted the existence of "radiation friction" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, “radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.”

==Historical theories about light, in chronological order==

===Classical Greece and Hellenism===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
In the fifth century BC, [[Empedocles]] postulated that everything was composed of [[Classical element|four elements]]; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that [[Aphrodite]] made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fundamentals of Optical Engineering |last=Singh |first=S. |year=2009 |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |isbn=9788183564366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 300 BC, [[Euclid]] wrote ''Optica'', in which he studied the properties of light. Euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically. He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one closes one's eyes, then opens them at night. If the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Light_1.html |title=Light through the ages: Ancient Greece to Maxwell |last=O'Connor |first=J J |last2=Robertson |first2=E F |date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 55 BC, [[Lucretius]], a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek [[atomism|atomists]], wrote that "The light &amp; heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove." (from ''On the nature of the Universe''). Despite being similar to later particle theories, Lucretius's views were not generally accepted. [[Ptolemy]] (c. 2nd century) wrote about the [[refraction]] of light in his book ''Optics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ptolemy's Theory of Visual Perception: An English Translation of the Optics with Introduction and Commentary |author=Ptolemy and A. Mark Smith |publisher=Diane Publishing |year=1996 |page=23 |isbn=978-0-87169-862-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical India===
In [[Science and technology in ancient India|ancient India]], the [[Hindu]] schools of [[Samkhya]] and [[Vaisheshika]], from around the early centuries AD developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental "subtle" elements (''tanmatra'') out of which emerge the gross elements. The [[atomism|atomicity]] of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous.&lt;ref name="sifuae.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sifuae.com/sif/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Shastra-Pratibha-2015-Seniors-Booklet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Shastra Pratibha 2015 Seniors Booklet |website=Sifuae.com |accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, the Vaisheshika school gives an [[atomic theory]] of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], space and time. (See ''[[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]]''.) The basic atoms are those of earth (''prthivi''), water (''pani''), fire (''agni''), and air (''vayu'') Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of ''tejas'' (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the ''tejas'' atoms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
The ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' refers to [[sunlight]] as "the seven rays of the sun".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name="sifuae.com"/&gt;

The Indian [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dignāga]] in the 5th century and [[Dharmakirti]] in the 7th century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name="sifuae.com"/&gt;

===Descartes===
[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) held that light was a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]] property of the luminous body, rejecting the "forms" of [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Witelo]] as well as the "species" of [[Roger Bacon#Legacy|Bacon]], [[Grosseteste]], and [[Kepler]].&lt;ref name="Theoriesof"&gt;''Theories of light, from Descartes to Newton'' A. I. Sabra CUP Archive,1981 pg 48 {{ISBN|0-521-28436-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28436-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1637 he published a theory of the [[refraction]] of light that assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media.

Descartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes' theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.&lt;ref name="Theoriesof" /&gt;

===Particle theory===
{{Main|Corpuscular theory of light}}
[[File:PierreGassendi.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Pierre Gassendi]].]]
[[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592–1655), an atomist, proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s.  [[Isaac Newton]] studied Gassendi's work at an early age, and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the ''plenum''. He stated in his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675 that light was composed of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the [[diffraction]] of light (which had been observed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]]) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].

Newton's theory could be used to predict the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light, but could only explain [[refraction]] by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser [[Medium (optics)|medium]] because the [[gravity|gravitational]] pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704. His reputation helped the [[particle theory of light]] to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led [[Laplace]] to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [[black hole]]. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in ''The large scale structure of space-time,'' by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis]].

The fact that light could be [[polarized light|polarized]] was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.

=== Wave theory ===
To explain the origin of colors, [[Robert Hooke]] (1635-1703) developed a "pulse theory" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]'' ("Observation IX"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be [[perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629-1695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678, and published it in his ''[[Treatise on light]]'' in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the ''[[Luminiferous ether]]''.  As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.&lt;ref&gt;Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the 17th Century], Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4020-2697-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|200 px|[[Christiaan Huygens]].]]

[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s sketch of a [[double-slit experiment]] showing [[diffraction]]. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.]]

The wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]). Young showed by means of a [[double-slit experiment|diffraction experiment]] that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different [[color|colours]] were caused by different [[wavelength]]s of light, and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was [[Leonhard Euler]]. He argued in ''Nova theoria lucis et colorum'' (1746) that [[diffraction]] could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 [[André-Marie Ampère]] gave [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a [[transverse wave]].&lt;ref&gt;James R. Hofmann, ''André-Marie Ampère: Enlightenment and Electrodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light, and presented it to the [[Académie des Sciences]] in 1817. [[Siméon Denis Poisson]] added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favour of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}&lt;!-- [[Siméon Denis Poisson]] says he was an opponent of the theory --&gt; By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarisation could be explained by the wave theory of light and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance ''luminiferous aether'' proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]].

Newton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the [[speed of light]] could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [[Léon Foucault]], in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Understanding Physics |author1=David Cassidy |author2=Gerald Holton |author3=James Rutherford |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&amp;pg=PA382}}&lt;/ref&gt; His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.

===Electromagnetic theory ===
{{Main|Electromagnetic radiation}}
[[File:light-wave.svg|360px|thumb|A 3–dimensional rendering of [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarised]] light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light; an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a [[transverse wave]]).]]

In 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that the plane of polarisation of linearly polarised light is rotated when the light rays travel along the [[magnetic field]] direction in the presence of a transparent [[dielectric]], an effect now known as [[Faraday rotation]].&lt;ref name="LongairMalcolm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Longair |first=Malcolm |title=Theoretical Concepts in Physics |year=2003 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first evidence that light was related to [[electromagnetism]]. In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines.&lt;ref name="LongairMalcolm" /&gt; Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Faraday's work inspired [[James Clerk Maxwell]] to study electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in ''On Physical Lines of Force''. In 1873, he published ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which contained a full mathematical description of the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, still known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. Soon after, [[Heinrich Hertz]] confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.

In the quantum theory, photons are seen as [[wave packet]]s of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as [[spectral line]]s).

===Quantum theory===
In 1900 [[Max Planck]], attempting to explain [[black body radiation]] suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these "lumps" of light energy "quanta" (from a Latin word for "how much"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], and suggested that these light quanta had a "real" existence. In 1923 [[Arthur Holly Compton]] showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called [[Compton scattering]]) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] named these light quanta particles [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Open Access}} {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToMolecularSpectroscopy |title=Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy |last=Barrow |first=Gordon M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1962 |format=Scanned PDF |lccn=62-12478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] came to picture light as (in some sense) ''both'' a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is ''neither'' a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.

In February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve [[polariton]]s, that could be useful in the development of [[quantum computer]]s.&lt;ref name="NW-20180216"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hignett |first=Katherine |title=Physics Creates New Form Of Light That Could Drive The Quantum Computing Revolution |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photons-light-physics-808862 |date=16 February 2018 |website=[[Newsweek]] |accessdate=17 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20180216"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liang, Qi-Yu et al. |title=Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/783 |date=16 February 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=359 |issue=6377 |pages=783–786 |doi=10.1126/science.aao7293 |pmid=29449489 |accessdate=17 February 2018 |arxiv=1709.01478 |bibcode=2018Sci...359..783L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7371">A '''limiting factor''' is a variable of a system that, if subject to a small change, causes a non-negligible change in an output or other measure of the system. A factor not limiting over a certain [[Domain of a function|domain]] of starting conditions may yet be limiting over another domain of starting conditions, including that of the factor.

==Overview==
The identification of a factor as limiting only in distinction to one or more other factors that are non-limiting. Disciplines differ in their use of the term as to whether they allow the simultaneous existence of more than one limiting factor (which may then be called "co-limiting"), but they all require the existence of at least one non-limiting factor when the terms are used.  There are several different possible scenarios of limitation when more than one factor is present.  The first scenario, called ''single limitation'' occurs when only one factor, the one with maximum demand, limits the system.  ''Serial co-limitation'' is when one factor has no direct limiting effects on the system, but must be present to increase the limitation of a second factor. A third scenario, ''independent limitation,'' occurs when two factors both have limiting effects on the system but work through different mechanisms.  Another scenario, ''synergistic limitation,'' occurs when both factors contribute to the same limitation mechanism, but in different ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ecology==
In ''ecology'', common limiting factor [[Resource (biology)|resources]] are environmental conditions that limit the growth, abundance, or distribution of an organism or a population of organisms in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=TMS&gt;Thomas M. Smith., Robert Leo Smith. 2009. Or simply,  Limiting factors are things that prevent a population from growing any large. ''Elements of Ecology''. Pearson International Edition. 7th Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|G-11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Limiting_factor|title=Limiting factor - Biology-Online Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of limiting factors is based on ''[[Liebig's Law]] of the Minimum,'' which states that growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource. In other words, a factor is limiting if a change in the factor produces increased growth, abundance, or distribution of an organism, when other factors necessary to the organisms life do not. Limiting factors may be physical or biological.&lt;ref name=TMS/&gt;{{rp|417,8}}

Limiting factors are not limited to the condition of the species. Some factors may be increased or reduced based on circumstances. An example of a limiting factor is [[sunlight]] in the [[rain forest]], where growth is limited to all plants on the [[forest floor]] unless more light becomes available. This decreases a number of potential factors that could influence a biological process, but only one is in effect at any one place and time. This recognition that there is always a ''single'' limiting factor is vital in [[ecology]]; and the concept has parallels in numerous other processes. The limiting factor also causes [[competition]] between individuals of a species population. For example, [[space]] is a limiting factor. Many predators and prey need a certain amount of space for survival: food, water, and other biological needs. If the population of a species is too high, they start competing for those needs. Thus the limiting factors hold down population in an area by causing some individuals to seek better prospects elsewhere and others to stay and starve. Some other limiting factors in biology include [[temperature]] and other [[weather]] related factors. Species can also be limited by the availability of macro- and micronutrients.  There has even been evidence of co-limitation in prairie ecosystems.  A study published in 2017 showed that sodium (a micronutrient) had no effect on its own, but when in combination with nitrogen and phosphorus (macronutrients), it did show positive effects, which is evidence of serial co-limitation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspari|first=Michael|last2=Roeder|first2=Karl A.|last3=Benson|first3=Brittany|last4=Weiser|first4=Michael D.|last5=Sanders|first5=Nathan J.|date=2017-02-01|title=Sodium co-limits and catalyzes macronutrients in a prairie food web|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=98|issue=2|pages=315–320|doi=10.1002/ecy.1677|pmid=27936500|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other limiting factors may be cubic feet of display or warehouse space, or working capital."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=AllBusiness Business Glossary|title=Business definition for: Limiting (constraining) factor|accessdate=April 28, 2013|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/constraining-limiting-factor/4949815-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also frequently used in technology literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Sheriff, A., Bouchlaghem, D., El-Hamalawi, A., and Yeomans, S. |year=2012|title=Information Management in UK-Based Architecture and Engineering Organizations: Drivers, Constraining Factors, and Barriers|journal=Journal of Management Engineering|volume =28 |issue =2|pages= 170–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Institutional Factors in Information Technology Innovation|authors=

The analysis of limiting business factors is part of the [[program evaluation and review technique]], [[critical path analysis]], and [[theory of constraints]] as presented in the novel ''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]''.

In the design of [[chemical reaction]]s to produce a chemical product, one of the reagents may be consumed by the reaction before the others. The amount of product is limited by the supply of this reagent. This [[limiting reagent]] determines the theoretical [[Yield (chemistry)|yield]] of the reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30714">The following is a list of [[rhododendron]] cultivars and species which have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]. They are mostly [[Hardiness (plants)|hardy]] evergreen [[shrubs]] with abundant, brilliantly-coloured, trumpet-shaped flowers, often in large spherical trusses. The group known as [[azalea]]s are often (but not always) more compact with smaller flowers and leaves, and may be [[evergreen]] ([[subgenus]] ''[[Rhododendron subg. Tsutsuji|Tsutsuji]]'') or [[deciduous]] (subgenus ''[[Rhododendron subg. Pentanthera|Pentanthera]]''). Most rhododendrons bloom for a short period in late spring (April to May in the [[temperateness|temperate]] Northern Hemisphere). They are seen at their best in a woodland setting with light dappled shade, in [[humus]]-rich [[soil pH|acid soil]].&lt;ref name=RHSAZ&gt;{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16515">This is a '''list of recently extinct flora of Australia''', that is plants that are considered to have become extinct since the European colonisation of [[Australia]] in 1788. Within Australia there are mechanisms for registering an extinction at the federal, state and territory levels. Federal and state listings may vary due to [[Local extinction|regional extinctions]] or because of differing definitions of extinction in the various pieces of legislation.

==Plants listed as extinct by the federal government==
Plants and animals are listed as extinct and the federal level under the auspices of the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].

'''Mare Frigoris''' (the "Sea of Cold") is a [[lunar mare]] in the far north of the [[Moon]]. It is located in the outer rings of the [[Procellarum basin]], just north of [[Mare Imbrium]], and stretches east to north of [[Mare Serenitatis]]. It is just north of the dark crater [[Plato (crater)|Plato]].

==Geology==
The basin material surrounding the mare is of the [[Lower Imbrian]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], while the eastern mare material is of the [[Upper Imbrian]] epoch, and the western mare material is of the [[Eratosthenian]] epoch.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==History==
One of the first images from a spacecraft of the sea were done by the [[Luna program]] of the 1950s and later NASA's [[Lunar Orbiter]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions of the 1960s and the 1970s.  In December 1992, [[Galileo spacecraft]] took a picturie during its flyby of the Moon through a violet filter.  It includes the surrounding features of [[J. Herschel (crater)|J. Herschel]], [[Pythagoras (crater)|Pythagoras]] and a few others.  It was featured in the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) on July 31, 1996 titled A Violet Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960731.html|title=A Violet Moon|publisher=Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)|date=July 31, 1996|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Frigoris was named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] had included it among the Insula Borealis ("Northern Island") in his map of ''c''.1600,&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Van Langren]] had labelled it the Mare Astronomicum ("Sea of Astronomy") in his 1645 map.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.41, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Gassendi]] called it the Boreum Mare ('Northern Sea').&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==View==

This regional view is nearly orthogonal at top but highly oblique at bottom, and north is up and slightly to the right.  Mare Frigoris is the dark band extending from upper left to lower right.  [[Mare Imbrium]] and [[Sinus Iridum]] are in lower left.

==In popular culture==

This area of the Moon featured prominently in 'Behemoth', the second episode of the 1973 BBC science fiction mini-series ''[[Moonbase 3]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The '''Mist lift''', '''Mist flow''' or '''Steam lift''' pump is a [[gas lift]] technique of lifting water used in a form of [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion]] (OTEC) where water falls to operate a hydro-electric turbine.  The water is pumped from the level it drops to using rising steam which is combined into a [[Multiphase heat transfer|multiphase]] flow.&lt;ref name=compact_patent&gt;{{ citation | country-code = US | patent-number = 4441321| description =patent  | title = Compact mist flow power generator | publication-date = 1984-04-10 | inventor-first = Stuart L. | inventor-last = Ridgway  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Independent of energy production, the technique can be used simply as a thermally powered pump used to raise ocean water from depths for unspecified uses.&lt;ref name=ball_patent&gt;{{ citation | country-code = US | patent-number = 4603553| description =patent  | title = Ballistic cold water pipe | publication-date = 1984-12-11 | inventor-first = Stuart L. | inventor-last = Ridgway  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
As in other open cycle OTEC schemes, the technique involves boiling seawater under low atmospheric pressure.  The scheme can take many forms so for illustration a particular form will be described and a section below will list details of alternate forms.  
The prerequisite for mist lift is that a significant thermal gradient exists.  Typically warm surface water is expected to be near {{convert|25|C|F}}.  Cold water from depth needs to be in the vicinity of {{convert|5|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=zener82&gt;{{citation |title=Periodic explosions by positive feedback in a rising foam column |last1= Zener |first1= Clarence |last2= Noriega |first2= Jaime | journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=79 |pages= 3384–3386 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/79/10/3384.full.pdf |format=pdf |date= May 1982 |accessdate= June 2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.79.10.3384|bibcode=1982PNAS...79.3384Z |pmc=346420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1980_patent&gt;{{ citation | country-code = US | patent-number = 4216657 | description =patent  | title = Mist flow ocean thermal energy process | publication-date = 1980-08-12 | inventor-first = Stuart L. | inventor-last = Ridgway  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common set of embodiments uses a floating concrete vessel most of which is submerged below the surface.  Large volumes of warm surface seawater fall by gravity from a substantial height such as {{convert|100|m|ft}} to generate electricity from a [[Water turbine|hydro-electric turbine]] at the base of the structure.  "Mist lift" gets its name by the gas lift technique used to pump the water back out of the structure.  Due to the partial vacuum within the structure, warm sea water from the surface boils, creating large volumes of rising steam. {{convert|10|m|ft}} to 20 metres up, jets of cold sea water are sprayed upwards into the vapor, rapidly contracting it and thereby creating significantly lower pressure at the top of the structure than at the base.  This causes the multi-phase steam-water "mist" to be lifted with great velocity to the top of the structure where it exits.&lt;ref name=compact_patent/&gt;&lt;ref name=otecnews05&gt;{{citation|first1=Stuart L.|last1=Ridgway|url=http://www.otecnews.org/articles/mistlift.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226170157/http://www.otecnews.org/articles/mistlift.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 December 2005|title=Out of Gas? Refuel with Mist lift Ocean Thermal Energy|publisher=OTEC News|date=19 April 2005|accessdate=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of variations==
*In land based forms, water is lifted up a tower, and the water falls to drive the turbine.&lt;ref name=compact_patent/&gt; 
*Multiphase flow can overcome friction problems of cylinder designs if the jet of cold liquid is sent upwards through the center of cylinder. The contracted vapor is pulled towards the center of the cylinder, reducing contact between higher density portions of the flow and the walls of the cylinder.&lt;ref name=ball_patent/&gt;
*The height of the structure can vary greatly, with larger heights correlated with greater power outputs. The original Ridgway patent called for a structure of {{convert|50|m|ft}}.  
*Similar to air lift pumps, the multiphase flow can take the form not only of a mist, but a frothy mix of bubbles as envisioned by Earl Beck &lt;ref name=beck2001&gt;{{ citation | country-code = US | patent-number = 6202417 | description =patent  | title = Ocean thermal gradient hydraulic power plant | publication-date = 2001-03-20 | inventor-first = Earl J.  | inventor-last = Beck  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bubble laden multiphase flows tend to burst their bubbles as they rise, reducing performance of the pump.  This effect can be reduced through use of a foaming agent such as a detergent as proposed by Zener and Fetkovich&lt;ref name=zener82 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Zener|first1=Clarence |last2=Fetkovich |first2=John |title=Foam Solar Sea Power Plant |journal=Science |volume=
189 |number=4199 |date=25 July 1975 |pages=294–5 |doi=10.1126/science.189.4199.294 |pmid=17813708|bibcode=1975Sci...189..294Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The lift can be separated into two lift stages which theoretically can generate 800 kilowatts per cubic meter per second of cold water.&lt;ref name=otecnews05/&gt;

Details common in Ridgway designs
*A vacuum pump maintains a pressure of {{convert|2400|Pa|psi}} at the base of the structure. 
*The cold water jets create a lower pressure of {{convert|1200|Pa|psi}} mid way up the structure.  
*Input water is filtered and [[Aerated water|de-aerated]] to remove gases in order to improve boiling performance.&lt;ref name=1980_patent /&gt;
*Mist droplets in the range of 200 micrometres can be lifted up to 50 meters by their own vapor generated from flashing.&lt;ref name=jsee&gt;{{citation|journal=Journal of Solar Energy Engineering |last1=Lee |first1= C. K. B. |last2= Ridgway |first2= Stuart |title=Vapor/Droplet Coupling and the Mist Flow (OTEC) Cycle |volume=105 |date= May 1983 |url=http://library.greenocean.org/oteclibrary/otecdesigns/mistliftotec/vapor_mistlift_otec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design issues==
* If the turbine occurs in the process after the water is mist lifted, there can be a large number of micro bubbles which could cause excessive [[cavitation]] of the turbine rotor.&lt;ref name=beck2001 /&gt;
* If a submerged structure is used, the cost of the submerged chamber could represent up to 40 percent of the plant cost due to the strength and volume required.  A large volume chamber is necessary for high velocity flows to rise without excessive friction.  If the structure is high volume and is submerged 100 meters, it must be strong enough to hold back the weight of the ocean at that depth.&lt;ref name=ball_patent/&gt;

==Cost evaluation==
Mist Lift utilizing thermal temperature differences does not require large pumps and heat exchangers as in other types of OTEC.   In closed systems, the expense of the exchangers represents the largest cost of the OTEC plant, with a 100MW plant requiring 200 exchangers the size of 20 foot shipping containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Comparison Of Aluminum Alloys And Manufacturing Processes Based On Corrosion Performance For Use In OTEC Heat Exchangers|last1=Eldred|first1=M. |last2=Landherr |first2= A. |last3=Chen |first3=I.C. |doi=10.4043/20702-MS | url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=OTC-20702-MS | title= Offshore Technology Conference 2010 (OTC 2010) |publisher= Curran Associates, Inc.  | isbn=9781617384264 | date= July 2010 |accessdate= May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Makai Ocean Engineering was contracted to construct computer models to evaluate whether a Mist lift power generation plant would be competitive with the dominant OTEC approaches being pursued by researchers.  The study estimated that a Mist lift power generation plant could be 17% to 37% cheaper than a closed cycle plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/RecipientReportedData/pages/RecipientProjectSummary508.aspx?AwardIdSur=91379 |title=Recovery.gov award summary: Makai Ocean Engineering July 1 - September 30, 2011. |accessdate=May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214180903/http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/RecipientReportedData/pages/RecipientProjectSummary508.aspx?AwardIdSur=91379 |archivedate=December 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In submerged mist flow plants, close to 40% of the cost is devoted to creating a strong enough pressure vessel.&lt;ref name=ball_patent/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="855">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Othreis''' was a [[nymph]] who consorted with both [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]] and became by them mother of Meliteus and Phager respectively.

When Meliteus was born, Othreis, in fear of [[Hera]]'s wrath, exposed the child. The boy, however, was nurtured by bees and thus survived. He was soon found by his half-brother Phager, who was pasturing his sheep in the neighborhood. Impressed with the child being nurtured in such a marvelous way, as well as having reckoned a prophecy that told him to take care of his relative nourished by bees, Phager adopted and raised Meliteus. When Meliteus grew up, he founded the city Melite in [[Phthia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rifting to Spreading Transition.jpg|thumb|Rifting-to-spreading transition]]
[[File:Passive Contiental Margin.jpg|thumb|Passive continental margin]]
A '''passive margin''' is the transition between [[oceanic lithosphere|oceanic]] and [[continental lithosphere]] that is not an active plate [[Continental margin|margin]]. A passive margin forms by [[sedimentation]] above an ancient [[rift]], now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins. Eventually the continental rift forms a [[mid-ocean ridge]] and the locus of [[Extension (geology)|extension]] moves away from the [[continent-ocean boundary]]. The transition between the continental and oceanic lithosphere that was originally created by rifting is known as a passive margin.

==Global distribution==
[[Image:globald.png|right|thumb|250 px|Map showing the distribution of Earth's passive margins (yellow swaths).]] Passive margins are found at every ocean and continent boundary that is not marked by a strike-slip fault or a subduction zone. Passive margins define the region around the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Arctic Ocean]], and western [[Indian Ocean]], and define the entire coasts of [[Africa]], [[Greenland]], [[India]] and [[Australia]]. They are also found on the east coast of [[North America]] and [[South America]], in western [[Europe]] and most of [[Antarctica]]. East [[Asia]] also contains some passive margins.

==Key components==

===Active vs. passive margins===
This refers to whether a crustal boundary between oceanic lithosphere and continental lithosphere is a [[tectonic plate|plate]] boundary or not. [[Convergent boundary|Active margins]] are found on the edge of a continent where subduction occurs. These are often marked by [[tectonic uplift|uplift]] and [[volcanic belt|volcanic mountain belts]] on the continental plate. Less often there is a strike-slip fault, as defines the southern coastline of W. [[Africa]]. Most of the eastern [[Indian Ocean]] and nearly all of the [[Pacific Ocean]] margin are examples of active margins. While a weld between oceanic and continental lithosphere is called a passive margin, it is not an inactive margin. Active subsidence, sedimentation, growth faulting, pore fluid formation and migration are all active processes on passive margins. Passive margins are only passive in that they are not active plate boundaries.

===Morphology===
[[Image:bathmetry.png|left|thumb|350px|Bathymetric profile across a typical passive margin. Note that vertical scale is greatly exaggerated relative to the horizontal scale.]] Passive margins consist of both onshore [[coastal plain]] and offshore [[continental shelf]]-slope-rise triads. Coastal plains are often dominated by fluvial processes, while the continental shelf is dominated by deltaic and longshore current processes. The great rivers ([[Amazon River|Amazon]]. [[Orinoco]], [[Congo River|Congo]], [[Nile]], [[Ganges]], [[Yellow]], [[Yangtze]], and [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie]] rivers) drain across passive margins. Extensive [[Estuary|estuaries]] are common on mature passive margins. Although there are many kinds of passive margins, the [[shape|morphologies]] of most passive margins are remarkably similar. Typically they consist of a continental shelf, continental slope, continental rise, and abyssal plain. The morphological expression of these features are largely defined by the underlying transitional crust and the [[sedimentation]] above it. Passive margins defined by a large fluvial sediment budget and those dominated by coral and other biogenous processes generally have a similar morphology. In addition, the shelf break seems to mark the maximum [[Neogene]] lowstand, defined by the glacial maxima. The outer continental shelf and slope may be cut by great [[submarine canyon]]s, which mark the offshore continuation of rivers.
At high latitudes and during glaciations, the nearshore morphology of passive margins may reflect glacial processes, such as the [[fjords]] of [[Norway]] and [[Greenland]].

[[Image:Volcanic passive margin.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Cross-section through transitional crust of a passive margin. Transitional crust as a largely volcanic construct. Note: vertical scale is greatly exaggerated relative to horizontal scale.]]
The main features of passive margins lie underneath the external characters. Beneath passive margins the transition between the continental and oceanic crust is a broad transition known as transitional crust. The subsided continental crust is marked by [[normal fault]]s that dip seaward. The faulted crust transitions into oceanic crust and may be deeply buried due to [[thermal subsidence]] and the mass of sediment that collects above it. The [[lithosphere]] beneath passive margins is known as transitional lithosphere. The lithosphere thins seaward as it transitions seaward to oceanic crust. Different kinds of transitional crust form, depending on how fast rifting occurs and how hot the underlying mantle was at the time of rifting. Volcanic passive margins represent one endmember transitional crust type, the other endmember (amagmatic) type is the rifted passive margin. Volcanic passive margins also are marked by numerous [[dyke (geology)|dykes]] and [[intrusion|igneous intrusions]] within the subsided continental crust. There are typically a lot of dykes formed perpendicular to the seaward-dipping lava flows and sills. Igneous intrusions within the crust cause lava flows along the top of the subsided continental crust and form seaward-dipping reflectors.

==Subsidence mechanisms==
Passive margins are characterized by thick accumulations of sediments. Space for these sediments is called accommodation and is due to subsidence of especially the transitional crust. Subsidence is ultimately caused by gravitational equilibrium that is established between the crustal tracts, known as [[isostasy]]. Isostasy controls the uplift of the rift flank and the subsequent subsidence of the evolving passive margin and is mostly reflected by changes in [[heat flow]]. Heat flow at passive margins changes significantly over its lifespan, high at the beginning and decreasing with age. In the initial stage, the continental crust and lithosphere is stretched and thinned due to plate movement ([[plate tectonics]]) and associated igneous activity. The very thin lithosphere beneath the rift allows the upwelling mantle to melt by decompression. Lithospheric thinning also allows the [[asthenosphere]] to rise closer to the surface, heating the overlying lithosphere by [[Heat conduction|conduction]] and [[advection]] of heat by intrusive dykes. Heating reduces the density of the lithosphere and elevates the lower crust and lithosphere. In addition, [[mantle plumes]] may heat the lithosphere and cause prodigious igneous activity. Once a mid-oceanic ridge forms and seafoor spreading begins, the original site of rifting is separated into conjugate passive margins (for example, the eastern US and NW African margins were parts of the same rift in early [[Mesozoic]] time and are now conjugate margins) and migrates away from the zone of mantle upwelling and heating and cooling begins. The mantle lithosphere below the thinned and faulted continental oceanic transition cools, thickens, increases in density and thus begins to subside. The accumulation of sediments above the subsiding transitional crust and lithosphere further depresses the transitional crust.

==Classification of passive margins==
There are four different perspectives needed to classify passive margins:
# map-view formation geometry (rifted, sheared, and transtensional),
# nature of transitional crust (volcanic and non-volcanic),
# whether the transitional crust represents a continuous change from normal continental to normal oceanic crust or this includes isolated rifts and stranded continental blocks (simple and complex), and
# sedimentation (carbonate-dominated, clastic-dominated, or sediment starved).

The first describes the relationship between rift orientation and plate motion, the second describes the nature of transitional crust, and the third describes post-rift sedimentation. All three perspectives need to be considered in describing a passive margin. In fact, passive margins are extremely long, and vary along their length in rift geometry, nature of transitional crust, and sediment supply; it is more appropriate to subdivide individual passive margins into segments on this basis and apply the threefold classification to each segment.

===Geometry of passive margins===

====Rifted margin====
This is the typical way that passive margins form, as separated continental tracts move perpendicular to the coastline. This is how the Central [[Atlantic]] opened, beginning in [[Jurassic]] time. Faulting tends to be [[Fault (geology)#Listric fault|listric]]: [[normal fault]]s that flatten with depth.

====Sheared margin====
Sheared margins form where continental breakup was associated with [[strike-slip fault]]ing. A good example of this type of margin is found on the south-facing coast of west Africa. Sheared margins are highly complex and tend to be rather narrow. They also differ from rifted passive margins in structural style and thermal evolution during continental breakup. As the [[seafloor spreading]] axis moves along the margin, thermal uplift produces a ridge. This ridge traps sediments, thus allowing for thick sequences to accumulate. These types of passive margins are less volcanic.

====Transtensional margin====
This type of passive margin develops where rifting is oblique to the coastline, as is now occurring in the [[Gulf of California]].

===Nature of transitional crust===
Transitional crust, separating true oceanic and continental crusts, is the foundation of any passive margin. This forms during the rifting stage and consists of two endmembers: Volcanic and Non-Volcanic. This classification scheme only applies to rifted and transtensional margin; transitional crust of sheared margins is very poorly known.

====Non-volcanic rifted margin====
[[Non-Volcanic Passive Margins|Non-volcanic margins]] are formed when extension is accompanied by little [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] melting and volcanism. Non-volcanic transitional crust consists of stretched and thinned continental crust. Non-volcanic margins are typically characterized by continentward-dipping seismic reflectors (rotated crustal blocks and associated sediments) and low P-wave velocities (&lt;7.0&amp;nbsp;km/s) in the lower part of the transitional crust.

====Volcanic rifted margin====
[[Volcanic passive margin|Volcanic margins]] form part of large igneous provinces, which are characterised by massive emplacements of mafic extrusives and intrusive rocks over very short time periods.
Volcanic margins form when rifting is accompanied by significant mantle melting, with volcanism occurring before and/or during continental breakup. The transitional crust of volcanic margins is composed of [[basalt]]ic [[igneous rock]]s, including [[lava]] flows, [[sill (geology)|sills]], [[Dike (geology)|dykes]], and [[gabbro]].

Volcanic margins are usually distinguished from non-volcanic (or magma-poor) margins (e.g. the Iberian margin, Newfoundland margin) which do not contain large amounts of extrusive and/or intrusive rocks and may exhibit crustal features such as unroofed, serpentinized mantle . Volcanic margins are known to differ from magma-poor margins in a number of ways:
* a transitional crust composed of [[basalt]]ic [[igneous rock]]s, including [[lava]] flows, [[sill (geology)|sills]], [[Dike (geology)|dykes]], and [[gabbro]]s.
* a huge volume of basalt flows, typically expressed as seaward-dipping reflector sequences (SDRS) rotated during the early stages of crustal accretion (breakup stage),
* The presence of numerous sill/dyke and vent complexes intruding into the adjacent basin,
* the lack of significant passive-margin subsidence during and after breakup, and
* the presence of a lower crust with anomalously high seismic P-wave velocities (V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=7.1-7.8&amp;nbsp;km/s) – referred to as lower crustal bodies (LCBs) in the geologic literature.

The high velocities (V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 7&amp;nbsp;km) and large thicknesses of the LCBs are evidence that supports the case for plume-fed accretion (mafic thickening) underplating the crust during continental breakup. LCBs are located along the continent-ocean transition but can sometimes extend beneath the continental part of the rifted margin (as observed in the mid-Norwegian margin for example). In the continental domain, there are still open discussion on their real nature, chronology, geodynamic and petroleum implications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mantleplumes.org/VM_Norway.html Norwegian volcanic margin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622205619/http://www.mantleplumes.org/VM_Norway.html |date=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of volcanic margins:
* The Yemen margin
* The East Australian margin
* The West Indian margin
* The Hatton-Rockal margin
* The U.S East Coast
* The mid-Norwegian margin
* The Brazilian margins
* The Namibian margin
* The East Greenland margin
* The West Greenland margin

Examples of non-volcanic margins:
* The Newfoundland Margin
* The Iberian Margin
* The Margins of the Labrador Sea (Labrador and Southwest Greenland)

===Heterogeneity of transitional crust===

====Simple transitional crust====
Passive margins of this type show a simple progression through the transitional crust, from normal continental to normal oceanic crusts. The passive margin offshore [[Texas]] is a good example.

====Complex transitional crust====
This type of transitional crust is characterized by abandoned [[rift]]s and continental blocks, such as the [[Blake Plateau]], [[Grand Banks]], or [[Bahama Islands]] offshore eastern Florida.

===Sedimentation===
A fourth way to classify passive margins is according to the nature of [[sedimentation]] of the mature passive margin. Sedimentation continues throughout the life of a passive margin. Sedimentation changes rapidly and progressively during the initial stages of passive margin formation because rifting begins on land, becoming marine as the rift opens and a true passive margin is established. Consequently, the sedimentation history of a passive margin begins with fluvial, lacustrine, or other subaerial deposits, evolving with time depending on how the rifting occurred and how, when, and by what type of sediment it varies.

====Constructional====
Constructional margins are the "classic" mode of passive margin sedimentation. Normal sedimentation results from the [[sediment transport|transport]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] of sand, silt, and clay by [[river]]s via [[river delta|deltas]] and redistribution of these sediments by [[longshore current]]s. The nature of sediments can change remarkably along a passive margin, due to interactions between carbonate sediment production, clastic input from rivers, and alongshore transport. Where [[clastic sediment]] inputs are small, [[biogenic sediment]]ation can dominate especially nearshore sedimentation. The [[Gulf of Mexico]] passive margin along the southern United States is an excellent example of this, with muddy and sandy coastal environments down current (west) from the [[Mississippi River Delta]] and beaches of [[carbonate]] sand to the east. The thick layers of sediment gradually thin with increasing distance offshore, depending on subsidence of the passive margin and the efficacy of offshore transport mechanisms such as [[turbidity current]]s and [[submarine channel]]s.

Development of the shelf edge and its migration through time is critical to the development of a passive margin. The location of the shelf edge break reflects complex interaction between sedimentation, sealevel, and the presence of sediment dams. Coral reefs serve as bulwarks that allow sediment to accumulate between them and the shore, cutting off sediment supply to deeper water. Another type of sediment dam results from the presence of [[salt dome]]s, as are common along the [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] passive margin.

====Starved====
Sediment-starved margins produce narrow continental shelves and passive margins. This is especially common in arid regions, where there is little transport of sediment by rivers or redistribution by longshore currents. The Red Sea is a good example of a sediment-starved passive margin.

==Formation==
[[Image:Formation of passive margins.png|right | 350px]]
There are three main stages in the formation of passive margins:
# In the first stage a continental rift is established due to stretching and thinning of the crust and lithosphere by plate movement. This is the beginning of the continental crust subsidence. Drainage is generally away from the rift at this stage.
# The second stage leads to the formation of an oceanic basin, similar to the modern [[Red Sea]]. The subsiding continental crust undergoes normal faulting as transitional marine conditions are established. Areas with restricted sea water circulation coupled with arid climate create evaporite deposits. Crust and lithosphere stretching and thinning are still taking place in this stage. Volcanic passive margins also have igneous intrusions and dykes during this stage.
# The last stage in formation happens only when crustal stretching ceases and the transitional crust and lithosphere subsides as a result of cooling and thickening (thermal subsidence). Drainage starts flowing towards the passive margin causing sediment to accumulate over it.

==Economic significance==
Passive margins are important exploration targets for [[petroleum]].  Mann et al. (2001) classified 592 giant oil fields into six basin and tectonic-setting categories, and noted that continental passive margins account for 31% of giants. Continental rifts (which are likely to evolve into passive margins with time) contain another 30% of the world's giant oil fields. Basins associated with collision zones and subduction zones are where most of the remaining giant oil fields are found.

Passive margins are petroleum storehouses because these are associated with favorable conditions for accumulation and maturation of organic matter. Early continental rifting conditions led to the development of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] basins, large sediment and organic flux, and the preservation of organic matter that led to oil and gas deposits. Crude oil will form from these deposits. These are the localities in which petroleum resources are most profitable and productive. Productive fields are found in passive margins around the globe, including the [[Gulf of Mexico]], western [[Scandinavia]], and Western [[Australia]].

==Law of the Sea==
International discussions about who controls the resources of passive margins are the focus of [[Law of the Sea]] negotiations. Continental shelves are important parts of national [[exclusive economic zone]]s, important for seafloor mineral deposits (including oil and gas) and fisheries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3817">The '''Ruwenzori-Virunga montane moorlands''' is a [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] of central [[Africa]].

[[Image:Ruwenpflanzen.jpg|thumb|300px|Lower Bigo Bog at 3400m in the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] with [[giant lobelia]] in foreground.]]
[[Image:1172 ruwenzori.jpg|thumb|300px|View of the Rwenzori peaks, with giant groundsel plants ''([[Dendrosenecio]])'' in the foreground]]

==Setting==
The ecoregion lies above 3000 meters elevation, and is divided into two areas: the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] on the border of [[Uganda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and the volcanic [[Virunga Mountains]] to the south, where the Democratic Republic of the Congo, [[Rwanda]], and Uganda meet. It is surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] ecoregion.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Neil, Jennifer D’Amico Hales, Emma Underwood (2004). ''Terrestrial Ecoregions of Africa and Madagascar: A Conservation Assessment''. Island Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Afroalpine]] flora of the higher altitudes have much in common with the [[East African montane moorlands]] of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], [[Mount Kenya]] and [[Mount Meru]].

==Flora and fauna==
The ecoregion is home to a distinctive Afroalpine vegetation. Habitat types include lakes, marshy deltas and peat bogs, open montane grasslands, shrublands, enclaves of high elevation forest, snow fields, and glaciers. Giant [[rosette plant]]s, including various species of [[lobelia]]s and [[senecio]]s, are characteristic of the ecoregion.
Vegetation varies with elevation, soils, and exposure.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The upper montane forest of the [[Albertine Rift montane forests]], composed of cloud forests with ''[[Hagenia abyssinica]]'' and ''[[Hypericum revolutum]]'', or bamboo forests of ''[[Sinarundinaria alpina]]'', extends up to {{convert|3000|-|3300|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Ericaceous forests form a transition zone between the montane forests and alpine moorlands, extending up to {{convert|3800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. ''[[Erica arborea]]'' is the dominant species.&lt;ref name=Bussmann2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bussmann, R. W. |year=2006 |title=Vegetation zonation and nomenclature of African Mountains - An overview |journal=Lyonia |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=41–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ericaceous vegetation varies in growth habit, in places forming a dense forest of single-trunked trees, thickets of multi-trunked shrubs, or open shrubland reaching only 1 meter high. The ericaceous forest supports many [[epiphyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wesche, Karsten; Georg Miehe, and Meinhard Kaeppeli (2000). "The Significance of Fire for Afroalpine Ericaceous Vegetation". ''Mountain Research and Development'' 20(4):340-347. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpine grasslands and alpine shrublands extend up to {{convert|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}} altitude. Tussock grasslands include ''Festuca abyssinica'' and ''Carex runssoroensis''. The giant [[rosette plant]]s ''[[Lobelia wollastonii]]'' and ''[[Dendrosenecio johnstonii]]'' are found on both the Rwenzoris and the Virungas, while ''[[Lobelia stuhlmannii]]'' grows only on the Virungas.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In the portion of the Rwenzoris above {{convert|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}} altitude, the alpine grasslands and shrublands yield to upper alpine dwarf scrub, also known as subnival shrub, where ''Helichrysum stuhlmanii'' forms isolated thickets.&lt;ref name=Bussmann2006/&gt;

The Virunga Mountains provide habitat for the endangered [[mountain gorilla]] ''(Gorilla beringei beringei)''.

[[Image:Dust Plumes off Western Africa.jpg|thumb|Dust plumes off [[Western Africa]]]]
[[Image:Saharan Dust Crosses the Atlantic.jpg|thumb|Images showing Saharan dust crossing the Atlantic]]

The '''Saharan Air Layer''' (SAL) is an extremely hot, dry and sometimes dust-laden layer of the [[atmosphere]] that often overlies the cooler, more-humid surface air of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  In the [[Sahara Desert]] region of [[North Africa]], where it originates, it is the prevalent atmosphere, extending from the surface upwards several kilometers.  As it drives, or is driven, out over the ocean, it is lifted above the denser [[marine layer|marine air]].  This arrangement is an [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] where the temperature increases with height. The boundary between the SAL and the marine layer suppresses or "caps" any convection originating in the marine layer.  Since it is dry air, the [[lapse rate]] within the SAL itself is steep, that is, the temperature falls rapidly with height.

Disturbances such as large thunderstorm complexes over North Africa periodically result in vast [[dust storm|dust and sand storms]], some of which extend as high as 6,000 [[meter]]s.  These can be driven out to sea within the SAL as far west as [[North America]].

In the case of Africa, winds blow twenty percent of dust from a Saharan storm out over the Atlantic Ocean, and twenty percent of that, or four percent of a single storm's dust, reaches all the way to the western Atlantic. The remainder settles out into the ocean or washes out of the air with rainfall. Scientists think that the July 2000 measurements made in [[Puerto Rico]], nearly 8 million tonnes, equaled about one-fifth of the total year's dust deposits.

The SAL passes over the [[Canary Islands]] where the phenomenon is named "Calima" and manifests as a fog that reduces visibility and deposits a layer of dust over everything.

These clouds of dust are visible in [[satellite]] photos as a milky white to gray shade, similar to [[haze]].

Findings to date indicate that the iron-rich dust particles that often occur within the SAL reflect [[solar radiation]], thus cooling the atmosphere.  The particles also reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the ocean, thus reducing the amount of heating of the ocean.  They also tend to increase [[condensation]] as they drift into the marine layer below, but not [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] as the drops formed are too small to fall and tend not to readily coelesce.  These tiny drops are subsequently more easily evaporated as they move into drier air laterally or dry air mixes down from the SAL aloft.  Research on aerosols also shows that the presence of small particles in air tends to suppress winds.  The SAL has also been observed to suppress the development and intensifying of [[tropical cyclone]]s, which may be related directly to these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author1=Jason P. Dunion|author2=Christopher S. Velden|title=The impact of the Saharan Air Layer on Atlantic tropical cyclone activity|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-85-3-353|accessdate=18 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=American Meteorological Society|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAL is a subject of ongoing study and research.

[[Image:Skywave.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Radio waves (black) [[Reflection (physics)|reflecting]] off the [[ionosphere]] (red) during skywave propagation]]

In [[radio communication]], '''skywave''' or '''skip''' refers to the [[Radio propagation|propagation]] of [[radio waves]] [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] or [[refraction|refracted]] back toward Earth from the [[ionosphere]], an [[Ionization|electrically charged]] layer of the upper [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].  Since it is not limited by the curvature of the Earth,  skywave propagation can be used to communicate beyond the [[horizon]], at intercontinental distances.  It is mostly used in the [[shortwave]] [[frequency]] bands.

As a result of skywave propagation, a signal from a distant [[AM broadcasting]] station, a [[shortwave radio|shortwave]] station, or &amp;ndash; during [[sporadic E propagation]] conditions (principally during the summer months in both hemispheres) a distant [[VHF]] [[TV/FM DX|FM or TV station]] &amp;ndash; can sometimes be received as clearly as local stations.  Most long-distance shortwave ([[high frequency]]) radio communication &amp;ndash; between 3 and 30&amp;nbsp;MHz &amp;ndash; is a result of skywave propagation. Since the early 1920s [[amateur radio|amateur radio operators]] (or "hams"), limited to lower transmitter power than [[Broadcasting|broadcast stations]], have taken advantage of skywave for long distance (or "[[DX communication|DX]]") communication.

Skywave propagation is distinct from: 
* [[surface wave|groundwave]] propagation, where radio waves travel near Earth's surface without being reflected or refracted by the atmosphere &amp;ndash; the dominant propagation mode at lower frequencies, 
*[[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] propagation, in which radio waves travel in a straight line, the dominant mode at higher frequencies.

== Explanation ==
The ionosphere is a region of the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], from about 80&amp;nbsp;km to 1000&amp;nbsp;km in altitude, where neutral air is [[ion]]ized by solar [[photon]]s and [[cosmic ray]]s. When [[high frequency]] signals enter the ionosphere obliquely, they are [[Scattering|back-scattered]] from the ionized layer as scatter waves.&lt;ref&gt;Sony Corporation. (1998). ''Wave Handbook''. p.14. {{oclc|734041509}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the midlayer [[ionization]] is strong enough compared to the signal frequency, a scatter wave can exit the bottom of the layer earthwards as if [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] from a mirror. Earth's surface (ground or water) then [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely reflects]] the incoming wave back towards the ionosphere. Consequently, like a rock "skipping" across water, the signal may effectively "bounce" or "skip" between the earth and ionosphere two or more times (multihop propagation). Since at shallow incidence losses remain quite small, signals of only a few watts can sometimes be received many thousands of miles away as a result. This is what enables [[shortwave]] broadcasts to travel all over the world.

If the ionization is not great enough, the scatter wave is initially deflected downwards, and subsequently upwards (above the layer peak) such that it exits the top of the layer slightly displaced. Sky wave propagation occurs in the [[waveguide]] formed by the ground and ionosphere, each serving as reflectors. With a single "hop," path distances up to 3500&amp;nbsp;km may be reached. Transatlantic connections are mostly obtained with two or three hops.&lt;ref&gt;K.Rawer:''Wave Propagation in the Ionosphere''. Kluwer Acad.Publ., Dordrecht 1993. {{ISBN|0-7923-0775-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The layer of ionospheric [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] with equal ionization (the reflective  surface) is not fixed, but undulates like the surface of the ocean.  Varying reflection efficiency from this changing surface can cause the reflected signal strength to change, causing "''[[fading]]''" in shortwave broadcasts.


[[Image:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|center|500px|Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves.]]

== Other considerations ==

[[Very high frequency|VHF]] signals with frequencies above about 30&amp;nbsp;MHz usually penetrate the ionosphere and are not returned to the Earth's surface.  [[E-skip]] is a notable exception, where VHF signals including FM broadcast and VHF TV signals are frequently reflected to the Earth during late spring and early summer. E-skip rarely affects [[UHF]] frequencies, except for very rare occurrences below 500&amp;nbsp;MHz.

[[frequency|Frequencies]] below approximately 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (wave lengths longer than 30 meters), including broadcasts in the [[mediumwave]] and [[shortwave]] bands (and to some extent [[longwave]]), propagate most efficiently by skywave at night. Frequencies above 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (wavelengths shorter than 30 meters) typically propagate most efficiently during the day. Frequencies lower than 3&amp;nbsp;kHz have a wave length longer than the distance between the Earth and the ionosphere. The [[maximum usable frequency]] for skywave propagation is strongly influenced by [[sunspot]] number.

Skywave propagation is usually degraded &amp;ndash; sometimes seriously &amp;ndash; during [[geomagnetic storm]]s. Skywave propagation on the sunlit side of the Earth can be entirely disrupted during [[Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance|sudden ionospheric disturbances]].

Because the lower-altitude layers (the [[E-layer]] in particular) of the [[ionosphere]] largely disappear at night, the refractive layer of the ionosphere is much higher above the surface of the Earth at night. This leads to an increase in the "skip" or "hop" distance of the skywave at night.

==History==

===Discovery of skywave propagation===
[[Amateur radio|Amateur radio operators]] are credited with the discovery of skywave propagation on the shortwave bands. Early long-distance services used [[surface wave]] propagation at [[Very low frequency|very low frequencies]],&lt;ref&gt;Stormfax. [http://www.stormfax.com/wireless.htm Marconi Wireless on Cape Cod]&lt;/ref&gt; which are attenuated along the path. Longer distances and higher frequencies using this method meant more signal attenuation. This, and the difficulties of generating and detecting higher frequencies, made discovery of shortwave propagation difficult for commercial services.

Radio amateurs conducted the first successful transatlantic tests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-club-of-america.org/history.php?page=1921.html |title=1921 - Club Station 1BCG and the Transatlantic Tests |accessdate=2009-09-05 |publisher=Radio Club of America }}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1921, operating in the 200 meter [[mediumwave]] band (1500&amp;nbsp;kHz)&amp;mdash;the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe at 200 meters and at least 30 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two-way communications between North American and Hawaiian amateurs began in 1922 at 200 meters. Although operation on wavelengths shorter than 200 meters was technically illegal (but tolerated as the authorities mistakenly believed at first that such frequencies were useless for commercial or military use), amateurs began to experiment with those wavelengths using newly available [[vacuum tube]]s shortly after World War I.

Extreme [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] at the upper edge of the 150-200 meter band&amp;mdash;the official wavelengths allocated to [[amateur radio operators|amateurs]] by the Second National Radio Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112106763342;view=1up;seq=63 |title=Radio Service Bulletin No. 72 |pages=9–13 |accessdate=2018-03-05 |date=1923-04-02 |publisher=Bureau of Navigation, Department of Commerce }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923&amp;mdash;forced amateurs to shift to shorter and shorter wavelengths; however, amateurs were limited by regulation to wavelengths longer than 150 meters (2&amp;nbsp;MHz). A few fortunate amateurs who obtained special permission for experimental communications below 150 meters completed hundreds of long distance two way contacts on 100 meters (3&amp;nbsp;MHz) in 1923 including the first transatlantic two way contacts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130112737/http://www.arrl.org/news/features/1998/1102/2/?nc=1 |date=November 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1923, on 110 meters (2.72&amp;nbsp;MHz)

By 1924 many additional specially licensed amateurs were routinely making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6000 miles (~9600&amp;nbsp;km) and more. On 21 September several amateurs in California completed two way contacts with an amateur in New Zealand. On 19 October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90-minute two-way contact nearly halfway around the world. On October 10, the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/1924conf.htm |title=Recommendations for Regulation of Radio: October 6-10, 1924 |publisher=Earlyradiohistory.us |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[80-meter band|80 meters]] (3.75&amp;nbsp;MHz), [[40-meter band|40 meters]] (7&amp;nbsp;MHz) and [[20-meter band|20 meters]] (14&amp;nbsp;MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the [[10-meter band]] (28&amp;nbsp;MHz) was created by the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twiar.org/aaarchives/WB008.txt |title=Report |website=twiar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 25 November 1927. The [[15-meter band]] (21&amp;nbsp;MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1 May 1952.

===Marconi===
In June and July 1923, [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], to his yacht Ellette in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]. In September 1924, Marconi transmitted during daytime and nighttime on 32 meters from Poldhu to his yacht in Beirut. Marconi, in July 1924, entered into contracts with the British [[General Post Office]] (GPO) to install high speed shortwave telegraphy circuits from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]]. The UK-to-Canada shortwave "Beam Wireless Service" went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926. Beam Wireless Services from the UK to Australia, South Africa and India went into service in 1927.

Far more spectrum is available for long distance communication in the shortwave bands than in the long wave bands; and shortwave transmitters, receivers and antennas were orders of magnitude less expensive than the multi-hundred kilowatt transmitters and monstrous antennas needed for long wave.

Shortwave communications began to grow rapidly in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/beyondionosphere00unitrich/beyondionosphere00unitrich_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Beyond the ionosphere : fifty years of satellite communication" |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the internet in the late 20th century. By 1928, more than half of long distance communications had moved from transoceanic cables and long wave wireless services to shortwave "skip" transmission and the overall volume of transoceanic shortwave communications had vastly increased. Shortwave also ended the need for multimillion-dollar investments in new transoceanic telegraph cables and massive long wave wireless stations, although some existing transoceanic telegraph cables and commercial long wave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s.

The cable companies began to lose large sums of money in 1927, and a serious financial crisis threatened the viability of cable companies that were vital to strategic British interests. The British government convened the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porthcurno.org.uk/page.php?id=104 Cable and Wireless Pl c History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320053915/http://www.porthcurno.org.uk/page.php?id=104 |date=2015-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928 "to examine the situation that had arisen as a result of the competition of Beam Wireless with the Cable Services". It recommended and received Government approval for all overseas cable and wireless resources of the Empire to be merged into one system controlled by a newly formed company in 1929, Imperial and International Communications Ltd. The name of the company was changed to [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless Ltd.]] in 1934.

[[Image:Vacuum tube multimeter.jpg|thumb|200px| A "Sylvania Electric" multimeter tester for vacuum tubes]]
A '''tube tester''' is an electronic instrument designed to test certain characteristics of [[vacuum tubes]] (thermionic valves). Tube testers evolved along with the vacuum tube to satisfy the demands of the time, and their evolution ended with the tube era. The first tube testers were simple units designed for specific tubes to be used in the battlefields of World War I by radio operators, so they could easily test the tubes of their communication equipment.

==Types of tube testers==

===Modern testers===
The most modern testers perform a multitude of the below tests and are fully automated. Examples of modern testers include the '''Amplitrex AT1000''', the '''Space-Tech Lab EasyTubeTester''', the '''Maxi pre-amp tester''' and the '''maxi-matcher''' (power tubes only) by maxi test and the new, and somewhat more primitive, '''DIVO VT1000''' by Orange Amplification. While the AT1000, EasyTubeTester and the Maxi-test brand testers offer precise measurements of transconductance/Gm and emissions/iP at full or near full voltages, the Orange tester offers a very simple numerical quality scale. The EasyTubeTester has a unique feature of quick tube matching +/-percentage display.

===Filament continuity tester===
The simplest tester is the ''filament continuity tester'', usually with a neon lamp connected in series with the filament/heater and a current limiting resistance fed directly by the mains. There is therefore no need to select the appropriate filament voltage for the particular tube under test, but this equipment will not identify tubes that may be faulty in other (more likely) ways, nor indicate any degree of wear.  The same checks can be made with a cheap [[multimeter]]'s resistance test.

===Tube checker===
The tube checker is the second-simplest of all tube testers after filament continuity testing. Tubes are used as a low power [[rectifier]], with all elements other than filament connections connected together as the anode, at a fraction of its normal emission. By mistake referred to sometimes as Emission Tester because they are a crude measure of emission in directly heated types (but a measure of unwanted heater-cathode leakage in indirectly heated types). Switches will need to select the correct filament voltage and pins.

===Emission tester===
Next in complexity is the ''emission tester'', which basically treats any tube as a diode by carefully connecting the cathode to ground, all the grids and plate to [[Battery (vacuum tube)#B battery|B+ voltage]], feeding the filament with the correct voltage, and an ammeter in series with either the plate or the cathode. This effectively measures [[Thermionic emission|emission]], the current which the cathode is capable of emitting, for the given plate voltage, which can usually be controlled by a variable load resistor. Switches will need to select the correct filament voltage plus which pins belong to the filament and cathode(s).

Older testers may call themselves ''Plate Conductance'' if the ammeter is in series with the plate, or ''Cathode Conductance'' if the meter is in series with the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Know your Tube and Transistor Testers, Robert G. Middleton&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems of ''emission testers'' are:
* they do not measure key characteristics of tubes, like transconductance
* they do not perform the tests at real load, voltages and currents
* they test the tube under static conditions, which are not even near the dynamic conditions the tube would work with in a real electronic device
* tubes with grids might not even show the real emission because of ''hot spots'' in the cathode, hidden by the grids under normal conditions
* grids will be forward biased to some extent - some fine control grid wires are limited in their ability to withstand this
* the amount of current that should be considered "100%" has to be known and documented for each tube type (and will be different for different emission test circuit details)

The ''advantage'' of an emission tester is that from all types of tube testers, it provides the most reliable warning of  tube wear-out. If emission is at 70%, transconductance can be at 90% still, and gain at 100%.  The best and most popular version used by the German army was the Funke W19{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} .

The ''disadvantage'' of an emission tester is that it can test a good tube as bad, and a bad tube as good, because it ignores other properties of the tube. A tube with low emission will work perfectly fine in most circuits, and need not be replaced on that indication alone, unless it measures much lower than specified or if it indicates a short.

A variation on the emission tester is the ''dynamic conductance tester'', a type of tester developed by the Jackson Electrical Company of Dayton, Ohio. The main difference is the use of ‘proportional AC voltages’ in place of applying the current directly to the grids and plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jackson Tube Testers {{!}}  {{!}} Tales from the Tone Lounge|url = http://tone-lizard.com/jackson-tube-testers/|website = Tone Lizard|publisher = http://tone-lizard.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short circuit test===
Usually, emission testers also have a ''short circuit test'' which is just a variation of the continuity tester with a neon lamp, and which allows to identify if there is any shortcut between the different pairs of electrodes.

===Parametric tester===
A tester of this type applies DC voltage to the tube being tested, and datasheet values are verified under real conditions. Some parametric testers apply AC voltage to the tube being tested, with verification under conditions which simulate DC operation. Examples include the [[Megger Group Limited#AVO|AVO]] line of tube testers, along with the Funke W20 and the Neuberger RPG375.

===Mutual conductance tester===
The mutual conductance tester tests the tube dynamically by applying bias and an AC voltage to the control grid, and measuring the current obtained on the plate, while maintaining the correct DC voltages on the plate and screen grid. This setup measures the [[transconductance]] of the tube, indicated in [[Mho|micromhos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radiolaguy.com/Mutual-Emission.htm | title = Mutual Conductance vs. Emission Test | accessdate = 2010-12-08 | publisher = RadiolaGuy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oscilloscope tube curve tracer plug-in===
A full set of characteristic curves for vacuum tubes, and later [[Semiconductor curve tracer|for semiconductor devices]], could be displayed on an [[oscilloscope]] screen by use of a plug-in adapter, or on a dedicated curve tracer. An example is the Tektronix 570.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/tektronix_electron_tube_curve_trac.html Radiomuseum: Electron Tube Curve Tracer 570]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-service tube testers==
[[File:RCA-tube-tester-at-Oklahoma-History-Center.jpg|thumb|right|An RCA self-service tube tester on display at the [[Oklahoma History Center]].]]From the late 1920s until the early 1970s, many department stores, drug stores and grocery stores in the U.S. had a self-service tube-vending display. It typically consisted of a tube-tester atop a locked cabinet of tubes, with a flip chart of instructions. One would remove the tubes from a malfunctioning device, such as a radio or television, bring them to the store, and test them all, looking up the instructions from the model number on the tube and the flip chart. If a tube was defective, store personnel would sell a replacement from the cabinet.

At that time, tubes in consumer devices were installed in sockets and easily replaceable, except for the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] in televisions. Most devices had a removable back with a diagram showing where to replace each tube. There were only a few types of [[tube socket]], so it was easy to make a mistake. If testing showed all tubes to be working, the next step was a repair shop. As [[transistor]] devices became common, the grocery-store tube-tester vanished.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9352">[[Image:Pipe with Wood Lagging.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A pipeline protected by wood lagging.]]
'''Wood lagging''' is a method of banding wooden slats around pipelines to protect against [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], and [[corrosion]]. Wooden lagging acts as a sheath, protecting the pipeline from  damage,&lt;ref name="neb"/&gt; and is especially useful in rocky terrain; steep inclines; around rivers or swampy areas; and other rough terrain.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt; '''Boiler lagging''' is akin to pipe lagging, but is used to protect [[steam boiler]]s.

Wood lagging has been used on notable pipelines such as The Trans-Mountain Pipeline, which spans the [[Canadian Rockies]], since 1953, and [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners|The Kinder Morgan TMX Anchor Loop]]. The latter, constructed in 2007, used wood lagging in the environmentally-sensitive terrain and river crossings of [[Alberta]]'s [[Jasper National Park]].&lt;ref name="anchor"/&gt;

==Overview==

===Construction process===
{{double image|right||170||200|Pipelines with wood lagging under construction}}
Wood lagging is one of several solutions employed by [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] engineers to provide mechanical protection for underground pipelines. Others include [[concrete]] coating, rockshield, [[high-density polyethylene]], imported sand padding, and padding machines.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt;

Wood lagging involves wiring a series of wooden slats together to create a 'blanket'.  This blanket of wooden slats is then dropped over and wrapped around the outside of a pipeline, with or without coating,&lt;ref name="puc"/&gt; and secured with steel or plastic banding.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt;

Once wood lagging is installed, the pipeline can be buried and backfilled.  (Wood lagging is installed as part of the “padding and backfill” stage of construction.)&lt;ref name="efile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

For pipelines that encounter saturated soils or water, wood lagging is often installed in between bolt-on concrete weights, acting as a spacer to keep the weights in place as well as to provide mechanical protection to the pipe.  River weights are generally used at river and creek crossings to counteract the [[buoyancy]] of pipelines in stream, high water table situations, or in swampy areas.&lt;ref name="png"/&gt;

===Characteristics===

Wood lagging is especially useful to protect pipelines in rocky terrain; steep inclines; around rivers or swampy areas; and in areas with poor natural availability of padding, such as sand or gravel.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt;

Wood lagging is light, flexible, and easy to install at [[construction]] sites.  As a method for protecting pipelines, wood lagging offers high-impact resistance at a considerably reduced cost compared to other types of pipeline protection, such as [[concrete]] coating.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt;

Materials for wood lagging can often be sourced regionally near pipeline construction sites, reducing transportation time and costs. [[Wood]] used in wood lagging is a [[renewable]] resource that creates a [[carbon sequestration]] effect after pipeline burial, providing minimal environmental impact compared to other types of pipeline protection.&lt;ref name="asme"/&gt;

===Historic and modern uses===

The longevity of wood lagging that has been installed underground is unknown.  However, intact wood lagging has been found still performing its function more than 50 years after installation:
[[File:GWR Firefly.jpg|thumb|200px|GWR Firefly replica at [[Didcot Railway Centre]]. The wooden slats around boiler are an example of boiler lagging. (Click photo to enlarge)]]
*The Trans-Mountain Pipeline, which spans the [[Canadian Rockies]], the mountainous region of central [[British Columbia]], and 98 streams and rivers, used wood lagging to protect an expanse of pipe crossing the [[Coquihalla Canyon]].  Archival film footage shows the use of wood lagging during its installation in 1953.&lt;ref name="oil"/&gt;

Modern examples of wood lagging used to protect [[oil pipeline|oil]] and [[natural gas pipeline]]s include:

*The BC Gas Southern Crossing Pipeline, constructed in 2000.  Wood lagging was used in approximately 22&amp;nbsp;km of the 315&amp;nbsp;km pipeline route.
*The Kinder Morgan TMX Anchor Loop, constructed in 2007 by [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]].  Wood lagging was used to protect the pipeline in the environmentally-sensitive terrain and river crossings in [[Jasper National Park]] in [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name="anchor"/&gt; In this case, two-by-four inch slats were strapped over the pipes to provide extra protection against the rough terrain of the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name="newtech"/&gt;
*Sun Canadian's company policy is to cover exposed pipes with wood lagging.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

A different, but related, use of wooden slats was for lagging [[steam boiler]]s, for example in trains.
