'''AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism''' (Also commonly referred to as '''AP Physics C: E&amp;M''', or simply '''E&amp;M''') is an [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] [[science]] course about [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. It is one of the four [[AP Physics]] courses offered in some [[Secondary education in the United States|U.S. secondary schools]].

==Course content==

It is supposed to be equivalent to an introductory [[college]] course in [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] for physics or engineering majors.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview&gt;{{citation | url = http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-course-overviews/ap-physics-c-mechanics-course-overview.pdf | format = PDF | title = AP® PHYSICS C: ELECTRICITY &amp; MAGNETISM | publisher = [[College Board]] | date = December 2016 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course modules are:&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt;
* Electrostatics
* Conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics
* Electric circuits
* Magnetic fields
* Electromagnetism.

Methods of [[calculus]] are used wherever appropriate in formulating physical principles and in applying them to physical problems. Therefore, students should have completed or be concurrently enrolled in a calculus class.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt;

This course may be combined with [[AP Physics C: Mechanics]] to make a unified Physics C course that prepares for both exams. In this scenario, Electricity and Magnetism is typically taught second, as it requires much of the knowledge gained in the Mechanics course.

==AP test==
The course culminates in an optional exam for which high-performing students may receive some credit towards their college coursework, depending on which college or university they attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit &amp; Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration===
The AP examination for AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism is separate from the AP examination for AP Physics C: Mechanics. Before 2006, test-takers paid only once and were given the choice of taking either one or two parts of the Physics C test.

===Format===
The exam is configured in two categories: a 35-question [[multiple choice]] section and a 3-question [[free response]] section.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt; Test takers are allowed to use an approved calculator during the entire exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-physics-c-mechanics/calculator-and-table-policies | title = AP Physics C: Mechanics – Calculator and Table Policies | work = AP Students | publisher = [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is weighted such that each section is worth half of the final score.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt; This and [[AP Physics C: Mechanics]] are the shortest AP exams, with total testing time of 90 minutes.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt;

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_c/topics.html | title = Topic Outline | work = College Board Tests | publisher = The College Board | year = 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130404054146/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_c/topics.html | archive-date = April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3349">'''AICD (activation-induced cell death)''' is [[programmed cell death]] caused by the interaction of [[Fas receptor]]s (Fas, CD95) and [[Fas ligand]]s (FasL, CD95 ligand).&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;Zhang J, Xu X, Liu Y. (2004), Activation-Induced Cell Death in T Cells and Autoimmunity. Cell Mol Immunol. 1(3):186-92&lt;/ref&gt; AICD is a negative regulator of activated [[T lymphocytes]] that results from repeated stimulation of their [[T-cell receptors]] (TCR) and helps to maintain peripheral [[immune tolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kabelitz D, Janssen O. (1997), Antigen-induced death of T-lymphocytes. Front Biosci. 2:d61-77&lt;/ref&gt;  Alteration of the process may lead to [[autoimmune disease]]s.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

The AICD effector cell is one that expresses FasL, and [[apoptosis]] is induced in the cell expressing the Fas receptor. Both activated T cells and [[B cells]] express Fas and undergo [[clonal deletion]] by the AICD mechanism.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green DR, Droin N, Pinkoski M. (2003), Activation-induced cell death in T cells. Immunol Rev. 193:70-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donjerković D, Scott DW. (2000), Activation-induced cell death in B lymphocytes. Cell Res. 10(3):179-92&lt;/ref&gt; Activated T cells that express both Fas and FasL may be killed by themselves or by each other.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

== Signaling ==
The binding of Fas ligand to Fas receptor triggers [[protein trimer|trimerization]] of Fas, whose cytoplasmic domain is then able to bind the [[death domain]] of the [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor protein]] [[FADD]] (Fas-associated protein with death domain). Procaspase 8 binds to FADD's [[death effector domain]] (DED) and [[proteolysis|proteolytically]] self-activates as [[caspase 8]]. Fas, FADD, and procaspase 8 together form a [[death-inducing signaling complex]] (DISC). Activated caspase 8 is released into the cytosol, where it activates the [[caspase]] cascade that initiates apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Nagata S. (1997), Apoptosis by death factor. Cell. 88(3):355-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

== Regulation of Fas-FasL and AICD ==
FasL is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. (The other option is regulation of the signal emanating from the [[death receptor]] itself, controlling sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis.)&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; [[NFAT]] activated by TCR stimulation activates FasL transcription, possibly indirectly by upregulating [[early growth response proteins]].&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt; T cell activation-induced [[gene transcription|transcription]] of FasL is further regulated by [[c-Myc]]–[[MAX (gene)|MAX]] heterodimers, and can be blocked by c-Myc downregulation.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;  Interferon regulatory factors [[IRF1]] and [[IRF2]] also upregulate FasL transcription by directly binding to the FasL [[gene promoter|promoter]].&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt; 

Not much is known about the regulation of Fas and other death receptors. However, overexpression of the protein [[CFLAR]] (caspase and FADD-like apoptosis regulator) inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Scaffidi C, Schmitz I, Krammer PH, Peter ME. (1999é, The role of c-FLIP in modulation of CD95-induced apoptosis. J Biol Chem 274:1541–1548&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">In 1865, at [[Boston, Massachusetts]], a society for the study of social questions was organized and given the name  '''American Social Science Association'''. The group grew to where its membership totaled about 1,000 persons. About 30 corresponding members were located in [[Europe]].  It published annually the  ''[[Journal of Social Science]]''.  

Members of the group worked in five departments:  
* Education and art
* Health
* Trade and finance
* Social economy
* Jurisprudence

In 1898, the society founded the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] which developed into the [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

An '''anal vibrator''' is a [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] designed for [[sexual stimulation]] of the [[anus]] of both men and women. All anal vibrators have one common feature: they produce a vibrating effect in the [[rectum]] for pleasurable sensations.

Anal vibrators differ from other types of vibrators in that they have a flared base to prevent possible loss in the rectum. The average size of an anal vibrator is smaller than vibrators intended for vaginal penetration and may vary from 4-6&amp;nbsp;inches long and about 1&amp;nbsp;inch wide. As well as other vibrators designed for external and internal stimulation, anal vibrators are usually battery operated: the batteries may be inside the unit or connected by wire to a power pack.

Unlike anal [[dildo]]s, such as butt plugs, anal probes and anal beads, vibrating anal toys may produce various stimulating effects: rotating, vibrating or pulsating, and can have different speed or vibration levels to regulate and adjust the vibrator to various sensations.

==Types of anal vibrators==
* '''Vibrating [[anal probing|anal probes]]'''
Anal probes, with vibrating effect are smaller than usual butt plugs–about the size of a finger, which make them a very helpful anal toy for beginners. Anal probe vibrators may be narrower because their main function is to slide and vibrate.
* '''Vibrating [[butt plug]]s'''
Vibrating butt plugs are made to stay inside the anus to create fullness and vibrating stimulation at the same time. Their advantage is that they can be simply left in for anal stimulation during solo or partners' sex to receive multiple enhancements.
* '''Vibrating [[anal beads]] and balls'''
Vibrating beads and balls are a number of small beads or balls joined together through a long retrievable cord to a power control. They may not only be inserted and pulled out but also vibrate at different speeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10797">The '''Applegate mechanism''' ('''Applegate's mechanism''' or '''Applegate effect''') explains long term orbital period variations seen in certain [[eclipsing binaries]]. As a [[main sequence star]] goes through an activity cycle, the outer layers of the star are subject to a magnetic torque changing the distribution of angular momentum, resulting in a change in the star's oblateness. The orbit of the stars in the binary pair is gravitationally coupled to their shape changes, so that the period shows modulations (typically on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) on the same time scale as the activity cycles (typically on the order of decades).&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Applegate |first1=James H. |title=A mechanism for orbital period modulation in close binaries|journal=Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |date=1992 |volume=385 |pages=621–629|bibcode=1992ApJ...385..621A|doi = 10.1086/170967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Careful timing of eclipsing binaries has shown that systems showing orbital period modulations on the order of ∆P/P ∼ 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; over a period of decades are quite common. A striking example of such a system is [[Algol]], for which the detailed observational record extends back over two centuries. Over this span of time, a graph of the time dependence of the difference between the observed times of eclipses ''versus'' the predicted times shows a feature (termed the "great inequality") with a full amplitude of 0.3 days and a recurrent time scale of centuries. Superimposed on this feature is a secondary modulation with a full amplitude of 0.06 days and a recurrent time scale of about 30 years. Orbital period modulations of similar amplitude are seen in other [[Algol binaries]] as well.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

Although recurrent, these period modulations do not follow a strictly regular cycle. Irregular recurrence rules out attempts to explain these period modulations as being due to [[apsidal precession]] or the presence of distant, unseen companions. Apsidal precession explanations also have the problem that they require an eccentric orbit, but the systems in which these modulations are observed often show orbits of little eccentricity. Furthermore, third body explanations have the issue that in many cases, a third body massive enough to produce the observed modulation should not have managed to escape optical detection, unless the third body were quite exotic.&lt;ref name="Van Buren"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Buren |first1=D. |title=Comment on the three-body theory for period changes in RS CVn systems |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=1986 |volume=92 |pages=136–138 |bibcode=1986AJ.....92..136V|doi = 10.1086/114145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon observed in certain Algol binaries has been monotonic period increases. This is quite distinct from the far more common observations of alternating period increases and decreases explained by the Applegate mechanism. Monotonic period increases have been attributed to mass transfer, usually (but not always) from the less massive to the more massive star&lt;ref name="Hall_1989"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
The time scale and recurrence patterns of these orbital period modulations suggested to Matese and Whitmire (1983) a mechanism invoking changes in the quadrupole moment of one star with subsequent spin-orbit coupling. However, they could not provide any convincing explanation for what might cause such fluctuations in the quadrupole moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matese |first1=J. J. |last2=Whitmire |first2=D. P. |title=Alternate period changes in close binary systems |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=1983 |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=L7–L9 |bibcode=1983A&amp;A...117L...7M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the Matese and Whitmire mechanism as a basis, Applegate argued that changes in the radius of gyration of one star could be related to magnetic activity cycles.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt; Supportive evidence for his hypothesis came from the observation that a large fraction of the late-type secondary stars of Algol binaries appear to be rapidly rotating convective stars, implying that they should be chromospherically active. Indeed, orbital period modulations are seen only in Algol-type binaries containing a late-type convective star.&lt;ref name="Hall_1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Douglas S. |title=The relation between RS CVn and Algol |journal=Space Science Reviews |date=1989 |volume=50 |pages=219–233 |bibcode=1989SSRv...50..219H|doi = 10.1007/BF00215932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that gravitational quadrupole coupling is involved in producing orbital period changes, the question remained of how a magnetic field could induce such shape changes. Most models of the 1980s assumed that the magnetic field would deform the star by distorting it away from hydrostatic equilibrium. Marsh and Pringle (1990) demonstrated, however, that the energy required to produce such deformations would exceed the total energy output of the star.&lt;ref name="Marsh and Pringle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marsh |first1=T. R. |last2=Pringle |first2=J. E. |title=Changes in the orbital periods of close binary stars |journal=Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |date=1990 |volume=365 |pages=677–680 | bibcode=1990ApJ...365..677M|doi = 10.1086/169521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star does not rotate as a solid body. The outer parts of a star contribute most to a star's quadrupole moment. Applegate proposed that as a star goes through its activity cycle, magnetic torques could cause a redistribution of angular momentum within a star. As a result, the rotational oblateness of the star will change, and this change would ultimately result in changing the orbital period via the Matese and Whitmire mechanism. Energy budget calculations indicate that the active star typically should be variable at the ΔL/L&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.1 level and should be differentially rotating at the ΔΩ/Ω&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.01 level.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

==Applicability==
The Applegate mechanism makes several testable predictions:
* Luminosity variations in the active star should correspond to modulations in the orbital period.
* Any other indicator of magnetic activity (''i.e.'' sunspot activity, coronal X-ray luminosity, ''etc.'') should also show variations corresponding to modulations in the orbital period.
* Since large changes in the radius of the star are ruled out by considerations of energetics, luminosity variations should be entirely due to temperature variations.&lt;ref name="Applegate 1992"/&gt;

Tests of the above predictions have been supportive of the mechanism's validity, but not unambiguously so.&lt;ref name=Maceroni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maceroni|first1=Carla|title=Angular Momentum Evolution in Close Late-type Binaries |journal=Turkish Journal of Physics |date=1999 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=289–300 |accessdate=24 May 2015 |url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/physics/issues/fiz-99-23-2/fiz-23-2-2-98073.pdf |bibcode = 1999TJPh...23..289M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frasca&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20041007| title = Orbital period variation in close binaries from radial velocity data and magnetic activity cycles| journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics| volume = 429| pages = 309| date = 2005| last1 = Frasca | first1 = A.| last2 = Lanza | first2 = A. F.|bibcode = 2005A&amp;A...429..309F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Applegate effect provides a unified explanation for many (but not all) ephemeris curves for a wide class of binaries, and it may aid in the understanding of the [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] activity seen in rapidly rotating stars.&lt;ref name=Hilditch&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilditch |first1=R. W.|title=An Introduction to Close Binary Stars|date=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521798006 |pages=175–176 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJSADIxyheoC&amp;pg=PA175 |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Applegate mechanism has also been invoked to explain variations in the observed transit times of [[extrasolar planet]]s, in addition to other possible effects such as tidal dissipation and the presence of other planetary bodies.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16602.x| title = Orbital period variations of hot Jupiters caused by the Applegate effect| journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society| pages = no| date = 2010| last1 = Watson | first1 = C.

However, there are many stars for which the Applegate mechanism is inadequate. For example, the orbital period variations in certain eclipsing post-common-envelope binaries are an order of magnitude larger than can be accommodated by the Applegate effect, with [[magnetic braking]] or a third body in a highly elliptical orbit providing the only known mechanisms able to explain the observed variation.&lt;ref name=Völschow&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201527333| title = Eclipsing time variations in close binary systems: Planetary hypothesis vs. Applegate mechanism| journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]| volume = 587| issue=34| date = 2016| last1 = Völschow | first1 = M.| last2 = Schleicher | first2 = D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11843">'''Artifact-centric business process model'''  represents an operational [[business process model|model of business processes]] in which the changes and evolution of [[business data]], or [[Business entity (computer science)|business entities]], are considered as the main driver of the processes. The artifact-centric approach, also called activity-centric or process-centric business process modeling, focuses on describing how business data is change/updated, by a particular action or task, throughout the process.

== Overview ==
In general, a process model describes activities conducted in order to achieve business goals, informational structures, and organizational resources. [[Workflow]]s, as a typical [[process modeling]] approach, often emphasize the sequencing of activities (i.e., [[control flow]]s), but ignore the informational perspective or treat it only within the context of single activities. Without a complete view of the informational context, business actors often focus on what should be done instead of what can be done, hindering operational innovations.

Business process modeling is a foundation for design and management of business processes. Two key aspects of business process modeling are a formal framework that integrates both control flow and data, and a set of tools to assist all aspects of a business process life cycle. A typical business process life cycle includes at least a design phase, concerned with the “correct” realization of business logic in a resource-constrained environment, and an operational phase, concerned with optimizing and improving execution (operations). Traditional business process models emphasize a procedural and/or graph-based paradigm (i.e., control flow). Thus, methodologies to design workflow in those models are typically process-centric. It has been argued that a data-centric perspective is more useful for designing business processes in the modern era.

Intuitively, business artifacts (or simply artifacts) are data objects whose manipulations define the underlying processes in a business model. Recent engineering and development efforts have adopted the artifact approach for design and analysis of business models. An important distinction between artifact-centric models and traditional data flow (computational) models is that the notion of the life cycle of the data objects is prominent in the former, while not existing in the latter.

== Research and history ==
Artifact-centric modeling is an area of growing interest. Nigam and Caswell&lt;ref&gt;Nigam, A. and N.S. Caswell, Business artifacts: An approach to operational specification. IBM Syst. J., 2003. 42(3): p. 428-445.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of business artifacts and information-centric processing of artifact lifecycles. Kumaran et al.'s further studies on artifact-centric business processes can be found here.&lt;ref name="BH2005"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., A model-driven approach to industrializing discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL, 2005. CCCT CCCEC(1): p. 145-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BH2007"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., et al., Towards Formal Analysis of Artifact-Centric Business Process Models, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 288-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIU2007"&gt;Liu, R., K. Bhattacharya, and F. Wu, Modeling Business Contexture and Behavior Using Business Artifacts, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2007. p. 324-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhattacharya&lt;ref name="BH2005" /&gt; described a successful business engagement which applies business artifact techniques to industrialize discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. Liu et al.&lt;ref name="LIU2007"/&gt; formulated nine commonly used patterns in information-centric business operation models and developed a computational model based on Petri Nets. Bhattacharya, K., et al.&lt;ref name="BH2007"/&gt; provides a formal model for artifact-centric business processes with complexity results concerning static analysis of the semantics of such processes. Kumaran et al.&lt;ref&gt;Kumaran, S., R. Liu, and F. Wu, On the Duality of Information-Centric and Activity-Centric Models of Business Processes, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2008. p. 32-47.&lt;/ref&gt; presented the formalized information-centric approach to discovering business entities from activity-centric process models and transforming such models into artifact-centric business process models. An algorithm was provided to achieve this transformation automatically.

Other approaches related to artifact-centric modelling can be found in,.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"&gt;[[Van der Aalst, W.M.P.]], [[Mathias Weske|M. Weske]], and D. Grünbauer, Case handling: a new paradigm for business process support. Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering, 2005. 53(2): p. 129-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WANG2005"&gt;Wang, J. and A. Kumar, A Framework for Document-Driven Workflow Systems, in Business Process Management. 2005. p. 285-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Aalst et al.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"/&gt; provides a case-handling approach where a process is driven by the presence of data objects instead of control flows. A case is similar to the business entity concept in many respects. Wang and Kumar&lt;ref name="WANG2005"/&gt; proposed the document-driven workflow systems which is designed based on data dependencies without the need for explicit control flows. Muller et al.&lt;ref name="MULLER2007"&gt;Müller, D., M. Reichert, and J. Herbst, Data-Driven Modeling and Coordination of Large Process Structures, in On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2007: CoopIS, DOA, ODBASE, GADA, and IS. 2009. p. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced the framework for the data-driven modelling of large process structures, namely COREPRO. The approach reduces modelling efforts significantly and provides mechanisms for maintaining data-driven process structures.

Another related thread of work is the use of state machines to model object lifecycles. Industries often define data objects and standardize their lifecycles as state machines to facilitate interoperability between industry partners and enforce legal regulations.&lt;ref name="RYNDINA2007"&gt;Ryndina, K., J. Küster, and H. Gall, Consistency of Business Process Models and Object Life Cycles, in Models in Software Engineering. 2007. p. 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding et al.&lt;ref name="REDDING2008"&gt;Redding, G., et al., Generating business process models from object behavior models. Information Systems Management, 2008. 25(4): p. 319-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and Küster et al.&lt;ref name="KUSTER2007"&gt;Küster, J., K. Ryndina, and H. Gall, Generation of Business Process Models for Object Life Cycle Compliance, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 165-181.&lt;/ref&gt; give techniques to generate business processes which are compliant with predefined object lifecycles. In addition, event-driven process modelling, for example, Event-driven Process Chains (EPC), also describes object lifecycles glued by events.

More recent and closely related work on artifact-centric process model can be found in.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"&gt;Gerede, C. and J. Su, Specification and Verification of Artifact Behaviors in Business Process Models, in Service-Oriented Computing – ICSOC 2007. 2009. p. 181-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"&gt;Gerede, C.E., K. Bhattacharya, and J. Su, Static analysis of business artifact-centric operational models. Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications, SOCA 2007, 2007: p. 133-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"&gt;Fritz, C., R. Hull, and J. Su, Automatic construction of simple artifact-based business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"&gt;Deutsch, A., et al., Automatic verification of data-centric business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerede and Su&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"/&gt; developed a specification language ABSL to specify artifact behaviours in artifact-centric process models. The authors showed decidability results of our language for different cases and provided key insights on how artifact-centric view can affect the specification of desirable business properties. Gerede et al.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"/&gt; identified important classes of properties on artifact-centric operational models focusing on persistence, uniqueness and arrival properties. They proposed a formal model for artifact-centric operational models to enable a static analysis of these properties and showed that the formal model guarantees persistence and uniqueness.

Fritz, Hull, and Su&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"/&gt; formulated the technical problem of goal-directed workflow construction in the context of declarative artifact-centric workflow, and develop results concerning the general setting, design time analysis, and the synthesis of workflow schemas from goal specifications. The work is among the important initial steps along the path towards eventual support for tools that enable substantial automation for workflow design, analysis, and modification. Deutsch et al.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"/&gt; introduced the artifact system model, which formalizes a business process modelling paradigm that has recently attracted the attention of both the industrial and research communities. The problem of automatic verification of artifact systems, with the goal of increasing confidence in the correctness of such business processes is also studied.

Sira and Chengfei&lt;ref name="YONGCHAREON2010"&gt;Yongchareon, S., Liu, C.: Process View Framework for Artifact-Centric Business Processes, in R. Meersman et al. (Eds.): OTM 2010, Part I. LNCS, vol. 6426, pp. 26–43. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel view framework for artifact-centric business processes. It consists of artifact-centric process model, process view model, a set of consistency rules, and the construction approach for building process views. The formal model of artifact-centric business processes and views, namely ACP, is defined and used to describe artifacts, services, business rules that control the processes, as well as views. They developed a bottom-up abstraction mechanism for process view construction to derive views from underlying process models according to view requirements. Consistency rules are also defined to preserve the consistency between constructed view and its underlying process. This work can be considered as one approach to the abstraction, i.e., generalization of artifact-centric business processes. The framework has also been extended to address modelling and change validation of inter-organizational business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yongchareon|first1=Sira|title=A view framework for modeling and change validation of artifact-centric inter-organizational business processes|journal=Information Systems|date=2015|volume=47|pages=51–81|doi=10.1016/j.is.2014.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2016}}
In [[Islam]], '''''Barakah''''' or '''''Baraka''''' ({{lang-ar|بركة}}) is a kind of continuity of spiritual presence and revelation that begins with God and flows through that and those closest to God.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-1216 |title=Home - Brill Reference |publisher=Brillonline.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name="Nasr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Seyyed Hossein|title=Sufi Essays|date=1972|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0873952332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Baraka can be found within physical objects, places, and people, as chosen by God. This force begins by flowing directly from God into creation that is worthy of baraka.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"/&gt; These creations endowed with baraka can then transmit the flow of baraka to the other creations of God through physical proximity or through the adherence to the spiritual practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. God is the sole source of baraka and has the power to grant and withhold baraka.

==Islamic mysticism==
Baraka is a prominent concept in Islamic mysticism, particularly [[Sufism]]. It pervades Sufi texts, beliefs, practices, and spirituality. Sufism emphasizes the importance of esoteric knowledge and the spiritual union with God through the heart. Baraka symbolizes this connection between the divine and the worldly through God's direct and intentional blessing of those that are most reflective of Him and his teachings.

Baraka is not a state, it is a flow of blessings and grace. It flows from God to those that are closest to God, such as saints and prophets. Those that have received baraka are thought to have the abilities to perform miracles (''karamat''), such as thought-reading, healing the sick, flying, and reviving the dead.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|title=The Shambhala Guide to Sufism|date=1997|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=9781570621802|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} However, according to [[Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri]], a prominent Sufi mystic, the use of these miracles and the actual possession of these abilities are not indicative of a saint's status, however, the performance of these miracles by prophets is important to establish credentials.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Sources, transmission, and traditional importance==

===Sources===
The [[Qur'an]], [[hadith]], saints, prophets, Muhammad and his descendants are all powerful sources of baraka.&lt;ref name="brillonline1"/&gt; Through these sources, one may achieve baraka by three methods: (1) visitation of saints and holy shrines charged with baraka, (2) attachment to the chain of spiritual masters through the [[khirqa]], and (3) emulation of the inner [[Sunnah]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Transmission through saints===
Saints as the source of baraka, can transmit baraka to ordinary men simply through their presence. As this hadith explains, "By means of the righteous Muslim, God repulses affliction from one hundred neighbors".&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Valerie J.|title=Sufism, Mystics, and Saints in Modern Egypt|date=2009|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|isbn=157003849X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} In this way, the saints provide a means for ordinary men to connect with the blessings of God through baraka. The physical closeness to a saint's shrine is said to emit baraka, which is why many followers of Islam choose to visit shrines. The ritualistic act of visiting tombs and other holy places, such as shrines, to receive baraka is known as [[ziyara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karamustafa|first1=Ahmet T.|title=Sufism: The Formative Period|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0520252691}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

===Transmission through khirqa===
Sufis pass esoteric knowledge and baraka from the master [[sheikh]] to the aspirant through the passing of the [[khirqa]]. The khirqa is the initiatory cloak of the Sufi chain of spirituality. This cloak initiates an aspirant into the [[silsilah]], which is the chain of sheikhs that goes back to Muhammad. This chain serves as the channel through which baraka flows from the source of spiritual revelation to the being of the initiate.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} There are two kinds of this kind of transmission (tanakkul) of baraka through the khirqa: khirqa-yi irada and khirqa-yi tabarruk. Khirqa-yi irada is characterized by the passing of baraka to the aspirant from the singular sheikh to which he has sworn. Khirqa-yi tabarruk, also known as the "frock of blessing", is characterized by the passing of baraka to the worthy aspirant from any sheikh that he has encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schimmel|first1=Annemarie|last2=Ernst|first2=Carl W.|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|date=2013|publisher=Mizan|location=Jakarta Selatan|isbn=9794337978|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

The silsilah chain created from the passing of the khirqa that confirms authenticity of many hadiths is known as the [[isnad]]. It was not until the late eleventh and twelfth centuries that the Sufi tradition began accepting this form of [[isnad]] as a means to transmit mystical knowledge and blessings.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Jonathan A.C.|title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|date=2009|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford|isbn=1851686630|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission through Sunnah===
By following the practices and teachings of Muhammad, one can achieve baraka through the emulation of [[Sunnah]]. Because Muhammad is the source of Muhammadan baraka, by living in constant remembrance of [[Names of God in Islam|the names of God]] and in accordance to Muhammad's Sunnah. Those that live the inner Sunnah within the heart, are those that reflect the Light of Muhammad (al-nur al-muhammadi) and the Muhammadan baraka.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Those that live according to the Sunnah, live in constant remembrance of God, and live authentically from the heart are those to whom God opens the channel through which baraka can flow. By living in accordance to Muhammad, one can become worthy of God's direct blessing of baraka. If granted baraka, the saintly person is able to feel God's force from within and is nourished by the hadith while being guided by the baraka.&lt;ref name="Nasr"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Controversy of seeking baraka==
Seeking baraka has been a source of controversy throughout the Islamic world. Through the act of [[ziyara]], saints and the shrines of saints are seen as a means to access the baraka sent from God.  Because of this, many within Islam see ziyara as a form of [[idolatry]] in the way devotees may look towards the saints instead of towards God, Himself, for baraka.&lt;ref name="Sells"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seels|first1=Michael A.|last2=Ernst|first2=Carl W.|title=Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur'an, Mi'raj, Poetic and Theological Writings|date=1996|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809136198}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} Although ziyara has been a source of great controversy, it remains one of the most typical ritual practices of Islamic spirituality.&lt;ref name="Sells"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

[[File:BOD test bottles (biological oxygen demand) (3231600029).jpg|thumb|BOD test bottles at the laboratory of a [[wastewater treatment]] plant.]]
'''Biochemical Oxygen Demand''' ('''BOD''', also called '''Biological Oxygen Demand''') is the amount of [[Oxygenation (environmental)|dissolved oxygen]] needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.  The BOD value is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per litre of sample during 5 days of incubation at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and is often used as a surrogate of the degree of [[Organic compound|organic]] [[pollution of water]].&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Clair N. Sawyer |author2=Perry L. McCarty |author3=Gene F. Parkin | title=Chemistry for Environmental Engineering and Science | edition=5th | location=New York | year=2003 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | isbn=0-07-248066-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BOD can be used as a gauge of the effectiveness of [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants. It is listed as a [[conventional pollutant]] in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 304(a)(4), {{USCSub|33|1314|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

BOD is similar in function to [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), in that both measure the amount of [[organic compound]]s in water. However, COD is less specific, since it measures everything that can be chemically oxidized, rather than just levels of biodegradable organic matter.

==Background==
Most natural waters contain small quantities of [[organic compound]]s.  Aquatic [[microorganisms]] have evolved to use some of these compounds as [[food]].  Microorganisms living in oxygenated waters use dissolved oxygen to oxidatively degrade the organic compounds, releasing [[energy]] which is used for [[Bacterial growth|growth]] and [[reproduction]].  Populations of these microorganisms tend to increase in proportion to the amount of food available.  This microbial [[metabolism]] creates an oxygen demand proportional to the amount of organic compounds useful as food.  Under some circumstances, microbial metabolism can consume dissolved oxygen faster than atmospheric oxygen can dissolve into the water or the autotrophic community (algae, cyanobacteria and macrophytes) can produce.  Fish and aquatic insects may die when oxygen is depleted by microbial metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Charles R. &amp; Horne, Alexander J. ''Limnology'' (1983) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-023651-8}} pp.88&amp;267&lt;/ref&gt;

Biochemical oxygen demand is the amount of oxygen required for microbial metabolism of organic compounds in water.  This demand occurs over some variable period of time depending on temperature, [[nutrient]] concentrations, and the [[enzyme]]s available to indigenous microbial populations.  The amount of oxygen required to completely oxidize the organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water through generations of microbial growth, death, decay, and cannibalism is total biochemical oxygen demand (total BOD).  Total BOD is of more significance to [[food web]]s than to [[water quality]].  Dissolved oxygen depletion is most likely to become evident during the initial aquatic microbial population explosion in response to a large amount of organic material.  If the microbial population deoxygenates the water, however, that lack of oxygen imposes a limit on population growth of [[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] aquatic microbial organisms resulting in a longer term food surplus and oxygen deficit.&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;Reid, George K. ''Ecology of Inland Waters and Estuaries'' (1961) Van Nostrand Reinhold pp.&amp;nbsp;317–320&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard temperature at which BOD testing should be carried out was first proposed by the [[Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal]] in its eighth report in 1912:
&lt;blockquote&gt;" (c) An effluent in order to comply with the general standard must not contain as discharged more than 3 parts per 100,000 of suspended matter, and with its suspended matters included must not take up at 65°F   more than 2.0 parts per 100,000 of dissolved oxygen in 5 days. This general standard  should be prescribed either by Statute or by order of the Central Authority, and should be subject to modifications by that Authority after an interval of not less than ten years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This was later standardised at 68&amp;nbsp;°F and then 20&amp;nbsp;°C.  This temperature may be significantly different from the temperature of the natural environment of the water being tested.

Although the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal proposed 5 days as an adequate test period for rivers of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], longer periods were investigated for [[North America]]n rivers.  Incubation periods of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 days were being used into the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, John F. ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage'' 9th Ed. (1946) American Public Health Association p.139&lt;/ref&gt;  Keeping dissolved oxygen available at their chosen temperature, investigators found up to 99 percent of total BOD was exerted within 20 days, 90 percent within 10 days, and approximately 68 percent within 5 days.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart, Leonard Church ''Civil Engineering Handbook'' 4th Ed. (1959) McGraw-Hill p.&amp;nbsp;9–40&lt;/ref&gt;  Variable microbial population shifts to [[nitrifying bacteria]] limit test [[reproducibility]] for periods greater than 5 days.  The 5-day test protocol with acceptably reproducible results emphasizing carbonaceous BOD has been endorsed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  This 5-day BOD test result may be described as the amount of oxygen required for aquatic microorganisms to stabilize decomposable organic matter under aerobic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Clair N. &amp; McCarty, Perry L. ''Chemistry for Sanitary Engineers'' 2nd Ed. (1967) McGraw-Hill pp.&amp;nbsp;394–399&lt;/ref&gt;  Stabilization, in this context, may be perceived in general terms as the conversion of food to living aquatic [[fauna]].  Although these fauna will continue to exert biochemical oxygen demand as they die, that tends to occur within a more stable evolved [[ecosystem]] including higher [[trophic level]]s.&lt;ref name="reid"/&gt;

=== Typical values ===
Most pristine rivers will have a 5-day carbonaceous BOD below 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Moderately [[pollution|polluted]] rivers may have a BOD value in the range of 2 to 8&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Rivers may be considered severely polluted when BOD values exceed 8&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Connor |first=Richard |authorlink = |title =The United Nations World Water Development Report 2016: Water and Jobs, chapter 2: The Global Perspective on Water |publisher =UNESCO |volume = |edition = |date =2016 |location =Paris |page =26 |isbn =978-92-3-100155-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal [[sewage]] that is efficiently treated by a [[sewage treatment|three-stage process]] would have a value of about 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L or less. Untreated sewage varies, but averages around 600&amp;nbsp;mg/L in [[Europe]] and as low as 200&amp;nbsp;mg/L in the U.S., or where there is severe [[groundwater]] or [[surface water]] [[Infiltration/Inflow]]. The generally lower values in the U.S. derive from the much greater water use per capita than in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Sawyer" /&gt;

== Methods ==
There are two commonly recognized methods for the measurement of BOD.

=== Dilution method ===
This standard method is recognized by U.S. [[EPA]], which is labeled Method 5210B in the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater&lt;ref&gt;Lenore S. Clesceri, Andrew D. Eaton, Eugene W. Rice (2005). Standard Methods for Examination of Water &amp; Wastewater Method 5210B. Washington, DC: American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association, and the Water Environment Association. http://www.standardmethods.org .&lt;/ref&gt;  
In order to obtain BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in a sample must be measured before and after the incubation period, and appropriately adjusted by the sample corresponding dilution factor. This analysis is performed using 300 ml incubation bottles in which [[buffered dilution water]] is dosed with seed microorganisms and stored for 5 days in the dark room at 20&amp;nbsp;°C to prevent DO production via photosynthesis. In addition to the various dilutions of BOD samples, this procedure requires dilution water blanks, [[glucose glutamic acid]] (GGA) controls, and seed controls. The dilution water blank is used to confirm the quality of the dilution water that is used to dilute the other samples. This is necessary because impurities in the dilution water may cause significant alterations in the results. The GGA control is a standardized solution to determine the quality of the seed, where its recommended BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 198&amp;nbsp;mg/l ± 30.5&amp;nbsp;mg/l.
For measurement of '''carbonaceous BOD''' (cBOD), a nitrification inhibitor is added after the dilution water has been added to the sample. The inhibitor hinders the [[oxidation]] of ammonia nitrogen, which supplies the nitrogenous BOD (nBOD). When performing the BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test, it is conventional practice to measure only cBOD because nitrogenous demand does not reflect the oxygen demand from organic matter.  This is because nBOD is generated by the breakdown of proteins, whereas cBOD is produced by the breakdown of organic molecules.

BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated by:
*Unseeded:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BOD}_5 = \frac{(D_0 - D_5)}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
*Seeded:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BOD}_5 = \frac{(D_0 - D_5) - (B_0 - B_5)f}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt; D_0&lt;/math&gt; is the dissolved oxygen (DO) of the diluted solution after preparation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; D_5&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of the diluted solution after 5 day incubation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; P&lt;/math&gt; is the decimal dilution factor
:&lt;math&gt; B_0&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of diluted seed sample after preparation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; B_5&lt;/math&gt; is the DO of diluted seed sample after 5 day incubation (mg/l)
:&lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of seed volume in dilution solution to seed volume in BOD test on seed

=== Manometric method ===
This method is limited to the measurement of the oxygen consumption due only to carbonaceous oxidation. [[Ammonia]] oxidation is inhibited.

The sample is kept in a sealed container fitted with a [[pressure sensor]]. A substance that absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] (typically [[lithium hydroxide]]) is added in the container above the sample level. The sample is stored in conditions identical to the dilution method. Oxygen is consumed and, as ammonia oxidation is inhibited, carbon dioxide is released. The total amount of gas, and thus the pressure, decreases because carbon dioxide is absorbed. From the drop of pressure, the sensor electronics computes and displays the consumed quantity of oxygen.

The main advantages of this method compared to the dilution method are:
* simplicity: no dilution of sample required, no seeding, no blank sample.
* direct reading of BOD value.
* continuous display of BOD value at the current incubation time.

== Alternative methods ==

=== Biosensor ===
An alternative to measure BOD is the development of biosensors, which are devices for the detection of an analyte that combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector component. Enzymes are the most widely used biological sensing elements in the fabrication of biosensors. Their application in biosensor construction is limited by the tedious, time consuming and costly enzyme purification methods. Microorganisms provide an ideal alternative to these bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lei|first1=Yu|title=Microbial biosensors|url=http://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/downloads/microbial%20sensor%2006.pdf|website=www.cbs.umn.edu|publisher=Analytica Chimica Acta 568 (2006) 200–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many micro organisms useful for BOD assessment are relatively easy to maintain in pure cultures, grow and harvest at low cost. Moreover, the use of microbes in biosensor field has opened up new possibilities and advantages such as ease of handling, preparation and low cost of device. A number of pure cultures, e.g. ''Trichosporon cutaneum, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas sp.'' etc. individually, have been used by many workers for the construction of BOD biosensor. On the other hand, many workers have immobilized activated sludge, or a mixture of two or three bacterial species and on various membranes for the construction of BOD biosensor. The most commonly used membranes were polyvinyl alcohol, porous hydrophilic membranes etc.&lt;ref name="igib.res.in"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kumar|first1=Rita|title=IMMOBILIZED MICROBIAL CONSORTIUM USEFUL FOR RAPID AND RELIABLE BOD ESTIMATION|url=http://www.igib.res.in/pme/patents.htm|website=www.igib.res.in|publisher=CSIR-Institute of Genomics &amp; Integrative Biology (IGIB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A defined microbial consortium can be formed by conducting a systematic study, i.e. pre-testing of selected micro-organisms for use as a seeding material in BOD analysis of a wide variety of industrial effluents. Such a formulated consortium can be immobilized on suitable membrane, i.e. charged nylon membrane useful for BOD estimation. Suitability of charges nylon membrane lies in the specific binding between negatively charged bacterial cell and positively charged nylon membrane. So the advantages of the nylon membrane over the other membranes are : The dual binding, i.e. Adsorption as well as entrapment, thus resulting in a more stable immobilized membrane. Such specific Microbial consortium based BOD analytical devices, may find great application in monitoring of the degree of pollutional strength, in a wide variety of Industrial waste water within a very short time.&lt;ref name="igib.res.in" /&gt;

Biosensors can be used to indirectly measure BOD via a fast (usually &lt;30 min) to be determined BOD substitute and a corresponding calibration curve method (pioneered by Karube et al., 1977). Consequently, biosensors are now commercially available, but they do have several limitations such as their high maintenance costs, limited run lengths due to the need for reactivation, and the inability to respond to changing quality characteristics as would normally occur in wastewater treatment streams; e.g. diffusion processes of the biodegradable organic matter into the membrane and different responses by different microbial species which lead to problems with the reproducibility of result (Praet et al., 1995). Another important limitation is the uncertainty associated with the calibration function for translating the BOD substitute into the real BOD (Rustum ''et al.'', 2008).

===Fluorescent RedOx Indicator===
A surrogate to BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; has been developed using a [[resazurin]] derivative which reveals the extent of oxygen uptake by micro-organisms for organic matter mineralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=2013130308 A |title=Process for directly measuring multiple biodegradabilities |pubdate=2013-05-23 |fdate=2012-11-21 |pridate=2011-11-23 |invent1=Nathalie Pautremat |invent2=Romy-Alice Goy |invent3=Zaynab El Amraoui |invent4=Yves Dudal |assign1= Envolure}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-validation performed on 109 samples in Europe and the United-States showed a strict statistical equivalence between results from both methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muller|first1=Mathieu|last2=Bouguelia|first2=Sihem|last3=Goy|first3=Romy-Alice|last4=Yoris|first4=Alison|last5=Berlin|first5=Jeanne|last6=Meche|first6=Perrine|last7=Rocher|first7=Vincent|last8=Mertens|first8=Sharon|last9=Dudal|first9=Yves|title=International cross-validation of a BOD5 surrogate|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|date=2014|pages=1–4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-014-3202-3|doi=10.1007/s11356-014-3202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French start-up [http://envolure.com/index-en.html Envolure] (Montpellier, France) offers the kit [http://envolure.com/enverdi-en.html ENVERDI] which enables the users to perform up to 40 BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously in 48 hours in a single 96-wells microplate.

===Software sensor===
Rustum et al. (2008) proposed the use of the KSOM to develop intelligent models for making rapid inferences about BOD using other easy to measure water quality parameters, which, unlike BOD, can be obtained directly and reliably using on-line hardware sensors. This will make the use of BOD for on-line process monitoring and control a more plausible proposition. In comparison to other data-driven modeling paradigms such as multi-layer perceptrons artificial neural networks (MLP ANN) and classical multi-variate regression analysis, the KSOM is not negatively affected by missing data. Moreover, time sequencing of data is not a problem when compared to classical time series analysis.

== Dissolved oxygen probes: Membrane and luminescence ==

Since the publication of a simple, accurate and direct dissolved oxygen analytical procedure by Winkler,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, L. W. (1888). "Die zur Bestimmung des in Wasser gelösten Sauerstoffes " Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 21(2): 2843–2854.&lt;/ref&gt; the analysis of dissolved oxygen levels for water has been key to the determination of surface water purity and ecological wellness. The Winkler method is still one of only two analytical techniques used to calibrate oxygen electrode meters; the other procedure is based on oxygen solubility at saturation as per [[Henry's law]]. Though many researchers have refined the Winkler analysis to dissolved oxygen levels in the low PPB range, the method does not lend itself to automation.

The development of an analytical instrument that utilizes the reduction-oxidation (redox) chemistry of oxygen in the presence of dissimilar metal electrodes was introduced during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kemula, W. and S. Siekierski (1950). "Polarometric determination of oxygen." Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 15: 1069–75.&lt;/ref&gt; This redox electrode (also known as dissolved oxygen sensor&lt;ref name=WWT&gt;{{cite news|title=Technically Speaking: dissolved oxygen control|url=http://wwtonline.co.uk/features/technically-speaking-dissolved-oxygen-control|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=Water and Wastewater Treatment|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) utilized an oxygen-permeable membrane to allow the diffusion of the gas into an electrochemical cell and its concentration determined by polarographic or galvanic electrodes. This analytical method is sensitive and accurate to down to levels of ± 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/l dissolved oxygen. Calibration of the redox electrode of this membrane electrode still requires the use of the Henry's law table or the [[Winkler test for dissolved oxygen]].

[[File:Dissolved oxygen sensor in a sewer treatment plant.webm|thumb|Dissolved oxygen sensor in a [[sewage treatment plant]] used as a feedback loop to control the [[Centrifugal fan|blowers]] in an [[aeration]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Calvin|title=Repair or Rethink?|url=http://www.tpomag.com/editorial/2012/04/repair_or_rethink|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=Treatment Plant Operator|issue=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the last two decades, a new form of electrode was developed based on the luminescence emission of a photo active chemical compound and the quenching of that emission by oxygen. It is also called optical dissolved oxygen sensor.&lt;ref name=WWT/&gt; This quenching photophysics mechanism is described by the Stern–Volmer equation for dissolved oxygen in a solution:&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Fresnadillo, D., M. D. Marazuela, et al. (1999). "Luminescent Nafion Membranes Dyed with Ruthenium(II) Complexes as Sensing Materials for Dissolved Oxygen." Langmuir 15(19): 6451–6459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter, et al. (2008). "Evaluation of a new optical sensor for measuring dissolved oxygen by comparison with standard analytical methods." Monatsschr. Brauwiss.(Mar./Apr.): 66-80.&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are several recognized EPA methods for the measurement of dissolved oxygen for BOD, including the following methods:

== Test limitations ==
The test method involves variables limiting reproducibility. Tests normally show observations varying plus or minus ten to twenty percent around the mean.&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hammer, Mark J. | title=Water and Waste-Water Technology | year=1975 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn=0-471-34726-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

=== Toxicity ===
Some wastes contain chemicals capable of suppressing microbiological growth or activity.  Potential sources include industrial wastes, [[antibiotic]]s in pharmaceutical or [[medical waste]]s, sanitizers in food processing or commercial cleaning facilities, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] disinfection used following conventional sewage treatment, and odor-control formulations used in sanitary waste holding tanks in passenger vehicles or portable toilets.  Suppression of the microbial community oxidizing the waste will lower the test result.&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt;{{rp|85}}

=== Appropriate microbial population ===
The test relies upon a microbial ecosystem with enzymes capable of oxidizing the available organic material.  Some waste waters, such as those from biological secondary [[sewage treatment]], will already contain a large population of microorganisms acclimated to the water being tested.  An appreciable portion of the waste may be utilized during the holding period prior to commencement of the test procedure.  On the other hand, organic wastes from industrial sources may require specialized enzymes.  Microbial populations from standard seed sources may take some time to produce those enzymes.  A specialized seed culture may be appropriate to reflect conditions of an evolved ecosystem in the receiving waters.&lt;ref name="Hammer" /&gt;{{rp|85–87}}

== History  ==
The ''[[Royal Commission]] on River Pollution'', which was established in 1865 and the formation of the ''[[Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal]]'' in 1898 led to the selection in 1908 of BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; as the definitive test for organic [[Water pollution|pollution]] of rivers. Five days was chosen as an appropriate test period because this is supposedly the longest time that river water takes to travel from source to [[estuary]] in the [[U.K.]]. In its sixth report the Royal Commission recommended that  the standard set should be 15 parts by weight per million of water.&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924003641929 Final Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Inquire and Report What Methods of Treating and Disposing of Sewage. 1912 ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the Ninth report the commission had revised the recommended standard : &lt;blockquote&gt;" An effluent taking up 2–0 parts dissolved oxygen per 100,000 would be found by a
simple calculation to require dilution with at least 8 volumes of river water taking up 0.2 part if the resulting mixture was not to take up more than 0.4 part. Our experience indicated that in a large majority of cases the volume of river water would exceed 8 times the volume of effluent, and that the figure of 2–0 parts dissolved oxygen per 100,000, which had been shown to be practicable, would be a safe figure to adopt for the purposes of a general standard, taken in conjunction with the condition that the effluent should not contain more than 3–0 parts per 100,000 of suspended solids."&lt;ref name="Royal" /&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;This was the cornerstone 20:30 (BOD:Suspended Solids) + full [[nitrification]] standard which was used as a yardstick in the U.K. up to the 1970s for sewage works [[effluent]] quality.

The [[United States]] includes BOD effluent limitations in its [[sewage treatment|secondary treatment]]  regulations. Secondary sewage treatment is generally expected to remove 85 percent of the BOD measured in sewage and produce effluent BOD concentrations with a 30-day average of less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a 7-day average of less than 45&amp;nbsp;mg/L.  The regulations also describe "treatment equivalent to secondary treatment" as removing 65 percent of the BOD and producing effluent BOD concentrations with a 30-day average less than 45&amp;nbsp;mg/L and a 7-day average less than 65&amp;nbsp;mg/L.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">'''Brachymeiosis''' was a hypothesized irregularity in the [[Ascomycota#Sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction of ascomycete fungi]], a variant of [[meiosis]] following an "extra" [[karyogamy]] (nuclear fusion) step. The hypothesized process would have transformed four [[diploid]] [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] into eight [[haploid]] ones. The current [[scientific consensus]] is that brachymeiosis does not occur in any fungi.&lt;ref name="Carlile"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Carlile | first=Michael J. | title=Two influential mycologists: Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (1879-1967) and Lilian Hawker (1908-1991) | journal=Mycologist | volume=19 | issue=03 | year=2005 | pages=129–131 | doi=10.1017/s0269915x05003058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the current understanding, [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]] reproduce by forming male and female organs ([[Antheridium|antheridia]]/spermatia and [[ascogonium|ascogonia]]), transferring [[haploid]] [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] from the antheridium to the ascogonium, and growing a dikaryotic [[ascus]] containing both nuclei. Karyogamy then occurs in the ascus to form a diploid nucleus, followed by meiosis and [[mitosis]] to form eight haploid nuclei in the [[ascospore]]s.&lt;ref name="Dube"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dube | first=H.C. | title=Introduction To Fungi, 3E | publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Limited | year=2009 | isbn=978-81-259-1433-4 | page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the botanist [[Robert Almer Harper|R.A. Harper]] reported the observation of a second karyogamy event in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny. This would imply the creation of a tetraploid nucleus in the ascus, rather than a diploid one; in order to produce the observed haploid ascospores, a second meiotic reduction in chromosome count would then be necessary. The second reduction was hypothesized to occur during the second or third mitotic division in the ascus, even though chromosome reduction does not typically occur during mitosis. This supposed form of meiosis was termed “brachymeiosis” in 1908 by H. C. I. Fraser.&lt;ref name="Swingle"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Swingle | first=D.B. | title=Fertilization in ''Ascodesmis nigricans'' Van Tiegh| journal=American Journal of Botany | date=1934 | jstor=2436104 | volume=21 |pages=519–545 | doi=10.2307/2436104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of brachymeiosis was controversial throughout the first half of the twentieth century, with many conflicting results published. Then, research with improved staining techniques established clearly that only one reductive division occurs in the asci of all examined species, including some which had been believed to undergo brachymeiosis.&lt;ref name="Hirsch"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hirsch | first=Hilde E. | title=No Brachymeiosis in Pyronema Confluens | journal=Mycologia | volume=42 | issue=2 | year=1950 | page=301 | doi=10.2307/3755444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Olive"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olive |first=L. S. |year=1949 |title=Cytological evidence opposing the theory of brachymeiosis in the ascomycetes |journal=Science |volume=110 |page=185 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/110/2851/185.1 |doi=10.1126/science.110.2851.185}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these studies, the theories of double fusion and subsequent brachymeiosis were discarded around 1950.&lt;ref name="Carlile" /&gt;

'''Chandler Burr''' (born December 30, 1963) is an American [[journalist]], author, and museum curator. 

==Early life and education ==
Born in [[Chicago]] and raised in [[Washington, D.C.]], Burr graduated from [[Principia College]] in [[Elsah, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jun/970677.htm 77 North Washington Street, The Atlantic Online, June 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; He began his [[journalism]] career in 1987 as a [[stringer (journalism)|stringer]] in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'s'' Southeast Asia bureau,&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.chandlerburr.com/bio.htm Official Biography], ChandlerBurr.com&lt;/ref&gt; and later became a Contributing Editor to ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. Burr has also written for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' on [[epidemiology]] and public health. Burr earned a master's degree in [[international economics]] and Japan studies from the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]] (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; 
==Published work==
In 1993, Burr wrote a cover story, "Homosexuality and Biology", for ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandlerburr.com/articles/homosexualitybiology.pdf Chandler Burr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] chandlerburr.com&lt;/ref&gt; The story became the basis for his first book ''[[A Separate Creation]]: The Search for the Biological Origins of Sexual Orientation'' (1996), which investigated [[sexual orientation]] research. ''A Separate Creation'' was published by [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]], a subsidiary of the [[Walt Disney Company]], and its argument that sexual orientation is inborn prompted a call by [[Southern Baptists]] to boycott Disney films and theme parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandlerburr.com/bio.htm Chandler Burr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] chandlerburr.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' published Burr's article "Why Conservatives Should Embrace the Gay Gene", in which he argued that scientific research demonstrating that sexual orientation is biologically determined supports a conservative view of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandlerburr.com/newsite/content/articles/weeklystandard.php Chandler Burr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120220170547/http://www.chandlerburr.com/newsite/content/articles/weeklystandard.php |date=2012-02-20 }} chandlerburr.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Burr's ''The Emperor of Scent'', published in 2003, tells how the French-Italian scientist [[Luca Turin]] originated the theory about the functioning of the [[sense of smell]]. As a result, ''The New Yorker'' proposed that Burr describe the creation of a perfume. Burr's March 2005 ''New Yorker'' article recounted [[Jean-Claude Ellena]]'s year-long creation, in Paris and Grasse, of [[Hermès]]' Un Jardin sur le Nil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/03/14/050314fa_fact Annals of Innovation: The Scent of the Nile : The New Yorker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Burr's ''The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris &amp; New York'', published in 2008, describes Ellena's creation of Un Jardin sur le Nil in Paris, and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]'s creation of [[Lovely (perfume)|Lovely]] in New York City under the license [[aegis]] of the perfume corporation [[Coty, Inc.|Coty]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18238465 NPR] npr.org&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Burr’s novel, ''You Or Someone Like You'', was published by Ecco in summer 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/11120-a-hollywood-novel-that-isn-t-pw-profiles-chandler-burr-.html A Hollywood Novel That Isn't: PW profiles Chandler Burr&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From August 2006 until the end of 2010, Burr was perfume critic of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;
==Museum curation ==
In December 2010 he founded the Department of [[Olfactory art]] at the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in New York City. In December 2010, Burr left ''The New York Times'' to curate the exhibition "The Art of Scent: 1889-2011" at the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in New York City,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basenotes.net/content/626-New-York-s-Museum-of-Art-and-Design-to-open-dedicated-fragrance-department-curated-by-Chandler-Burr?s=3185ed804b468be3cd7a1aa8169b30d3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720144723/http://www.basenotes.net/content/626-New-York-s-Museum-of-Art-and-Design-to-open-dedicated-fragrance-department-curated-by-Chandler-Burr?s=3185ed804b468be3cd7a1aa8169b30d3 |archivedate=2012-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed visitors to experience seminal works by some of the greatest scent artists of the late-19th, 20th and early-21st centuries such as Jean-Claude Ellena, [[Ernest Beaux]], and [[Jacques Cavallier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PR/1000_Filename_Center%20of%20Olfactory%20Art%20and%20Burr%20Announcement%20Release_FINAL.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201412/http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PR/1000_Filename_Center%20of%20Olfactory%20Art%20and%20Burr%20Announcement%20Release_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' reported that when asked about his refusal to display packaging or bottles, Burr replied "[T]he smell [is] the work of art. I’m opposed to the photon. If you have to see it, I’m not interested."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/arts/design/perfume-as-an-art-form-at-museum-of-art-and-design.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Chandler%20Burr%20Carol%20Kino&amp;st=cse Scent of a Museum] by Carol King, ''New York Times'' March 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
==Personal life==
Burr  lives in [[New York City]].

The [[Bogotá]] newspaper ''El Tiempo'' in its edition of 2 December 2011 carried an article on how Burr reportedly had failed to disclose his sexual orientation in petitioning to [[LGBT adoption|adopt]] two Colombian [[orphan]]s. As a result, the Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar halted the adoption proceedings, claiming a lack of candor on Burr's part; Burr responded that the children knew about his sexual orientation and "they didn't care".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/3148 Gay Father Overcomes Discrimination to Win Adoption Case in Colombia] Americas Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 2011 it was reported that the adoptions were made official and that Burr and his adopted sons were reunited.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/ARTICULO-WEB-NEW_NOTA_INTERIOR-10911795.html Estadounidense gay recupera a sus dos hijos adoptados - Noticias de Justicia en Colombia] ELTIEMPO.COM&lt;/ref&gt; 

Burr is an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;"People ask me, "Is there that much to write about perfume?" Lanvin just sent me its latest, Rumeur. If I weren't already an atheist, I would lose my faith in God again. But it gave me an idea for another piece for the Times." Chandler Burr, The Independent (London), September 4, 2006, Pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-profit work==
In 2014 Burr established the Department of Scent Art as an independent [[501c3]] non-profit arts organization based in New York. The DSA produces exhibitions such as ''Hyper-Natural: Scent from Art to Design'' at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], Melbourne.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Beyond Sight|url=http://www.artbeyondsight.org/sidebar/aboutaeb.shtml|website=Art Beyond Sight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary}}
'''Comic relief''' is the inclusion of a [[humour|humorous]] character, scene, or witty dialogue in an otherwise serious work, often to relieve tension.

==Definition==
Comic relief usually means a releasing of emotional or other tension resulting from a comic episode interposed in the midst of serious or tragic elements in a drama. Comic relief often takes the form of a bumbling, [[wikt:wisecrack|wisecrack]]ing [[sidekick]] of the [[hero]] or [[villain]] in a work of fiction. A sidekick used for comic relief will usually comment on the absurdity of the [[hero]]'s situation and make comments that would be inappropriate for a character who is to be taken seriously. Other characters may use comic relief as a means to irritate others or keep themselves confident.

==Use==
Sometimes comic relief characters will appear in fiction that is [[comic]]. This generally occurs when the work enters a [[drama]]tic moment, but the character continues to be comical  regardless.
[[Greek tragedy]] did not allow any comic relief within the drama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/European-History-670/Greek-Tragedy-English-Tragedy.htm|title=Greek Tragedy and English Tragedy|last=Rutherford|first=Sam|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a tradition of concluding a series of several tragic performances with a humorous [[satyr play]]. Even the Elizabethan critic Sidney following [[Horace]]’s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' pleaded for the exclusion of  comic elements  from a tragic  drama. But in the Renaissance England Marlowe among the [[University Wits]] introduced comic relief through  the presentation of crude scenes in Doctor Faustus following the native tradition of Interlude which was usually introduced between two tragic plays. In fact, in the classical tradition the mingling of the tragic and the comic was not allowed.

==Examples==

'''Conservation and restoration of objects made from plastics'''  is an activity dedicated to the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of objects of historical and personal value made from [[plastics]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. Within museum collections there are a variety of artworks and artifacts that are composed of [[plastic]] material whether they are [[Synthetic plastic|synthetic]] or semi-synthetic; these were created for a range of uses from artistic, to technical, to domestic use. Plastics have become an integral component of life and many plastic objects have become staple icons or objects worth preserving for the future.  Although relatively new material for museum collections, plastics having originated in the 19th century, they are deteriorating at an alarming rate, risking the loss not only of the objects themselves, but through their deterioration processes they place objects within their vicinity at risk too.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plastics are made of synthetic, semi-synthetic and organic material, all of which are susceptible to degradation, with their respective off-gassing being harmful to the objects nearby in museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|pmc=2874019|title=Our Plastic Age|last=Thompson|first=Richard|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent changes in plastic manufacturing, as a result of environmental concerns, towards [[biodegradable plastics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/what-you-can-do-keep-plastic-out-ocean.html|title=What You Can Do to Keep Plastic out of the Ocean {{!}} response.restoration.noaa.gov|website=response.restoration.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a potentially negative effect upon the long term stability of such objects within museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madden|first=Odile|date=Spring 2014|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material, a Maturing Profession spring 2014. Conservation of plastics|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/pdf/v29n1.pdf|journal=Conservation Perspectives the GCI Newsletter|volume=|pages=4–9|via=The Getty Conservation Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification and composition of plastics  ==
All plastics vary by the type of polymer used to create it, these polymers are what conservators look to in order to divide plastics into groupings that could best help create a preservation or restoration plan. Groupings are important as some plastics can be dangerous or even flammable thus it is key to identify these plastics in order to best understand how to store and care for them.

== Identifying plastics ==
Identification of plastic in a collection is extremely important because all plastics release a harmful toxin or gas that can damage nearby objects and by being able to identity the most harmful plastics a preservation plan can be set into place to slow down the effects and protect other objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Plastics are identified in three ways including looking for its trade name, trademark or patent number. Identifying plastic is done in order to  check what the plastic is composed of as different makers and depending on the year are different material could have been used to make the plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010|title=Care and Identification of Objects Made from Plastic|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/08-04.pdf|journal=Conserve O Gram|volume=|pages=|via=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no marker to identify the type of plastic used then it can be identified by using various types of data analyzed using [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technology like, [[Optical spectrometer|Optical Spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] and [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infared spectroscopy]] along with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other forms of identification include [[elemental analysis]], thermal analysis to decipher the composition of plastics.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Once the composition is found it is best to determine if the plastic in the collection will be considered Malignant or not.

[http://www.modip.ac.uk/ MoDiP], the Museum of Design in plastics,  has created a guide to plastic objects that includes the objects  manufacturing date,  manufacturing process along with its typical characteristics such as feel and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modip.ac.uk/resources/curators_guide/A-Z_plastics|title=A - Z of plastics materials {{!}} Museum of Design in Plastics, MoDiP|website=www.modip.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because if an object in the collection that is listed here differs from smell or touch then it could be the object has begun to deteriorate. It is also encouraged that if one has an object not listed then they should contact MoDiP to include it to the list.

== Common plastics ==
These are plastics that are still capable of degradation but its effects are not as harmful to nearby objects.The list below is of chemical compositions that make up common plastics found in museum collections:
* Cellulose Esters&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/preserving.html|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material a Maturing Profession (Feature)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plasticized PVC,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ([[Polyvinyl chloride|Polyvinyl Chloride]], PVC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pvc-plastic|title=Everything You Need To Know About PVC Plastic|last=Staff|first=Creative Mechanisms|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are plastics that will age faster if left untreated and have a higher potential or off-gassing or release a toxin that can damage surrounding objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To determine if objects are considered malignant proper identification of the object will be necessary.  
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride)]]
* [[Cellulose nitrate|Cellulose Nitrate]]
* [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]]
* [[Vulcanization|Vulcanized Rubber]] 
* [[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]]

[[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]] have become an issue because as plastic is used in many everyday objects the push to create biodegradable plastics has been on the rise. This causes an issue for conservators because these object will ultimately degrade as their composition is designed to as there is an increase in plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is these biodegradable plastics that can be prove to be difficult and museums will need to provide research for these items quickly to slow done their deterioration.

== Deterioration ==
Perhaps the most difficult part about plastic deterioration is that one cannot visibly see what types of chemical reactions are occurring inside the polymer or even identity the type of plastic until it is too late. Typically all plastics will give off a distinct odor, leak toxins, or will begin to shrink or crack in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/network/identification-of-plastics-by-looking-touching-and-smelling|title=Identification of plastics by looking, touching and smelling|work=Blog|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although deterioration will inevitably happen it is important to know  the causes of it and be able to mitigate it.

=== Causes of deterioration  ===
The cause of deterioration regarding plastics can be linked to age, chemical composition, storage, and improper handling of the objects. Conservators are in place to slow down the processes of deterioration by considering the 4 leading caused of deterioration:

# '''Age'''-  when plastics were first manufactured in the 19th century they were composed of semi-organic material, thus these over the years these objects have deteriorated due to lack of research and improper handling of these plastics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Without enough time to care for objects the older objects have deteriorated. 
# '''Chemical''' - Depending on the objects' chemical composition, conservators can understand how it will react overtime. Other chemical reactions come from heat, oxygen, light, liquids, additives and biological attacks as these can cause a reaction in the polymer to speed up deterioration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Chemical reactions are also caused by objects coming into contact with water and oxygen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
# '''Storage-'''  When objects are improperly stored is when contamination and deterioration can occur. This often occurs when temperature or relative humidity fluctuate in the storage area as this causes the polymers to react to the environment and will begin to deteriorate and possible contaminate surrounding objects. Storage should also be thought of as when an object is on exhibit as this is when the object is on display with lights and its temperature and humidity can fluctuate, being able to create a plan to adjust the exhibit case while on display can help prevent any damage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# '''Improper handling''' - This is due in part to improper cleaning techniques when using water or solvents on material that do not support those cleaning methods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also when handling the objects human error can occur that can cause abrasions or scratches.

=== Types of deterioration  ===
Understanding the different types of plastic chemical degradation as this helps determine what not to expose plastics to  As the polymers that are composed of the plastics can deteriorate easily by changes in temperature, water or light it is important to understand how these affect the polymers. Listed below are the chemical reactions that occur with the deterioration of the polymer's structure.

* '''Photo-oxidative degradation''' refers to plastic object degrading by being exposed to UV and Visible Light although the type of wavelength that will damage the plastic depends on the composition of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Balijit|date=2007|title=Mechanistic Implications of Plastic Degradation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391007003539|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume=93|pages=561–584|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; In General however, plastic will be affected by light and it is best practice to keep plastic away from light sources as much as possible. 
* '''[[Thermal degradation of polymers|Thermal degradation]]''' affects the whole unit of the polymer that the object is composed of and is affected by the temperature and amount of light the object is exposed to.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
* '''Ozone-Induced degradation''' will deteriorate saturated and  unsaturated polymers when the polymer is exposed to "ozone in the air" will speed the process of deterioration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A test is conducted to see if the objects has been exposed by taking small samples and analyzed using an [[FTIR]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''[[Catalysis|Catalytic Degradation]]''' Mainly focuses on plastic waste polymers as they are transformed into hydrocarbons
* '''[[Biodegradation]]''' is when the surface or the strength of the plastic changes, these properties allow it to decompose or mineralize by carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''Decomposition of Hydroperoxides''' is when metal and metal ions are found on the plastic material as this can also lead to the deterioration of the object&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=Physical and Chemical processes leading to deterioration  of original properties of plastic|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/4_Degradation/2_Physical_and_chemical_processes/4_2_PhysicalAndChemicalProcessesLeadingToDeterioration.pdf|journal=Processes Leading to the Deterioration of Plastics|volume=|pages=|via=POPART}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}Additional effects of deterioration

For plastics composed of [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]] the  most common sign of  deterioration condition is when it this type is exposed to water, it will give off a smell of vinegar ([[Vinegar syndrome]]),  its surface will have  a white powder residue  and it will begin to shrink.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Cellulose Acetate butyrate and Cellulose butyrate will produce [[butyric acid]] which has a "vomit odor".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride]]) will most likely cause a blooming effect, white spores, on the surface that if it comes into contact with other surrounding material it will contaminate it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Preventative care  ==
=== Handling ===
Safety gloves such as those made of Nitrile can help prevent toxins entering the skin when handling plastic objects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As plastics can ooze or off-gas material that may or may not be visible to the naked eye wearing gloves other than cotton is recommended.

=== Storage environment ===
Proper storage of plastics can help slow down the degrading process of plastics. Plastics are currently stored with a RH Level of 50% with the storage temperature at 18 degrees Celsius with no light coming into contact with the objects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|date=2014|title=A Safe Space Storage Strategies for Plastics|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/storage.html|journal=Conservation Perspectives|volume=29|pages=|via=http://getty.edu/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the composition of each plastic material can be different it is difficult to determine one unifying storage care plan ,thus  understanding the composition of the plastic can help determine their preferred climate levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Keeping plastics at a stable low temperature or considering placing these objects either in cold storage or in oxygen impermeable bags helps slow degradation.

Monitoring plastics in their storage environment is done by keeping track of their status and condition by using log entries on Excel spreadsheets or another format. To monitoring their temperature environment this is done using data loggers which track hourly changes in temperature. These methods can help strengthen a plan of preventative care as monitoring their status along with temperature can help connect any changes that occur.

=== Long-term storage equipment ===
Adsorbents such as "activated carbon, silica gel and zeolites"  are used as they can help with the gasses that are released from plastics as this material can help slow down the degrading process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These absorbents can also be used when the object is on display to prevent and off-gassing that could occur, so these can be used on exhibit and long-term storage. Absorbents along with acid-free boxes and silica gel can help slow down the process of degradation and [[Cellulose acetate film|vinegar syndrome]] which is common in film, Lego and artwork. A yearly check up of plastic objects can help monitor the condition of plastic objects as well as the condition of the surrounding objects to ensure they have not been contaminated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Objects composed of Cellulose Nitrate  benefit from cold storage as they are sensitive to increases in temperature.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''[http://www.gaylord.com/Preservation/Conservation-Supplies/Wrapping%2C-Lining-%26-Support-Materials/Marvelseal%26%23174%3B-360-Barrier-Film-%2850-ft-%29/p/M3650 Oxygen Impermeable bags]''' are used as they absorb all the oxygen in the bag.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With no oxygen to trigger the event of deterioration that is used for some plastics the process may be slowed down.

== Conservation   ==
The process of conservation and restoration of plastics requires an understanding of composition of the plastic and an appreciation for the possible methods of restoring plastics and their limitations, as well as an appreciation for the post-treatment preventive care of the object.

=== Cleaning ===
The process of cleaning plastics is done through the use of solvents or using modern technology after identifying the polymers that make up the composition of the plastic. Cleaning can still be done using water or solvents however,  solvents run the risk of physically damaging the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/5_Active_conservation/1_Conservation_of_plastics_in_collections/5_1_Introduction.pdf|title=Studies in Active Conservation of Plastic Artefacts in Museums|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|publisher=POPART|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spot test can be performed if uncertain how the object will react to water or solvents.

Light cleaning on the object is possible, but if cleaning requires a heavy hand then the use of  an Erbium: YAG Laser could assist in cleaning tougher scratches or abrasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/eryag-laser|title=Er:YAG laser - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Scratch removal ===
Within the field of contemporary art, where the finish is part of the artists intent the removal of scratches plays a far greater role than it would with social-historical artifacts, as such conservators have undertaken, and scientifically investigated, a variety of methods of scratch removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laganà|first=Ana|date=2014|title=Looking through Plastics: Investigating options for the treatment of scratches, abrasions, and losses in cast unsaturated polyester works of art|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/cons_plastics/related_mats.html|journal=COM-CC 17th Triennial Conference Preprints,|volume=|pages=|via=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/art_LA/paper_2014_icom_cc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filling ===
Fillings are used if the object has suffered considerable damage. The process of filling depends on the objects chemical composition consisting  of- refractive indexes, transparency, low viscosity, and its compatibility with the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-journal/the-use-of-lasers-in-the-conservation-of-museum-objects-made-from-plastics|title=The use of lasers in the conservation of museum objects made from plastics|work=Blog|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defense physiology''' is a term used to refer to the symphony of body function ([[physiology]]) changes which occur in response to a stress or threat.  

When the body executes the  "[[fight-or-flight]]" reaction or stress response, the  nervous system initiates, coordinates and directs specific changes in how the body is functioning ([[physiology]]), preparing the body to deal with the threat.  (See also [[General adaptation syndrome]].)

==Definitions==
stress : As it pertains to the term ''defense physiology'', the term ''stress'' refers to a ''perceived threat'' to the continued functioning of the body / life according to its current state.  

threat : What constitutes a ''threat'' as it pertains to ''defense physiology''?  A ''threat'' may be consciously recognized or not.  A physical event (a loud noise or car collision), a chemical or a biological agent which alters (or has the possibility to alter) body function ([[physiology]]) away from optimum or healthy functioning (or away from its current state of functioning) may be perceived as a ''threat''  (also called a [[Stress (medicine)#Stressors|stressor]]).  

Life circumstances, though posing no immediate physical danger, could be [[perception|perceived]] as a threat.  Anything that could change the continuing of the person’s life as they are currently experiencing it could be perceived as a ''threat''.

==Physiological reactions to threat (or perceived threat) ==
A threat may be either ''empirical'' (an outside observer may agree that the event or circumstance poses a threat) or ''a priori'' (an outside observer would not agree that the event or circumstance poses a threat).  What is important to the individual, in terms of the body’s response, is that a threat is [[perception|perceived]].  

The [[perception]] of a ''threat'' may also trigger an associated ‘feeling of [[stress (medicine)#Folklore of stress|distress]]’.
Physiological reactions triggered by mind cannot differentiate both the physical or mental threat separately, Hence the "fight-or-flight" response of mind for the both reactions will be same.

==Duration of threat and its different physiological effects on the nervous system. ==
'''[[Fight-or-flight response|Acute Stress Reaction]]''' - The body executes the “[[Fight-or-flight response|Fight-or-flight]]” reaction to get the body out of danger quickly.  When the timing between the ''threat'' and the resolution of the ''threat'' are close, the “[[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]]" reaction is executed, the ''threat'' is handled, and the body returns to its previous state (taking care of the business of life - digestion, relaxation, tissue repair etc.).  The body has evolved to stay in this mode for only a short time.

'''[[Fight-or-flight_response#Biology_of_the_stress_response|Chronic Stress State]]''' - When the timing between the ''threat'' and the resolution of the ''threat'' are more distant (the ''threat'' or the perception of ''threat'' is prolonged or other ''threats'' occur before the body has recovered), the “[[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]]" reaction continues and becomes the new ‘standard operating condition’ of the body, '''[[Fight-or-flight_response#Negative effects of the stress response in humans|chronic Defense Physiology]]'''.  Continuing in this mode produces significant negative effects ([[stress (medicine)#Folklore of stress|distress]]) in many aspects of body functioning (physical, mental and emotional [[stress (medicine)#Folklore of stress|distress]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14180">The Drought Research Initiative(DRI) was established to better understand the physical characteristics of and processes influencing Canadian Prairie droughts, and to contribute to their better prediction, through a focus on the recent severe drought that began in 1999 and largely ended in 2005. It is an interdisciplinary effort that involves 15 funded investigators from 6 Canadian universities and more than 20 collaborators from other universities and federal laboratories as well as partners from three provincial governments ([[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]]). DRI is achieving its objective by focusing on five complementary research themes, including quantification, understanding, prediction, comparisons with other droughts, and  implications for society. Details beyond the scope of this entry can be found in Stewart et al. (2008)&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Stewart, R., J. Pomeroy and R. Lawford, 2008: A Drought Research Initiative for the Canadian Prairies, CMOS Bulletin, Vol. 36, No. 3, 97-102.&lt;/ref&gt; or on the [http://www.drinetwork.ca/ DRI website]

==Background==
[[Drought]] is an anomaly within the atmospheric, surface and sub-surface cycling of water and energy, usually initiated through large to regional scale atmospheric processes, and enhanced and maintained through regional to local [[earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]], [[Surface-water hydrology|surface hydrology]], [[land surface]] and [[groundwater]] feedbacks that operate throughout the annual cycle. Droughts are a distinctive feature of the [[Drought in Canada|Canadian Prairies]] where the large scale [[atmospheric circulation]]s are influenced by [[Block (meteorology)|blocking]] from intense [[orography]] to the west and long distances from all warm ocean-derived atmospheric water sources. &lt;br /&gt;
DRI addresses a multi-year drought that began in 1999 with cessation of its atmospheric component in 2004/2005 and many of its hydrological components in 2005.   It was the worst drought for at least a hundred years in parts of the [[Canadian Prairies]]. According to Phillips (2002),&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Phillips, D.W., 2002: The top ten Canadian weather stories for 2001. CMOS Bulletin, 30, 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; for the western and central Canadian Prairies during 2001 and 2002, “… it was the worst of times. Even in the dust bowl of the 1930s, no single year between Medicine Hat, Kindersley and Saskatoon was drier than in 2001”.   The drought affected agriculture, recreation, tourism, health, hydro-electricity, and forestry in the Prairies. [[Gross Domestic Product]] fell some $5.8 billion and employment losses exceeded 41,000 jobs for 2001 and 2002.  This drought also contributed to a negative or zero net farm income for several provinces for the first time in 25 years ([[Statistics Canada]], 2003&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;Statistics Canada, 2003: Net Farm Income. Catalogue No. 21-010-XIE, Volume 2. Ottawa, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;) with agricultural production over Canada dropping an estimated $3.6 billion in 2001/2002.  Previously reliable water supplies such as streams, wetlands, dugouts, reservoirs, and groundwater were placed under stress and often failed. More details are available in Wheaton (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, E, Wittrock V, Kulshreshtha S, Koshida G, Grant C,
Chipanshi A, Bonsal BR (2005) Lessons learned from the
drought years of 2001 and 2002: synthesis report. Agriculture
and Agri-Food Canada, Saskatchewan Research
Council Publ No. 11602–46E03, Saskatoon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Despite the enormous economic, environmental, and societal impacts of droughts, DRI is undertaking the first integrated drought research program of its kind in Canada with the hope being that the occurrence and nature of drought can be better anticipated on short and long term scales.  From a longer-term perspective, this 5-year Network represents an essential step in better predicting droughts over Canada, their detailed structure and their impacts with increasing confidence and better assessing whether there will be a ‘drying of the continental interior’ in the future

==Research Themes==
DRI is achieving its objective by focusing on five complementary research themes, including quantification, understanding, and better prediction of a particular drought with funding primarily from the [[Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences|Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences (CFCAS)]].  Comparisons with other droughts, and implications for society have been funded with additional direct and in-kind support coming from [[Environment Canada]], [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]], [[Natural Resources Canada]], [[Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration|Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA)]], [[Saskatchewan Watershed Authority]], [[Saskatchewan Research Council]], [[Manitoba Water Stewardship]] and [[Manitoba Hydro]].

===1: Characterizing Drought===
To characterize the drought of 1999-2005 DRI has been quantifying its atmospheric, hydrologic, and land-surface physical features at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.  This analysis will be realized by addressing three focused questions:
*What variables are required to quantify the characteristics of this recent drought?
*What data sources and model outputs are available for quantification of these parameters?
*How do we characterize and “close the budgets” of water and energy over the Prairies?

The analysis has involved the development of a four-dimensional assessment of the atmosphere during the drought over various temporal scales using a knowledge of [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[geopotential height]], [[wind]], [[clouds]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] amount, and current [[weather]]. At the surface, the spatial and temporal characteristics of vegetative state (in terms of [[water stress]]) for major vegetation types ([[crop]]s and [[boreal shield|boreal zones]]), [[soil moisture]], [[drainage basin|stream network]], [[river flows]], lake levels, [[wetlands]], [[depression storage capacity|depression storage]], [[groundwater]] and [[subsurface flow|sub-surface flows]] be assessed to determine when and where drought is occurring. Although this is a difficult task due to data gaps, and the complexity of the shallow undulations in the prairies [[topography]], an analysis of [[in-situ]] data, [[earth observation satellite|satellite]] data and model output now provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the drought.

===2: Drought Processes===
DRI is also focusing on the understanding of the processes and feedbacks governing the formation, evolution, cessation and structure of the drought.  This theme addresses the following questions:
*What processes were responsible for the onset of the recent drought?
*What processes and feedbacks contributed to the drought’s evolution, persistence, and spatial structure?
*What processes and feedbacks controlled the termination of this drought?
There are many ways in which drought, basically a sustained precipitation deficit, can be initiated and prolonged.  Some processes that reduce precipitation include, large scale circulation anomalies, lack of moisture advected into a region, reduction of local moisture supplies, production of [[virga]] as opposed to precipitation, and possibly even the role of [[aerosols]] in the dusty environment acting to reduce precipitation.  Over the five years of this drought, these processes and numerous other factors were operating at various times and locations to preclude substantial precipitation from being produced over large regions of the Prairies.  &lt;br /&gt;
While prairie drought processes have characteristic spatial and temporal scales, land surface hydrological/biophysical processes generally operate at small spatial scales (and with larger inherent spatial variability) while atmospheric process have a hierarchy of scales ranging from planetary to local turbulence.  DRI is addressing the cascade of energy and movement of moisture through atmospheric processes and the horizontal scale link between land surface and groundwater processes during drought events.

===3: Drought Prediction===
Drought prediction research in DRI is directed at assessing and reducing uncertainties in the prediction of drought and its structure. In particular, prediction research has focused on the evaluation and improvement of prediction models.  The modelling tools used are [[global climate model|global]] and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs), and [[hydrological model]]s.  The hydrological models are driven by output from the [[atmospheric models]], data from ongoing research sites and reanalysis products.  DRI modeling studies address the following questions:
*How well was the current drought predicted based on current techniques?
*To what extent could this prediction be improved through better initialization?
*To what extent could this prediction be improved through dynamical [[downscaling]] and better [[physics]]?
*What are the appropriate scales and processes for prediction of Prairie droughts?
Use is being made of archived historical model outputs and new simulations to address many of these issues. DRI focuses on many facets of a particular extreme and consequently many more variables beyond the traditional temperature and precipitation need to be examined. For example, experiments carried out within DRI are helping to assess the role of [[soil moisture]] and [[snow cover]] on seasonal prediction.

===4:  Drought Comparisons===
Theme 4 provides comparisons of the recent drought and previous droughts over this region and those in other regions, in the context of [[climate variability]] and [[climate change|change]].  For many users there is a need to understand a current or recent drought event in the context of historical droughts.  These comparisons are guided by the following research questions:
*How do the physical features, processes, and feedbacks of the recent Canadian Prairie drought compare with a) previous droughts over the [[Drought in Canada|Canadian Prairies]], b) [[Drought in Canada|Canada-wide droughts]], c) [[Drought in the United States|US Great Plains droughts]], and d) [[drought|droughts across the world]]?
*How does the prediction of the recent drought compare with predictions of other droughts?
*How does the recent drought compare with past [[climate variability]] and projected [[climate change]]?
Comparisons between the 1999-2004/05 drought have focused on the internal structure of drought, as well as its presence over a particular region.  Many droughts, including the 1999-2005 event have a complex internal structure for their precipitation patterns which often changed dramatically during the drought.  More details on these comparisons are available in Bonsal (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Bonsal, B., 2008: Droughts in Canada: an overview. CMOS Bulletin, Vol. 36, No. 3, 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===5: Drought Impacts===
Theme 5 applies our progress in drought characterization and prediction to critical issues of importance to society during times of drought.  These efforts are linked to the following questions:
*What organizations are affected by drought?
*What exactly is the nature of their impact and how can this be alleviated?
*Given the progress being made by the Network, how can it address drought impacts on affected organizations?
In order to advance this theme, DRI has carried out an extensive consultative process with the users; has launched a set of simulation exercises to test how users may adapt new DRI products to make better decisions through an exercise known as DEWS (Drought Early Warning System test), and formed a Partners Advisory Committee composed of experts from user agencies and groups to give advice on their needs for DRI research and information.  More details are available in Lawford et al. (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Lawford, R., H. Hill, E. Wheaton, I. Hanuta, A. Warkentin, B. Girling and R. Stewart, 2008: A review of some requirements for drought information on the Canadian Prairies. CMOS Bulletin, Vol. 36, No. 3, 97-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Structure and Linkages==
DRI is led by two Principal Investigators, Drs. Ronald Stewart and John Pomeroy.  A Board of Directors, chaired by Jim Bruce oversees the program strategy and a Science Committee takes the day-to-day decisions about the implementation of the project. In addition, the operational details are implemented by a Secretariat consisting of a Network Manager, a Financial Manager and two Data Managers.  A Partners Advisory Committee, chaired by Harvey Hill, also meets and reports on the user needs to the Board of Directors. The program have also established strong linkages and collaborations with research initiatives and departments and on provincial, federal and international levels. The detailed program structure and linkages can be found in Stewart et al., (2008).&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

==The DRI Legacy==
DRI has brought together an unprecedented amount of information on [[Drought in Canada|Canadian drought]]. On its [http://www.drinetwork.ca web site], one can find many links to various datasets that describe elements of drought in the atmosphere, at the surface or below the surface.  Compiling a Prairie-wide database of provincial groundwater and water levels is part of this effort. The data are being brought together in an integrated information system.  Synthesis articles, special issue of [http://www.cmos.ca/pubs.html#Atmosphere-Ocean Atmosphere-Ocean] and a public information document about the 1999-2005 drought are in preparation.  In addition, new techniques of archiving and making available datasets are being explored as one other legacy of DRI.  Undoubtedly, the greatest legacy of DRI will be the young people who have been trained at the PhD, Masters and early scientist level who carried out much of this research and are now pursuing lifetime careers in disciplines related to DRI.

{{refimprove|date=October 2008}}

The '''efficiency''' of an entity (a [[machine|device]], [[electronic component|component]], or [[system]]) in [[electronics]] and [[electrical engineering]] is defined as useful power output divided by the total electrical power consumed (a [[vulgar fraction|fractional]] [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]), typically denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] small letter [[eta]] (η – ήτα).

: &lt;math&gt;

\mathrm{Efficiency}=\frac{\mathrm{Useful\ power\ output}}{\mathrm{Total\ power\ input}}
&lt;/math&gt;
If energy output and input are expressed in the same units, efficiency is a [[dimensionless number]]. Where it is not customary or convenient to represent input and output energy in the same units, efficiency-like quantities have units associated with them.  For example, the [[heat rate (efficiency)|heat rate]] of a fossil-fuel power plant may be expressed in [[British thermal unit|BTU]] per [[kilowatt-hour]]. [[Luminous efficacy]] of a light source expresses the amount of visible light for a certain amount of power transfer and has the units of [[lumen (unit)|lumens]] per watt.

== Efficiency of typical electrical devices ==

''Efficiency'' should not be confused with ''[[effectiveness]]'': a system that wastes most of its input power but produces exactly what it is meant to is effective but not efficient. The term "efficiency" makes sense only in reference to the wanted effect. A [[light bulb]], for example, might have 2% efficiency at emitting light yet still be 98% efficient at heating a room (In practice it is nearly 100% efficient at heating a room because the light energy will also be converted to heat eventually, apart from the small fraction that leaves through the windows). An [[electronic amplifier]] that delivers 10 watts of power to its load (e.g., a [[loudspeaker]]), while drawing 20 watts of power from a power source is 50% efficient. (10/20 × 100 = 50%)
* Electric kettle: more than 90%{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} (comparatively little heat energy is lost during the 2 to 3 minutes a kettle takes to boil water).
* A premium efficiency electric motor: more than 90% ''(see Main Article: [[Premium efficiency]]).''
* A large power [[transformer]] used in the electrical grid may have efficiency of more than 99%. Early 19th century transformers were much less efficient, wasting up to a third of the energy passing through them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}
* In electrical power generation steam power plant have 30-40 % efficiency.

== Efficiency of devices at point of maximum power transfer ... ==

As a result of the [[maximum power theorem]], devices transfer maximum power to a load when running at 50% electrical efficiency. This occurs when the load resistance (of the device in question) is equal to the internal [[Thévenin's theorem|Thevenin equivalent]] resistance of the power source.  This is valid only for non-reactive source and load impedances.

== Efficiency of light bulbs ==
{{details|Luminous efficacy}}

[[Image:LampEfficiency.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Diagram of efficiency for various types of lamps]]

* [[Incandescent light bulb]]: about 2%.
* [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]: about 7–9%.
* White [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) about 4–18%.

== Discussion ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
High efficiency is particularly relevant in [[system]]s that can operate from [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Inefficiency may require weighing the cost either of the wasted energy, or of the required [[power supply]], against the cost of attaining greater efficiency. Efficiency can usually be improved by choosing different components or by redesigning the system. Inefficiency probably produces extra heat within the system, which must be removed if it is to remain within its [[operating temperature]] range.  In a climate-controlled environment, like a home or office, heat generated by appliances may reduce heating costs or increase air conditioning costs.

EtherSound is intended by the developer to be compliant with [[IEEE 802.3]] Ethernet standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Tech Focus: Digital Audio Networks, Part 2 — The Major Players |author=Dan Daley |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.sportsvideo.org/2016/05/05/tech-focus-digital-audio-networks-part-2-the-major-players/ |work=SVG News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the IEEE defines rates such as [[Fast Ethernet|100 Megabit]] and [[Gigabit Ethernet]] standards, EtherSound has been developed as both ES-100 (for use on dedicated 100 Megabit Ethernet networks or within a Gigabit network as a VLAN) and ES-Giga (for use on dedicated Gigabit Ethernet networks). The two versions of EtherSound are not compatible.

==Network technology==
While Ethersound is compliant with the IEEE 802.3 [[physical layer]] standards, logically it uses a [[token passing]] scheme of transporting audio data which prevents all of its features from being used on a standard Ethernet network. On a standard network it is only able to distribute audio and control data one way. It is not designed to share Ethernet [[LAN]]s with typical office operations data or Internet traffic such as email. It supports two way communications only when wired in a daisy chain topology.&lt;ref name="AES"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Best Practices in Network Audio |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |year=2009 |url=http://www.aes.org/technical/documents/AESTD1003V1.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Ethersound is best used in applications suitable to a daisy chain network topology or in live sound applications that benefit from its low point-to-point latency.

==Low latency==
Low latency is important for many users of [[Audio over Ethernet]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Studer, Digigram partner for connectivity |work=Television Broadcast |date=2007|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-167104123.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;One of the most critical applications involves picking up sound from a vocalist's or instrumentalist's microphone on a live performance stage, mixing that signal with those received from other microphones (and performers) and delivering the mix to the performer via [[in-ear monitors]]. Latency in this application is particularly annoying to vocalists. This is because a singer hears his or her own voice through [[bone conduction]] as well as through the outer ear. If the sound from the in-ear monitor lags the bone-conduction sound by more than a few milliseconds, [[phase shifts]] and [[comb filter]]ing will become audible.&lt;/ref&gt; EtherSound can deliver up to 64 channels of 48&amp;nbsp;kHz, 24-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio data with a network latency of 125 [[microseconds]]. Each device in a [[daisy chain (network topology)|daisy-chain]] network adds 1.5 microseconds of latency. EtherSound's network latency is stable and deterministic: the delay between any two devices on an EtherSound network can be calculated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10645">[[File:XASFig.jpg|thumb|Three regions of XAS data|440x440px]] '''X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy''' ([[X-ray absorption spectroscopy|XAS]]) includes both '''Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure''' (EXAFS) and '''X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure''' ([[XANES]]). XAS is the measurement of the [[x-ray]] [[absorption coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt; \mu (E) &lt;/math&gt; in the equations below) of a material as a function of energy. X-rays of a narrow energy resolution are shone on the sample and the incident and transmitted x-ray intensity is recorded as the incident x-ray energy is incremented. The number of x-ray photons that are transmitted through a sample (I&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) is equal to the number of x-ray photons shone on the sample (I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) multiplied by a decreasing exponential that depends on the type of atoms in the sample, the absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and the thickness of the sample &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt; I_t = I_0 e^{-\mu x} &lt;/math&gt;

The absorption coefficient is obtained by taking the log ratio of the incident x-ray intensity to the transmitted x-ray intensity. 

&lt;math&gt; \mu = \frac{-\mathrm{ln}({I}_{t}/{I}_{0})}{x} &lt;/math&gt;

When the incident x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an [[electron]] of an atom within the sample, the number of x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing a drop in the transmitted x-ray intensity. This results in an absorption edge. Each element on the periodic table has a set of unique absorption edges corresponding to different binding energies of its electrons, giving XAS element selectivity. XAS spectra are most often collected at [[synchrotron]]s. Because X-rays are highly penetrating, XAS samples can be gases, solids or liquids.  And because of the brilliance of synchrotron X-ray sources the concentration of the absorbing element can be as low as a few ppm. 

EXAFS [[Absorption spectrum|spectra]] are displayed as graphs of the [[absorption coefficient]] of a given material versus [[energy]], typically in a 500 – 1000 [[Electron volt|eV]] range beginning before an [[absorption edge]] of an element in the sample. The x-ray absorption coefficient is usually normalized to unit step height. This is done by regressing a line to the region before and after the absorption edge, subtracting the pre-edge line from the entire data set and dividing by the absorption step height, which is determined by the difference between the pre-edge and post-edge lines at the value of E0 (on the absorption edge).

The normalized absorption spectra are often called [[XANES]] spectra. These spectra can be used to determine the average oxidation state of the element in the sample. The XANES spectra are also sensitive to the coordination environment of the absorbing atom in the sample.  Finger printing methods have been used to match the XANES spectra of an unknown sample to those of known "standards". Linear combination fitting of several different standard spectra can give an estimate to the amount of each of the known standard spectra within an unknown sample.

X-ray absorption spectra are produced over the range of 200 – 35,000 eV. The dominant physical process is one where the absorbed photon ejects a core [[photoelectron]] from the absorbing atom, leaving behind a core hole. The atom with the core hole is now excited.  The ejected photoelectron’s energy will be equal to that of the absorbed photon minus the [[binding energy]] of the initial core state. The ejected photoelectron interacts with electrons in the surrounding non-excited atoms.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:EXAFS.png|thumb|300px|right|Schematics of the EXAFS process illustrating the origin of EXAFS oscillations due to the interference of outgoing and backscattered photoelectron wave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p-ng.si/~arcon/xas/exafs/exafs.htm Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure, Dr. Alojz Kodre ''et al.'']&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;If the ejected photoelectron is taken to have a [[wave]]-like nature and the surrounding atoms are described as point scatterers, it is possible to imagine the [[backscatter]]ed electron waves interfering with the forward-propagating waves. The resulting interference pattern shows up as a [[modulation]] of the measured absorption coefficient, thereby causing the oscillation in the EXAFS spectra. A simplified plane-wave single-scattering theory has been used for interpretation of EXAFS spectra for many years, although modern methods (like FEFF, GNXAS) have shown that curved-wave corrections and multiple-scattering effects can not be neglected. The photelectron scattering amplitude in the low energy range (5-200 eV) of the photoelectron kinetic energy  become much larger so that multiple scattering events become dominant in the [[XANES]]  (or NEXAFS) spectra.

The [[wavelength]] of the photoelectron is dependent on the energy and phase of the backscattered wave which exists at the central atom. The wavelength changes as a function of the energy of the incoming photon. The [[phase (waves)|phase]] and [[amplitude]] of the backscattered wave are dependent on the type of atom doing the backscattering and the distance of the backscattering atom from the central atom. The dependence of the scattering on atomic species makes it possible to obtain information pertaining to the chemical coordination environment of the original absorbing (centrally excited) atom by analyzing these EXAFS data.

==Experimental considerations==

Since EXAFS requires a tunable x-ray source, data are always collected at [[synchrotron]]s, often at [[beamline]]s which are especially optimized for the purpose. The utility of a particular synchrotron to study a particular solid depends on the [[Luminosity#In_scattering_theory_and_accelerator_physics|brightness]] of the x-ray flux at the absorption edges of the relevant elements.

== Applications ==

XAS is an interdisciplinary technique and its unique properties, as compared to x-ray diffraction, have been exploited for
understanding the details of local structure in:

* [[glass]], [[amorphous]] and [[liquid]] systems
* [[Solid solution|solid solutions]]
* [[Doping (semiconductor)|Doping]] and [[Ion implantation|ionic implantation]] of materials for [[electronics]]
* local distortions of crystal lattices
* [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic compounds]]
* [[metalloproteins]]
* [[Cluster chemistry|metal clusters]]
* vibrational dynamics{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* [[ions]] in [[solutions]]
* [[speciation]] of elements

==Example of Significance==

EXAFS is, like [[XANES]], a highly sensitive technique with elemental specificity.  As such, EXAFS is an extremely useful way to determine the chemical state of practically important species which occur in very low abundance or concentration. Frequent use of EXAFS occurs in [[environmental chemistry]], where scientists try to understand the propagation of [[pollutant]]s through an [[ecosystem]]. EXAFS can be used along with [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] in [[forensic]] examinations, particularly in [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[non-proliferation]] applications.

For an example of an EXAFS study of [[uranium]] chemistry in [[glass]] see [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/459339-8dNh9T/webviewable/459339.pdf], and for a general study of trivalent [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in [[chloride]] containing aqueous media can be read at [http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/activity_rep/ar98/2525-edelstein.pdf]

==History==

A very detailed, balanced and informative account about the history of EXAFS (originally called Kossel's structures) is given in the paper "A History of the X-ray Absorption Fine Structure" by R. Stumm von Bordwehr, Ann. Phys. Fr. vol. 14, 377-466 (1989).
A more modern and accurate account of the history of XAFS (EXAFS and XANES) is given by the leader of the group that developed the modern version of XAFS in the award lecture "Musings about the development of the XAFS" by Edward A. Stern, J. Synchrotron Rad. (2001). 8, 49-54.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22322">'''Eyewitness testimony''' is the account a bystander or victim gives in the courtroom, describing what that person observed that occurred during the specific incident under investigation. Ideally this recollection of events is detailed; however, this is not always the case. This recollection is used as evidence to show what happened from a witness' point of view.  Memory recall has been considered a credible source in the past, but has recently come under attack as forensics can now support psychologists in their claim that memories and individual perceptions can be unreliable, manipulated, and biased. Due to this, many countries and states within the US are now attempting to make changes in how eyewitness testimony is presented in court. Eyewitness testimony is a specialized focus within [[cognitive psychology]].

==Reliability==
Psychologists have probed the reliability of eyewitness testimony since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Wells |first1= G. L. |last2= Memon |first2= A. |last3= Penrod |first3= S. D. |year= 2006 |title= Eyewitness Evidence: Improving Its Probative Value |journal= Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume= 7 |page= 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent pioneer was [[Hugo Münsterberg]], whose controversial book ''On the Witness Stand'' (1908) demonstrated the fallibility of eyewitness accounts, but met with fierce criticism, particularly in legal circles.&lt;ref name = "Mberg legacy"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Memon |first1= A. |last2= Mastroberardino |first2= S. |last3= Fraser |first3= J. |year= 2008 |title= Münsterberg's Legacy: What Does Eyewitness Research Tell Us About the Reliability of Eyewitness Testimony? |journal= Applied Cognitive Psychology |volume= 22 |pages= 841–851 |doi= 10.1002/acp.1487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas did, however, gain popularity with the public.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, John D. (2009). "A Conceptual History of Psychology". New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, DNA testing would clear individuals convicted on the basis of errant eyewitness testimony. Studies by Scheck, Neufel, and Dwyer showed that many  DNA-based exonerations involved eyewitness evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, B., Neufeld, P., &amp; Dwyer, J. (2000). ''Actual Innocence''. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and '80s, Bob Buckhout showed inter alia that eyewitness conditions can, at least within ethical and other constraints, be simulated on university campuses,&lt;ref name = "Mberg legacy" /&gt; and that large numbers of people can be mistaken: "Nearly 2,000 witnesses can be wrong" was the title of one paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Buckhout |first= R. |year= 1980 |title= 
 Nearly 2,000 witnesses can be wrong |journal= Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society |volume= 16 |issue= 4 |pages= 307–310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms by which flaws enter eyewitness testimony are varied and can be quite subtle.

One way is a person's memory being influenced by things seen or heard after the crime occurred. This distortion is known as the post-event [[misinformation effect]] (Loftus and Palmer, 1974). After a crime occurs and an eyewitness comes forward, law enforcement tries to gather as much information as they can to avoid the influence that may come from the environment, such as the media. Many times when the crime is surrounded by much publicity, an eyewitness may experience source [[Misattribution of memory | misattribution]]. Source misattribution occurs when a witness is incorrect about where or when they have the memory from. If a witness cannot correctly identify the source of their retrieved memory, the witness is seen as not reliable.

While some witnesses see the entirety of a crime happen in front of them, some witness only part of a crime. These witnesses are more likely to experience [[confirmation bias]]. Witness expectations are to blame for the distortion that may come from confirmation bias. For example, Lindholm and Christianson (1998) found that witnesses of a mock crime who did not witness the whole crime, nevertheless testified to what they expected would have happened. These expectations are normally similar across individuals due to the details of the environment.

Evaluating the credibility of eye-witness testimony falls on all individual jurors when such evidence is offered as testimony in a trial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, Barbara and Fisher, George. (1999). "The Problem with Eyewitness Testimony". Stanford:Stanford Journal of Legal Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that mock juries are often unable to distinguish between a false and accurate eyewitness testimony. "Jurors" often appear to correlate the confidence level of the witness with the accuracy of their testimony. An overview of this research by Laub and Bornstein shows this to be an inaccurate gauge of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;
Laub, Cindy, &amp; Bornstein, Brian H. (2008) "Juries and Eyewitnesses". Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research on eyewitness testimony looks at systematic variables or estimator variables. Estimator variables are characteristics of the witness, event, testimony, or testimony evaluators. Systematic variables are variables that are, or have the possibility of, being controlled by the criminal justice system. Both sets of variables can be manipulated and studied during research, but only system variables can be controlled in actual procedure.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt;

===Estimator variables===

====Age of Witness====
Among children, suggestibility can be very high. Suggestibility is the term used when a witness accepts information after the actual event and incorporates it into the memory of the event itself.  Children's developmental level (generally correlated with age) causes them to be more easily influenced by leading questions, misinformation, and other post-event details. Compared to older children, preschool-age children are more likely to fall victim to suggestions without the ability to focus solely on the facts of what happened.&lt;ref&gt;Bruck, Maggie and Stephen J Ceci. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1999. 50:419–39 Copyright Ó 1999 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved kj&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a recent meta-analysis found that older adults (over age 65) tend to be more susceptible to memory distortion brought about by misleading post-event information, compared to young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, L. E., Patihis, L., McCuller, L. L., Davis, D., Brank, E. M., Loftus, E. F., &amp; Bornstein, B. H. (2014). Misinformation effects in older versus younger adults: A meta-analysis and review. In M. P. Toglia, D. F. Ross, J. Pozzulo, &amp; E. Pica (Eds) The Elderly Eyewitness in Court, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reconstructive memory====
{{main|Reconstructive memory}}
Many of the early studies of memory demonstrated how memories can fail to be accurate records of experiences. Because jurors and judges do not have access to the original event, it is important to know whether a testimony is based on actual experience or not.&lt;ref&gt;Mori, Naohisa. Styles of remembering and types of experience: An experimental investigation of reconstructive memory. Integrative Psychological &amp; Behavioral Science, Vol 42(3), Sep, 2008. pp. 291-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1932 study,  [[Frederic Bartlett]] demonstrated how serial reproduction of a story distorted accuracy in recalling information. He told participants a complicated Native American story and had them repeat it over a series of intervals. With each repetition, the stories were altered. Even when participants recalled accurate information, they filled in gaps with information that would fit their personal experiences. His work showed [[long term memory]] to be adaptable.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology]. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett viewed [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s as a major cause of this occurrence. People attempt to place past events into existing representations of the world, making the memory more coherent. Instead of remembering precise details about commonplace occurrences, a schema is developed. A schema is a generalization formed mentally based on experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen K. Reed. (2010). Cognition. San Diego:Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning, 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The common use of these schemas suggests that memory is not an identical reproduction of experience, but a combination of actual events with already existing schemas. Bartlett summarized this issue, explaining 
{{Bq|1=&lt;!--
--&gt;[M]emory is personal, not because of some intangible and hypothetical persisting ‘self ’, which receives and maintains innumerable traces, restimulating them whenever it needs; but because the mechanism of adult human memory demands an organisation of ‘schemata’ depending upon an interplay of appetites, instincts, interests and ideas peculiar to any given subject. Thus if, as in some pathological cases, these active sources of the ‘schemata’ get cut off from one another, the peculiar personal attributes of what is remembered fail to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further research of schemas shows memories that are inconsistent with a schema decay faster than those that match up with a schema. Tuckey and Brewer found pieces of information that were inconsistent with a typical robbery decayed much faster than those that were schema consistent over a 12-week period, unless the information stood out as being extremely unusual. The use of schemas has been shown to increase the accuracy of recall of schema-consistent information but this comes at the cost of decreased recall of schema-inconsistent information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuckey | first1 = Michelle Rae | last2 = Brewer | first2 = Neil | year = 2003 | title = How Schemas Affect Eyewitness Memory Over Repeated Retrieval Attempts | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 7| pages = 785–800 | doi=10.1002/acp.906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misinformation effect====
{{main|Elizabeth Loftus|Misinformation effect}}
Elizabeth Loftus is one of the leading psychologists in the field of eyewitness testimony. She provided extensive research on this topic, revolutionizing the field with her bold stance that challenges the credibility of eyewitness testimony in court.  She suggests that memory is not reliable and goes to great lengths to provide support for her arguments. She mainly focuses on the integration of misinformation with the original memory, forming a new memory.  
Some of her most convincing experiments support this claim:
#In one of her experiments, Loftus demonstrates that false verbal Information can integrate with original memory. Participants were presented with either truthful information or misleading information, and overall it showed that even the false information verbally presented became part of the memory after the participant was asked to recall details. This happens because of one of two reasons. First, it can alter the memory, incorporating the misinformation in with the actual, true memory. Second, the original memory and new information may both reside in memory in turn creating two conflicting ideas that compete in recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|last2=Miller|first2=David G.|last3=Burns|first3=Helen J.|title=Semantic integration of verbal information into a visual memory.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory|date=1978|volume=4|issue=1|pages=19–31|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.4.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Loftus conducted more experiments to prove the reliability of expert psychological testimony versus the accepted basic eyewitness testimony. It was found that jurors who hear about a violent crime are more likely to convict a defendant than of one from a nonviolent crime. To reduce this tendency for a juror to quickly accuse, and perhaps wrongly accuse, choosing to utilize expert psychological testimony causes the juror to critically appraise the eyewitness testimony, instead of quickly reaching a faulty verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|title=Impact of expert psychological testimony on the unreliability of eyewitness identification.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1980|volume=65|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.65.1.9|pmid=7364708}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Also, it has been shown that intelligence and gender has a role in the ability of accurate memory recall.  Participants were measured in eyewitness performance in two areas: 1) the ability to resist adding misinformation to the memory and 2) accuracy of recalling the incident and person.  It showed that when a woman was recalling information about a woman, the resistance to false details was higher and the recall was more accurate.  If a man was recalling an incident involving a man, similarly the recall was more accurate.  However, when dealing with opposite genders, the participants gave into the suggestibility (misinformation) more easily and demonstrated less accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=Peter A.|last2=Andriks|first2=Joyce L.|last3=Loftus|first3=Elizabeth F.|title=Eyewitness accounts of females and males.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1979|volume=64|issue=3|pages=339–347|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.64.3.339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Facial recognition is a good indicator of how easily memories can be manipulated. In this specific experiment, if a misleading feature was presented, more than a third of the participants recalled that detail. With a specific detail, almost 70% of people claimed that it had been there, when it had not been present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|last2=Greene|first2=Edith|title=Warning: Even memory for faces may be contagious.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|date=1980|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–334|doi=10.1007/BF01040624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic variables===

====Type of questioning====
As early as 1900, psychologists like [[Alfred Binet]] recorded how the phrasing of questioning during an investigation could alter witness response. Binet believed people were highly susceptible to suggestion, and called for a better approach to questioning witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Binet, Alfred.(1900) ''La Suggestibilite''&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies conducted by Crombag (1996) discovered that in an incident involving a crew attempting to return to the airport but were unable to maintain flight and crashed into an 11-story apartment building. Though no cameras caught the moment of impact on film, many news stations covered the tragedy with footage taken after impact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/plane-crashes-into-apartment-building&lt;/ref&gt; Ten months after the event, the researchers interviewed people about the crash. According to theories about [[flashbulb memory]], the intense shock of the event should have made the memory of the event incredibly accurate. This same logic is often applied to those who witness a criminal act. To test this assumption, participants were asked questions that planted false information about the event. Fifty-five percent of subjects reported having watched the moment of impact on television, and recalled the moment the plane broke out in flames-even though it was impossible for them to have seen either of these occurrences. One researcher remarked, "[V]ery critical sense would have made our subjects realize that the implanted information could not possibly be true. We are still at a loss as to why so few of them realized this."

A survey of research on the matter confirm eyewitness testimony consistently changes over time and based on the type of questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunning | first1 = David | last2 = Stern | first2 = Lisa Beth | year = 1992 | title = Examining the Generality of Eyewitness Hypermnesia: A Close Look at Time Delay and Question Type | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 643–657 | doi=10.1002/acp.2350060707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach investigators and lawyers take in their questioning has repeatedly shown to alter eyewitness response. One study showed changing certain words and phrases resulted in an increase in overall estimations of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Libscomb, Thomas, McAllister, Hunter, &amp; Bregman, Norman. (2001). Bias in Eyewitness Accounts: The Effects of Question Format, Delay Interval, and Stimulus Presentation. ''The Journal of Psychology,'' 207-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improving eyewitness testimony==
Law enforcement, legal professions, and psychologists have worked together in attempts to make eyewitness testimony more reliable and accurate. Geiselman, Fisher, MacKinnon, and Holland saw much improvement in eyewitness memory with an interview procedure they referred to as the [[cognitive interview]]. The approach focuses on making witness aware of all events surrounding a crime without generating false memories or inventing details. In this tactic,  the interviewer builds a rapport with the witness before asking any questions.&lt;ref&gt;Ghetti, S., Goodman, G. S., Schaaf, J. M. &amp; Qin, J. (2004). Issues In Eyewitness Testimony. In W. T. O'Donohue, &amp; E. R. Levensky (Eds.), ''Handbook of Forensic Psychology'' (pp. 532). San Diego, CA: Elsevier Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; They then allow the witness to provide an open ended account of the situation. The interviewer then asks follow up questions to clarify the witness' account, reminding the witness it is acceptable to be unsure and move on.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt; This approach guides the witness over a rigid protocol. When implemented correctly, the CI showed more accuracy and efficiency without additional incorrect information being generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geiselman | first1 = R. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = Ronald | last3 = MacKinnon | first3 = David | last4 = Holland | first4 = Heidi | year = 1986 | title = Enhancement of eyewitness memory with the cognitive interview | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 385–401 | doi=10.2307/1422492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, this is the U.S. Department of Justice's suggested method for law enforcement officials to use in obtaining information from witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice, "Eyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement."&lt;/ref&gt; Programs training officers in this method have been developed outside the U.S. in many European countries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R.P. (2005). ''The cognitive interview: Question &amp; answers''. Ashburn, Virginia: The National Transportation Safety Board Academy. Retrieved June 13, 2006, from http://www.ntsb.gov/ Academy/courseinfo/Q&amp;A_Fisher.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While some analysis of police interviewing technique reveals this change towards CI interviewing is not put into effect by many officials in the U.S.A. and the U.K., it is still considered to be the most effective means of decreasing error in eyewitness testimony.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memon, A., Meissner, C. A., &amp; Fraser, J. (2010). The cognitive interview: A meta-analytic review and study space analysis of the past 25 years. Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 16[4], 340-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural reforms==
Experts debate what changes need to occur in the legal process in response to research on inaccuracy of eyewitness testimony.

===Jury guidelines===
It has been suggested that the jury be given a checklist to evaluate eyewitness testimony when given in court. R. J. Shafer offers this checklist for evaluating eyewitness testimony: 
:* How well could the eyewitness observe the thing he reports? Were his senses equal to the observation? Was his physical location suitable to sight, hearing, touch? Did he have the proper social ability to observe: did he understand the language, have other expertise required (e.g., law, military)?
:*When did he report in relation to his observation? Soon? Much later?
:*Are there additional clues to intended veracity? Was he indifferent on the subject reported, thus probably not intending distortion? Did he make statements damaging to himself, thus probably not seeking to distort? Did he give incidental or casual information, almost certainly not intended to mislead?
:*Do his statements seem inherently improbable: e.g., contrary to human nature, or in conflict with what we know?
:*Remember that some types of information are easier to observe and report on than others.
:*Are there inner contradictions in the testimony? &lt;ref&gt;Garraghan, Gilbert J. (1946). A Guide to Historical Method. New York: Fordham University Press. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judge guidelines===
In 2011, the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] created new rules for the admissibility of eyewitness testimony in court. The new rules require judges to explain to jurors any influences that may heighten the risk for error in the testimony. The rules are part of nationwide court reform that attempts to improve the validity of eyewitness testimony and lower the rate of false conviction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/nyregion/in-new-jersey-rules-changed-on-witness-ids.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The FORAN System&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sener.es/EPORTAL_DOCS/GENERAL/SENERV2/DOC-cw49c0bed4e7a4e/FORAN45yearsasaworldreference.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is an integrated CAD/CAM/CAE system developed by [[SENER]] for the design and production of practically any naval ship and offshore unit. It is a multidisciplinary and integrated system that can be used in all the ship design and production phases and disciplines. The System&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senermar.es/NAVAL/foran/en&lt;/ref&gt; collects all the information in a single database. FORAN is mainly focused on the design of: 
* Merchants, Ro-Pax, Ro-Ro, bulk carriers, chemical tankers, container ships and cement and oil tankers.
* Navy vessels (surface ships and submarines), in which the systems allows designers to carry out configuration control, analyze different design alternatives (prototypes), handle advanced hull forms and manage materials and special standards, as well as introducing customized criteria.
* Specific vessels, tugs and workboats, hotel vessels, fishing vessels, fish transport vessels, oceanographic vessels, etc.
* For use in the offshore industry such as floating platforms (both anchored and fixed), staff transportation services, anchor vessels and vessels for applications such as supply, rescue, firefighting or anti-pollution.  
&lt;br&gt;The latest version of the integrated CAD/CAM/CAE system is FORAN V70.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tenlinks.com/news/PR/Sener/110311_seaplace.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==FORAN V70==

'''Common tools:''' this version supports Unicode characters; this functionality enables entering text and generating information in languages using non Latin characters such as Chinese, Russian or Korean. FORAN dialogues and menu names can also be translated. Moreover, this update includes FVIEWER, a virtual reality module that replace the former VISUAL3D module. This application takes advantage of state-of-the-art graphic cards capabilities and allows the management of huge amount of information data. 

'''Drafting:''' This update includes also a new 2D environment, based in the QCAD application and compatible with AutoCAD, developed to be used in the modules for the norms and structure standards definition (FNORM), and in the General Arrangement module (FGA) and for the definition of electrical and P&amp;I diagrams. It also includes developments for the interim products drawings, symbolic drawings and the 3D model views drawings.

'''Project:''' One of the most relevant developments of the new version is the General Arrangement module (FGA) for spaces and general ship arrangement definition, both in 2D or 3D environments, with all data stored in the FORAN database. The application allows generating the general arrangement drawing in an efficient way.  On the other hand, the module for the probabilistic damage stability calculations (FSUBD) offers now the possibility to consider intermediate stages of flooding, according to SOLAS standard. The automatic assignment of spaces to subzones has also been improved. 

'''Hull structure:''' A FNORM module for the definition of standards of structure is provided with a user interface, including multi dock windows and snap points; furthermore, it allows adding geometrical restrictions and includes the possibility of layer management. The increase of the lengths of the identifications and descriptions of blocks, materials and geometrical norms, as well as the hierarchical structure for the definition of the standards and geometrical norms are other capabilities of this module. Moreover, following features must be highlighted:  hull structure modeling: an algorithm to represent corrugated parts more accurately, commands for checking the edge preparation of plates and profiles, options for the definition of face bars and an algorithm to represent more accurately curved shell and deck plates. Regarding profiles and plates nesting, the NEST module allows the nesting of identical parts assigned to different interim products and keeps information to recognize each individual part. 

'''Outfitting:''' FORAN V70 includes piping design tools for pipeline routing. Some important characteristics featured in the new update regard the polygonal lines, which are no more needed, the pipelines that are now routed dynamically displaying the pipeline as a solid model with significant snap points of the model. The version incorporates design functionalities adapted to the production circumstances in each shipyard, such as a command for smart splitting of pipe segments based on the standard pipe length defined in the components library, or checking utilities to control the spool fabrication restrictions before generating drawings and greater flexibility for the creation of sets of piping elements.

'''Electrical design:''' The electrical design module allows now to generate cable conduits for special non-standard cross-section cableways and to define conduits with cables inside cable trays, considering them in the cross-section filling calculations. In the cable routing the definition of cable splitting has also been improved and the management of cables partially routed has a better functionality in the connection between cables and terminal blocks.

'''Product lifecycle management (PLM):'''  FORAN V70 allows the integration with different PLM Systems, thanks to a neutral solution built with standards based on CORBA and web services.

==FORAN FVIEWER VR==

The use of a [[Virtual Reality]] (VR) environment offers significant advantages in shipbuilding. The most important advantage is the possibility to review the model and to find out errors at early design stages, with an important cost reduction. VR allows an intuitive and quick evaluation of the model, queries, measurement of distances, ergonomic studies, collision detection, design changes evaluation, simulation of mounting, dismantling and operation tasks, etc. The viewer, called FORAN FVIEWER VR, which is part of the FORAN System, includes stereoscopic capability as feature, which means that it allows the 3D navigation around the model of a ship, being possible to use it with tracking devices. The module can be used during a 3D navigation with a great user-model interaction. The solution can be used in any kind of VR room as well as in portable solutions, workstations, etc.

==Head Mounted Display (HMD)==

The development of applications in a Virtual Reality environment within the shipbuilding industry is booming nowadays. After the development of the second generation of the viewer for interactive navigation through the ship 3D model -FORAN FVIEWER VR- SENER and Ingevideo have developed a Head Mounted Display (HMD).A Virtual Reality HMD is a device that lets the user to view and interact with 3D simulation environments, in this case applied to 3D models generated in FORAN. The possibility of working in virtual reality environments provides benefits and cost reductions, since it allows virtual screening in an interactive and intuitive way.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infodefensa.com/cache_noticias/sen/sener-presenta-un-innovador-casco-de-realidad-virtual-para-el-sector-naval.html#googtrans(es|en)&lt;/ref&gt;

==FORAN system references==

The FORAN system is used in more than 150 ship design offices and shipyards in 30 countries. Some of its most significant references are:
* Strategic projection ship for [[Navantia]].
* Cruise salvage vessel for the China Ship Development and Design Center (CSDDC).
* CVF, aircraft carrier for the [[Royal Navy]] (client: BAE Systems Babcock Marine).
* “Bahía Uno”, oil tanker for Astilleros de Murueta.
* “Ruiloba”, container ship for 1,350 TEU for the client Hijos de J. Barreras Shipyard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3762">The '''Freeman law''' is a statement in astronomy which says that [[disk galaxy|disk galaxies]] have the same [[surface brightness]], Σ at the center.

The Freeman law was confirmed in year 2010 for a sample of 30000 [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] galaxy images &lt;ref name="Fathi"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1009.2692|last1=Fathi|first1=Kambiz|title=Revisiting the Scale Length-mu0 Plane and the Freeman Law in the Local Universe|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=722|pages=L120|year=2010|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/722/1/L120|bibcode=2010ApJ...722L.120F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it can be used with the [[Tully-Fisher relation]] to determine the [[luminosity]] and therefore distance of an observed galaxy.

However more recently it has been argued that the Freeman law is an effect of [[selection bias]].&lt;ref name="McGaugh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota State University, "{{cite web |url=http://odin.physastro.mnsu.edu/~eskridge/astr225/week10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706235131/http://odin.physastro.mnsu.edu/~eskridge/astr225/week10.html |archivedate=2007-07-06 |df= }}"&lt;/ref&gt; The Freeman law is sometimes called the Fish-Freeman effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Disney, M.|author2=Phillipps, S.|year=1983|title=The visibility of galaxies as a function of central surface brightness|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=205|issue=4|pages=1253–1265|doi=10.1093/mnras/205.4.1253|bibcode=1983MNRAS.205.1253D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fish law''' (or Fish's law) in astronomy is the analogue for the Freeman law with disk galaxies replaced by [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. It was described in 1964 by Robert A. Fish based on photometric results for 29 elliptical galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fish, Robert A.|title=A Mass-Potential Relationship in Elliptical Galaxies and Some Inferences Concerning the Formation and Evolution of Galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=139|issue=1|year=1964|pages=284–305|bibcode=1964ApJ...139..284F|doi=10.1086/147753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)==
According to Brada and [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brada, Rafael|author2=Milgrom, Mordehai|title=The modified dynamics (MOND) predicts an absolute maximum to the acceleration produced by 'dark halos'|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=512|issue=17|pages=L17|date=December 1998|arxiv=astro-ph/9812117|doi=10.1086/311871|bibcode=1999ApJ...512L..17B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|The acceleration constant of the modified dynamics ([[MOND]]), ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', appears in various predicted regularities pertinent to galaxies. For example, it features as an upper cutoff to the mean surface density (or mean surface brightness translated with ''[[List of common astronomy symbols#Mass comparison|M]]/[[List of common astronomy symbols#Luminosity comparison|L]]'') of galaxies, as observed and formulated in the Freeman law for disks, and of the Fish law for ellipticals.}}

A '''functional food''' is a [[food]] given an additional [[wikt:function|function]] (often one related to health-promotion or disease prevention) by adding new ingredients or more of existing ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1171305207040&amp;lang=e What are Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals? Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607113000/http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1171305207040&amp;lang=e |date=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also apply to traits purposely [[plant breeding|bred]] into existing edible plants, such as purple or gold potatoes having enriched [[anthocyanin]] or [[carotenoid]] contents, respectively.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://agresearchmag.ars.usda.gov/2014/nov/potatoes | title=Delicious, Nutritious, and a Colorful Dish for the Holidays! | publisher=US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, AgResearch Magazine | date=November 2014 | accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional foods may be "designed to have physiological benefits and/or reduce the risk of chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions, and may be similar in appearance to conventional food and consumed as part of a regular diet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basics about Functional Food|publisher=US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/00000000/NPS/FinalFunctionalFoodsPDFReadVersion6-25-10.pdf|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first used in [[Japan]] in the 1980s where there is a government approval process for functional foods called Foods for Specified Health Use (FOSHU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FOSHU, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan | agency= Government of Japan | url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/topics/foodsafety/fhc/02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The functional food industry, consisting of food, beverage and supplement sectors, is one of the several areas of the [[food industry]] that is experiencing fast growth in recent years.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, W. "Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods'' August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that the global market of functional food industry will reach 176.7 billion in 2013 with a [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of 7.4%. Specifically, the functional food sector will experience 6.9% CAGR, the supplement sector will rise by 3.8% and the functional beverage sector will be the fastest growing segment with 10.8% CAGR.&lt;ref name="roberts"/&gt; This kind of growth is fueled not only by industrial innovation and development of new products that satisfy the demand of [[health industry|health]] conscious [[consumer]]s, but also by [[health claim]]s covering a wide range of health issues.&lt;ref name="scholan"&gt;Scholan, I. "Functional Beverages-- where next? Innovation in functional beverages market is set to continue." ''International Food Ingredients'' December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, consumer [[skepticism]] persists mainly because benefits associated with consuming the products may be difficult to detect.&lt;ref name="scholan"/&gt; Strict examination of some of the functional food claims may discourage some companies from launching their products.&lt;ref name="scholan"/&gt;

Consequently, the collective genomes of the holobiont form a "hologenome". Holobionts and hologenomes are structural entities&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; that replace misnomers in the context of host-microbiota symbioses such as [[superorganism]] (i.e., an integrated social unit composed of conspecifics), organ, and [[metagenome]]. Variation in the hologenome may encode phenotypic plasticity of the holobiont and can be subject to evolutionary changes caused by selection and drift, if portions of the hologenome are transmitted between generations with reasonable fidelity. One of the important outcomes of recasting the individual as a holobiont subject to evolutionary forces is that genetic variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in the host genome and also by changes in the microbiome, including new acquisitions of microbes, horizontal gene transfers, and changes in microbial abundance within hosts. Although there is a rich literature on binary host–microbe symbioses, the hologenome concept distinguishes itself by including the vast symbiotic complexity inherent in many multicellular hosts. For recent literature on holobionts and hologenomes published in an open access platform, see the following reference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Origin==

[[Lynn Margulis]] coined the term holobiont in her 1991 book ''Symbiosis as a Source of Evolutionary Innovation: Specation and Morphogenesis'' (MIT Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sKzeiHUIUQC |title=Symbiosis as a Source of Evolutionary Innovation: Speciation and Morphogenesis |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |last2=Fester |first2=René |date=1991-01-01 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262132695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term holobiont is derived from the Ancient Greek [[wikt:ὅλος |ὅλος]] (hólos, "whole"), and the word biont for a unit of life.

In September 1994, [[Richard Anthony Jefferson |Richard Jefferson]] first introduced the term hologenome at a presentation at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Number 6 in a series of 7 VHS recordings, ''A Decade of PCR: Celebrating 10 Years of Amplification'', Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1994. {{ISBN |0-87969-473-4}}. http://www.cshlpress.com/default.tpl?..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgL3rmZL9P0 Part 4: The Hologenome - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; At the CSH Symposium and earlier, the unsettling number and diversity of microbes that were being discovered through the powerful tool of PCR-amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA genes was exciting, but confusing interpretations in diverse studies. A number of speakers referred to microbial contributions to mammalian or plant DNA samples as 'contamination'. In his lecture, Jefferson argued that these were likely not contamination, but rather essential components of the samples that reflected the actual genetic composition of the organism being studied, and that the logic of the organism's performance and capabilities would be embedded only in the hologenome. Observations on the ubiquity of microbes in plant and soil samples as well as laboratory work on molecular genetics of vertebrate-associated microbial enzymes informed this assertion {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

In 2008, [[Eugene Rosenberg]] and Ilana Zilber-Rosenberg independently derived the term hologenome and developed the hologenome theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Zilber-Rosenberg, Ilana | authorlink2 = Rosenberg, Eugene | year = 2008 | title = Role of microorganisms in the evolution of animals and plants: the hologenome theory of evolution | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 723–35 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00123.x | pmid=18549407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was originally based on their observations of Vibrio shiloi-mediated bleaching of the coral ''Oculina patagonica''. Since its first introduction, the theory has been promoted as a fusion of Lamarckism and Darwinism and expanded to all of evolution, not just that of corals. The history of the development of the hologenome theory and the logic undergirding its development was the focus of a cover article by Carrie Arnold in New Scientist in January, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"Creator of Species, The Hologenome, a New View of Evolution" https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21728992-000-the-hologenome-a-new-view-of-evolution/&lt;/ref&gt; The most comprehensive treatment of the theory, including updates by the Rosenbergs on neutrality, pathogenesis and multi-level selection, can be found in their [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319042404 2013 book].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"The Hologenome Concept: Human, Animal and Plant Microbiota"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Robert Brucker]] and [[Seth Bordenstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/667.full | doi=10.1126/science.1240659 | pmid=23868918 | volume=341 | issue=6146 | title=The Hologenomic Basis of Speciation: Gut Bacteria Cause Hybrid Lethality in the Genus Nasonia | journal=Science | pages=667–669| bibcode=2013Sci...341..667B | last1=Brucker | first1=Robert M | last2=Bordenstein | first2=Seth R | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-invigorated the hologenome concept by showing that the gut microbiomes of closely related ''[[Nasonia]]'' wasp species are distinguishable, and contribute to hybrid death. This set interactions between hosts and microbes in a conceptual continuum with interactions between genes in the same genome. In 2015, Bordenstein and [[Kevin R. Theis]] outlined a conceptual framework that aligns with pre-existing theories in biology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Support from vertebrate biology===
Multicellular life is made possible by the coordination of physically and temporally distinct processes, most prominently through [[hormone]]s. Hormones mediate critical activities in vertebrates, including ontogeny, somatic and reproductive physiology, sexual development, performance and behaviour. 
 
Many of these hormones – including most steroids and [[Thyroid hormone |thyroxines]] – are secreted in inactive form through the endocrine and apocrine systems into epithelial corridors in which microbiota are widespread and diverse, including gut, urinary tract, lung and skin. There, the inactive hormones can be re-activated by cleavage of the glucuronide or sulfate residue, allowing them to be reabsorbed. Thus the concentration and bioavailability of many of the hormones is impacted by microbial cleavage of conjugated intermediaries, itself determined by a diverse population with redundant enzymatic capabilities. Aspects of [[enterohepatic circulation]] have been known for decades, but had been viewed as an ancillary effect of detoxification and excretion of metabolites and xenobiotics, including effects on lifetimes of pharmaceuticals, including birth control formulations.

The basic premise is that a spectrum of hormones can be re-activated and resorbed from epithelia, potentially modulating effective time and dose relationships of many vertebrate hormones. The ability to alter and modulate, amplify and suppress, disseminate and recruit new capabilities as microbially-encoded 'traits' means that sampling, sensing and responding to the environment become intrinsic features and emergent capabilities of the holobiont, with mechanisms that can provide rapid, sensitive, nuanced and persistent performance changes. 
 
Studies by Froebe et al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc1990/cc041n03/p00173-p00185.pdf Axillary malodor production: A new mechanism]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 indicating that essential mating pheromones, including androstenols, required activation by skin-associated microbial glucuronidases and sulfatases. In the absence of microbial populations in the skin, no detectable aromatic pheromone was released, as the pro-pheromone remained water-soluble and non-volatile. This effectively meant that the microbes in the skin were essential to produce a mating signal.&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"&gt;Enabling Innovation: A 2011 Lecture in the Illahee Series https://vimeo.com/26387884&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support from coral biology===
Subsequent re-articulation describing the hologenome theory by Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, published 13 years after Jefferson's definition of the theory, was based on their observations of corals, and the coral probiotic hypothesis.

[[File:CoralBleaching.jpg |thumb |250px |Unbleached and bleached coral]]

Coral reefs are the largest structures created by living organisms, and contain abundant and highly complex microbial communities. A coral "head" is a colony of genetically identical [[polyp]]s, which secrete an [[exoskeleton]] near the base. Depending on the species, the exoskeleton may be hard, based on [[calcium carbonate]], or soft and proteinaceous. Over many generations, the colony creates a large skeleton that is characteristic of the species. Diverse forms of life take up residence in a coral colony, including [[Photosynthesis |photosynthetic]] algae such as ''[[Zooxanthella |Symbiodinium]]'', as well as a wide range of bacteria including [[Nitrogen fixation |nitrogen fixers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shashar N, Feldstein T, Cohen Y, Loya Y |title=Nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) on a coral reef |journal=Coral Reefs |year=1994 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=171–4 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v358131k0381525v/ |doi=10.1007/BF00301195 |bibcode=1994CorRe..13..171S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chitin]] decomposers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ducklow HW, Mitchell R |title=Bacterial Populations and Adaptations in the Mucus Layers on Living Corals |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |year=1979 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=715–725 |jstor= 2835723 |doi=10.4319/lo.1979.24.4.0715 |bibcode=1979LimOc..24..715D }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which form an important part of coral nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kushmaro A, Kramarsky-Winter E |chapter=Bacteria as a source of coral nutrition |veditors=Rosenberg E, Loya Y |title=Coral Health and Disease |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin Heidelberg |year=2004 |pages=231–241 |isbn=978-3-540-20772-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gBuWCe6lfYC&amp;pg=PA231ots=vSpvYVhI2q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association between coral and its [[microbiota (microbiology) |microbiota]] is species dependent, and different bacterial populations are found in mucus, skeleton and tissue from the same coral fragment.&lt;ref name="RRKLZR2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reshef L, Koren O, Loya Y, Zilber-Rosenberg I, Rosenberg E |title=The Coral Probiotic Hypothesis |journal=Environmental Microbiology |year=2006 |volume=8 |pages=2068–73 |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/lifesci/departments/zoology/members/loya/175.pdf.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01148.x |pmid=17107548 |issue=12 |citeseerx=10.1.1.627.6120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past several decades, major declines in coral populations have occurred. [[Climate change]], [[water pollution]] and [[overfishing]] are three stress factors that have been described as leading to disease susceptibility. Over twenty different coral diseases have been described, but of these, only a handful have had their causative agents isolated and characterized.

[[Coral bleaching]] is the most serious of these diseases. In the Mediterranean Sea, the bleaching of ''[[Oculina patagonica]]'' was first described in 1994 and, through a rigorous application of [[Koch's Postulates]], determined to be due to infection by ''[[Vibrio]] shiloi''.&lt;ref name="KRFL1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kushmaro A, Rosenberg E, Fine M, Loya Y |title=Bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica by Vibrio AK-1 |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |year=1997 |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=159–165 |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/bleaching-of-the-coral-oculina-patagonica-by-vibrio-ak-1/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129193709/http://www.mendeley.com/research/bleaching-of-the-coral-oculina-patagonica-by-vibrio-ak-1/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-29 |doi=10.3354/meps147159 |quote=The causative agent, ''Vibrio'' AK-1, was present in 28 bleached ''O. patagonica'' examined, but absent from 24 healthy (unbleached) corals. The ''Vibrio'' sp. was isolated in pure culture, characterized microbiologically, and shown to cause bleaching when inoculated onto unbleached corals. |bibcode=1997MEPS..147..159K }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 2002, bacterial bleaching of ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' occurred every summer in the eastern Mediterranean. Surprisingly, however, after 2003, ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' in the eastern Mediterranean has been resistant to ''V.&amp;nbsp;shiloi'' infection, although other diseases still cause bleaching.

The surprise stems from the knowledge that corals are long lived, with lifespans on the order of decades,&lt;ref name="BBRT2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baird AH, Bhagooli R, Ralph PJ, Takahashi S |title=Coral bleaching: the role of the host |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |year=2009 |volume=24 |pages=16–20 |url=http://www.reefresilience.org/pdf/Baird_etal_2009.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.09.005 |pmid=19022522 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not have [[adaptive immune system]]s. Their [[innate immune system]]s do not produce antibodies, and they should seemingly not be able to respond to new challenges except over evolutionary time scales. Yet multiple researchers have documented variations in bleaching susceptibility that may be termed 'experience-mediated tolerance'.&lt;ref name="BDGD2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown B, Dunne R, Goodson M, Douglas A |title=Experience shapes the susceptibility of a reef coral to bleaching |journal=Coral Reefs |year=2002 |volume=21 |pages=119–126 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/45hflp9ncl32j27w/ |doi=10.1007/s00338-002-0215-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RA2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardson LL, Aronson RB |title=Infectious diseases of reef corals |journal=Proceedings 9th International Coral Reef Symposium |year=2000 |volume=2 |pages=1225–30 |url=http://www.coremap.or.id/downloads/ICRS9th-Coral_Disease1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The puzzle of how corals managed to acquire resistance to a specific pathogen led [[Eugene Rosenberg(Eugene Rosenberg) |Eugene Rosenberg]] and Ilana Zilber-Rosenberg to propose the Coral Probiotic Hypothesis.&lt;ref name="RRKLZR2006"/&gt; This hypothesis proposes that a dynamic relationship exists between corals and their symbiotic microbial communities. Beneficial mutations can arise and spread among the symbiotic microbes much faster than in the host corals. By altering its microbial composition, the "holobiont" can adapt to changing environmental conditions far more rapidly than by genetic mutation and selection in the host species alone.

Extrapolating the coral probiotic hypothesis to other organisms, including higher plants and animals, led to the Rosenberg's support for and publications around the hologenome theory of evolution.

==Theory==

===Definition===
{{prose|date=February 2017}}

The framework of the hologenome theory of evolution is as follows (condensed from Rosenberg ''et al.'', 2007):&lt;ref name="RKREZ2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Rosenberg E, Koren O, Reshef L, Efrony R, Zilber-Rosenberg I |title = The role of microorganisms in coral health, disease and evolution |journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology |year  = 2007 |volume = 5 |pages = 355–362 |url  = http://sequoia.ucmerced.edu/Shini/CGNGS/literature/Rosenberg_et_al_2007.pdf |doi  = 10.1038/nrmicro1635 |pmid  = 17384666 |issue = 5}}{{dead link |date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "All animals and plants establish [[symbiotic]] relationships with microorganisms."
* "Different host species contain different symbiont populations and individuals of the same species can also contain different symbiont populations."
* "The association between a host organism and its microbial community affect both the host and its microbiota."
* "The genetic information encoded by microorganisms can change under environmental demands more rapidly, and by more processes, than the genetic information encoded by the host organism."
* "...&amp;nbsp;the genome of the host can act in consortium with the genomes of the associated symbiotic microorganisms to create a hologenome. This hologenome...can change more rapidly than the host genome alone, thereby conferring greater adaptive potential to the combined holobiont evolution."
* "Each of these points taken together [led Rosenberg ''et al.'' to propose that] the holobiont with its hologenome should be considered as the unit of natural selection in evolution."

Some authors supplement the above principles with an additional one. If a given holobiont is to be considered a unit of natural selection: 
* The hologenome must be heritable from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Fe2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feldhaar H |title=Bacterial symbionts as mediators of ecologically important traits of insect hosts |journal=Ecological Entomology |year=2011 |volume=5 |pages=533–543 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01318.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMBBGMPR2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilbert SF, McDonald E, Boyle N, Buttino N, Gyi L, Mai M, Prakash N, Robinson J |title=Symbiosis as a source of selectable epigenetic variation: taking the heat for the big guy |journal=Phil.

Ten principles of holobionts and hologenomes were presented in PLOS Biology:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

* I. Holobionts and hologenomes are units of biological organization
* II. Holobionts and hologenomes are not organ systems, superorganisms, or metagenomes
* III. The hologenome is a comprehensive gene system
* IV. The hologenome concept reboots elements of Lamarckian evolution
* V. Hologenomic variation integrates all mechanisms of mutation
* VI. Hologenomic evolution is most easily understood by equating a gene in the nuclear genome to a microbe in the microbiome
* VII. The hologenome concept fits squarely into genetics and accommodates multilevel selection theory
* VIII. The hologenome is shaped by selection and neutrality
* IX. Hologenomic speciation blends genetics and symbiosis
* X. Holobionts and their hologenomes do not change the rules of evolutionary biology

===Horizontally versus vertically transmitted symbionts===

Many case studies clearly demonstrate the importance of an organism's associated microbiota to its existence. (For example, see the numerous case studies in the [[Microbiome]] article.) However, horizontal ''versus'' vertical transmission of [[endosymbiont]]s must be distinguished. Endosymbionts whose transmission is predominantly vertical may be considered as contributing to the heritable genetic variation present in a host species.&lt;ref name="Fe2011"/&gt;

In the case of colonial organisms such as corals, the microbial associations of the colony persist even though individual members of the colony, reproducing asexually, live and die. Corals also have a sexual mode of reproduction, resulting in [[plankton]]ic larva; it is less clear whether microbial associations persist through this stage of growth. Also, the bacterial community of a colony may change with the seasons.&lt;ref name="RRKLZR2006"/&gt;

Many insects maintain heritable obligate symbiosis relationships with bacterial partners. For example, normal development of female wasps of the species ''Asobara tabida'' is dependent on ''[[Wolbachia]]'' infection. If "cured" of the infection, their ovaries degenerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pannebakker BA, Loppin B, Elemans CP, Humblot L, Vavre F |title=Parasitic inhibition of cell death facilitates symbiosis |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |year=2007 |volume=104 |pages=213–5 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/1/213.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.0607845104 |pmid= 17190825 |issue= 1 |pmc= 1765438|bibcode=2007PNAS..104..213P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission of the infection is vertical through the egg cytoplasm.

In contrast, many obligate symbiosis relationships have been described in the literature where transmission of the symbionts is via horizontal transfer. A well-studied example is the nocturnally feeding squid ''[[Euprymna scolopes]]'', which camouflages its outline against the moonlit ocean surface by emitting light from its underside with the aid of the symbiotic bacterium ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Visick KL, Ruby EG |title=''Vibrio fischeri'' and its host: it takes two to tango |journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology |year=2006 |volume=9 |pages=632–8 |url=http://www.medmicro.wisc.edu/labs/mcfall_ruby_papers/pdf/2006/Visick_Ruby_2006_CurrOpin.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611053013/http://www.medmicro.wisc.edu/labs/mcfall_ruby_papers/pdf/2006/Visick_Ruby_2006_CurrOpin.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-11 |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2006.10.001 |issue=6 |pmid=17049299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rosenbergs cite this example within the context of the hologenome theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="RR2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenberg E, Zilber-Rosenberg I |title=Symbiosis and development: The hologenome concept |journal=Birth Defects Research Part C: Embryo Today: Reviews |year=2011 |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=56–66 |doi=10.1002/bdrc.20196|pmid=21425442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Squid and bacterium maintain a highly co-evolved relationship. The newly hatched squid collects its bacteria from the sea water, and lateral transfer of symbionts between hosts permits faster transfer of beneficial mutations within a host species than are possible with mutations within the host genome.

===Primary versus secondary symbionts===
[[File:Nezara viridula MHNT verte.jpg |thumb |150px |Green Vegetable Bug ([[Nezara viridula]]) in [[Fronton, Haute-Garonne |Fronton]], France]]
Another traditional distinction between endosymbionts has been between primary and secondary symbionts.&lt;ref name="Fe2011"/&gt; Primary endosymbionts reside in specialized host cells that may be organized into larger, organ-like structures (in insects, the [[bacteriome]]). Associations between hosts and primary endosymbionts are usually ancient, with an estimated age of tens to hundreds of millions of years. According to [[endosymbiotic theory]], extreme cases of primary endosymbionts include [[mitochondria]], [[plastids]] (including [[chloroplasts]]), and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells. Primary endosymbionts are usually transmitted exclusively vertically, and the relationship is always mutualistic and generally obligate for both partners. Primary endosymbiosis is surprisingly common. An estimated 15% of insect species, for example, harbor this type of endosymbiont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baumann P |title=Bacteriology of bacteriocyte-associated endosymbionts of plant sap-sucking insects |journal=[[Annual Review of Microbiology]] |year=2005 |volume=59 |pages=155–189 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.59.030804.121041 |pmid=16153167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, secondary endosymbiosis is often facultative, at least from the host point of view, and the associations are less ancient. Secondary endosymbionts do not reside in specialized host tissues, but may dwell in the body cavity dispersed in fat, muscle, or nervous tissue, or may grow within the gut. Transmission may be via vertical, horizontal, or both vertical and horizontal transfer. The relationship between host and secondary endosymbiont is not necessarily beneficial to the host; indeed, the relationship may be parasitic.&lt;ref name="Fe2011"/&gt;

The distinction between vertical and horizontal transfer, and between primary and secondary endosymbiosis is not absolute, but follows a continuum, and may be subject to environmental influences. For example, in the [[Pentatomidae|stink bug]] ''Nezara viridula'', the vertical transmission rate of symbionts, which females provide to offspring by smearing the eggs with gastric [[Cecum |caeca]], was 100% at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, but decreased to 8% at 30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prado SS, Golden M, Follett PA, Daugherty MP, Almeida RP |title=Demography of Gut Symbiotic and Aposymbiotic ''Nezara viridula'' L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) |journal=Environmental Entomology |year=2009 |volume=38 |pages=103–109 |url=http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/28541/1/IND44191437.pdf |doi=10.1603/022.038.0112 |pmid=19791602 |issue=1 }}{{dead link |date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in aphids, the vertical transmission of bacteriocytes containing the primary endosymbiont ''Buchnera'' is drastically reduced at high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montllor CB, Maxmen A, Purcell AH |title=Facultative bacterial endosymbionts benefit pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum under heat stress |journal=Ecological Entomology |year=2002 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=189–195 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00393.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In like manner, the distinction between [[commensalism |commensal]], [[Mutualism (biology) |mutualistic]], and [[parasitism |parasitic]] relationships is also not absolute. An example is the relationship between [[legume]]s and [[Rhizobium |rhizobial]] species: N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake is energetically more costly than the uptake of fixed nitrogen from the soil, so soil N is preferred if not limiting. During the early stages of nodule formation, the plant-rhizobial relationship actually resembles a pathogenesis more than it does a mutualistic association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Pérez-Giménez J, Quelas JI, Lodeiro AR |chapter=Competition for Nodulation |editor=El-Shemy HA |title=Soybean Physiology and Biochemistry |year=2011 |publisher=InTech |url=http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/competition-for-nodulation |isbn=978-953-307-534-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Lamarckism within a Darwinian context===
[[File:Neo-Lamarckian inheritance of hologenome.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|[[Lamarckism|Neo-Lamarckian]] inheritance of hologenome]]
[[Lamarckism]], the concept that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring (also known as [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] or [[soft inheritance]]) incorporated two common ideas of its time:

* Use and disuse – individuals lose characteristics they do not require (or use) and develop characteristics that are useful.
* Inheritance of acquired traits – individuals inherit the traits of their ancestors.

Although Lamarckian theory was rejected by the [[neo-Darwinism]] of the [[modern synthesis (20th century) |modern evolutionary synthesis]] in which evolution occurs through random variations being subject to [[natural selection]], the hologenome theory has aspects that harken back to Lamarckian concepts. In addition to the traditionally recognized modes of variation (''i.e.'' [[Genetic recombination |sexual recombination]], chromosomal rearrangement, mutation), the holobiont allows for two additional mechanisms of variation that are specific to the hologenome theory: (1) changes in the relative population of existing microorganisms (''i.e.'' amplification and reduction) and (2) acquisition of novel strains from the environment, which may be passed on to offspring.&lt;ref name="RR2011"/&gt;

Changes in the relative population of existing microorganisms corresponds to Lamarckian "use and disuse", while the ability to acquire novel strains from the environment, which may be passed on to offspring, corresponds to Lamarckian "inheritance of acquired traits". The hologenome theory, therefore, is said by its proponents to incorporate Lamarckian aspects within a Darwinian framework.&lt;ref name="RR2011"/&gt;

==Additional case studies==
[[File:Acyrthosiphon pisum (pea aphid)-PLoS.jpg |thumb |200px |Pea aphids extracting sap from the stem and leaves of garden peas]]
The [[pea aphid]] ''Acyrthosiphon pisum'' maintains an obligate symbiotic relationship with the bacterium ''[[Buchnera (proteobacteria) |Buchnera aphidicola]]'', which is transmitted maternally to the embryos that develop within the mother's [[ovariole]]s. [[Acyrthosiphon pisum |Pea aphids]] live on sap, which is rich in sugars but deficient in amino acids. They rely on their ''Buchnera'' endosymbiotic population for essential amino acids, supplying in exchange nutrients as well as a protected intracellular environment that allows ''Buchnera'' to grow and reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gómez-Valero L, Soriano-Navarro M, Pérez-Brocal V, Heddi A, Moya A, García-Verdugo JM, Latorre A |title=Coexistence of Wolbachia with Buchnera aphidicola and a Secondary Symbiont in the Aphid Cinara cedri |journal=J.

Both strains are present in field populations, suggesting that under some conditions, increased heat tolerance is advantageous to the host, while under other conditions, decreased heat tolerance but increased cold tolerance may be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dunbar HE, Wilson AC, Ferguson NR, Moran NA |title=Aphid Thermal Tolerance Is Governed by a Point Mutation in Bacterial Symbionts |journal=PLoS Biology |date=May 2007 |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e96 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050096 |pmid=17425405 |pmc=1847839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can consider the variant ''Buchnera'' genomes as [[allele]]s for the larger hologenome.&lt;ref name="GMBBGMPR2010"/&gt; The association between ''Buchnera'' and aphids began about 200 million years ago, with host and symbiont co-evolving since that time; in particular, it has been discovered that genome size in various ''Buchnera'' species has become extremely reduced, in some cases down to 450&amp;nbsp;kb, which is far smaller even than the 580&amp;nbsp;kb genome of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gil R, Sabater-Muñoz B, Latorre A, Silva FJ, Moya A |title=Extreme genome reduction in ''Buchnera'' spp.: Toward the minimal genome needed for symbiotic life |journal=Proc.

Development of mating preferences, ''i.e.'' [[sexual selection]], is considered to be an early event in [[speciation]]. In 1989, Dodd reported mating preferences in ''[[Drosophila]]'' that were induced by diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dodd DMB  |title=Reproductive Isolation as a Consequence of Adaptive Divergence in ''Drosophila pseudoobscura''  |journal=Evolution  |date=September 1989  |volume=43  |issue=6  |pages=1308–11 |url=http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302120058/http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-02  |doi=10.2307/2409365|jstor=2409365  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has recently been demonstrated that when otherwise identical populations of ''Drosophila'' were switched in diet between molasses medium and starch medium, that the "molasses flies" preferred to mate with other molasses flies, while the "starch flies" preferred to mate with other starch flies. This mating preference appeared after only one generation and was maintained for at least 37 generations. The origin of these differences were changes in the flies' populations of a particular bacterial symbiont, ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]''. Antibiotic treatment abolished the induced mating preferences. It appears that the symbiotic bacteria changed the levels of cuticular hydrocarbon sex [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharon G, Segal D, Ringo JM, Hefetz A, Zilber-Rosenberg I, Rosenberg E |title=Commensal bacteria play a role in mating preference of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' |journal=Proc.

Zilber-Rosenberg and Rosenberg (2008) have tabulated many of the ways in which symbionts are transmitted and their contributions to the fitness of the holobiont, beginning with mitochondria found in all [[eukaryote]]s, [[chloroplast]] in plants, and then various associations described in specific systems. The microbial contributions to host fitness included provision of specific amino acids, growth at high temperatures, provision of nutritional needs from cellulose, nitrogen metabolism, recognition signals, more efficient food utilization, protection of eggs and embryos against metabolism, camouflage against predators, photosynthesis, breakdown of complex polymers, stimulation of the immune system, [[angiogenesis]], vitamin synthesis, fiber breakdown, fat storage, supply of minerals from the soil, supply of organics, acceleration of mineralization, carbon cycling, and salt tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zilber-Rosenberg I, Rosenberg E |title=Role of microorganisms in the evolution of animals and plants: the hologenome theory of evolution |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |year=2008 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=723–735 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00123.x |pmid=18549407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism ==
The hologenome theory is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leggat W, Ainsworth T, Bythell J, Dove S, Gates R, Hoegh-Guldberg O, Iglesias-Prieto R, Yellowlees D |title=The hologenome theory disregards the coral holobiont |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |year=2007 |volume=5 |pages=Online Correspondence |url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v5/n10/full/nrmicro1635-c1.html |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1635-c1 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major criticism by Ainsworth ''et al.'' has been their claim that ''V.&amp;nbsp;shiloi'' was misidentified as the causative agent of coral bleaching, and that its presence in bleached ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' was simply that of opportunistic colonization.&lt;ref name="AFRH2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ainsworth TD, Fine M, Roff G, Hoegh-Guldberg O |title=Bacteria are not the primary cause of bleaching in the Mediterranean coral ''Oculina patagonica'' |journal=The ISME Journal |year=2008 |volume=2 |pages=67–73 |url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v2/n1/full/ismej200788a.html |doi=10.1038/ismej.2007.88 |pmid=18059488 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If this is true, the original observation that led to Rosenberg's later articulation of the theory would be invalid. On the other hand, Ainsworth ''et al.''&lt;ref name="AFRH2008"/&gt; performed their samplings in 2005, two years after the Rosenberg group discovered ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' no longer to be susceptible to ''V.&amp;nbsp;shiloi'' infection; therefore their finding that bacteria are not the primary cause of present-day bleaching in Mediterranean coral ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' should not be considered surprising. The rigorous satisfaction of Koch's postulates, as employed in Kushmaro ''et al.'' (1997),&lt;ref name="KRFL1997"/&gt; is generally accepted as providing a definitive identification of infectious disease agents.

Baird ''et al.'' (2009)&lt;ref name="BBRT2009"/&gt; have questioned basic assumptions made by Reshef ''et al.'' (2006)&lt;ref name="RRKLZR2006"/&gt; in presuming that (1) coral generation times are too slow to adjust to novel stresses over the observed time scales, and that (2) the scale of dispersal of coral larvae is too large to allow for adaptation to local environments. They may simply have underestimated the potential rapidity of conventional means of natural selection. In cases of severe stress, multiple cases have been documented of ecologically significant evolutionary change occurring over a handful of generations.&lt;ref name="CHRF2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carroll SP, Hendry AP, Reznick DN, Fox CW |title=Evolution on ecological time-scales  |journal=Functional Ecology |year=2007 |volume=21 |pages=387–393
 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01289.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novel adaptive mechanisms such as switching symbionts might not be necessary for corals to adjust to rapid climate change or novel stressors.&lt;ref name="BBRT2009"/&gt;
 
Organisms in symbiotic relationships evolve to accommodate each other, and the symbiotic relationship increases the overall fitness of the participant species. Although the hologenome theory is still being debated, it has gained a significant degree of popularity within the scientific community as a way of explaining rapid adaptive changes that are difficult to accommodate within a traditional Darwinian framework.&lt;ref name="RR2011"/&gt;

Definitions and uses of the words holobiont and hologenome also differ between proponents and skeptics,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Theis |first=Kevin R. |last2=Dheilly |first2=Nolwenn M. |last3=Klassen |first3=Jonathan L. |last4=Brucker |first4=Robert M. |last5=Baines |first5=John F. |last6=Bosch |first6=Thomas C.

Ongoing discourse is attempting to clear this confusion. Theis et al. clarify that "critiquing the hologenome concept is not synonymous with critiquing coevolution, and arguing that an entity is not a primary unit of selection dismisses the fact that the hologenome concept has always embraced multilevel selection."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For instance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6200/1011.1.abstract Comment on “The hologenomic basis of speciation: Gut bacteria cause hybrid lethality in the genus Nasonia” | Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler and Turelli (2014) criticize the conclusions of Brucker and Bordenstein (2013), noting that their observations are also consistent with an alternative explanation. Brucker and Bordenstein (2014) responded to these criticisms, claiming they were unfounded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6200/1011.2.abstract Response to Comment on “The hologenomic basis of speciation: Gut bacteria cause hybrid lethality in the genus Nasonia” | Science]&lt;/ref&gt; because of factual inaccuracies and altered arguments and definitions that were not advanced by Brucker and Bordenstein (2013).

Recently, [[Forest L Rohwer]] and colleagues developed a novel statistical test to examine the potential for the hologenome theory of evolution in coral species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej2015190a.html The ISME Journal - Stable and sporadic symbiotic communities of coral and algal holobionts]&lt;/ref&gt; They found that coral species do not inherit microbial communities, and are instead colonized by a core group of microbes that associate with a diversity of species. The authors conclude: "Identification of these two symbiont communities supports the holobiont model and calls into question the hologenome theory of evolution." However, other studies in coral adhere to the original and pluralistic definitions of holobionts and hologenomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bourne |first=David G. |last2=Morrow |first2=Kathleen M. |last3=Webster |first3=Nicole S. |date=2016-01-01 |title=Insights into the Coral Microbiome: Underpinning the Health and Resilience of Reef Ecosystems |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=317-40 |doi=10.1146/annurev-micro-102215-095440 |pmid=27482741}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bourne, Kathleen Morrow and Nicole Webster clarify that "The combined genomes of this coral holobiont form a coral hologenome, and genomic interactions within the hologenome ultimately define the coral phenotype."

'''Humanities''' are [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] that study aspects of [[human]] [[society]] and [[culture]]. In the [[Renaissance]], the term contrasted with [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] and referred to what is now called [[classics]], the main area of [[secular]] study in universities at the time. Today, the humanities are more frequently contrasted with natural, and sometimes social, sciences as well as professional training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary 3rd Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The humanities use methods that are primarily [[Critical theory|critical]], or [[Continental philosophy|speculative]], and have a significant historical element&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;—as distinguished from the mainly [[Empirical method|empirical]] approaches of the [[natural science]]s,&lt;ref name=oed&gt;"Humanity" 2.b, ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 3rd Ed. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; yet, unlike the sciences, it has no central discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199665211.001.0001| isbn=9780199665211| title=A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=2013-11-14| last1=Bod| first1=Rens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance scholars and artists were also called [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]]. Some [[secondary school]]s offer humanities classes usually consisting of [[literature]], global studies and [[art]].

Human disciplines like history and [[cultural anthropology]] study subject matters that the manipulative [[experimental method]] does not apply to—and instead mainly use the [[comparative method]]&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[comparative research]].

==Fields==

===Anthropology===
{{Main|Anthropology}}

[[Anthropology]] is the holistic "science of humans", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the [[social sciences]], humanities and [[human biology]]. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural ''sciences'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''humanities'' generally study local traditions, through their [[history]], [[literature]], [[music]], and [[art]]s, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.

The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. | title = Anthropology, Sociology, and Other Dubious Disciplines | doi = 10.1086/375868 | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 453–465 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: [[archaeology]], physical or [[biological anthropology]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]]. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word ''anthropos'' (άνθρωπος) is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "human being" or "person". [[Eric Wolf]] described sociocultural anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences".

The goal of anthropology is to provide a [[Holism|holistic]] account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York: |publisher=J. P. Putnam's Sons}} Originally published 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropologists use terms such as "less complex" societies, or refer to specific modes of [[subsistence]] or [[Modes of production|production]], such as "pastoralist" or "forager" or "horticulturalist", to discuss humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (''ethnos'') remaining of great interest within anthropology.

The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena and Richard Warms. ''Culture Counts''. Wadsworth. 2008. Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main|Archaeology}}

Archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of [[material culture]]. The [[archaeological record]] consists of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[architecture]], [[biofact (archaeology)|biofacts]] or ecofacts, and [[cultural landscapes]]. Archaeology can be considered both a [[social science]] and a branch of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.42.8 | issue=42 | title=The Intellectual Base of Archaeological Research 2004-2013: a visualisation and analysis of its disciplinary links, networks of authors and conceptual language | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Sinclair | first1 = Anthony }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has various goals, which range from understanding [[culture history]] to reconstructing past [[lifeway]]s to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.

Archaeology is thought of as a branch of [[anthropology]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |first1=William A. |last= Haviland |first2= Harald E. L. |last2= Prins |first3=Bunny |last3=McBride |first4=Dana |last4=Walrath |publisher=Cengage Learning |year= 2010 |edition=13th |isbn=0-495-81082-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as [[history]].

===Classics===
[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the most famous Greek poet]]
[[Classics]], in the [[Western culture|Western]] academic tradition, refers to the studies of the cultures of [[classical antiquity]], namely Ancient Greek and Latin and the Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures. Classical studies is considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities; however, its popularity declined during the 20th century. Nevertheless, the influence of classical ideas on many humanities disciplines, such as philosophy and literature, remains strong.

===History===
[[History]] is systematically collected [[information]] about the [[past]]. When used as the name of a [[field of study]], ''history'' refers to the study and interpretation of the record of [[human]]s, [[society|societies]], institutions, and any topic that has changed over time.

Traditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities. In modern [[academia]], history is occasionally classified as a [[social science]].

===Linguistics and languages===
{{Main|Linguistics|Language}}
{{see also2|{{in title|language}}}}
While the scientific study of language is known as [[linguistics]] and is generally considered a [[social science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |title=Social Science Majors, University of Saskatchewan |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906113657/http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |archive-date=2015-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[natural science]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|title=Language as a Natural Object; Linguistics as a Natural Science|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723173105/http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|archive-date=2010-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as [[Wittgenstein]] claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including [[prose]] forms (such as the [[novel]]), [[poetry]] and [[drama]], also lies at the heart of the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a [[foreign language]] usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.

===Law and politics===
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]]]]{{Main|Law}} In common parlance, [[law]] means a rule that (unlike a rule of ethics) is enforceable through institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crimes Against Humanity|first=Geoffrey| last=Robertson| authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|year=2006| publisher=Penguin|page=90| isbn=978-0-14-102463-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a "system of rules",&lt;ref name="hhc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=H. L. A. |authorlink=H. L. A. Hart |title=The Concept of Law |year=1961 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an "interpretive concept"&lt;ref name="rdl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Dworkin |title=Law's Empire |year=1986 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-51836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve justice, as an "authority"&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raz |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Raz |title=The Authority of Law |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-956268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mediate people's interests, and even as "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first=John |authorlink=John Austin (legal philosopher) |title=The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined |year=1831 |publisher= |location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every [[social science]] and discipline of the humanities. Laws are [[politic]]s, because politicians create them. Law is [[philosophy]], because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of [[history]]'s stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the Latin word ''LEX''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{main|Literature}}
[[File:First Folio.jpg|thumb|[[Shakespeare]] wrote some of the most acclaimed works in [[English literature]].]] '''Literature''' is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition, but which has variably included all written work; writing that possesses literary merit; and language that foregrounds literariness, as opposed to [[ordinary language]]. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] the term derives from [[Latin]] ''literatura/litteratura'' "writing formed with letters", although some definitions include [[Oral literature|spoken or sung texts]]. Literature can be classified according to whether it is [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], and whether it is [[poetry]] or [[prose]]; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the [[novel]], [[short story]] or [[drama]]; and works are often categorised according to historical periods, or according to their adherence to certain [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] features or expectations ([[genre]]).

===Philosophy===
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|The works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] overlap into many fields of the humanities, such as philosophy, literature, theology, music, and classical studies.]]
Philosophy—etymologically, the "love of wisdom"—is generally the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument, rather than experiments ([[experimental philosophy]] being an exception).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nagel (1987). ''What Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy''. Oxford University Press, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy used to be a very comprehensive term, including what have subsequently become separate disciplines, such as [[physics]]. (As [[Immanuel Kant]] noted, "Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three sciences: physics, ethics, and logic.")&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1785). ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'', the first line.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the main fields of philosophy are [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]]. Still, it continues to overlap with other disciplines. The field of [[semantics]], for example, brings philosophy into contact with [[linguistics]].

Since the early twentieth century, philosophy in English-speaking [[universities]] has moved away from the humanities and closer to the formal sciences, becoming much more ''analytic.'' [[Analytic philosophy]] is marked by emphasis on the use of logic and formal methods of reasoning, conceptual analysis, and the use of [[symbolic logic|symbolic]] and/or [[mathematical logic]], as contrasted with the [[Continental philosophy|Continental style of philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Brian Leiter [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp] "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics than with the humanities."&lt;/ref&gt; This method of inquiry is largely indebted to the work of philosophers such as [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G.E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

===Religion===
[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|The [[compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|creation]].]]
New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly around the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]] in [[India]], [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] being some of the earliest major faiths. In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain predominance, looked not to the force of law, but to the power and example of tradition for political morality. In the west, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander of Macedon]] in the 4th century BC.

[[Abrahamic religions]] are those [[religion]]s deriving from a common ancient tradition and traced by their adherents to [[Abraham]] (circa 1900 BCE), a [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] whose life is narrated in the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]], where he is described as a [[prophet]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7), and in the [[Quran]], where he also appears as a [[prophets of Islam|prophet]]. This forms a large group of related largely monotheistic religions, generally held to include [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], and comprises over half of the world's religious adherents.

===Performing arts===
The [[performing art]]s differ from the [[visual arts]] in so far as the former uses the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium, and the latter uses materials such as clay, metal, or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create some [[work of art|art object]]. Performing arts include [[acrobatics]], [[busking]], [[comedy]], [[dance]], [[film]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[music]], [[opera]], [[juggling]], [[marching arts]], such as [[brass band]]s, and [[theatre]].

Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]], such as with [[costume]]s and [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc. There is also a specialized form of [[fine art]] in which the artists ''perform'' their work live to an audience. This is called [[Performance art]]. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of [[Theatrical property|props]]. Dance was often referred to as a ''plastic art'' during the [[Modern dance]] era.

====Musicology====
[[File:Mozarteum grosser saal buehne mit orchester.jpg|thumb|Concert in the Mozarteum, Salzburg]]
[[Musicology]] as an academic discipline can take a number of different paths, including [[historical musicology]], [[ethnomusicology]] and [[music theory]]. Undergraduate music majors generally take courses in all of these areas, while graduate students focus on a particular path. In the liberal arts tradition, musicology is also used to broaden skills of non-musicians by teaching skills such as concentration and listening.

====Theatre====
[[Theatre]] (or theater) (Greek "theatron", ''θέατρον'') is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]], [[mummers' play]]s, and [[pantomime]].

====Dance====
Dance (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', perhaps from [[Old Frankish language|Frankish]]) generally refers to [[human]] [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]] or presented in a [[Social environment|social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[Waggle dance|bee dance]], mating dance), and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (''the [[leaves]] danced in the [[wind]]''). [[Choreography]] is the art of creating dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.

Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]], and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]].
===Visual arts===

====History of visual arts====
[[File:Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain.jpg|thumbnail|''Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain'' by [[Emperor Gaozong of Song China|Emperor Gaozong]] (1107–1187) of [[Song Dynasty]]; fan mounted as album leaf on silk, four columns in cursive script.]]
The great traditions in [[art]] have a foundation in the art of one of the ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Japan]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[China]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|India]], [[Greater Nepal]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Mesoamerica]].

Ancient Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g., [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt).

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. The [[Renaissance]] saw the return to valuation of the material world, and this shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of landscape.

Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan.

Religious [[Islam]]ic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead. The physical and rational certainties depicted by the 19th-century Enlightenment were shattered not only by new discoveries of relativity by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but also by unprecedented technological development. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art.

====Media types====

=====Drawing=====
[[Drawing]] is a means of making a [[image|picture]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in [[technical drawing]] is referred to as a ''draftsman'' or ''draughtsman''.

=====Painting=====
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]
[[Painting]] taken literally is the practice of applying [[pigment]] suspended in a carrier (or [[Paint#Components|medium]]) and a binding agent (a [[adhesive|glue]]) to a surface (support) such as [[paper]], [[canvas]] or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with [[drawing]], [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to [[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]] to the human body itself.

Colour is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including [[Goethe]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Isaac Newton]], have written their own [[colour theory|colour theories]]. Moreover, the use of language is only a generalization for a colour equivalent. The word "[[red]]", for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum. There is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as [[musical notation|C]] or [[musical notation|C#]] in music, although the [[Pantone]] system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose.

Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. This began with [[cubism]] and is not painting in strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]] or [[wood]] for their [[Texture (painting)|texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]]. Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of [[concept]]; this has led some {{Who|date=June 2011}} to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work.

==Origin of the term==
The word "humanities" is derived from the [[Renaissance Latin]] expression ''studia humanitatis'', or "study of ''[[humanitas]]''" (a classical Latin word meaning—in addition to "humanity"—"culture, refinement, education" and, specifically, an "education befitting a cultivated man"). In its usage in the early 15th century, the ''studia humanitatis'' was a course of studies that consisted of grammar, poetry, rhetoric, history, and moral philosophy, primarily derived from the study of Latin and Greek classics. The word ''humanitas'' also gave rise to the Renaissance Italian neologism ''umanisti'', whence "humanist", "[[Renaissance humanism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"humanism." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 11 Apr. 2012. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275932/humanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the West, the study of the humanities can be traced to ancient Greece, as the basis of a broad education for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Bod, Rens; ''A New History of the Humanities'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; During Roman times, the concept of the seven [[liberal arts]] evolved, involving [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] (the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]), along with [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astrology and astronomy|astronomy]] and [[music]] (the [[quadrivium]]).&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Albert W.; ''The Humanities Today'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; These subjects formed the bulk of [[medieval]] education, with the emphasis being on the humanities as skills or "ways of doing".

A major shift occurred with the [[Renaissance humanism]] of the fifteenth century, when the humanities began to be regarded as subjects to study rather than practice, with a corresponding shift away from traditional fields into areas such as literature and history. In the 20th century, this view was in turn challenged by the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] movement, which sought to redefine the humanities in more [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] terms suitable for a [[democracy|democratic]] society since the Greek and Roman societies in which the humanities originated were not at all democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Walling, Donovan R.; ''Under Construction: The Role of the Arts and Humanities in Postmodern Schooling'' Phi Delta Kappa Educational Foundation, Bloomington, Indiana, 1997. Humanities comes from human&lt;/ref&gt; This was in keeping with the postmodernists' nuanced view of themselves as the culmination of history.

==Today==

=== Education and employment ===
For many decades, there has been a growing public perception that a humanities education inadequately prepares graduates for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hersh|first=Richard H.|date=1997-03-01|title=Intention and Perceptions A National Survey of Public Attitudes Toward Liberal Arts Education|journal=Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning|volume=29|issue=2|pages=16–23|doi=10.1080/00091389709603100|issn=0009-1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common belief is that graduates from such programs face underemployment and incomes too low for a humanities education to be worth the investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/27/hooray_for_worthless_education/|title=Hooray for "worthless" education!|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|website=Salon|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, humanities graduates find employment in a wide variety of management and professional occupations. In Britain, for example, over 11,000 humanities majors found employment in the following occupations:
* Education (25.8%)
* Management (19.8%)
* Media/Literature/Arts (11.4%)
* Law (11.3%)
* Finance (10.4%)
* Civil service (5.8%)
* Not-for-profit (5.2%)
* Marketing (2.3%)
* Medicine (1.7%)
* Other (6.4%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://torch.ox.ac.uk/sites/torch/files/publications/Humanities%20Graduates%20and%20the%20British%20Economy%20-%20University%20of%20Oxford.pdf|title=Humanities graduates and the British economy: The hidden impact|last=Kreager|first=Philip|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many humanities graduates finish university with no career goals in mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamuti-Trache et al|first=Maria|year=2006|title=The Labour Market Value of Liberal Arts and Applied Education Programs: Evidence from British Columbia|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/view/183539/183484|journal=Canadian Journal of Higher Education|volume=36|pages=49–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thought Vlogger|title=What can you do with a humanities degree?|date=2018-08-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnJbi2Fiiz8|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many spend the first few years after graduation deciding what to do next, resulting in lower incomes at the start of their career; meanwhile, graduates from career-oriented programs experience more rapid entry into the labour market. However, usually within five years of graduation, humanities graduates find an occupation or career path that appeals to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koc|first=Edwin W|year=2010|title=The Liberal Arts Graduate College Hiring Market|url=https://canvas.wisc.edu/files/77515/download?download_frd=1&amp;verifier=yadEsAdLKIQpRNLKXPwePhZh1jVmeqF7AInh8qDc|journal=National Association of Colleges and Employers|volume=|pages=14–21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2008/2008155.pdf|title=Ten Years After College: Comparing the Employment Experiences of 1992–93 Bachelor's Degree Recipients With Academic and Career Oriented Majors|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is empirical evidence that graduates from humanities programs earn less than graduates from other university programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-626-x/11-626-x2014040-eng.htm|title=The Cumulative Earnings of Postsecondary Graduates Over 20 Years: Results by Field of Study|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=64|title=Earnings of Humanities Majors with a Terminal Bachelor's Degree|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/career_earnings_by_college_major/|title=Career earnings by college major|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the empirical evidence also shows that humanities graduates still earn notably higher incomes than workers with no postsecondary education, and have job satisfaction levels comparable to their peers from other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=5–6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanities graduates also earn more as their careers progress; ten years after graduation, the income difference between humanities graduates and graduates from other university programs is no longer statistically significant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Humanities graduates can earn even higher incomes if they obtain advanced or professional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=10777|title=Boost in Median Annual Earnings Associated with Obtaining an Advanced Degree, by Gender and Field of Undergraduate Degree|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=10780|title=Earnings of Humanities Majors with an Advanced Degree|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
{{Main|Humanities in the United States}}

====The Humanities Indicators====
The [[Humanities Indicators]], unveiled in 2009 by the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], are the first comprehensive compilation of data about the humanities in the United States, providing scholars, policymakers and the public with detailed information on humanities education from primary to higher education, the humanities workforce, humanities funding and research, and public humanities activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amacad.org/ |title=American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences |publisher=Amacad.org |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/ |title=Humanities Indicators |publisher=Humanities Indicators |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeled after the National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators, the Humanities Indicators are a source of reliable benchmarks to guide analysis of the state of the humanities in the United States.

If "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charette |first=Robert N. |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth – IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; statements about a "crisis" in the humanities are also misleading and ignore data of the sort collected by the Humanities Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Humanities-Scholars-See/140311/ Humanities Scholars See Declining Prestige, Not a Lack of Interest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/A-Collection-of-Articles-and/140205/ Debating the State of the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Humanities in American Life''====
The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====As a major====

In 1950, a little over 1 percent of 22-year-olds in the United States had earned a humanities degrees (defined as a degree in English, language, history, philosophy); in 2010, this had doubled to about 2 and a half percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Ben|title=A Crisis in the Humanities? (10 June 2013)|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/06/10/the-humanities-crisis/|website=The Chronicle|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this is because there was an overall rise in the number of Americans who have any kind of college degree. (In 1940, 4.6 percent had a four-year degree; in 2016, 33.4 percent had one.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Reid|title=Census: More Americans have college degrees than ever before|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/326995-census-more-americans-have-college-degrees-than-ever-before|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=The Hill|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a percentage of the type of degrees awarded, however, the humanities seem to be declining. Harvard University provides one example. In 1954, 36 percent of Harvard undergraduates majored in the humanities, but in 2012, only 20 percent took that course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuessler|first1=Jennifer|title=Humanities Committee Sounds an Alarm|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/arts/humanities-committee-sounds-an-alarm.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Benjamin Schmidt of Northeastern University has documented that between 1990 to 2008, degrees in English, history, foreign languages, and philosophy have decreased from 8 percent to just under 5 percent of all U.S. college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-14/the-great-recession-never-ended-for-college-humanities|title=The Great Recession Never Ended for College Humanities|last=Smith|first=Noah|date=14 August 2018|website=Bloomberg|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In liberal arts education====
[[The Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences]] 2013 report ''The Heart of the Matter'' supports the notion of a broad "[[Liberal arts colleges|liberal arts education]]", which includes study in disciplines from the natural sciences to the arts as well as the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/18/humanities-social-sciences-column/2436093/ Humanities, social sciences critical to our future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/428644/august-15-2013/richard-brodhead Colbert Report: The humanities do pay]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[colleges]] provide such an education; some require it. The [[University of Chicago]] and [[Columbia University]] were among the first schools to require an extensive [[core curriculum]] in philosophy, literature, and the arts for all students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand]], "The Problem of General Education," in ''The Marketplace of Ideas'' (W. W. Norton, 2010), especially pp. 32–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other colleges with nationally recognized, mandatory programs in the liberal arts are [[Fordham University]], [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]]. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E. D. Hirsch, Jr.]].

====In the digital age====
Researchers in the humanities have developed numerous large- and small-scale digital corpora, such as digitized collections of historical texts, along with the digital tools and methods to analyze them. Their aim is both to uncover new knowledge about corpora and to visualize research data in new and revealing ways. Much of this activity occurs in a field called the [[digital humanities]].

====STEM====
Politicians in the United States currently espouse a need for increased funding of the [[STEM fields]], science, technology, engineering, mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform |title=Whitehouse.gov |access-date=2014-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021222654/http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform |archive-date=2014-10-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal funding represents a much smaller fraction of funding for humanities than other fields such as STEM or medicine.&lt;ref name="bi_26Jun2013"&gt;''America Is Raising A Generation Of Kids Who Can't Think Or Write Clearly'', [http://www.businessinsider.com/the-war-against-humanities-2013-6 Business Insider]&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a decline of quality in both college and pre-college education in the humanities field.&lt;ref name="bi_26Jun2013"/&gt;

Former four-term Louisiana Governor, [[Edwin Edwards]] (D), has recently acknowledged the importance of the humanities. In a video address&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUY5c9IrAHE YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; to the academic conference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scedhs2014.uqam.ca/en/program.html Scedhs2014.uqam.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revolutions in Eighteenth-Century Sociability'', Edwards said
:Without the humanities to teach us how history has succeeded or failed in directing the fruits of technology and science to the betterment of our tribe of ''homo sapiens'', without the humanities to teach us how to frame the discussion and to properly debate the uses-and the costs-of technology, without the humanities to teach us how to safely debate how to create a more just society with our fellow man and woman, technology and science would eventually default to the  ownership of—and misuse by—the most influential, the most powerful, the most feared among us.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8919778/Introductory_remarks_by_former_four-term_Louisiana_Governor_Edwin_W._Edwards_Honorary_Chair_Montreal_Enlightenment_Conference_October_18_2014 Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The value of the humanities debate====

The contemporary debate in the field of critical university studies centers around the declining value of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Collini]], "What Are Universities For?"(Penguin 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Small]], "The Value of the Humanities"(Oxford University Press 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; As in America, there is a perceived decline in interest within higher education policy in research that is qualitative and does not produce marketable products. This threat can be seen in a variety of forms across Europe, but much critical attention has been given to the field of research assessment in particular. For example, the UK [Research Excellence Framework] has been subject to criticism due to its assessment criteria from across the humanities, and indeed, the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Palgrave Communications 3, Article number: 17020 (2017)
doi:10.1057/palcomms.2017.20&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the notion of "impact" has generated significant debate.&lt;ref&gt;The Social Impact of the Arts http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230572553&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulaitis|first=Zoe|year=2017|title=Measuring impact in the humanities: Learning from accountability and economics in a contemporary history of cultural value|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-017-0002-7|journal=Palgrave Communications|via=|doi=10.1057/s41599-017-0002-7|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical history==

===Citizenship and self-reflection===

Since the late 19th century, a central justification for the humanities has been that it aids and encourages self-reflection—a self-reflection that, in turn, helps develop personal consciousness or an active sense of civic duty.

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Gadamer|Hans-Georg Gadamer]] centered the humanities' attempt to distinguish itself from the natural sciences in [[humankind]]'s urge to understand its own experiences. This understanding, they claimed, ties like-minded people from similar cultural backgrounds together and provides a sense of cultural continuity with the philosophical past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the late 20th and early 21st centuries extended that "narrative imagination"&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, Moira. "Narrative imagination and taking the perspective of others," ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'' 21, 4–5 (July, 2002), 407–416.&lt;/ref&gt; to the ability to understand the records of lived experiences outside of one's own individual social and cultural context. Through that narrative [[imagination]], it is claimed, humanities scholars and students develop a [[conscience]] more suited to the multicultural world we live in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum, Martha]]. ''[[Martha Nussbaum#Cultivating Humanity|Cultivating Humanity]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That conscience might take the form of a passive one that allows more effective [[self-reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harpham | first1 = Geoffrey | year = 2005 | title = Beneath and Beyond the Crisis of the Humanities | url = | journal = [[New Literary History]] | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 21–36 | doi=10.1353/nlh.2005.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extend into active empathy that facilitates the dispensation of civic duties a responsible world citizen must engage in.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; There is disagreement, however, on the level of influence humanities study can have on an individual and whether or not the understanding produced in humanistic enterprise can guarantee an "identifiable positive effect on people."&lt;ref&gt;Harpham, 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanistic theories and practices===
There are three major branches of knowledge: [[natural sciences]], [[social sciences]], and the humanities. [[Technology]] is the practical extension  of the natural sciences, as [[politics]] is the extension of the social sciences. Similarly, the humanities have their own practical extension, sometimes called "transformative humanities" (transhumanities) or "culturonics" ([[Mikhail Epstein]]'s term):
* Nature – natural sciences – technology –&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;transformation of nature
* 
* Society – social sciences –&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;politics&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;transformation of society
* 
* Culture – human sciences –&amp;nbsp;culturonics&amp;nbsp;– transformation of culture&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein. ''The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto''. New York and London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2012, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
Technology, politics and culturonics are designed to transform what their respective disciplines study: nature, society, and culture. The field of transformative humanities includes various   practicies and technologies, for example, [[language planning]], the construction of new languages, like [[Esperanto]], and invention of new artistic and literary genres and movements in the genre of [[manifesto]], like [[Romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], or [[Surrealism]].  Humanistic [[invention]] in the sphere of culture, as a practice complementary to scholarship, is an important aspect of the humanities.

===Truth and meaning===

The divide between humanistic study and natural sciences informs arguments of meaning in humanities as well. What distinguishes the humanities from the [[natural science]]s is not a certain subject matter, but rather the mode of approach to any question. Humanities focuses on understanding meaning, purpose, and goals and furthers the appreciation of singular historical and social phenomena—an interpretive method of finding "truth"—rather than explaining the causality of events or uncovering the truth of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. ''The Formation of the Historical World in the Human Sciences'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its societal application, narrative imagination is an important tool in the (re)production of understood meaning in history, culture and literature.

Imagination, as part of the tool kit of artists or scholars, helps create meaning that invokes a response from an audience. Since a humanities scholar is always within the [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] of lived experiences, no "absolute" knowledge is theoretically possible; knowledge is instead a ceaseless procedure of inventing and reinventing the context a text is read in. [[Poststructuralism]] has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} In the wake of [[Death of the author|the death of the author]] proclaimed by [[Barthes|Roland Barthes]], various theoretical currents such as [[deconstruction]] and [[discourse]] analysis seek to expose the ideologies and rhetoric operative in producing both the purportedly meaningful objects and the [[hermeneutic]] subjects of humanistic study. This exposure has opened up the interpretive structures of the humanities to criticism humanities scholarship is "unscientific" and therefore unfit for inclusion in modern university curricula because of the very nature of its changing contextual meaning.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}}

===Pleasure, the pursuit of knowledge and scholarship===

Some, like [[Stanley Fish]], have claimed that the humanities can defend themselves best by refusing to make any claims of utility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Fish|Fish, Stanley]], [http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#more-81 The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; (Fish may well be thinking primarily of literary study, rather than history and philosophy.) Any attempt to justify the humanities in terms of outside benefits such as social usefulness (say increased productivity) or in terms of ennobling effects on the individual (such as greater wisdom or diminished prejudice) is ungrounded, according to Fish, and simply places impossible demands on the relevant academic departments. Furthermore, [[critical thinking]], while arguably a result of humanistic training, can be acquired in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/the-laws-of-cool-knowledge-work-and-the-culture-of-information-catalogue-copy-and-table-of-contents/ Alan Liu, ''Laws of Cool,'' 2004,]&lt;/ref&gt; And the humanities do not even provide any more the kind of social cachet (what sociologists sometimes call "[[cultural capital]]") that was helpful to succeed in Western society before the age of mass education following World War II.

Instead, scholars like Fish suggest that the humanities offer a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure based on the common pursuit of knowledge (even if it is only disciplinary knowledge). Such pleasure contrasts with the increasing privatization of leisure and instant gratification characteristic of Western culture; it thus meets [[Jürgen Habermas]]' requirements for the disregard of social status and rational problematization of previously unquestioned areas necessary for an endeavor which takes place in the bourgeois [[public sphere]]. In this argument, then, only the academic pursuit of pleasure can provide a link between the private and the public realm in modern Western consumer society and strengthen that public sphere that, according to many theorists,{{who|date=May 2012}} is the foundation for modern democracy.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Others, like [[Mark Bauerlein]], argue that professors in the humanities have increasingly abandoned proven methods of [[epistemology]] (''I care only about the quality of your arguments, not your conclusions.'') in favor of [[indoctrination]] (''I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.''). The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Romanticization and rejection===

Implicit in many of these arguments supporting the humanities are the makings of arguments against public support of the humanities. [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]] asserts that we live in a changing world, a world where "cultural capital" is replaced with ''[[scientific literacy]]'', and in which the romantic notion of a Renaissance humanities scholar is obsolete. Such arguments appeal to judgments and anxieties about the essential uselessness of the humanities, especially in an age when it is seemingly vitally important for scholars of literature, history and the arts to engage in "collaborative work with experimental scientists or even simply to make "intelligent use of the findings from empirical science."&lt;ref&gt;""Theory," Anti-Theory, and Empirical Criticism," ''Biopoetics: Evolutionary Explorations in the Arts'', Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner, eds., Lexington, Kentucky: ICUS Books, 1999, pp. 144–145. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">The '''International Committee for the History of Technology''' (ICOHTEC) was founded at a meeting of the International Congress on the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histnet.cnrs.fr/research/sfhst/spip.php?article222&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris in the summer of 1968. Its founding was the brainchild of [[Melvin Kranzberg]], Professor of the History of Technology at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Kranzberg had already established the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT) and its journal, ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', but he felt that in the midst of Cold War tensions, there was a need for another forum that focused on crossing the artificial borders of the Iron Curtain. For Kranzberg, the History of Technology, a new discipline not yet burdened with ideological or political freight as were other branches of history, was an ideal arena where scholars from East and West could find common ground. Kranzberg was supported in this effort by Maurice Daumas from France, Eugene Olszewski from Poland, and S.J. Schuchardine from the USSR, among others. For the past several decades, ICOHTEC's principal activity has been an ''annual meeting'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohtec.org/annual-meeting-current.html&lt;/ref&gt;  where scholars from many countries and from many disclipines gather and share their work. Papers presented at the meetings are usually published in the Committee's annual journal ''ICON''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohtec.org/publications-icon.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kranzberg’s vision was largely fulfilled in the meetings that followed, although exchanges among scholars were not always harmonious.  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in the years that followed, ICOHTEC lost its original reason for being. But it has thrived in the following years and continues to have an active international membership and hold well-attended and intellectually lively meetings. One reason is the perception that its sister society, SHOT, remains somewhat biased toward U.S. membership in spite of efforts to reach out more to an international audience.
&lt;!-- 


ICOHTEC had a very successful meeting [http://www.conferences.hu/ichs09/index.htm] in Budapest, Hungary in 2009. 

In 2010 it held a joint meeting in Tampere, Finland with [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]] (TICCIH) and The International Association of the Labour Museums (WORKLAB), around the theme ‘Reusing the Industrial Past’.

'''James Gilchrist Lawson''' (1874–1946) was a prolific British Christian author and compiler. Most notably, he compiled biographical sketches into ''Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians'' (1911), which is a landmark text in Pentecostal and Charismatic history. This book draws broadly from Christian history and the Wesleyan [[holiness movement]] to include many post-conversion experiences with the Holy Spirit, which Lawson believed to be the [[baptism of the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Gilchrist Lawson, ″Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, The Warner Press, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, it connects the modern [[Pentecostal movement]], which began in 1900, to the much larger stream of Christian theology and history.&lt;ref&gt;″Book Review: Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, Charlie Whitlow. http://charliewhitlow.com/book-review-deeper-experiences-of-famous-christians/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gilchrist Lawson, ″Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographical sketches include [[Girolamo Savonarola]], [[Fenelon]], [[Madame Guyon]], [[John Wesley]], [[Charles Finney]], [[William Booth]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gilchrist Lawson, ″Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, The Warner Press, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Author and professor [[Dallas Willard]] wrote that ''Deeper Experiences'' is ″the one book other than the Bible that has most influenced me.″ &lt;ref&gt;Dallas Willard, ″When God Moves In: My Experience with Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, in ''Indelible Ink: 22 Prominent Christian Leaders Discuss the Books That Shape Their Faith.'' ed. Scott Larsen. WaterBrook Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawson was editor of ''The Marked Reference Bible'', which was an expansion on ''The Christian Worker's New Testament'' which he had published in 1924. ''The Marked Reference Bible'' includes a chain-reference and a color-coding system. The four colors represent the primary topics of salvation (red), the Holy Spirit (green), temporal blessings (brown), and prophetic subjects (blue). This Bible comes highly recommended by [[Winkie Pratney]] as a reference for [[biblical theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkie Pratney, 21CR Conference. Hamilton, New Zealand. May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible allows you to see not only where a topic or subtopic is mentioned, but how many times, as a guide to that topic's importance to the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;''New Marked Reference Bible'', King James Version. ed. J. Gilchrist Lawson. Zondervan: Grand Rapids, 1983. 1st ed. 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawson was also a prolific compiler of quotes and stories. His compilations include ''Greatest Thoughts About the Bible'',&lt;ref&gt;George H. Doran Company, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; ''Greatest Thoughts About Jesus Christ'',&lt;ref&gt;George H. Doran Company, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;''Greatest Thoughts About God'',&lt;ref&gt;George H. Doran Company, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; ''The World’s Best Humorous Anecdotes'' (1923), ''The World’s Best Conundrums and Riddles of all Ages'' (1924), ''The World's Best Epigrams'' (1924), and ''The Best Loved Religious Poems''.&lt;ref&gt;Revell, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Lawson published a compilation of biographical sketches called ''Famous Missionaries''.

James Lawson says of himself in the introduction to ''Greatest Thoughts About God'', ″For the greater part of his life the compiler of this volume has been collecting the greatest thoughts of the greatest thinkers on the greatest themes. During the years the compiler has engaged in evangelistic work in the United States and Great Britain, he was able to consult the best books in the best libraries of America and Britain and to glean the best thoughts from them. While engaged in journalistic work, for five years, for the leading religious papers, in London, England, he was brought in contact with most of the religious leaders of the world and garnered the best thoughts from them. Through his connection with the religious publishing business during the last ten years, he has been able to collect the best thoughts from all the leading religious papers. Owing to the exceptional privileges which have been given to him by the providence of God, the compiler of this volume is able to give to the world the very cream of religious thoughts concerning God.″ &lt;ref&gt;"Greatest Thoughts About God", J. Gilchrist Lawson, George H. Doran Company: New York, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Greatest Thoughts About God''. Kindle edition. 20134&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kalamos Island biological field station''' is a [[research station]] located in the island [[Kalamos (island)|Kalamos]], in the [[Ionian Sea]], in [[Western Greece]]. It is situated in the core of the inner Ionian marine protected area, site GR22220003 of the [[Natura 2000]] network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://natura2000.eea.europa.eu/# Natura 2000 network viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; The marine area is additionally protected under the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area (ACCOBAMS).&lt;ref&gt;Urgent Call by the Cetacean Alliance for the conservation of one of the last strongholds of the endangered Mediterranean common dolphin, for the conservation of Tuna and other marine megafauna, to preserve viable fish stocks and protect spawning grounds, to preserver marine biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides and for the sustainability of fisheries in a Natura 2000 site.
[http://www.cetaceanalliance.org/call/Call_Apr2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The station is a base for year-round research activities in ecology, ecosystem management and sustainability issues such as permaculture. It was created as part of the [[Kalamos and Kastos sustainable development program]] of [[Terra Sylvestris]], a [[non-governmental]] [[non profit organization]] that established the program in order to bring about sustainable development through [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] in the area of the Island of [[Kalamos]], [[Kastos]] and adjacent smaller islands and their [[ocean|marine environment]].&lt;ref&gt;

A '''locule''' (plural '''locules''') or '''loculus''' (plural '''loculi''') (meaning "little place" in Latin) is a small cavity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/loculus |title=Loculus |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; or compartment within an organ or part of an organism ([[animal]], [[plant]], or [[fungus]]).

In angiosperms ([[flowering plant]]s), the term ''locule'' usually refers to a chamber within an [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] ([[gynoecium]] or [[carpel]]) of the [[flower]] and [[fruit]]s. Depending on the number of locules in the ovary, fruits can be classified as ''uni-locular'' (unilocular), ''bi-locular'', ''tri-locular'' or ''multi-locular''. The number of locules present in a gynoecium may be equal to or less than the number of carpels. The locules contain the [[ovule]]s or [[seed]]s.

The term may also refer to chambers within [[anther]]s containing [[pollen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ascomycete]] fungi, locules are chambers within the [[hymenium]] in which the [[perithecium|perithecia]] develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://palaeos.com/fungi/glossary/glossaryG.html#L |title=Palaeos: Life Through Deep Time |accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcus Junkelmann''' (* 2 October 1949 in [[Munich]]) is a German historian and experimental archeologist.

==Life and work==
Junkelmann started to study history at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] in 1971 and in 1979 he received a PhD for a thesis on the military achievements of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian II]] (1662–1726) (original title: '' Kurfürst Max Emanuel von Bayern als Feldherr''). After that he worked as an associate member of staff at the university and for a military museum in [[Ingolstadt]].

In the 1980s Junkelmann became well known in Germany for his work in [[experimental archeology]]. He reconstructed and tested Roman weapons and army gear. In 1985 in connection with the 2000 year celebration of the city of [[Augsburg]] he organized a large [[Historical reenactment|experimental reenactment]] of the life and work conditions of [[Legionary|Roman legionaries]]. The experiment consisted of a month-long march from [[Verona]] to [[Augsburg]] including the crossing of the [[Alps]]. For the complete trip the original Roman army gear and equipment was used and the typical legionary tasks were performed. Later Junkelmann went on to perform a similar experiments for the Roman cavalry. He authored several books and documentaries on his archeological experiments. In 1997 he was awarded the [[Ceram Prize]] for his book on the nutrition of Roman soldiers (original title: ''Panis militaris: Die Ernährung des römischen Soldaten oder der Grundstoff der Macht'').

{{use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}
[[File:General characteristics of a large marine ecosystem.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|General characteristics of a [[large marine ecosystem]] (Gulf of Alaska)]]
[[File:Orca porpoising.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Killer whales ([[orca]]) are marine [[apex predator]]s. They hunt practically anything, including tuna, smaller sharks and seals. However, the oceans are alive with less obvious, but equally important forms of marine life, such as bacteria.]]

'''Marine life''', or '''sea life''' or '''ocean life''', is the [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and other [[organism]]s that live in the [[Saline water|salt water]] of the sea or ocean, or the [[brackish water]] of coastal [[estuaries]]. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms produce much of the oxygen we breathe. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.

Most life forms evolved initially in [[marine habitats]]. Oceans provide about 99 percent of the living space on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/living-ocean Living Ocean] ''NASA Science''. Retrieved 17 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[vertebrate]]s appeared in the form of [[fish]], which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into [[amphibian]]s which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as [[Pinniped|seals]], [[dolphin]]s or [[whale]]s. Plant forms such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]], and particularly [[phytoplankton]], are key [[primary producer]]s forming the general foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].

Marine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However, as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialisation for respiration in water. Marine vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin.

Altogether there are 230,000 documented marine [[species]], including about 20,000 species of marine fish, and it has been estimated that nearly two million marine species are yet to be documented.&lt;ref name="la.2009"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mapping an ocean of species |last=Drogin |first=Bob |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/nation/na-fish2 |date=2 August 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine species range in size from the microscopic, including [[plankton]] and [[phytoplankton]] which can be as small as 0.02 micrometres, to huge [[cetacean]]s (whales, dolphins and porpoises) including the [[blue whale]], the largest known animal reaching up to 33 metres (109 feet) in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first1=Gregory S. |title=The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs |chapter=The Evolution of Dinosaurs and their World |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bortolotti&gt;{{cite book | last = Bortolotti | first  = Dan | title  = Wild Blue: A Natural History of the World's Largest Animal | year = 2008 | publisher  = St. Martin's Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marine microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es, constitute more than 90% of the total marine biomass.

There is no life without water, which has been characterised as the "solvent of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Agre | first1 = P | year = 2006 | title = The aquaporin water channels | url = http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1513/pats.200510-109JH#.V577FY4bJ5A | journal = Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 5–13 | doi=10.1513/pats.200510-109JH | pmid=16493146 | pmc=2658677}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel prize winner [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] referred to water as the ''mater und matrix'', the mother and womb of life.&lt;ref&gt;Collins J.

The abundance of water on earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes earth from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's [[hydrosphere]] consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000&amp;nbsp;m. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of 10,911.4&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref group=note name="trench_depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiko7000/&gt;

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s, or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of {{val|3.618|e=8|u=km2}} with a mean depth of {{val|3682|u=m}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{val|1.332|e=9|u=km3}}.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112/&gt; If all of Earth's crustal surface was at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean |title=sphere depth of the ocean&amp;nbsp;– hydrology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 |title=Third rock from the Sun&amp;nbsp;– restless Earth |work=NASA's Cosmos |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water.

Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history.

However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.

A [[virus]] is a small [[pathogen|infectious agent]] that [[Replicate (biology)|replicates]] only inside the living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of other [[organism]]s. Viruses can infect all types of [[life forms]], from [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to [[microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{vcite journal

When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as ''virions'', consist of two or three parts: (i) the [[genetic material]] made from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], long [[molecule]]s that carry genetic information; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, called the [[capsid]], which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]]. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average [[bacterium]].

The origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[Horizontal gene transfer in evolution|horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref name="Canchaya" /&gt; Viruses are considered by some to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]]. However they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{vcite journal|author = Rybicki, EP|year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as replicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Are viruses alive?

[[Bacteria]] constitute a large [[domain (biology)|domain]] of [[prokaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s. Typically a few [[micrometre]]s in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on [[Earth]], and are present in most of its [[habitat]]s. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, [[Hot spring|acidic hot springs]], [[radioactive waste]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fredrickson JK, Zachara JM, Balkwill DL, Kennedy D, Li SM, Kostandarithes HM, Daly MJ, Romine MF, Brockman FJ | title = Geomicrobiology of high-level nuclear waste-contaminated vadose sediments at the Hanford site, Washington state | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 70 | issue = 7 | pages = 4230–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15240306 | pmc = 444790 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.70.7.4230-4241.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the deep portions of [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]]. Bacteria also live in [[symbiotic]] and [[parasitic]] relationships with plants and animals.

Once regarded as [[plant]]s constituting the class ''Schizomycetes'', bacteria are now classified as [[prokaryotes]]. Unlike cells of animals and other [[eukaryote]]s, bacterial cells do not contain a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and rarely harbour [[cell membrane|membrane-bound]] [[organelle]]s. Although the term ''bacteria'' traditionally included all prokaryotes, the [[scientific classification]] changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that [[evolution|evolved]] from an ancient common ancestor. These [[domain (biology)|evolutionary domains]] are called ''Bacteria'' and ''[[Archaea]]''.&lt;ref name="Woese"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese CR, Kandler O, Wheelis ML | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | pmc = 54159 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode = 1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the [[Abiogenesis|first forms of life]] to appear on Earth, about 4 billion years ago.

Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes.

The [[archaea]] (Greek for ''ancient''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=a&amp;p=41 Archaea] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''.

These microbes are [[prokaryotes]], meaning they have no [[cell nucleus]] or any other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s in their cells.

Archaea were initially classified as [[bacteria]], but this classification is outdated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pace NR |title=Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7091 |page=289 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16710401 |doi=10.1038/441289a|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..289P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains of life, [[Bacteria]] and [[Eukaryota]]. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized [[phylum|phyla]]. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their [[nucleic acid]]s in samples from their environment.

Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of ''[[Haloquadratum|Haloquadratum walsbyi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoeckenius W |title=Walsby's square bacterium: fine structure of an orthogonal procaryote |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=352–60 |date=1 October 1981|pmid=7287626 |url=http://jb.asm.org/content/148/1/352.long |pmc=216199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess [[gene]]s and several [[metabolic pathway]]s that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the [[enzyme]]s involved in [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]]. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on [[ether lipid]]s in their [[cell membrane]]s, such as [[archaeol]]s. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from [[organic compounds]], such as sugars, to [[ammonia]], [[ion|metal ions]] or even [[hydrogen|hydrogen gas]]. Salt-tolerant archaea (the [[Haloarchaea]]) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]]; however, unlike plants and [[cyanobacteria]], no known species of archaea does both. Archaea [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] by [[binary fission]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], or [[budding]]; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms [[spore]]s.

Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in [[plankton]] may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the [[carbon cycle]] and the [[nitrogen cycle]].

Microscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for life, sometimes acting as hiding and foraging places for larval forms of larger fish and invertebrates. Algal life is widespread and very diverse under the ocean. Microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute a larger proportion of the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. Most of the [[ecological niche|niche]] occupied by sub plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic [[algae]] in the ocean, such as ''[[Sargassum]]'' and [[kelp]], which are commonly known as [[seaweed]]s that create [[kelp forest]]s.

Plants that survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters, such as the [[seagrass]]es (examples of which are eelgrass, ''[[Zostera]]'', and turtle grass, ''Thalassia''). These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment. The [[foreshore|intertidal zone]] is also a good place to find plant life in the sea, where [[mangroves]] or [[cordgrass]] or [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|beach grass]] might grow.

Marine fungi can be classified as:&lt;ref name="Sridhar2009" /&gt;
* Lower fungi - adapted to marine habitats ([[Zoospore|zoosporic]] fungi, including mastigomycetes: [[oomycete]]s and [[chytridiomycetes]])
* Higher fungi - filamentous, modified to planktonic lifestyle ([[hyphomycetes]], [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]])

[[Small shelly fauna]] are a very mixed collection of fossils found between the Late Ediacaran and [[Cambrian Series 3|Middle Cambrian]] periods. The earliest, ''[[Cloudinid|Cloudina]]'', shows signs of successful defense against predation and may indicate the start of an [[evolutionary arms race]]. Some tiny Early Cambrian shells almost certainly belonged to molluscs, while the owners of some "armor plates," ''[[Halkieriid|Halkieria]]'' and ''[[Microdictyon]]'', were eventually identified when more complete specimens were found in Cambrian [[lagerstätte]]n that preserved soft-bodied animals.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Bengtson|2004|pp=67–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of body plans originated with [[vertebrate]]s, which were grouped into one phylum. But the vertebrate body plan is only one of many, and invertebrates consist of many phyla or body plans. The history of the discovery of body plans can be seen as a movement from a worldview centred on vertebrates, to seeing the vertebrates as one body plan among many. Among the pioneering [[zoologist]]s, Linnaeus identified two body plans outside the vertebrates; Cuvier identified three; and Haeckel had four, as well as the Protista with eight more, for a total of twelve. For comparison, the number of phyla recognised by modern zoologists has [[Phylum#Animal phyla|risen to 35]].&lt;ref name=Valentine2004/&gt;

===Marine sponges===
[[File:Callyspongia sp. (Tube sponge).jpg|thumb|right|Sponges have no nervous, digestive or circulatory system]]

[[Sponge]]s are animals of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] (Modern Latin for ''bearing pores''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Porifera Porifera (n.)] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''. Retrieved 18 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;). They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like [[mesohyl]] sandwiched between two thin layers of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s. They have unspecialized cells that can [[cellular differentiation|transform into other types]] and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have [[nervous system|nervous]], [[digestive system|digestive]] or [[circulatory system]]s. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.

Sponges are similar to other animals in that they are [[multicellular]], [[heterotrophic]], lack [[cell wall]]s and produce [[sperm cell]]s. Unlike other animals, they lack true [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and have no [[body symmetry]]. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the [[osculum]]. Many sponges have internal skeletons of [[spongin]] and/or spicules of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silicon dioxide]]. All sponges are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding {{convert|8800|m|mi|abbr=on}}.

While most of the approximately 5,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;known species feed on [[bacteria]] and other food particles in the water, some host [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] micro-organisms as [[endosymbiont]]s and these alliances often produce more food and oxygen than they consume. A few species of sponge that live in food-poor environments have become [[carnivore]]s that prey mainly on small [[crustacean]]s.{{sfn|Vacelet|Duport|2004|pp=179–190}}

===Marine cnidarians===
[[File:Nematostella vectensis.JPG|thumb|right|Cnidarians are the simplest animals with cells organised into tissues. Yet the [[starlet sea anemone]] contains the same genes as those that form the vertebrate head.]]

[[Cnidarians]] (Greek for ''nettle'') are distinguished by the presence of [[stinging cell]]s, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey. Cnidarians include [[coral]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[jellyfish]] and [[hydrozoans]]. They form a [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] containing over 10,000&lt;ref name=Zhang2011&gt;{{cite journal| author=Zhang, Z.-Q.| title=Animal biodiversity: An introduction to higher-level classification and taxonomic richness | journal=Zootaxa| volume=3148| year=2011| pages=7–12| url=http://mapress.com/zootaxa/2011/f/zt03148p012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[species]] of [[animal]]s found exclusively in aquatic (mainly marine) environments. Their bodies consist of [[mesoglea]], a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of [[epithelium]] that are mostly one [[cell (biology)|cell thick]]. They have two basic body forms: swimming [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]]e and [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[polyp]]s, both of which are [[Symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single [[Body orifice|orifice]] and body cavity that are used for digestion and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]].

Fossil cnidarians have been found in rocks formed about {{ma|580}}. Fossils of cnidarians that do not build [[biomineralization|mineralized]] structures are rare. Scientists currently think cnidarians, [[ctenophore]]s and [[bilaterian]]s are more closely related to [[Calcarea|calcareous sponges]] than these are to other [[sponge]]s, and that [[anthozoan]]s are the evolutionary "aunts" or "sisters" of other cnidarians, and the most closely related to bilaterians.

===Marine worms===
{{further|Marine worm|Sea worm}}
[[File:Chaetoblack.png|thumb|300px|right|Many marine worms are related only distantly, so they form a number of different phyla. The worm shown is an [[arrow worm]], found worldwide as a predatory component of plankton.]]

[[Worm]]s (Old English for ''serpent'') form a number of phylums. Their body plan typically involves long cylindrical tube-like bodies and no [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s. [[Marine worm]]s vary in size from microscopic to over {{convert|1|m|ft}} in length for some marine polychaete worms ([[bristle worms]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/articles/2009/04/07/nature_worm_feature.shtml |title=Cornwall – Nature – Superstar Worm |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to {{convert|58|m|ft|}} for the marine nemertean worm ([[bootlace worm]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Carwardine]] (1995) ''The Guinness Book of Animal Records''. Guinness Publishing. p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some marine worms occupy a small variety of [[parasitism|parasitic]] niches, living inside the bodies of other animals, while others live more freely in the marine environment or by burrowing underground.

Different groups of marine worms are related only distantly, so they are found in several different [[phylum (biology)|phyla]] such as the [[Annelida]] (segmented worms), [[Chaetognatha]] (arrow worms), [[Hemichordata]], and [[Phoronida]] (horseshoe worms). Many of these worms have specialized tentacles used for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide and also may be used for reproduction. Some marine worms are [[tube worm (body plan)|tube worm]]s, such as the [[giant tube worm]] which lives in waters near underwater [[volcanoes]] and can withstand temperatures up to 90 degrees [[Celsius]].

[[Platyhelminthes]] (flatworms) form another worm phylum which includes a class [[Cestoda]] of parasitic tapeworms. The marine tapeworm ''[[Polygonoporus giganticus]]'', found in the gut of [[sperm whale]]s, can grow to over 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="time-1957"&gt;{{cite news |date=1957-04-08|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809356-1,00.html|title=The Persistent Parasites|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hargis"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1985|author=Hargis, William J.|title=Parasitology and pathology of marine organisms of the world ocean| publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Echinoderms===
[[File:Haeckel Asteridea Larvae.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Starfish larvae|[[Starfish]] [[larvae]] are [[bilaterally symmetric]], whereas the adults have fivefold symmetry]]

[[Echinoderm]]s (Greek for ''spiny skin'') is a phylum which contains only marine invertebrates. The adults are recognizable by their [[radial symmetry]] (usually five-point) and include [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sand dollar]]s, and [[sea cucumber]]s, as well as the [[Crinoid|sea lilies]].&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/6015/Sea-Lily.html|title=Sea Lily|publisher=Science Encyclopedia|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the [[intertidal zone]] to the [[abyssal zone]]. The phylum contains about 7000 living [[species]],&lt;ref name="adw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Echinodermata.html|title=Animal Diversity Web - Echinodermata|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the second-largest grouping of [[deuterostome]]s (a superphylum), after the [[chordata|chordates]] (which include the [[vertebrate]]s, such as [[bird]]s, [[fish]]es, [[mammal]]s, and [[reptile]]s).

Echinoderms are unique among animals in having bilateral symmetry at the larval stage, but fivefold symmetry ([[pentamerism]], a special type of radial symmetry) as adults.&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lanwebs.lander.edu/faculty/rsfox/invertebrates/asterias.html | title=''Asterias forbesi'' | author=Fox, Richard | work=Invertebrate Anatomy OnLine | publisher=Lander University | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The echinoderms are important both biologically and geologically. Biologically, there are few other groupings so abundant in the [[Continental shelf|biotic desert]] of the [[deep sea]], as well as shallower oceans. Most echinoderms are able to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] tissue, organs, limbs, and [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]]; in some cases, they can undergo complete regeneration from a single limb. Geologically, the value of echinoderms is in their [[ossification|ossified]] [[skeleton]]s, which are major contributors to many [[limestone]] formations, and can provide valuable clues as to the geological environment. They were the most used species in regenerative research in the 19th and 20th centuries. Further, it is held by some scientists that the radiation of echinoderms was responsible for the [[Mesozoic Marine Revolution]].

Molluscs have such diverse shapes that many textbooks base their descriptions of molluscan anatomy on a generalized or ''hypothetical ancestral mollusc''.

Good evidence exists for the appearance of marine gastropods, [[cephalopods]] and bivalves in the [[Cambrian]] period {{ma|Cambrian|{{period end|Cambrian}}}}. However, the evolutionary history both of molluscs' emergence from the ancestral [[Lophotrochozoa]] and of their diversification into the well-known living and [[fossil]] forms are still subjects of vigorous debate among scientists.

[[Arthropod]]s (Greek for ''jointed feet'') have an [[exoskeleton]] (external [[skeleton]]), a [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] body, and jointed [[appendage]]s (paired appendages). They form a [[phylum]] which includes [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, [[myriapod]]s, and [[crustacean]]s. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] made of [[chitin]], often mineralised with [[calcium carbonate]]. The arthropod [[body plan]] consists of [[Segment (biology)|segments]], each with a pair of [[appendage]]s. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by [[moulting]].  Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guilds]] in most environments.

Extant marine arthropods range in size from the microscopic [[crustacean]] ''[[Stygotantulus]]'' to the [[Japanese spider crab]]. Arthropods' primary internal cavity is a [[hemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and through which their [[haemolymph]] - analogue of [[blood]] - circulates; they have [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory systems]]. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] is "ladder-like", with paired [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the [[esophagus]]. The [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[excretion|excretory]] systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong.

Their vision relies on various combinations of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many [[seta]]e (bristles) that project through their cuticles. Arthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection. Marine species all lay eggs and use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form.

The evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. The group is generally regarded as [[monophyletic]], and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with [[cycloneuralia]]ns (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum [[Ecdysozoa]]. Overall however, the [[basal (evolution)|basal]] relationships of Metazoa are not yet well resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated.

Unlike [[amphibian]]s, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are [[viviparity|viviparous]], as were some extinct aquatic clades&lt;ref name=S12&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sander |first=P.

As [[amniote]]s, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous species feed their [[fetus]]es through various forms of placenta analogous to those of [[mammal]]s, with some providing initial care for their hatchlings.

Except for some sea snakes, most extant marine reptiles are [[oviparity|oviparous]] and need to return to land to lay their eggs. Apart from sea turtles, the species usually spend most of their lives on or near land rather than in the ocean. Sea snakes generally prefer shallow waters nearby land, around islands, especially waters that are somewhat sheltered, as well as near estuaries.&lt;ref name="Sti74"&gt;Stidworthy J. 1974.

Some [[extinction|extinct]] marine reptiles, such as [[ichthyosaur]]s, evolved to be [[viviparity|viviparous]] and had no requirement to return to land. [[Ichthyosaur]]s resembled dolphins. They first appeared about 245 million years ago and disappeared about 90 million years ago. The terrestrial ancestor of the ichthyosaur had no features already on its back or tail that might have helped along the evolutionary process. Yet the ichthyosaur developed a [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[Caudal fin|tail fin]] which improved its ability to swim.&lt;ref name="Martill, 1993"&gt;Martill D.M. (1993).

Norton, 179–94. {{ISBN|9780393311396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest marine reptiles arose in the [[Permian]]. During the [[Mesozoic]] many groups of reptiles became adapted to life in the seas, including [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[nothosaur]]s, [[placodont]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[thalattosaur]]s and [[thalattosuchia]]ns. Marine reptiles were less numerous after [[mass extinction]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]].

====Birds====
{{Main|Seabird}}

[[Seabirds|Marine birds]] are [[adaptation|adapted]] to life within the [[marine (ocean)|marine]] environment. They are often called ''seabirds''. While marine birds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking [[convergent evolution]], as the same environmental problems and feeding [[ecological niche|niches]] have resulted in similar adaptations. Examples include [[albatross]], [[penguin]]s, [[gannet]]s, and [[auk]]s.

In general, marine birds live longer, [[mating|breed]] later and have fewer young than terrestrial birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most [[species]] nest in [[Bird colony|colonies]], which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual [[bird migration|migrations]], crossing the [[equator]] or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Marine birds can be highly [[pelagic]], coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely. Some marine birds plummet from heights, plunging through the water leaving vapour-like trails, similar to that of fighter planes.&lt;ref name="baitball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca/sardine-run-shark-feeding-frenzy-phenomenon-in-africa/miraculous-things |title=Sardine Run Shark Feeding Frenzy Phenomenon in Africa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202092952/http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca/sardine-run-shark-feeding-frenzy-phenomenon-in-africa/miraculous-things |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gannet]]s plunge into the water at up to 100 kilometres per hour (60&amp;nbsp;mph). They have air sacs under their skin in their face and chest which act like [[bubble-wrap]], cushioning the impact with the water.

There are about 130 living and recently extinct [[marine mammal]] species such as [[Pinniped|seals]], [[dolphin]]s, [[whale]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[sea otter]]s and [[polar bear]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marinemammalscience.org/species-information/list-of-marine-mammal-species-subspecies |title=The Society for Marine Mammalogy's Taxonomy Committee List of Species and subspecies |publisher=Society for Marine Mammalogy |date=October 2015 |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106152733/https://www.marinemammalscience.org/species-information/list-of-marine-mammal-species-subspecies/ |archivedate=6 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but are instead unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as [[mating]], [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] and [[molting]]. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat [[zooplankton]], others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals.

In a process of [[convergent evolution]], marine mammals such as dolphins and whales redeveloped their [[body plan]] to parallel the streamlined [[wiktionary:fusiform|fusiform]] body plan of [[pelagic fish]]. Front legs became [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s and back legs disappeared, a [[dorsal fin]] reappeared and the tail morphed into a powerful horizontal [[Fluke (tail)|fluke]].  This body plan is an adaptation to being an active predator in a high [[drag (physics)|drag]] environment. A parallel convergence occurred with the now extinct [[ichthyosaur]].&lt;ref&gt;Romer A.

These organisms include drifting or floating [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[algae]], [[protozoa]] and [[animal]]s that inhabit, for example, the [[pelagic zone]] of [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, or bodies of [[fresh water]]. Essentially, plankton are defined by their [[ecological niche]] rather than any [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] or [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification.

Though many planktonic [[species]] are [[microscope|microscopic]] in size, ''plankton'' includes organisms covering a wide range of sizes, including large organisms such as [[jellyfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institut-ocean.org/images/articles/documents/1354542960.pdf |title= Microzooplankton: the microscopic (micro) animals (zoo) of the plankton | author=John Dolan|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of [[phytoplankton]] is better understood due to their critical position as the most numerous [[primary production|primary producers]] on Earth. Phytoplankton are categorized into [[cyanobacteria]] (also called blue-green algae/bacteria), various types of [[algae]] (red, green, brown, and yellow-green), [[diatom]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[Euglenid|euglenoids]], [[coccolithophorid]]s, [[cryptomonad]]s, [[chrysophyte]]s, [[chlorophyte]]s, [[prasinophyte]]s, and [[silicoflagellate]]s.

[[Zooplankton]] tend to be somewhat larger, and not all are microscopic. Many [[Protozoa]] are zooplankton, including dinoflagellates, [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, and [[radiolarian]]s. Some of these (such as dinoflagellates) are also phytoplankton; the distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small organisms. Other zooplankton include [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[chaetognatha|chaetognaths]], [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s, [[Tunicate|urochordates]], and [[annelid]]s such as [[polychaete]]s.

[[Biodiversity]] is the result of over three billion years of [[evolution]]. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoan]]s and similar [[single-celled organism]]s. The history of biodiversity during the [[Phanerozoic]] (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the [[Cambrian explosion]] – a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend.&lt;ref name=Sahney2010&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024| last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.J. |first3=Paul |last3=Ferry  | year = 2010 | title = Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal = Biology Letters | url = http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/01/22/rsbl.2009.1024.abstract| volume=6| issue=4| pages=544–7 | publisher = The Royal Society| pmid=20106856| pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatic rise in diversity has been marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as [[mass extinction event]]s.&lt;ref name=Sahney2010/&gt; Mass extinction events occur when life undergoes precipitous global declines. Most diversity and [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] on earth is found among the [[microorganism]]s, which are difficult to measure. Recorded extinction events are therefore based on the more easily observed changes in the diversity and abundance of larger [[multicellular organism]]s, rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020272| pmid = 15314670| year = 2004| last1 = Nee | first1 = S.| title = Extinction, slime, and bottoms| volume = 2| issue = 8| pages = E272| pmc = 509315| journal = PLoS Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and [[stratigraphic]] range compared to land organisms.

Based on the [[fossil record]], the [[Background extinction rate|background rate of extinctions]] on Earth is about two to five [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] [[family (biology)|families]] of marine animals every million years. The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] was perhaps the first major extinction event.

{{further|History of marine biology}}

During the sixth century BC, the Greek philosopher [[Xenophanes]] (570-475 BC) recognised that some [[fossil]] shells were remains of shellfish. He used this to argue that what was at the time dry land was once under the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Desmond | first1 = Adrian | authorlink = Adrian Desmond | year = 1975 | title = The Discovery of Marine Transgressions and the Explanation of Fossils in Antiquity | url = | journal = American Journal of Science | volume = 275 | issue = | pages = 692–697 | doi=10.2475/ajs.275.6.692| bibcode = 1975AmJS..275..692D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an important step in advancing from simply stating an idea to backing it with evidence and observation.&lt;ref name="mckirahan66"&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the fourth century BC, another Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) attempted a comprehensive [[Categorization|classification]] of animals which included systematic descriptions of many marine species,&lt;ref&gt;Grene MG, Grene M and Depew D (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TJSGJjh8Jo8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22The+Philosophy+of+Biology%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS77P0gKnOAhUGlxQKHY8uD_0Q6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Philosophy%20of%20Biology%22&amp;f=false ''The Philosophy of Biology: An Episodic History''] pages 1–34, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|9780521643801}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boylan, Michael [http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-bio/ "Aristotle: Biology"] ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved 5 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly species found in the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H. D. P. (1948) "Place-Names and the date of Aristotle's Biological Works". ''Classical Quarterly'', '''42''' (3/4) :61–7&lt;/ref&gt; These pioneering works include ''[[History of Animals]]'', a general biology of animals, ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', a comparative [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] of animals, and ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', on developmental biology. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on [[Lesbos]] and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''Octopus'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]''). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of a group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref name="Singer, Charles 1931"&gt;Singer, Charles.

What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called "animals with blood" and "animals without blood" (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[hemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). He divided animals with blood into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ("animals without blood") he divided into insects, crustacea (further divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs).&lt;ref name="BergstromDugatkin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carl T.

In contemporary times, marine life is a field of study both in [[marine biology]] and in [[biological oceanography]]. In biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land. Marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. For this reason marine biology encompasses not only organisms that live only in a marine environment, but also other organisms whose lives revolve around the sea. Biological oceanography is the study of how organisms affect and are affected by the [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[geology]] of the [[ocean|oceanographic system]]. Biological oceanography mostly focuses on the [[microorganism]]s within the ocean; looking at how they are affected by their environment and how that affects larger marine creatures and their ecosystem.&lt;ref name ="Lalli Parsons"&gt;Lalli, Carol M., and Timothy R. Parsons. "Introduction." Biological Oceanography: An Introduction. First Edition ed. Tarrytown, New York: Pergamon, 1993. 7-21. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Biological oceanography is similar to [[marine biology]], but is different because of the perspective used to study the ocean. Biological oceanography takes a bottom up approach (in terms of the food web), while marine biology studies the ocean from a top down perspective. Biological oceanography mainly focuses on the ecosystem of the ocean with an emphasis on plankton: their diversity (morphology, nutritional sources, motility, and metabolism); their productivity and how that plays a role in the global carbon cycle; and their distribution (predation and life cycle).&lt;ref name="Lalli Parsons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Menden-Deuer |first=Susanne |title=Course Info, OCG 561 Biological Oceanography |url=http://www.gso.uri.edu/ocg561/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Charles B. |author2=Patricia A. Wheeler |title=Biological Oceanography |edition=Second |location=Chinchester, West Sussex |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological oceanography also investigates the role of microbes in food webs, and how humans impact the ecosystems in the oceans.&lt;ref name="Lalli Parsons" /&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies''' (German: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Gesellschaftsforschung'', MPIfG) is a [[Germany|German]] [[social sciences|social-science]] research institute within the [[Max Planck Society]] located in [[Cologne]].

Established in 1985, it was initially headed by sociologist [[Renate Mayntz]] (1985/86), followed by political scientist [[Fritz W. Scharpf]] (1986-2003), both of whom exerted a profound influence on the institute's research and public image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the MPIfG|url=http://www.mpifg.de/institut/geschichte_en.asp|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher=MPIfG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently directed by [[Wolfgang Streeck]] and [[Jens Beckert]], 31 employees and around 20 doctoral and post-doctoral fellows. The research group leaders are [[Martin Höpner]] and [[Sigrid Quack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MPIfG Staff|url=http://www.mpifg.de/institut/mitarbeiter_en.asp|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher=MPIfG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfgang Streeck]] became Director of the Institute in 1995 and remained in this position until his retirement in 2014, becoming Emeritus Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c.

* radiation of material falling onto the central black hole (which was growing much more quickly about 25,000 years ago) was so bright that it stripped [[electron]]s away from the [[atom]]s in the gas in its path, and then electrons recombined with these ionized atoms
* the energy released by material flowing into the black hole in an [[accretion disk]] created a vigorous outflow of gas from the surface of the disk, which directly heated gas in its path to X-ray emitting temperatures

The '''Frank H. Neely Nuclear Research Center''', also known as the '''Neely Research Reactor''' and the '''Georgia Tech Research Reactor''' was a [[nuclear engineering]] research center on the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] campus, which housed a 5 [[megawatt]] [[heavy water]] moderated and cooled [[research reactor]] from 1961 until 1995.&lt;ref name="hertel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nremp.gatech.edu/files/ne50/presentations/02D2_NE50_Hertel.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321112426/http://www.nremp.gatech.edu/files/ne50/presentations/02D2_NE50_Hertel.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-21|title=History of the Georgia Tech Research Reactor|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioned]] in November 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/nuclear/assets/ProjectPortfolio/ResearchReactor.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311135240/https://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/nuclear/assets/ProjectPortfolio/ResearchReactor.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-11|title=Research Reactor Decommissioning|publisher=[[CH2M HILL]]|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building that housed the reactor was demolished to make way for the [[Marcus Nanotechnology Research Center]].

The center is named for [[Frank H. Neely]], a Georgia Tech graduate and businessman who organized the first [[Georgia Nuclear Advisory Commission]], an essential step in the creation of the reactor and associated facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/finding-aids/display/xsl/MS088|title=Frank H. Neely Papers|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Library]]|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The center and associated reactor was built after campus president [[Blake Ragsdale Van Leer|Blake R. Van Leer]] appointed a Nuclear Science Committee, which included [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] director [[James E. Boyd (scientist)|James E. Boyd]].&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/BOYDJAM.ESE.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912061927/http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/BOYDJAM.ESE.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-12|title=James E. Boyd|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="makers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/gtri75/history-makers|title=History Makers|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and a large research reactor. The laboratory was built and dedicated on January 7, 1959, and could receive, store, and process radioactive materials.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt; The research reactor would be completed in 1963.

The reactor was shut down in 1988 due to safety concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/16/us/georgia-tech-closes-its-reactor-citing-continued-safety-concerns.html?pagewanted=1|title=Georgia Tech Closes Its Reactor, Citing Continued Safety Concerns|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1988-02-16|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was defueled due to safety concerns related to the nearby [[1996 Summer Olympics]] events.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt;

The reactor building was torn down after the decommissioning, with the remainder removed as of 2015.

The '''opposition surge''' (sometimes known as the '''opposition effect''', '''opposition spike''' or '''Seeliger effect'''&lt;ref name=Hameen-Anttila&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hameen-Anttila|first=K.A. |last2=Pyykko|first2=S. |title=Photometric behaviour of Saturn's rings as a function of the saturnocentric latitudes of the Earth and the Sun |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |date=July 1972 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=235–247 |bibcode = 1972A&amp;A....19..235H }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the brightening of a rough surface, or an object with many [[particle]]s, when illuminated from directly behind the observer. The term is most widely used in [[astronomy]], where generally it refers to the sudden noticeable increase in the brightness of a [[celestial body]] such as a [[planet]], [[moon]], or [[comet]] as its [[phase angle]] of observation approaches zero. It is so named because the reflected light from the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] appear significantly brighter than predicted by simple [[Lambertian reflectance]] when at [[Opposition (astronomy)|astronomical opposition]]. Two physical mechanisms have been proposed for this observational phenomenon: shadow hiding and coherent backscatter.

==Overview==

The phase angle is defined as the angle between the observer, the observed object and the source of light.  In the case of the solar system, the light source is the Sun, and the observer is situated on Earth. At zero phase angle, the Sun is directly behind the observer and the object is directly ahead, fully illuminated.

As the phase angle of an object lit by the Sun decreases, the object's brightness rapidly increases. This is mainly due to the increased area lit, but is also partly due to the intrinsic brightness of the part that is sunlit. This is affected by such factors as the angle at which light reflected from the object is observed. For this reason, a full moon is more than twice as bright as the moon at first or third quarter, even though the visible area illuminated appears to be exactly twice as large.

==Physical mechanisms==

===Shadow hiding===

When the angle of reflection is close to the angle at which the light's rays hit the surface (that is, when the sun and the object are close to [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] from the viewpoint of the observer), this intrinsic brightness is usually close to its maximum. At a phase angle of zero degrees, all shadows disappear and the object is fully illuminated. When phase angles approach zero, there is a sudden increase in apparent brightness, and this sudden increase is referred to as the opposition surge.

The effect is particularly pronounced on [[regolith]] surfaces of airless bodies in the [[solar system]]. The usual major cause of the effect is that a surface's small pores and pits that would otherwise be in shadow at other incidence angles become lit up when the observer is almost in the same line as the source of illumination.  The effect is usually only visible for a very small range of [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angles]] near zero. For bodies whose reflectance properties have been quantitatively studied, details of the opposition effect – its strength and angular extent – are described by two of the [[Hapke parameters]]. In the case of planetary rings (such as [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's]]), an opposition surge is due to the uncovering of shadows on the ring particles. This explanation was first proposed by [[Hugo von Seeliger]] in 1887.&lt;ref name=volSeeliger&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Seeliger|first=H.|title=Zur Theorie der Beleuchtung der grossen Planeten insbesondere des Saturn|journal=Abh. Bayer. Akad. Wiss. Math. Naturwiss. Kl.|date=1887|volume=16|pages=405–516|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coherent backscatter===
{{main|Coherent backscattering}}
A theory for an additional effect that increases brightness during opposition is that of coherent backscatter.&lt;ref&gt;Hapke, B. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990Icar...88..407H Coherent Backscatter: An Explanation for the Unusual Radar Properties of Outer Planet Satellites] ''Icarus'' '''88''': 407:417.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of coherent backscatter, the reflected light is enhanced at narrow angles if the size of the scatterers in the surface of the body is comparable to the wavelength of light and the distance between scattering particles is greater than a wavelength.  The increase in brightness is due to the reflected light combining coherently with the emitted light.

Coherent backscatter phenomena have also been observed with [[radar]].  In particular, recent observations of Titan at 2.2&amp;nbsp;cm with [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] have shown that a strong coherent backscatter effect is required to explain the high albedos at radar wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Janssen2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janssen|first=M.A. |first2=A.|last2=Le Gall |first3=L.C.|last3=Wye |date=2011|title=Anomalous radar backscatter from Titan’s surface?|journal=Icarus|volume=212|issue=1|pages=321–328|issn=0019-1035|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.026|bibcode = 2011Icar..212..321J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Throughout the Solar System==

The existence of the opposition surge was described in 1956 by [[Tom Gehrels]] during his study of the reflected light from an asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;Gehrels, T. (1956) "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1956ApJ...123..331G Photometric Studies of Asteroids. V: The Light-Curve and Phase Function of 20 Massalia]". ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''195''': 331-338.&lt;/ref&gt; Gehrels' later studies showed that the same effect could be shown in the moon's brightness.&lt;ref&gt;Gehrels, T.; Coffeen, T.; &amp; Owings, D. (1964) "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964AJ.....69..826G Wavelength dependence of polarization. III. The lunar surface]". ''Astron. J.'' '''69''': 826-852.&lt;/ref&gt;  He coined the term "opposition effect" for the phenomenon, but the more intuitive "opposition surge" is now more widely used.

Since Gehrels' early studies, an opposition surge has been noted for most airless solar system bodies. No such surge has been reported for bodies with significant atmospheres.

In the case of the [[Moon]], B. J. Buratti ''et al.'' have suggested that its brightness increases by some 40% between a phase angle of 4° and one of 0°, and that this increase is greater for the rougher-surfaced highland areas than for the relatively smooth [[mare (lunar surface)|maria]]. As for the principal mechanism of the phenomenon, measurements indicate that the opposition effect exhibits only a small wavelength dependence: the surge is 3-4% larger at 0.41 μm than at 1.00 μm. This result suggests that the principal cause of the lunar opposition surge is shadow-hiding rather than coherent backscatter.&lt;ref&gt;Burrati, B. J.; Hillier, J. K.; &amp; Wang, M. (1996) "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996Icar..124..490B The Lunar Opposition Surge: Observations by Clementine]". ''Icarus'' '''124''': 490-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Positions_of_Near_Earth_Asteroids_at_time_of_discovery.png|800px|align-cap=center|Due to the opposition effect over half (53%) of the discoveries of [[Near Earth object]]s were made in 3.8% of the sky, in a 22.5° [[Spherical cap|cone]] facing directly away from the Sun, and the vast majority (87%) were made in 15% of the sky, in a 45° [[Spherical cap|cone]] facing away from the Sun.&lt;ref name="NASA-NEO-Close-Approach-Data"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEO Earth Close Approach data |url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/ |website=NASA JPL |publisher=NASA |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10156">'''Post-mortem chemistry''', also called '''necrochemistry''' or '''death chemistry''', is a subdiscipline of [[chemistry]] in which the [[chemical structure]]s, [[chemical reaction|reactions]], [[chemical process|processes]] and parameters of a [[dead]] [[organism]] is investigated. Post-mortem chemistry plays a significant role in [[forensic pathology]]. [[biochemistry|Biochemical analyses]] of vitreous humor, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine is important in determining the cause of death or in elucidating forensic cases.&lt;ref name="fors"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/561/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00414-011-0625-y.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00414-011-0625-y&amp;token2=exp=1450092687~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F561%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00414-011-0625-y.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00414-011-0625-y*~hmac=d32f597e365e41bd9590045c176d514f509fbf004e813a4618eaf8799ae975f8 | title=Postmortem chemistry update part I | author=Cristian Palmiere &amp; Patrice Mangin | journal=[[Int J Legal Med]] | year=2012 | volume=126 | pages=187–198 | doi=10.1007/s00414-011-0625-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-mortem Interval Measurement ==
The post-mortem interval is the time that has elapsed since death. There are several different methods that can be used to estimate the post-mortem interval.[[File:Human_eye_diagram-sagittal_view-NEI.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Human_eye_diagram-sagittal_view-NEI.jpg|thumb|The vitreous humor is contained between the lens and the retina.]]

=== Vitreous Humor Analysis ===

The vitreous humor is four to five milliliters of colorless gel in the vitreous body of the eye. Because of its location and the inert nature of the vitreous humor, it is resistant to some of the post-mortem changes that occur in the rest of the body. This is what makes it useful in determining the time since death, along with the fact that it is not affected by age, sex, or cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Mingzhen|last2=Li|first2=Huijun|last3=Yang|first3=Tiantong|last4=Ding|first4=Zijiao|last5=Wu|first5=Shifan|last6=Qiu|first6=Xingang|last7=Liu|first7=Qian|date=2017-08-17|title=A Study on the Estimation of Postmortem Interval Based on Environmental Temperature and Concentrations of Substance in Vitreous Humor|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.13615|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=63|issue=3|pages=745–751|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.13615|issn=0022-1198}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also useful as a source of DNA or for diagnosing diseases. The vitreous humor contains various electrolytes, including but not limited to sodium, potassium, chlorine, calcium, and magnesium. The concentrations of these electrolytes can be measured with analyzers and related to the time since death with various equations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are various equations because each study has different results, which results in different equations. This is because there are so many factors and differences in experiments that a single equation cannot be determined to be better than the rest. One of these factors is temperature. At higher temperatures, the concentrations are less stable and the degradation of the sample speeds up.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-11-01|title=Estimation of post-mortem interval: A comparison between cerebrospinal fluid and vitreous humour chemistry|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X15001845|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|language=en|volume=36|pages=144–148|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2015.09.017|issn=1752-928X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature can be controlled once a sample is in the lab, but until then, the body will be the same temperature as the environment it was in. If the same equation is used for a sample that was not kept cold, then the result will not be accurate if the equation is for samples kept cold. Even though different equations have been found, the general trends are in agreement. As the time of death increases, the potassium concentration in the vitreous humor rises, and the sodium and calcium concentrations fall. The ratio of potassium to sodium decreases linearly with time. The reason that the potassium levels rise after death is because of a leak in the cell membrane that allows the concentration to reach equilibrium with the potassium levels in the blood plasma. This method is not exact, but a good estimate for the time since death can be obtained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis ===
Cerebrospinal fluid is found in the brain and spinal cord. It is a clear fluid that provides a barrier to absorb shock and prevent injury to the brain. It is useful for diagnosing neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimers. There are various substances in the cerebrospinal fluid that can be measured including urea, glucose, potassium, chloride, sodium, protein, creatinine, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and cortisol.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-06-01|title=Cerebrospinal fluid: postmortem biochemical study|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353113104001610|journal=Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=153–156|doi=10.1016/j.jcfm.2004.11.001|issn=1353-1131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different things can be learned about the person or how the died by looking at the concentrations of some of these substances. For example, high levels of urea can indicate kidney damage. High levels of cortisol, the hormone released under stress, could indicate a violent death. Creatinine is stable post-mortem, so the concentration at death is preserved. This is also helpful to determine the kidney function of an individual. Sodium and Potassium can also be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid to predict the time since death,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but it is not as accurate as it would be if the vitreous humor was used, since it has a lower correlation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Toxicological Analysis ==

Toxicology refers to the science of the chemical and physical properties of toxic substances. Samples from a body are analyzed for drugs or other toxic substances. The concentrations are measured and the substance's contribution to a death can be determined. This is done by comparing concentrations to lethal limits. The most common samples analyzed are blood, urine, kidney, liver, and brain. The samples are usually put through various tests, but the most common instrument used to quantify and determine a substance is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These instruments produce chromatograms of the sample, which are then compared to a database of known substances.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forensicsciencesimplified.org/tox/how.html|title=Toxicology: How It’s Done|website=www.forensicsciencesimplified.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In blood samples, the substance can usually be found, but in the liver, kidneys, and urine the metabolite may be the only substance that can be found. A metabolite is the broken down version of the original substance after it has gone through digestion and/or other biological processes. Substances can take anywhere from hours to weeks to metabolize and leave the body and have different retention times in different parts of the body. For example, cocaine can be detected in the blood for two to ten days, while it can be detected in urine for two to five days.

=== Blood Analysis ===
When blood is used for toxicology testing, drugs of abuse are the usual targets of analysis. Other substances that may be looked for are medications that are known to be prescribed to the individual or poisons if it is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/blood-tests|title=Blood Tests {{!}} National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tissue Analysis ===
Tissues can be analyzed to help determine a cause of death. The tissue samples that are most commonly analyzed are the liver, kidney, brain, and lungs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Hair and Fingernail Analysis ===

Hair samples can also be analyzed post-mortem to determine if there was a history of drug use or poisoning due to the fact that many substances stay in the hair for a long time. The hair can be separated into sections and a month by month analysis can be performed. Fingernails and hair follicles can also be analyzed for DNA evidence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Gastric Contents ===
The stomach contents can also be analyzed. This can help with the post-mortem interval identification by looking at the stage of digestion. The contents can also be analyzed for drugs or poisons to help determine a cause of death if it is unknown.

== Post-mortem Diagnosis ==

Post-mortem diagnosis is the use of post-mortem chemistry analysis tests to diagnose a disease after someone has passed away. Some diseases are unknown until death, or were not correctly diagnosed earlier. One way that diseases can be diagnosed is by examining the concentrations of certain substances in the blood or other sample types. For example, diabetic ketoacidosis can be diagnosed by looking at the concentration glucose levels in the vitreous humor, ketone bodies, glycated hemoglobin, or glucose in the urine. Dehydration can be diagnosed by looking for increased urea nitrogen, sodium, and chloride levels, with normal creatinine levels in the vitreous humor. Endocrine disorders can be diagnosed by looking at hormone concentrations and epinephrine and insulin levels. Liver diseases can be diagnosed by looking at the ratio of albumin and globulin in the sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/forensicschemistry.html|title=Postmortem chemistry|website=www.pathologyoutlines.com|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Punk ideologies''' are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the [[punk subculture]] and [[punk rock]]. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles.  It was primarily concerned with concepts such as [[poverty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[humanitarianism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[anti-corporatism]], [[anti-consumerism]], [[anti-war]], [[media culture|anti-media culture]], [[mainstream media|anti-mainstream or mainstream media]], [[anti-intellectualism]], against [[selling out]], [[anti-conservative]],  [[anti-nationalism]], anti-[[corporate greed]], anti-infatuation, against vagrancy laws, [[anti-racism]], anti-[[sexism]], [[gender equality]], [[racial equality]], [[civil rights]], [[animal rights]], [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]], [[social rights]], [[free-thought]] and [[non-conformity]]. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left wing]] views (e.g., [[NOFX]]) to [[right wing]] beliefs (e.g., [[No Remorse (band)|No Remorse]]) or [[apolitical]] (e.g., [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]).

Punk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective house's with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values or philosophy.

Because [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.

On religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], but some punk bands have promoted religions such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Buddhism]],  [[Taqwacore|Islam]], the [[Rastafari movement]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].

==Specific ideologies and philosophies==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

===Anarchism===
{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}
[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed "peace punks" or "[[anarcho-punk]]s." While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' ''[[Anarchy in the UK]]'', they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Animal Liberation Front]]- or [[Earth Liberation Front]]-style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].

===Animal rights and veganism===
In the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133–151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="descartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilbürger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title="Nailing Descartes to the Wall": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with [[animal rights]]. Consequently, [[vegetarianism]] and [[veganism]] became a feature of the punk subculture.&lt;ref name="descartes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haenfler|first=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3851-3|ref=harv|page=53 and 427–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as [[Fluff Fest]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=YWb7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics|page=137|last=Kuhn|first=Gabriel|publisher=PM Press|date=2010|isbn=1604860510|author-link=Gabriel_Kuhn|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/09/20/czech-diy-list/|title=The Sincere and Vibrant World of the Czech DIY Scene|publisher=Bandcamp|first=Jacopo|last=Sanna|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apoliticism===
Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band [[Charged GBH]] and the singer [[G.G. Allin]], although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song "Violence Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Lyrics - Violence Now - Assassinate The President |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094628/http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]]. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[liberalism|liberal]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian punk}}
[[Christian punk]] is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music industry]],&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/christian-punk-ma0000002639/artists|title=Christian Punk Music Artists - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently [[Crashdog]], [[Ballydowse]] and [[The Psalters]], the latter two of whom identified as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bramboniusinenglish.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/the-lost-psalters-interview-from-august-11-kortrijk/ |title=The Lost Psalters Interview |date=March 14, 2012 |publisher=Brambonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://londoncelticpunks.wordpress.com/tag/ballydowse/ |title=Tribute to Ballydowse |publisher=London Celtic Punks Web-Zine |date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include [[Altar Boys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/altar-boys-mn0000793617/biography |title=Altar Boys |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Crucified]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crucified-mn0000135837|title=The Crucified - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five Iron Frenzy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-iron-frenzy-mn0000178494 |title=Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flatfoot 56]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flatfoot-56-mn0000921885 |title=Flatfoot 56 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk band [[MxPx]], who earned a [[Music recording certification|gold record]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mxpx-mn0000521851 |title=MxPx |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism ===
{{see also|Conservative Punk}}
A small number are [[Conservatism|conservative]], rejecting leftist-[[anarchism]], [[liberalism]], [[communism]] and [[socialism]] in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Forgotten Rebels]], [[Billy Zoom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/zoom-i.htm |title=Billy Zoom interview |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Escalante]], [[Bobby Steele]], [[Duane Peters]] and [[Dave Smalley]]. Some [[Christian punk]] and hardcore bands have [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political stances, in particular some of the [[New York hardcore|NYHC]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=https://www.vice.com/read/survival-of-the-streets-137-v16n9 |title=Survival Of The Streets &amp;#124; VICE United States |publisher=Vice.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hare Krishna===
{{Further|Krishnacore}}
The Filipino punk band the [[Krishnacore|Wuds]] which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wuds-mn0001790200&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some notable members of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, including [[Ray Cappo]] ([[Youth of Today]], [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and other bands), [[John Joseph (rock singer)|John Joseph]] ([[Cro-Mags]]) and [[Harley Flanagan]] (Cro-Mags) converted to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823161134/http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.

===Islam===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Taqwacore]] is a punk subgenre centred on [[Islam]], its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]], [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].

===Liberalism===
[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Crashdog]],  [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Jared Gomes]] of [[Hed PE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035243/http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Latest-hed-p-e-album-has-plenty-of-messages-116661.php|title=Latest (hed) p.e. album has plenty of messages|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1025867/hedp-e|title=(Hed)p.e - Interviews - Killyourstereo.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034734/http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]]. Some punks participated in the [[Rock Against Bush]] movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]].

===Libertarianism===
Libertarian punks advocate [[free market]] [[capitalism]], a [[Night-watchman state|minimal government]] and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band [[Antiseen]],&lt;ref name=slug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slugmag.com/articles/106/ANTiSEEN.html |title=SLUG Magazine &amp;#124; ANTiSEEN |publisher=Slugmag.com |date=2004-09-29 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exene Cervenka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/24-7/2012/10/13/punk-icon-exene-cervenka-endorses-gary-j |title=Punk Icon Exene Cervenka Endorses Gary Johnson - Reason 24/7 |publisher=Reason.com |date=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mojo Nixon]] have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative,  [[Michale Graves]] has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.

===Neo-Nazism===
{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}
[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.

===Nihilism===
Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some early punk rock and [[protopunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/interview-with-simon-critchley/|title=Nihilism, Punk and the International Necronautical Society: an interview with Simon Critchley -|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sex Pistols]] were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'' writing that their "confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Ira, "Sex Pistols", in ''The Trouser Press Record Guide'', 4th ed., ed. Ira Robbins, p.585, Collier, 1991. {{ISBN|0-02-036361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though "much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said",&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical-review/19801802.htm|title=Popular Culture and Revolutionary Theory: Understanding Punk Rock|first=|last=EROL|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.

=== Situationism ===
[[File:DUST Flyer.jpg|thumb|Flyer for DUST happening circa. 1992]]
The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989"&gt;Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-571-23228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. [[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989" /&gt; [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around [[Hulme]] and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' [[Jamie Reid]]'s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

===Socialism===
[[The Clash]] were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing [[socialism]] to the punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMIaUCBTWMC&amp;pg=PA47 Ensminger, David, ''Left of the Dial: Conversations with Punk Icons'' (Oakland, CA: PM Press) p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qfACzulTwIC&amp;pg=PT327 |title=Seventies Unplugged - Gerard DeGroot - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]] said of his socialist views "I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salewicz|first1=Chris|title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0865479821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original [[Oi!]] bands expressed a rough form of socialist [[working class]] [[populism]] — often mixed with [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxzén]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], Joe Strummer, [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, The Jam). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: "... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

[[Bernie Sanders]], a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] running for [[president of the United States]] in 2016, was endorsed by various bands and musicians including [[Jello Biafra]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], [[Keith Morris]], [[Cheetah Chrome]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Belinda Carlisle]] and [[Pussy Riot]] among others. In April 2016, a [[Richmond, VA]] artist named Mickael Broth, created a large mural of a Sanders which was inspired by a classic [[Circle Jerks]]   logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.styleweekly.com/Studi/archives/2016/04/05/punk-rock-bernie-sanders-mural-goes-up-on-broad-street|title=Punk Rock Bernie Sanders Mural Goes Up on Broad Street|first=Brent|last=Baldwin|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders has also been credited as having a major impact on the east coast punk scene in the United States. In the early 1980s as mayor of [[Burlington, VT]], Sanders fought a government ban on live music and had a major goal of building a youth center. That center became [[242 Main Street]], which is currently one of the United States longest running all-ages youth-run DIY punk venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/how-bernie-sanders-242-main-street-shaped-the-northeast-punk-scene-515|title=How Bernie Sanders Shaped the Northeast Punk Scene|website=Vice|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Straight edge===
{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}
[[Straight edge]], which originated in the [[Washington DC]] hardcore punk scene with [[Minor Threat]] song "Straight Edge" written by frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. (Although the Washington DC straight-edge scene exhibited a fierce allegiance for Coca-Cola, with supporters rarely, if ever, seen drinking anything else in public.) Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].

==Criticism of punk ideologies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]" and "[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]". [[Crass]]'s song "White Punks on Hope" criticized the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accused [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier socialist principles. Their song "Punk is Dead" attacked corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''"Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...''

[[Misfits (band)|Misfit]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become "[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.

Author [[Jim Goad]] has been very critical of punk ideologies in many of his writings. In his essay "The Underground is A Lie!", Goad argued that many punks are hypocrites, and he claimed that many punks act poor while hiding the fact they come from [[middle class|middle]] to [[upper class]] backgrounds. In ''Farts from Underground'', Goad claimed that the [[DIY ethic]] never produces anything original, and it allows poor quality work to be championed.

In their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argued that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argued that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.

'''Relationship education''' promotes practices and principles of premarital education, [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] resources, relationship restoration, relationship maintenance, and evidence-based marriage education.

==History==
The formal organization of relationship education in the [[United States]] began in the late 1970s by a diverse group of professionals concerned that the results of conventional methods and means of [[marriage therapy]] resulted in no appreciable reduction in the elevated rate of [[divorce]] and [[out-of-wedlock birth]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The motivation for relationship education was found in numerous studied observations of the elevated rates of marital and family breakdown, school [[dropping out|drop-out]]s, [[incarceration]], [[drug addiction]], [[unemployment]], [[suicide]], [[homicide]], [[domestic abuse]] and other negative social factors when divorce and/or out-of-wedlock pregnancy were noted. In all of the negative categories noted above, statistical over-representation of adults whose childhood did not involve both of their parents was present.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Initial planning for the field of relationship education involved the participation of [[psychologists]], [[Mental Health Counselor|counselor]]s, [[family life educators]], [[social workers]], [[marriage and family therapists]], [[psychiatrists]], [[clergy]] from various faith traditions, policy makers, academicians in the fields of [[social science]], attorneys, judges, and lay persons.  The goal was to seek the broadest possible dispersal of research and marriage education skills courses which could improve interpersonal relationship functioning, especially with married and pre-marital couples.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Early contributors to the field of relationship education included David and Vera Mace, who founded The Association for Couples in Marriage Enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2008.bettermarriages.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx] Building Better Marriages: The Association for Couples in Marriage Enrichment&lt;/ref&gt; The Maces conducted their first couples retreat in 1962. Bernard and Louise Guerney launched the "Institute for the Development of Emotional and Life Skills," later known as "Relationship Enhancement," in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nire.org/] National Institute of Relationship Enhancement website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Lori Heyman Gordon developed a semester-long, 120-hour relationship education course for American University graduate students, which she called "PAIRS," an acronym for the "Practical Application of Intimate Relationship Skills."&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria, Rita. ''Building Intimate Relationships'', "The Saga of PAIRS." Routledge, December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Satir]], considered the "Mother of Family Therapy," began training therapists as relationship educators in 1984.&lt;ref name="satir" /&gt;

Two large scientific studies published in 2011 provided evidence that marriage and relationship education helps reduce divorce among military and distressed couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/07/13/marriage-education-and-relationship-skills-classes-gaining-traction-713] "Marriage Education and Relationship Skills Classes Gaining Traction," Fatherhood Channel, July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another showed evidence of significant gains for singles, couples and as a potential strategy to reduce rates of teen pregnancy.&lt;ref name="peluso"&gt;Peluso, Paul; Eisenberg Seth; Schindler, Rachel. "Marriage Education Impact Report," [[PAIRS Foundation]] for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, September 2011.[http://evaluation.pairs.com/reports/impact2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies, notably the [[Building Strong Families Program]], have shown that relationship education does not "improve relationship quality/satisfaction" for low-income, unwed couples, while another&lt;ref name="hawkins" /&gt; provided evidence of statistically significant benefits for low-income married couples.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;

==Rationale==

In 1984, [[Virginia Satir|Satir]] encouraged marriage and family therapists to shift their focus to relationship education:

{{Quotation|"We’re at a crossroads, an important crossroads of how we view people. That’s why it’s possible now for all the different kind of therapies to go into education, education for being more fully human, using what we know as a pathology is only something that tells us that something is wrong and then allows us to move towards how we can we use this to develop round people. I’m fortunate in being one of the people who pushed my way through to know that people are really round. That’s what it means to me to look at people as people who have potential that can be realized, as people who can have dreams and have their dreams work out. What people bring to me in the guise of problems are their ways of living that keep them hampered and pathologically oriented. What we’re doing now is seeing how education allows us to move toward more joy, more reality, more connectedness, more accomplishment and more opportunities for people to grow."&lt;ref name="satir"&gt;Eisenberg, Seth. "Revolutions of a Lifetime at Home and Abroad," Fatherhood Channel, February 21, 2011.[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/02/21/revolutions-of-a-lifetime-at-home-and-abroad-084/]&lt;/ref&gt;|Virginia Satir}}

===Impact of women's liberation===

Satir said the need for relationship education emerged from shifting gender roles as [[Feminist movement|women gained greater rights and freedoms]] during the 20th century:

{{Quotation|"As we moved into the 20th century, we arrived with a very clearly prescribed way that males and females in marriage were to behave with one another ... The pattern of the relationship between husband and wife was that of the dominant male and submissive female ... A new era has since dawned ... the climate of relationships had changed, and women were no longer willing to be submissive ... The end of the dominant/submissive model in relationships was in sight. However, there was very little that had developed to replace the old pattern; couples floundered ... Retrospectively, one could have expected that there would be a lot of chaos and a lot of fall-out. The change from the dominant/submissive model to one of equality is a monumental shift. We are learning how a relationship based on genuine feelings of equality can operate practically."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Satir | first = Virginia | author-link = Virginia Satir | contribution = Introduction to for our future, for our family | editor-last = PAIRS Foundation | editor-link = PAIRS Foundation | title = For our future, for our family: participant handbook | url = http://www.pairsusa.com/p-42-for-our-future-for-our-family-participant-handbook.aspx | location = Broward County, Florida | page = 6 | publisher = [[PAIRS Foundation]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044746/http://www.pairsusa.com/p-42-for-our-future-for-our-family-participant-handbook.aspx | archivedate = 2016-03-05 | df =  }} (Participant handbook for PAIRS 30-hour curriculum for Supporting Healthy Marriages.)

==Examples==

The National Council on Family Relations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncfr.org] - National Council on Family Relations website.&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on preparing professionals in [[family life education]], a prominent approach to relationship education.

In 2006, the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] began funding significant multi-year demonstration projects through the [[Administration for Children and Families]] to expand the availability of marriage education classes in more than 100 communities nationwide. This project, known as the "[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/healthymarriage/ Healthy Marriage Initiative]," was designed to improve the well-being of children by providing tools and education to strengthen marriages and families.

[[Jeffry H. Larson]] conducted several studies on marriage and relationship education, including a review of three widely used premarital inventories - Focus, Prepare, and Relate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-115465399.html] Larson, Jeffrey. "A review of three comprehensive premarital assessment questionnaires," Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==

===Relationship education for premarital couples===

A multi-year federal study, known as the [[Building Strong Families Program]], and 2010 meta-analysis&lt;ref name="hawkins" /&gt; of 47 studies found that relationship education "does not improve relationship quality/satisfaction" for unmarried couples.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Previous studies have asserted that premarital education programs have a positive effect on program participants. Using meta-analytic methods of current best practices to look across the entire body of published and unpublished evaluation research on premarital education, we found a more complex pattern of results. We coded 47 studies and found that premarital education programs do not improve relationship quality/satisfaction when unpublished studies are included in the analysis, although studies that follow couples past the honeymoon stage to detect prevention effects are rare. In contrast, premarital education programs appear to be effective at improving couple communication, with studies that employed observational measures rather than self-report measures producing large effects. Still, given the mixed, modest results, there is ample room and a real need to improve the practice of premarital education."&lt;ref name="hawkins"&gt;Hawkins, Alan J.; Fawcett Elizabeth B.; Blanchard, Victoria L.; Carroll, Jason. "Do Premarital Education Programs Really Work? A Meta-analytic Study," Volume 59, Issue 3, pages 232–239, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Building Strong Families Program====

Between 2002 and 2011, Mathematica Policy Research conducted the [[Building Strong Families Program]] study for the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], "to learn whether well-designed interventions can help couples fulfill their aspirations for a healthy relationship, marriage, and a strong family."&lt;ref name="opre"/&gt;

The study specifically evaluated the impact of relationship education classes delivered to more than 5,000 low-income, unwed couples at 12 locations in seven states. "The intervention featured up to 42 hours of multi-couple group sessions led by trained facilitators, focusing on skills that, according to earlier research, are associated with relationship and marital stability and satisfaction."&lt;ref name=opre&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/resource/the-building-strong-families-project-implementation-of-eight-programs-to] U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Mathematica reported findings from a 15-month follow-up of program and control group participants:

* BSF had no effect on whether couples were still together 15 months after they had applied for the program, when data from the eight BSF programs are combined. At this point, 76 percent of BSF couples were still romantically involved, compared with 77 percent of control group couples. Similarly, BSF and control group couples were equally likely to be married to each other at that time (17 and 18 percent respectively) and to be living together, whether married or unmarried (62 percent for both research groups)."&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/Family_Support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720101532/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/family_support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }} Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, Wood, Robert G., et al., "The Building Strong Families Project," May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifteen months after they applied for the program, BSF and control group couples reported being equally happy in their romantic relationships, with average ratings of 8.4 and 8.3 respectively on a 0-to-10 relationship happiness scale. Similarly, BSF and control group couples gave very similar ratings of supportiveness and affection in their relationships, with average support and affection scale values of 3.5 on a 1-to-4 scale for couples in both research groups. In addition, BSF had no overall effect on how faithful couples were to each other.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
* When results are averaged across all eight programs, BSF did not improve couples’ ability to manage their conflict. Couples in both research groups reported similar levels of use of constructive conflict behaviors, such as keeping a sense of humor and listening to the other partner’s perspective during disagreements. Similarly, there was no difference between the research groups in the avoidance of destructive conflict behaviors, such as withdrawing when there is a disagreement or allowing small disagreements to escalate. In addition, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF had no effect on how likely couples were to experience [[intimate partner violence]].  Similarly, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF did not improve co-parenting or increase father involvement. BSF and control group couples reported that their co-parenting relationships were of equally high quality. In addition, at the 15-month follow-up, couples in both research groups were equally likely to report that fathers were living with their children, spending substantial time with them, and providing them with substantial financial support.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
*The Baltimore BSF program [Loving Couples, Loving Children] had negative effects on couples’ relationships. BSF couples were less likely than control group couples to remain romantically involved, 59 percent versus 70 percent. Baltimore BSF couples reported being less supportive and affectionate toward each other than control group couples did. In addition, women in the Baltimore BSF program were more likely than women in the control group to report having been severely physically assaulted by a romantic partner in the past year, 15 percent compared with 9 percent. Baltimore BSF couples also rated the quality of their co-parenting relationship lower than control group couples did and reported that BSF fathers spent less time with their children and were less likely to provide them financial support than control group fathers were.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

===Relationship education for married couples===

Several studies, notably the [[Supporting Healthy Marriage Project]] funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], a meta-analysis by Hawkins and Ooms&lt;ref name="works" /&gt; and a five-year impact report by Peluso, Eisenberg and Schindler&lt;ref name="peluso" /&gt; found that relationship education provided statistically significant benefits for married couples.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The emerging evidence suggests that MRE [marriage and relationship education] programs can work for low-income populations as well as for those who are economically better off. The evidence from a new meta-analysis of 15 program evaluations (including three randomized control trials) shows that MRE programs can have positive, moderate size effects on low-income couples’ relationship outcomes, at least in the short run. However, the largest and most rigorous study of low-income, unmarried couples produced mixed results and shows there is still much to learn ... Across nearly all the studies reviewed for this Report, MRE improves communication—a core, essential relationship skill—as well as other measures of relationship quality. There is also some initial evidence that MRE for low-income couples can decrease divorce rates, reduce aggression, and improve children’s problem behaviors.&lt;ref name="works"&gt;Hawkins, Alan; Ooms, Theodora. "What Works in Marriage and Relationship Education," National Healthy Marriage Resource Center, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Washington, D.C.[http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/resource-detail/index.aspx?rid=2861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Supporting Healthy Marriage Study====

In August 2012, Manpower Development Research Corporation (MDRC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdrc.org] MDRC website&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit, nonpartisan social policy research organization, reported that a federally funded, multi-year, random assignment, control group study known as the [[Supporting Healthy Marriage Project]] found high levels of consumer satisfaction among 4,989 adults participating in relationship education courses based on the work of PREP Inc., [[PAIRS Foundation]] and [[John Gottman]] at sites in Florida (Orlando), Kansas (Wichita), Pennsylvania (Reading and Bethlehem), Texas (El Paso and San Antonio), New York (Bronx), Oklahoma (Oklahoma City), and Washington (Shoreline and Seattle).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/17/national-marriage-education-study-117] "National Study Shows Strong Consumer Satisfaction with Marriage and Relationship Education Classes," Fatherhood Channel, October 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A 12-month report on the program's impact found:&lt;ref name=knox&gt;Knox, Virginia, et al. "Early Impacts from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation," MDRC, New York, NY, March 2012.[http://www.mdrc.org/early-impacts-supporting-healthy-marriage-evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SHM PAIRS Couple.jpg|thumb|Couple practices communication skills during [[PAIRS Foundation]] relationship education class in Florida.]]

* The SHM program produced a consistent pattern of small positive effects on multiple aspects of couples’ relationships. Relative to the control group, the program group showed higher levels of marital happiness, lower levels of marital distress, greater warmth and support, more positive communication, and fewer negative behaviors and emotions in their interactions with their spouses. The consistency of results across outcomes and data sources (surveys and independent observations of couple interactions) is noteworthy.
* Compared with individuals in the control group, program group members reported experiencing slightly less psychological and physical abuse from their spouses. Men and women in the program group reported less psychological abuse in their relationships, and men in the program group reported that their spouses physically assaulted them less often, compared with their control group counterparts.
* Men and women in the program group reported slightly lower levels of adult psychological distress (such as feelings of sadness or anxiety) than their control group counterparts.
* The program did not significantly affect whether couples stayed married at the 12-month follow-up point.

Sexophobia in clinical talk has an effect on the way patients speak to their doctors, as it manifests itself in the communication strategies that are employed to speak about private health problems.&lt;ref name="venereology"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minichiello |first=V |last2=Browne |first2=J | year=1998 |title=Issues in clinical care of people being tested/treated for sexually transmissible infections |trans-title= |url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=559461629831610;res=IELAPA |language=English |journal=Venereology |volume=11 |issue=4 |page=27 |doi= |access-date=11 February 2017 |quote=Other researchers provide evidence of the impact of sexophobia on clinical talk through the identification of the strategies which are used to deal with embarrassing issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">In [[information technology]] and [[computer science]], a program is described as '''stateful''' if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/stateless|title=What is stateless? - Definition from WhatIs.com|author=|date=|website=techtarget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remembered information is called the '''state''' of the system.

The set of states a system can occupy is known as its [[state space]].  In a [[discrete system]], the state space is [[countable]] and often [[Finite set|finite]], and  the system's internal behaviour or interaction with its environment consists of separately occurring individual actions or events, such as accepting input or producing output, that may or may not cause the system to change its state.  Examples of such systems are [[digital logic]] circuits and components, [[Automata theory|automata]] and [[Formal language theory|formal language]], [[computer program]]s, and [[computer]]s.  The output of a digital circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and its state.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book

==Digital logic circuit state==
[[Digital logic]] circuits can be divided into two types: [[combinational logic]], whose output [[Digital signal (electronics)|signals]] are dependent only on its present input signals, and [[sequential logic]], whose outputs are a function of both the current inputs and the past history of inputs.&lt;ref name="Kaeslin"&gt;{{cite book

  | doi = 
  | id = 
  | isbn = 0521882672}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In sequential logic, information from past inputs is stored in electronic memory elements, such as [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]].  The stored contents of these memory elements, at a given point in time, is collectively referred to as the circuit's ''state'' and contains all the information about the past to which the circuit has access.&lt;ref name="Srinath"&gt;{{cite book

| quote= page 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since each [[Semiconductor memory|binary memory element]], such as a flip-flop, has only two possible states, ''one'' or ''zero'', and there is a finite number of memory elements, a digital circuit has only a certain finite number of possible states. If '''''N''''' is the number of binary memory elements in the circuit, the maximum number of states a circuit can have is '''2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

==Program state==
Similarly, a computer program stores data in [[Variable (computer science)|variable]]s, which represent storage locations in the [[Computer memory|computer's memory]].  The contents of these memory locations, at any given point in the program's execution, is called the program's ''state''.&lt;ref name="Laplante"&gt;{{cite book

A more specialized definition of state is used for computer programs that operate serially or sequentially on [[Stream (computing)|streams of data]], such as [[parser]]s, [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]s, [[communication protocol]]s  and [[encryption]].  Serial programs operate on the incoming data characters or packets sequentially, one at a time. In some of these programs, information about previous data characters or packets received is stored in variables and used to affect the processing of the current character or packet.  This is called a "[[stateless protocol|stateful protocol]]" and the data carried over from the previous processing cycle is called the "state".  In others, the program has no information about the previous data stream and starts "fresh" with each data input; this is called a "[[stateless protocol]]".

[[Imperative programming]] is a [[programming paradigm]] (way of designing a [[programming language]]) that describes computation in terms of the program state, and of the statements which change the program state. In [[declarative programming]] languages, the program describes the desired results and doesn't specify changes to the state directly.

==Finite state machines==
The output of a sequential circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and current state.  Since each [[binary digit|binary]] memory element has only two possible states, 0 or 1, the total number of different states a circuit can assume is finite, and fixed by the number of memory elements.  If there are ''N'' binary memory elements, a digital circuit can have at most 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct states.  The concept of state is formalized in an abstract mathematical [[model of computation]] called a [[finite state machine]],  used to design both sequential digital circuits and computer programs.

==Examples==
An example of an everyday device that has a state is a [[television set]].  To change the channel of a TV, the user usually presses a "channel up" or "channel down" button on the remote control, which sends a coded message to the set.  In order to calculate the new channel that the user desires, the digital tuner in the television must have stored in it the number of the ''current channel'' it is on.  It then adds one or subtracts one from this number to get the number for the new channel, and adjusts the TV to receive that channel.  This new number is then stored as the ''current channel''.  Similarly, the television also stores a number that controls the level of [[Loudness|volume]] produced by the speaker.  Pressing the "volume up" or "volume down" buttons increments or decrements this number, setting a new level of volume.  Both the ''current channel'' and ''current volume'' numbers are part of the TV's state.  They are stored in [[non-volatile memory]], which preserves the information when the TV is turned off, so when it is turned on again the TV will return to its previous station and volume level.

As another example, the state of a [[microprocessor]] is the contents of all the memory elements in it: the [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]s, [[processor register|storage register]]s, [[data cache]]s, and [[flag (computing)|flag]]s.  When computers such as laptops go into a [[hibernation (computing)|hibernation mode]] to save energy by shutting down the processor, the state of the processor is stored on the computer's [[hard disk]], so it can be restored when the computer comes out of hibernation, and the processor can take up operations where it left off.

'''Statistical epidemiology''' is an emerging branch of the disciplines of [[epidemiology]] and [[biostatistics]] that aims to:
* Bring more statistical rigour to bear in the field of [[epidemiology]]
* Recognise the importance of applied [[statistics]], especially with respect to the context in which statistical methods are appropriate and inappropriate
* Aid and improve our interpretation of observations

== Introduction ==

The science of [[epidemiology]] has had enormous growth, particularly with charity and government funding.  Many researchers have been trained to conduct studies, requiring multiple skills ranging from liaising with clinical staff to the [[statistical analysis]] of [[complex data]], such as using [[Bayesian method]]s.  The role of a Statistical Epidemiologist is to bring the most appropriate methods available to bear on [[observational study]] from medical research, requiring a broad appreciation of the underpinning methods and their context of applicability and interpretation.

The earliest mention of this phrase was in an article by EB Wilson,&lt;ref name=W/&gt; taking a critical look at the way in which statistical methods were developing and being applied in the science of epidemiology.

== Academic recognition ==

There are two Professors of Statistical Epidemiology in the United Kingdom ([http://www.leeds.ac.uk/light/staff/Mark-S-Gilthorpe University of Leeds] and [http://www1.ic.ac.uk/medicine/research/researchthemes/publicandint/ide/research_groups/stats/ Imperial College], London) and a Statistical Epidemiology group (Oxford University).

== Related fields ==

Statistical epidemiology draws upon [[quantitative methods]] from fields such as: [[statistics]], [[operations research]], [[computer science]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[mathematics]]

Stream '''substrate''' ([[sediment]]) is the material that rests at the bottom of a [[stream]]. There are several classification guides. One is:

*[[Mud]] – silt and clay.
*[[Sand]] – Particles between 0.06 and 2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.
*[[Granule (geology)|Granule]] – Between 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.
*[[Pebble]] – Between 4 – 64&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.
*[[Cobble (geology)|Cobble]] – between 6.4 and 25.6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter
*[[Boulder]] – more than 25.6&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.

Stream substrate can affect the life found within the stream habitat. Muddy streams generally have more sediment in the water, reducing clarity. Clarity is one guide to stream health.

Marine substrate can be classified geologically as well. See Green et al., 1999 for a reference. 

Mollusks and clams that live in areas with substrate, and need them to survive, use their silky byssal threads to cling to it. See Cteniodes Ales for reference.

'''Design standards''', '''reference standards''' and '''performance standards''' are familiar throughout business and industry, virtually for anything that is definable.  [[Sustainable design]], taken as reducing our impact on the earth and making things better at the same time, is in the process of becoming defined.   There are also lots of well organized specific methodologies that are used by different communities of people for different purposes.

== Design standards ==
One of the better known is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) green building rating system, which uses a diverse group of hard measures of environmental quality and impacts to define a holistic approach to sustainable building and assign ratings to individual projects.

Sustainable design is really just a more determined effort to consider the whole range of impacts on our environment in making any decision. A more complete design guide, guided more by whole project impact measures, is the model offered by the U.S. cooperating agencies in the [http://www.wbdg.org/ "Whole Building Design Guide"].

Green construction codes and standards are beginning to emerge on the national code stage. The standards go beyond energy standards such as [[ASHRAE 90.1]] and the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC) to cover additional areas such as site sustainability, [[water efficiency]], indoor [[environmental quality]] and materials and resources. The first is [[ASHRAE 189.1]], Standard for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, published by ASHRAE in January 2010 in conjunction with the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and the [[Illuminating Engineering Society]]. Standard 189.1 provides criteria by which a building can be judged as “green,” written in model code language that jurisdictions can use to develop a green building construction code.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Several organizations have developed their own ways of setting goals for energy reductions, such as [[Architecture 2030]] and for qualifying performance toward them such as [[Cradle to Cradle Design|Cradle to Cradle]].

== Design methods ==
Developing real methods for how to discover the design opportunities that would allow you to meet or exceed the standards was one of the objectives of the environmental design movement in architectural schools in the 1960s and '70s, but though some of the issues introduced then are still an important part of the process, not much actually changed about the methods of design.  Now with the combination of many more interactive tools and much higher stakes in the outcome, and long gestating rethinking about natural systems in general, a dramatic new revolution in methodology seems inevitable.

BIM (building information modeling) allows designers to work with many remote consultants on the same data file that represents all the decisions being made by the team.  That same file is available to the [[climate and energy]] and environmental impact analysis and cost analysis tools and consultants, ... and of course to the prospective contractors and the regulators.   Along with this new integrated access to the model there in needed a new way to integrate the conversation of so many people, each with some interest in reviewing each other's comments on the progress with the central design model.  That is likely to involve development of wiki tools for the process.  One such very early impliementation of a Wiki SD tool called [https://web.archive.org/web/20081007000010/http://www.connection.metadot.net/ "4Dsustainability"] organizes the project design evolution around the general learning process of '''how you define the problem''' by exploring its environment, and following that through the project.

The main difference between sustainable design methods and conventional design is incorporating the entire environment of the project's stakeholders on the design team, essentially, and that calls for new ways to explore connections and for more people and perspectives to be taken into account.  Other methods that recognize this requirement are the [http://www.aia.org/liv_sdat "AIA SDAT"] (sustainable design assessment team) program and the [http://www.scenariosforsustainability.org/index.php "Scenarios for sustainability"] process design tools.

[[File:12 Butterflies.jpg|thumb|Butterflies designed for the illustration of the book (c. 1890)]]

'''''The Gentle Art of Making Enemies''''' is a book by the painter [[James McNeill Whistler]], published in 1890. The book was in part a response to, in part a transcript of, Whistler's famous libel suit against critic [[John Ruskin]]. Ruskin, in a review of the inaugural showing at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]], had referred to Whistler's painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]'' as "flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".&lt;ref&gt;Hewison, Robert. ''John Ruskin''. Oxford University Press, 2007. pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  The book contains Whistler's letters to newspapers chronicling his many petty grievances against various acquaintances and friends.

Whistler biographer [[Stanley Weintraub]] suggests the book was controversial enough that Whistler might have been better known for it than for his art at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Stanley. ''Whistler: A Biography''. De Capo Press, 2001: xi. {{ISBN|0-306-80971-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University for Peace''' ('''UPEACE''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] with university status, established by [[treaty]] in 1980 and having its main campus in [[Costa Rica]]. Its stated mission is "to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]." The current Rector of UPEACE is Dr. Francisco Rojas Aravena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:UPEACE-campus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Costa Rica campus]]

The creation of the University for Peace was set in motion by a treaty and endorsed by resolution 34/111 of 14 December 1979 of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. By this Resolution, the UN General Assembly established an international commission which, in collaboration with the Government of Costa Rica, was requested to prepare the organization, structure and setting in motion of the University for Peace. Thereafter, by [http://www.upeace.org/pdf/resolution.pdf Resolution 35/55 of 5 December 1980],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN General Assembly Resolution on Establishment of UPEACE|url=http://www.upeace.org/pdf/resolution.pdf|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UN General Assembly endorsed the treaty establishing  the University for Peace by adopting the [http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201223/volume-1223-I-19735-English.pdf International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace] (UPEACE) along with the [http://www.upeace.org/pdf/charter.pdf Charter of the University for Peace].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the University for Peace annexed to the International Agreement Establishing the University for Peace|url=http://www.upeace.org/pdf/charter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University has the unique status of not only being a dedicated institution for higher education in Peace and Conflict studies, but also an international treaty body organization mandated by the United Nations General Assembly.

It offers [http://www.upeace.org/academic/index.cfm master's degree and doctoral programmes] at its main headquarters in [[San José, Costa Rica]], and carries out various activities related to the international peace and security objectives of the [[United Nations]] (UN) through centres and offices located in Addis Ababa, Geneva, New York, The Hague, and South Korea, and through partnership arrangements with numerous other institutions worldwide.

=== Relationship with United Nations ===

The University for Peace is part of the academic wing of the UN system, and has observer status at the UN General Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See 'Other Resources' at http://www.un.org/en/peace/ |url=https://www.un.org/en/peace/|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining its [[academic freedom|independence in academic]], financial and management matters. The [[UN Secretary-General]] is the Honorary President of UPEACE. The UN General Assembly maintains a constant interest in the activities of UPEACE, and in periodic resolutions calls on the UN Secretary-General to report to it on its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/83|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/466/81/PDF/N0946681.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the UN Secretary-General reports to the General Assembly of the UN periodically on the progress of UPEACE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the UN Secretary General on the University for Peace, A/64/281, dated 11 August 2009.|url=http://www.upeace.org/PDF/SG's%20Report%20-%202009%20(English).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council of the University for Peace is the supreme authority of the University. It is composed of five ''ex-officio'' members viz. the Rector, two representatives designated by the UN Secretary-General and by the Director-General of the [[UNESCO]], the Rector of the United Nations University, two representatives designated by the Government of the host country and the Chancellor of UPEACE. In addition, the Council comprises ten representatives of the academic community or other persons eminent in the field of peace and security appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN in consultation with the Director-General of the UNESCO.

=== Accreditation ===

The University has "unique world-wide authorization to award academic degrees, recognized by all countries which are members of the General Assembly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about-upeace/accreditation|title=University for Peace|website=www.upeace.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, its MA programs in the Department of Environment, Peace and Development, received official accreditation from SINAES (the national Costa Rican accreditation body) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about-upeace/accreditation/update-on-upeace-accreditation-process|title=University for Peace|website=www.upeace.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the MA programme in International Law and Human Rights, and the MA programme in International Law and the Settlement of Disputes received accreditation from SINAES in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upeace.org/news/two-programmes-from-the-international-law-department-receive-official-quality-accreditation._2016-09-09|title=Two programmes from the International Law Department receive Official Quality Accreditation.|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the fact that UPEACE offers unique MA programs that cannot be found anywhere else in the world means that it is the best and only choice for those who want to study the specific fields of Peace Education; Gender and Peacebuilding; Media, Peace and Conflict Studies; Responsible Management and Sustainable Development; etc.

== Headquarters and main campus ==

The University for Peace has its headquarters in Costa Rica, a country distinguished by a long tradition of democracy. Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948, the former President, H.E. [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]] was awarded The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1987 and the country continues to develop strong efforts for natural conservation - not to mention the friendly locals. The main campus of the University - the [[Rodrigo Carazo Odio|Rodrigo Carazo]] Campus - is located 30&amp;nbsp;km Southwest of San Jose, within a natural reserve composed of a secondary forest and the last remnant of primary forest (200 ha) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Hence, this protected area is very rich in fauna. It shelters mammals such as monkeys and deer; reptiles; and over 300 species of birds, as well as approximately 100 varieties of trees. The University's installations and protected area make up 303 ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about/campus/|title=About UPEACE|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest town to the mountain on which the University is perched, is [[Ciudad Colon]]. Most of the students, staff and faculty members of the University reside in Ciudad Colon, making it one of the most multi-cultural places in the world for its size.

The Rodrigo Carazo campus of the University for Peace is the principal location for the activities of the University. Most of its [http://www.upeace.org/academic/index.cfm Masters programmes] and its recently announced [http://www.upeace.org/academic/doctorate/ Doctoral programme] are administered from this campus. Students coming from several countries study in a highly [[multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] environment on the campus. The University boasts of a highly accomplished [http://www.upeace.org/faculty/index.cfm faculty], that comprises a mix of both resident and visiting faculty members. Because of the structure of the programmes and its unique global status, the University has an [http://www.upeace.org/calendar/index.cfm academic calendar] that enables bringing on board the most highly acclaimed academicians and practitioners from around the world. The University has also started administering [http://www.upeace.org/academic/distance/ distance education courses], including an online Masters Programme from the main campus.

The University also carries out hands-on training beyond its Masters and Doctoral Programmes aimed at practitioners and policy makers rather than graduate students. The University has established two Centres for this purpose that are located on the main campus. The [http://www.centre.upeace.org/ UPEACE Centre for Executive Education] delivers dynamic training courses to leaders from around the world. The Centre reaches out to nonprofit leaders, business executives, educators at all levels, UN staff, students and other professional audiences. According to the Centre's website, the approach to all its courses is innovative, interactive, and participant-centered, using case-studies and field trips when appropriate. The Centre aims to develop key leadership skills by incorporating the crosscutting themes of Intercultural Communication, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and Teambuilding.

The University has also established the [http://www.hrc.upeace.org/ UPEACE Human Rights Centre] which was created within the contours of the broader mission of the University to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace and with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. In particular, the work of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre seeks to promote understanding, respect and enjoyment of [[universal human rights]]. The Centre carries out this objective through human rights education, training, research, capacity building and awareness raising activities. The website of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre states that the Centre takes a practice based approach to the respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights and promotes the integration of theory and practice. The Centre also takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights and attaches equal importance to all human rights. Over the last few years, the UPEACE Human Rights Centre has conducted several training courses for policy makers, staff members of the UN and other inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics and civil servants.

The Headquarters and main campus of UPEACE also hosts the International Secretariat of the [[Earth Charter Initiative]], whose stated mission is "to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, ecological integrity, [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] human rights, [[respect for diversity]], [[economic justice]], [[democracy]], and a culture of peace." This mission is carried out using '[[The Earth Charter]]' as the principal guiding framework. The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, [[sustainability|sustainable]], and peaceful global society in the 21st century. In 2012, the Earth Charter Initiative and UPEACE were jointly awarded the UNESCO Chair on Education for Sustainable Development and the Earth Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Chair on ESD and Earth Charter, awarded jointly to EC Initiative and UPEACE|url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/categories/Education/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work related to this UNESCO Chair will be carried out at the newly constructed 'Earth Charter Center for Education for Sustainable Development' at the UPEACE main campus.

In addition to the activities at the Costa Rica Headquarters Campus, UPEACE works with an increasing number of partners in various parts of the world to ensure that the UPEACE mission is extended to reach as many individuals and institutions as possible.

== Around the world ==

'''Africa'''

As a result of extensive international consultations, which have underlined the importance of according a high priority to activities in Africa, the University for Peace (UPEACE) officially launched its Africa Programme in January 2002.

The University for Peace (UPEACE) established its [https://web.archive.org/web/20060629044240/http://www.africa.upeace.org/ Africa Programme] in 2002 on the basis of extensive consultations in the continent which aimed at developing a programme that responded to the true needs, aspirations and obstacles for education for building peace in Africa. From its inception, the programme focused on the necessity to stimulate and strengthen the capacity in Africa to teach, train and conduct research in areas of peace and conflict studies.

The first five years of the programme focused on the development of curricula and teaching materials and the delivery of a range of short courses, workshops, conferences and seminars in various parts of Africa. Within this period, the programme attracted close to one thousand participants from Academia, Policy makers and civil society organisations.

In a second five-year plan, which came out of a consultative meeting held in March 2007 with partners, the programme will additionally, work with a number of Partner Universities to develop full-fledged master's degree programmes to be based at African Universities. The principal aim of this endeavour is to further strengthen the African capacity and build a wide expertise for a better understanding of conflicts in Africa, their prevention and the creation of the environment favourable to lasting peace and development in the region.

'''Europe'''

In January 2012, UPEACE created a new Centre at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] ([http://www.upeace.nl/ UPEACE The Hague]), which is housed at the Academy Building of the [[Peace Palace]], next to The [[Hague Academy of International Law]]. UPEACE The Hague will focus on education and research at the forefront of peace studies, closely cooperating with academic and policy-oriented institutions in The Hague region. UPEACE The Hague will initially advance three fields where it can be innovative and complementary: Peace &amp; Conflict Studies, Water &amp; Peace, and Urban Peace &amp; Security. In addition, UPEACE The Hague will strengthen peace education in The Hague region by organising professional trainings, lectures, seminars, and workshops. Educational and research programmes will be characterised by the interaction between theory and practice, also contributing to policy innovations, and will therefore be appealing to both academics and professionals.

The Geneva Office of UPEACE, established in 2001, has continued to support the development of the overall activities of the University, in particular its regional programmes in Africa and Central Asia. The key focus of work undertaken by the Geneva office is contributing to the development of programme activities of the University in Africa and the Middle East, engaging with the academic community in Geneva to establish joint teaching and training courses on issues of particular relevance to the expertise available within the international community in Geneva and facilitation of relations within Europe and with the United Nations system, national delegations, donor community and academic institutions.

'''Asia-Pacific'''

In 2010, the [http://upeaceap.org UPEACE Asia Pacific Centre] (UPAPC) was established in Seoul, The Republic of Korea. The Centre carries out important activities as a think tank for development studies and provides post-graduate training programmes(Masters) in The Republic of  Korea. The Republic of Korea acceded to the International Agreement for the establishment of the University for Peace and Charter of the University for Peace on June 11, 2010.

'''Asia'''

The [http://www.upeace.org/academic/spec_masters/alp.cfm Asia Leaders Programme], a Dual Campus Master Programme, is a shared initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the University for Peace, in collaboration with [[Ateneo de Manila University]], which aims to provide students from Japan and other Asian countries with an opportunity to pursue a peace studies post graduate degree with a content-based language-training module. This offers the support for individuals who do not have a proficient command of English to work in this increasingly common international language and to become comfortable in their professional abilities as they gain academic skills. As part of the programme, students have also the opportunity to apply their academic and practical knowledge through a four-month internship at the end of the Master courses.

'''Affiliated institutions'''

Article 4 of the Charter of the University for Peace reads: "the University may enter into association or conclude agreements with Governments and intergovernmental and other organizations and institutions in the field of education." The University for Peace signed agreements with the governments of Serbia (formerly Yugoslavia), Colombia and Uruguay to open centres in those three countries. These centres have the necessary legal status to enjoy autonomy and academic freedom, while keeping its humanistic purpose within the framework of both the Charter of the University for Peace and the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The European Centre for Peace and Development (ECPD) in Belgrade, Serbia; the World Centre for Training and Research in Conflict Resolution (WCCR) in Bogotá, Colombia; and the World Centre for Research for Peace (CMIP) in Montevideo, Uruguay, have developed close links with their respective governments while being key UPEACE partners in areas of common interest. UPEACE keeps operational agreements with them and lends its logos when necessary in order to undertake joint activities within the framework of UPEACE's and the Centres’ mission. These activities, as with other partners, involve the cooperating parties working together at all stages of jointly agreed-upon projects.
