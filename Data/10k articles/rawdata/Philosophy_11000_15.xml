'''Abstractionism''' is the [[theory]] that the [[mind]] obtains some or all of its [[concept]]s by [[abstraction|abstracting]] them from concepts it already has, or from [[experience]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"&gt;Geach, Peter (1957) Mental Acts - Their Contents and Their Objects. Routledge Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other [[property (philosophy)|properties]]. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by [[George Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_philosophy/summary/v024/24.4flage.html | title=Berkeley on Abstraction | journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy | year=1986 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=483–501 | doi=10.1353/hph.1986.0073 | last=Flage | first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Geach]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"/&gt;

== Development ==
Abstractionism has its roots in [[Aristotle]]'s writings, particularly those rejecting the [[Plato|Platonic]] [[Theory of forms|theory of Forms]]. They were adopted and developed further by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Berkeley's Philosophy of Mathematics|last=Jesseph|first=Douglas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2010|isbn=0226398978|location=Chicago|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Causality and Mind: Essays on Early Modern Philosophy|last=Jolley|first=Nicholas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199669554|location=Oxford|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of Human Learning|last=Winch|first=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415161908|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory contradicts the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Phenomenology|last=Sinha|first=D|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1969|isbn=9789024702664|location=The Hague|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jerry Fodor]], who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts|last=Gingell|first=John|last2=Winch|first2=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9780415428927|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky, for instance, explained the "deep structure" of the [[Internet]] or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that "linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interlock: Art, Conspiracy, and the Shadow Worlds of Mark Lombardi|last=Goldstone|first=Patricia|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2015|isbn=9781619025653|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Berkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word "triangle" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|year=2012|isbn=9789401086288|location=Dordrecht|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Age of Aquarius'''" is an [[Astrology|astrological]] term denoting either the current or forthcoming [[astrological age]], depending on the method of calculation. Astrologers maintain that an astrological age is a product of the earth's slow [[Axial precession|precessional rotation]] and lasts for 2,160 years, on average (26,000-year period of precession / 12 zodiac signs = 2,160 years).

There are various methods of calculating the length of an astrological age. In sun-sign [[Planets in astrology|astrology]], the first sign is [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], followed by [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]], and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]], whereupon the cycle returns to Aries and through the zodiacal signs again. Astrological ages, however, proceed in the opposite direction ("[[Retrograde motion|retrograde]]" in astronomy). Therefore, the Age of Aquarius follows the Age of Pisces.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', 2000, pp. 115–27 - chapter 7 - "Love Shall Steer the Stars - The Long Dawning of the Age of Aquarius"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The approximate 2,150 years for each age corresponds to the average time it takes for the [[vernal equinox]] to move from one [[constellation]] of the [[zodiac]] into the next. This can be computed by dividing the earth's 25,800-year [[gyroscopic precession|gyroscopic]] [[Axial precession|precession]] period by twelve, the number of zodiac constellations used by astrologers. According to different astrologers' calculations, approximate dates for entering the Age of Aquarius range from AD 1447 (Terry MacKinnell) to AD 3597 (John Addey).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', 1999, pp. 489–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrologers do not agree on when the Aquarian age will start or even if it has already started.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', 2000, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Campion]] in ''The Book of World [[Horoscopes]]'' lists various references from mainly astrological sources for the start of the Age of Aquarius. Based on Campion's research, most published materials on the subject state that the Age of Aquarius arrived in the 20th century (29 claims), with the 24th century in second place with twelve claimants.&lt;ref&gt;Eight researchers claim the Aquarian age will arrive in the 25th century while the 21st, 26th, and 27th centuries have seven supporters each. Other centuries that have a number of supporters for the beginning of the Aquarian age include: 22nd and 23rd centuries (6 each); 19th century (5); and the 18th century (4) Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', The Wessex Astrologer Ltd., 1999, Pgs 489-495&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrological ages exist as a result of [[precession of the equinoxes]]. The slow wobble of the earth's spin axis on the celestial sphere is independent of the [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] rotation of the Earth on its own axis and the annual revolution of the earth around the sun. Traditionally this 25,800-year-long cycle is calibrated, for the purposes of determining astrological ages, by the location of the sun in one of the twelve zodiac constellations at the vernal equinox, which corresponds to the moment the sun rises above the celestial equator, marking the start of spring in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] each year. Roughly every 2,150&amp;nbsp;years the sun's position at the time of the vernal equinox will have moved into a new zodiacal constellation. However zodiacal constellations are not uniform in size, leading some astrologers to believe that the corresponding ages should also vary in duration. This however is a contentious issue among astrologers.

In 1929 the [[International Astronomical Union]] defined the edges of the 88 official constellations. The edge established between [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] officially locates the beginning of the Aquarian Age around AD 2600. Many astrologers dispute this approach because of the varying sizes and overlap between the zodiacal constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Grasse, ''Signs of the Times'', 2002, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astrological meaning==
Astrologers believe that an astrological age affects humanity, possibly by influencing the rise and fall of civilizations or cultural tendencies. 

Traditionally, Aquarius is associated with [[electricity]], [[computer]]s, flight, [[democracy]], freedom, [[humanitarianism]], [[idealism]], [[modernization]], astrology, [[Anxiety|nervous disorder]]s, rebellion, nonconformity, [[philanthropy]], veracity, perseverance, humanity, and irresolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rex E Bills, ''The Ruler-ship Book'', 1974, pp. 362–365&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Dean, ''Recent Advances in Natal Astrology - A Critical Review 1900–1976'', 1977, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The variations of views among astrologers include:
* Among other dates, one view is that the Age of Aquarius arrived around 1844, with the harbinger of the Siyyid `Alí Muḥammad (1819–1850), who founded [[Bábism]].&lt;ref&gt;David Williams, ''Simplified Astronomy for Astrologers'', 1969, American Federation of Astrologers, pp. 45–56&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marcia Moore]] and Mark Douglas promoted the view that, although no one knows when the Aquarian Age begins, the [[American Revolution]], the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the discovery of electricity are all attributable to the Aquarian Age.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Moore &amp; Mark Douglas, ''Astrology, The Divine Science'', 1971, p. 677&lt;/ref&gt; Moore and Douglas make a number of predictions about the trends that they believe will develop in the Aquarian Age.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Moore &amp; Mark Douglas, ''Astrology, The Divine Science'', 1971, p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;
* A common position expressed by many astrologers sees the Age of Aquarius as that time when humanity takes control of the Earth and its own destiny as its rightful heritage, with the destiny of humanity being the revelation of truth and the expansion of [[consciousness]], and that some people will experience mental enlightenment in advance of others and therefore be recognized as the new leaders in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Vera W Reid, ''Towards Aquarius '', 1971, pp. 97–116&lt;/ref&gt;
* Proponents of medieval astrology suggest that the Pisces world where religion is the [[opium of the people|opiate of the masses]] will be replaced in the Aquarian Age by a world ruled by secretive, power-hungry elites seeking absolute power over others; that knowledge in the Aquarian Age will only be valued for its ability to win wars; that knowledge and science will be abused, not industry and trade; and that the Aquarian Age will be a Dark Age in which [[religion]] is considered offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zoller, "The Use of Archetypes in Prediction", ''The FAA Journal'' September 2002 Volume 32 No 3 (Federation of Australian Astrologers), pp. 37–53&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another view suggests that the rise of scientific rationalism, combined with the fall of religious influence, the increasing focus on [[human rights]] since the 1780s, the exponential growth of technology, plus the advent of flight and space travel, are evidence of the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', 2000, pp. 126–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis MacNeice, ''Astrology'', Bloomsbury Books, London, 1989, pp. 100–1&lt;/ref&gt;
* A "wave" theory of the shifting Great Ages suggests that the Age of Aquarius will not arrive on a given date but is instead emerging in influence over many years, similar to how [[tide|the tide]] surges forward incrementally rather than all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Grasse, ''Signs of the Times'', 2002, pp. 228–231&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rudolf Steiner]] believed that the Age of Aquarius will arrive in 3573. In Steiner's approach, each age is exactly 2,160 years. Based on this structure, the world has been in the Age of Pisces since 1413. Rudolf Steiner had spoken about two great spiritual events: the return of [[Christ]] in the ethereal world (and not in a physical body), because people must develop their faculties until they can reach the ethereal world; and the incarnation of [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]], [[Zoroaster]]'s "destructive spirit" that will try to block the evolution of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lazaridès, ''"Vivons-nous les commencements de l'Ere des Poissons"'' - Editions anthroposophiques romandes. 1989 pp. 143–155&lt;/ref&gt;
* A variation of Steiner's approach has the age of Aquarius arriving in 1433 (or up to two years earlier), with the influence of Pisces exceeding Aquarius at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Terry MacKinnell, ''"The Dawning – Shedding New Light on the Astrological Ages"'', Xlibris, 2011, pp. 296–7 {{ISBN|978-1-4568-8253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}
* In an article about [[feminism]] in the French newspaper ''[[La Fronde (newspaper)|La Fronde]]'' from February 26, 1890, [[August Vandekerkhove]] stated: "About March, 21st this year the cycle of Aquarius will start. Aquarius is the house of the woman". He adds that is in this age the woman will be equal to the man.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Common cultural associations==
The expression ''Age of Aquarius'' in popular culture usually refers to the heyday of the [[hippie]] and [[New Age]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s.

Although more rock than [[New-age music|new-age]] in genre, the 1967&amp;nbsp;[[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', with its opening song "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Aquarius]]" and the memorable line "This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius", brought the Aquarian age concept to the attention of audiences worldwide. However, the song further defines this dawning of the age within the first lines: "When the Moon is in the [[House (astrology)|seventh house]] and Jupiter aligns with Mars, then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars". Astrologer Neil Spencer denounced the lyrics as "astrological gibberish", noting that [[Jupiter]] aligns with [[Mars]] several times a year and the [[moon]] is in the 7th&amp;nbsp;House for two hours every day.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', 2000, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

These lines are considered by many{{who|date=September 2016}} to be merely [[poetic license]], though some people take them literally. An example is the identification of [[Valentine's Day]]&amp;nbsp;2009 as the "perfect alignment to support our collective manifestation of love and peace and dawning of the Age of Aquarius".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judecurrivan.com/ Judecurrivan.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the [[NBC]] [[television]] show ''[[Aquarius (U.S. TV series)|Aquarius]]'', which premiered on May 28, 2015, is based on the [[Charles Manson]] case. The name relates to the "dawn of Aquarius," also commonly referred to as the New Age way of thinking.

'''Alexandre Mercereau''' (Paris, 22 October 1884 – 1945) was a French [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] poet and critic associated with [[Unanimism]] and the [[Abbaye de Créteil]]. He founded the Villa Médicis Libre, which helped impoverished artists and operated as charitable reformatory for delinquent teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=LVxCp5btOAEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22Villa+M%C3%A9dicis+Libre%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NXVyVaC3NMToUt7Yg-AD&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Villa%20M%C3%A9dicis%20Libre%22&amp;f=false Kathryn Brown, ''The Art Book Tradition in Twentieth-Century Europe'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013, p. 20], {{ISBN|1409420655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercereau's work inspired the revolutionary artistic movement of the early 20th century known as [[Cubism]].

==Early life and career==
Born '''Alexandre Mercereau de la Chaume''', he signed his first texts '''Eshmer-Valdor''', a [[pseudonym]] he quickly abandoned. In 1901, at sixteen years of age, Mercereau's first verses were published; poetry and criticism in ''Oeuvre d'art international''. In 1904 he co-founded the magazine ''La Vie'', where he became assistant editor, drama critic, and columnist.&lt;ref name="Metzinger 1911"&gt;[[Jean Metzinger]], ''Alexandre Mercereau'', a critical essay published in ''Vers et Prose'', 27 (October–November 1911)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parmentier 1911"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/toutesleslyresan01parmuoft  Ernest Florian-Parmentier, ''Toutes les lyres, Anthologie-Critique des Poètes Contemporains]'', 1911, Paris, Gastein-Serge&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 he published ''Les Thuribulums affaissés'', a book of verse that attracted much attention. At the same time, he co-founded the Association Ernest-Renan. In 1906 he organized the French section of Salon exhibition and literary review ''La Toison d'Or''.&lt;ref name="Metzinger 1911" /&gt;

In 1907 he published ''Gens de là et d'ailleurs''. From 1907 to 1908 he co-founded and participated in the experience of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], a collective open to artists. Mercereau organized exhibitions of French artists in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Kiev, and Odessa. After World War I he published a pamphlet, ''L'Abbaye et le bolchevisme culturel'' (published by [[:fr:Eugène Figuière|Eugène Figuière]]), in which he denounced the attitude of Georges Duhamel and [[Charles Vildrac]]. From 1910 he co-directed with [[Paul Fort]] the Parisian literary review ''Vers et Prose''. In 1911 he created the literary section of the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris, called ''Comité d'initiative théâtrale'', consisting of public lectures by emerging authors at the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Théâtre de l'Odéon]]. He subsequently co-founded the ''Revue indépendante'' and ''La Rue'', in addition to ''Vers et Prose''.&lt;ref name="Metzinger 1911" /&gt;

Mercereau was literary director at Jacques Povolozky &amp; Cie publishing, director of Caméléon, a ''café littéraire'' in [[Montparnasse]]. In ''Histoire Contemporaine des Lettres Française de 1885 à 1914'' (Eugène Figuière), Ernest Florian-Parmentier writes "[...] M. Mercereau seems endowed with all the qualities that lead almost inevitably to success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120529171716/http://clefargent.free.fr/mercereau.php Éric Dussert, ''Alexandre Mercereau (1884-1945)'', ''La Littérature est mauvaise fille'' (L'Atelier du Gué), 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lalittraturel00parmuoft Ernest Florian-Parmentier, ''Histoire Contemporaine des Lettres Française de 1885 à 1914'' (Histoire de la Littérature Française de 1885 à nos jours), Eugène Figuière, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbaye de Créteil==
{{main|Abbaye de Créteil}}
The [[Abbaye de Créteil]] was a ''[[phalanstère]]'' utopian community founded during the fall of 1906 by Alexandre Mercereau, along with the poets [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], [[Charles Vildrac]], and the artist, theorist [[Albert Gleizes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lredudrameessa00barz#page/134/mode/2up Barzun, Henri-Martin, ''L'Ere du Drame, Essai de Synthèse Poétique Moderne'', Figuière, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement drew its inspiration from the ''Abbaye de Thélème,'' a fictional creation by [[Rabelais]] in his novel ''[[Gargantua]]''.

Albert Gleizes met the artists [[:fr:Berthold Mahn|Berthold Mahn]], Jacques d'Otémar and Josué Gaboriaud while in Amiens (1904), as well as the printer, Lucien Linard, who would run the printshop at the [[Abbaye de Créteil]]. At this time, the art critic Jean Valmy Baysse (and soon historian of the [[Comédie-Française]]), in collaboration with Alexandre Mercereau, René Arcos, [[Charles Vildrac]] and [[Georges Duhamel]] were invited to participate on a new journal, titled ''La Vie''.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolist poet and writer [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]] joined the group of writers and painters in 1905. Gleizes assisted in the formation of the Association [[Ernest Renan]] in December at the [[Théâtre Pigalle]], in an attempt to counter the rise of militarist propaganda. In the process, publications and artwork tended towards a more popular and secular culture. Gleizes was in charge of the literary and artistic developments that organized poetry readings and street theatre.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Mercereau, Gleizes and others throughout 1906 worked on a concept established by Charles Vildrac of creating a self-supporting community of artists. The motivation was to develop their art free of commercial considerations. In Créteil, a small village outside Paris, they invested a house and grounds. Barzun paid the rent for the first six months, financed with his small inheritance. Gleizes and Vildrac moved in during the month of December.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; At the outset of 1907 the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] consisted of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel. Duhamel and Barzun joined the group periodically. The musician [[:fr:Albert Doyen|Albert Doyen]], later to become known as founder of the ''Fêtes du Peuple'' also participated intermittently. In 1906 Mercereau travelled to Moscow, where he met a group of Russian symbolist and Art Nouveau artists called Голубая роза (Blue Rose). There worked on a magazine publication and helped organize the French section of a salon exhibition called ''La Toison d'Or'' (Golden Fleece, Золотое руно). Simultaneously, he worked as a correspondent for the Abbaye de Créteil.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

He returned to Paris in the Spring of 1907 with a Russian wife. At this time the Abbaye group supported itself through the printing (run by Linard and Gleizes) of high-quality material. The painters Berthold Mahn, Jacques d'Otémar and Henri Doucet visited periodically.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

A former student at the [[Académie Julian]] and a friend of [[Maurice Denis]] and [[Les Nabis]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] was painting in a progressively geometric fashion. He exhibited his seascapes at the 1909 [[Salon des Indépendants]], and would soon meet Albert Gleizes through Alexandre Mercereau the same year. Mercereau, perhaps, realized the extent of their common interests.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Daniel Robbins, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Villa Médicis Libre==
Mercereau founded the Villa Médicis Libre, in Villepreux, under the patronage of Fondation Georges Bonjean, to provide inexpensive accommodations for avant-garde artists living in difficulties. [[André Lhote]] and [[Raoul Dufy]] resided there in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914'', ''La guerre'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15. Reprinted, Ampuis, 1997, written during the First World War&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/souvenirs.html Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914'', Notes, 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mercereau and Cubism==
According to [[Albert Gleizes]], Mercereau is responsible for having introduced him to [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] in 1910—the same year that Mercereau curated and included these artists in a Moscow exhibition, probably the first [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] Exhibition. Prior to meeting, Gleizes and Metzinger had been linked by [[Louis Vauxcelles]]' disparaging comments on "des cubes blafards"&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]. Quoted in John Golding, ''Cubism'', London, 1959, p. 22. See ''Toison d'Or'', Moscow, 1908, nos. 7-10, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; which likely referred to Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (1909–10) and Gleizes' ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre (The Tree)]]'' (1910) at the [[Salon des Indépendants]]. Mercereau had previously included Gleizes' ''Les Brumes du Matin sur la Marne'' in a Russian exhibition of 1908.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Given Mercereau's long standing delight in promoting group activity", writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "it is easy to recognize his pleasure in having brought together three painters whose works exhibited similar interests and who could be identified with his own synthetic ideals, ideals which had been influential in the Abbaye's development". As organizer of the literary section of the Salon d'Automne of 1909, he was able to introduce Gleizes to painters exhibiting there and to introduce his own concepts to the world of painting.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1909 and 1910 a significant group of artists came together through Mercereau. The entire group—including [[:fr:Roger Allard|Allard]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Barzun]], Beauduin, [[:fr:Pierre Castiaux|Castiaux]], [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Jouve]], [[:fr:Fernand Divoire|Divoire]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]], [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuși]], [[:fr:Théo Varlet|Varlet]] and even [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Apollinaire]] and [[André Salmon|Salmon]]—became sympathetic to the ideas of the Abbaye. During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organized a ''Journée portes ouvertes'' at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, and soon principle theorist of [[Futurism]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1911"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Alexandre Mercereau'', Vers et Prose, Paris, no. 27, October–December, 1911, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''From Symbolism to Cubism: The Abbaye of Créteil", The Art Journal, 1963-64, XXIII 2. pp. 111-116&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In poetry", writes Robbins, "this post-symbolist attempt to achieve new forms had to break decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not correspond with the reality of modem life; unity of time did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1911" /&gt;) shifted his scenes so violently, why Barzun tried to solve the problem of simultaneously developing lines of action by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's ''Real Allegory'' which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet "did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought".&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', published by Eugène Figuière, Paris, 1912. The authors begin their work with a discussion of Courbet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This group of artists met regularly at Le Fauconnier's studio near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. Salmon and Apollinaire were only peripheral members, participating in divers literary and artistic circles, but clearly Apollinaire's conception of Cubism was influenced by the epic notions found in the old Abbaye circle. In his preface to the 1911 Brussels Indépendants, Apollinaire wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...thus has come a simple and noble art, expressive and measured, eager to discover beauty, and entirely ready to tackle those vast subjects which the painters of yesterday did not dare to undertake, abandoning them to the presumptuous, old-fashioned and boring daubers of the official Salons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1913, L'Homme au hamac, oil on canvas, 130 x 155.5 cm. Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York.jpg|thumb|300px|Albert Gleizes, 1913, ''[[Man in a Hammock|L'Homme au Hamac (Man in a Hammock)]]'', oil on canvas, 130 x 155.5 cm, [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo, New York]]
This conception is not based on the studies of Picasso and Braque (what became known years later as the analytical Cubism), which had annihilated subject matter almost entirely and confined it to exceedingly flat space. Instead, it suggests the broad concepts held by the Mercereau-Gleizes circle, concepts at that time visible only in the paintings of Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Fernand Léger]]. The subjects treated by these Cubists differed significantly from the isolated still lifes or figures chosen by Picasso and Braque.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

Mercereau attempted to represent facets of [[time]] in his writings, much as Gleizes and Metzinger attempted to represent facets of space, time and form in their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HmPoAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Metzinger,+gleizes+hamac,+Mercereau&amp;dq=Metzinger,+gleizes+hamac,+Mercereau&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-MSUqGhEYXG4AOm6IGAAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw Bernard Augustine De Voto, ''Saturday Review'', Volume 48, Saturday Review Company, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Alexandre Mercereau, quick to spotlight the merit of others, so fastidious about honor that he indicates the provenance of any idea he did not find within himself, possessor of an intelligence where the most antinomic philosophies are elaborated, has very quickly passed through the phases of contemporary literature, with the cheerful self-assurance of someone who has never been affected by the herd instinct. ...

Alexandre Mercereau glorifies the androgyne, establishes ingenuous relationships between sacred vessels and instruments for the boudoir, and remains expressly a poet.|Jean Metzinger, 1911&lt;ref name="Metzinger 1911" /&gt;}}

A painting by Gleizes entitled ''[[Man in a Hammock]]'' integrates the man into the landscape, forming a single image by virtue of a non-linear grid. This device is used by Gleizes to accommodate all aspects of the scene. One of Mercereau's books can be seen in the painting, along with the still-life next to the sitter, the man, and the environment. All are symbols of fundamental importance to Gleizes, an artist who rarely, if ever, contented himself with mundane subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DfLqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Metzinger,+gleizes+hamac,+Mercereau&amp;dq=Metzinger,+gleizes+hamac,+Mercereau&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OfsSUtPZJsHyyAH1soDYCQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBg Painters of the Section d'Or: The Alternatives to Cubism. Exhibition, September 27-October 22, 1967, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

The man represented in the painting is very likely a portrait of Jean Metzinger.&lt;ref name="Briend"&gt;Briend, C., Exhibition Catalogue, ''Gleizes - Metzinger. Du Cubisme et après'', 9 May - 22 September 2012, pp. 34, 36, Musée de La Poste, Galerie du Messager, Paris, France. Exposition in commemoration of 100th anniversary of the publication of Du "Cubisme"]&lt;/ref&gt; The book entitled ''Paroles devant la vie'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/works/OL15710170W/Paroles_devant_la_vie Alexandre Mercereau, Paroles devant la vie, Published 1913 by E. Figuière in Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; held prominently by the model was written by Mercereau in 1913. Gleizes had collaborated in founding the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], and was very familiar with Mercereau's writings. Metzinger wrote an important text about Mercereau in 1911.&lt;ref name="Metzinger 1911" /&gt; Mercereau's publisher, [[:fr:Eugène Figuière|Eugène Figuière]], a year earlier had published ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', the Cubist manifesto written by Gleizes and Metzinger.

''Man in a Hammock'' is testament to the close association between Mercereau, Metzinger and Gleizes, and to their shared social, cultural and philosophical conviction that painting represented more than a fleeting glimpse of the world in which they lived, that by showing multiple facets of a subject captured at successive intervals in time simultaneously, a truer more complete image would emerge.&lt;ref name="Moser, Robbins"&gt;Joann Moser, Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger in retrospect'', 1985, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 he curated ''Moderní umění, 45th Exhibition of [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts|SVU Mánes]]'' in Prague. This "Survey of Modern Art" was one of the last prewar exhibitions in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books/about/Modern%C3%AD_uměn%C3%AD.html?id=DBqmOgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Alexandre Mercereau, Spolek výtvarných umělců Mánes, Moderní umění: 45. výstava S.V.U. Manes v Praze, únor-březen 1914 : soubor sestaven A. Mercereauem v Paříži, S.V.U. Manes, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition included works by [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[André Derain]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Jean Marchand]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Max Pechstein]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Jacques Villon]], in addition to Czech artists.

By 1914, Mercereau had met the Spanish sculptor [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]] and became his lifelong supporter and 
friend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/pifiron00gimn ''Picasso and the age of iron'', Carmen Giménez; Dore Ashton; Francisco Calvo Serraller, 1948, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">'''Animal industrial complex (AIC)''' refers to the accumulation of interests responsible for institutionalized exploitation of non-human animals. It entirely differs from individual acts of [[animal cruelty]] in that it is an institutionalized animal exploitation. Coined in 1989 by [[Barbara Noske]], it is one of the main topics of the [[critical animal studies]]. It is analogous to the term ''[[capitalism]]'' in human [[sociology]].

==Definitions==
Animal industrial complex, derived from the [[military–industrial complex]] of the 1950s,{{sfn|Sorenson, 2014|p=xii}} is the collective term used to "describe the many traditions, institutions, and industries that transform animals into products and services for human consumption."{{sfn|Sorenson, 2014|p=298}} It is an institutionalized violence against non-human animals that occur without any effective public opposition or government intervention.{{sfn|Sorenson, 2014|p=300}} The phrase ''animal industrial complex'' was coined in 1989 by the Dutch cultural anthropologist and philosopher [[Barbara Noske]] in her book ''Humans and Other Animals''. In the book, she wrote, "Animals have become reduced to mere appendages of computers and machines.”{{sfn|Noske, 1989|p=20}} Sociologist Richard Twine later defined the concept as “partly opaque and multiple set of networks and relationships between the corporate (agricultural) sector, governments, and public and private science. With economic, cultural, social and affective dimensions it encompasses an extensive range of practices, technologies, images, identities and markets."{{sfn|Twine, 2012|p=23}}

==Origin of the complex==
The origin of the animal industrial complex can be traced back to antiquity when humans began [[Domestication|domesticating]] animals. However, it was only since 1945 that the animal industrial complex began to grow significantly. According to Kim Stallwood, the animal industrial complex is "an integral part of the neoliberal, transnational order of increasing privatization and decreasing government intervention, favouring transnational corporations and global capital."{{sfn|Sorenson, 2014|p=299}} According to Sorenson, two milestones mark the shift in human attitudes toward animals that empowered the animal industrial complex, namely, [[Chicago]] and its stockyards and [[slaughterhouses]] from 1865 and the post-[[World War II]] developments such as [[Intensive animal farming|intensive factory farms]], [[industrial fishing]], and [[xenotransplantation]].{{sfn|Sorenson, 2014|pp=299–300}} [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''The Jungle'' explicitly describes the mistreatment of animals during their lives until they end up at the slaughterhouse.{{sfn|Sinclair, 1906}} [[Charles Patterson (author)|Charles Patterson]]'s ''Eternal Treblinka'' explains how the disassembly of animals in the slaughterhouses inspired [[Henry Ford]]'s assembling of cars in factories, and how it further influenced the [[Third Reich]] in [[Nazi Germany]] in building [[concentration camps]] and [[gas chambers]].{{sfn|Patterson, 2002|pp=71–79}}

==Properties of the complex==
The animal industrial complex breeds animals in the billions in order to make products and services for human consumption. All these animals are considered legal property of the animal industrial complex. The animal industrial complex is said to have transformed the already confused relationship between human and non-human animals, significantly increasing the consumption and threatening human survival.{{sfn|Sorenson, 2014|p=299}} The pervasive nature of the animal industrial complex is such that it evades attention.{{sfn|Sorenson, 2014|p=299}}

'''Aristotle's views on women''' influenced later [[Western philosophy|Western thinkers]], as well as [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic thinkers]], who quoted him as an authority until the end of the [[Middle Ages]], influencing [[women's history]].

In his [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], [[Aristotle]] saw women as subject to men, but as higher than slaves, and lacking authority; he believed the husband should exert political rule over the wife. Among women's differences from men were that they were, in his view, more impulsive, more compassionate, more complaining, and more deceptive. He gave the same weight to women's happiness as to men's, and in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' stated that society could not be happy unless women were happy too. Whereas [[Plato]] stated that women, while inferior, should be educated, Aristotle appears to have disagreed.

In his [[Aristotle's biology#Inheritance|theory of inheritance]], Aristotle considered the mother to provide a passive material element to the child, while the father provided an active, ensouling element with the form of the human species.

==Differences between males and females==

Aristotle believed women were inferior to men. For example, in his work [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']] (1254b13–14), Aristotle states "as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plato and Aristotle on the Nature of Women|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236725862|journal = Journal of the History of Philosophy|pages = 467–478|volume = 21|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/hph.1983.0090|first = Nicholas D.|last = Smith|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Politics'' 1.12 he wrote, "The slave is wholly lacking the [[Deliberation|deliberative]] element; the female has it but it lacks authority; the child has it but it is incomplete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/#SH7e |title=Aristotle: Politics [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; 1260a11 |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Freeland wrote: "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2016|title = Feminist History of Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-femhist/|date = 2016-01-01|first = Charlotte|last = Witt|first2 = Lisa|last2 = Shapiro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are "more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate ... more easily moved to tears ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action" than men.&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of Animals]]'', 608b1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He wrote that only fair-skinned women, not darker-skinned women, had a sexual discharge and climaxed. He also believed this discharge could be increased by eating of pungent foods. Aristotle thought a woman's sexual discharge was akin to that of an infertile or amputated male's.&lt;ref name=728a&gt;''[[Generation of Animals]]'', I, 728a.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that both sexes contributed to the material of generation, but that the female's contribution was in her discharge (as in a male's) rather than within the ovary.&lt;ref name=728a/&gt;

Aristotle explains how and why the association between man and woman takes on a hierarchical character by commenting on male rule over 'barbarians', or non-Greeks. "By nature the female has been distinguished from the slave. For nature makes nothing in the manner that the coppersmiths make the Delphic knife – that is, frugally – but, rather, it makes each thing for one purpose. For each thing would do its work most nobly if it had one task rather than many. Among the barbarians the female and the slave have the same status. This is because there are no natural rulers among them but, rather, the association among them is between male and female slave. On account of this, the poets say that 'it is fitting that Greeks rule barbarians', as the barbarian and the slave are by nature the same."&lt;ref name=Stauffer/&gt; While Aristotle reduced women's roles in society, and promoted the idea that women should receive less food and nourishment than males, he also criticised the results: a woman, he thought, was then more [[compassionate]], more opinionated, more apt to scold and to strike. He stated that women are more prone to despondency, more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, and of having a better memory.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Animals'', book IX, part 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's role in inheritance==
{{further|Aristotle's biology|Telegony (pregnancy)}}
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|300px|Inheritance: model of transmission of movements from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|form]] from the father. The model is not fully symmetric.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}]]

Aristotle's inheritance model sought to explain how the parents' characteristics are transmitted to the child, subject to influence from the environment.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} In his view, an active, ensouling masculine element brought life to a passive female element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfoundations.com/WOMAN/Aristotle.html Aristotle on woman]&lt;/ref&gt; The system worked as follows. The father's semen and the mother's menses encode their parental characteristics.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=50}} The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define [[Aristotle#Aristotle's epistemology|the form or ''eidos'']] of the human species, while the movements of both the father's and the mother's fluids define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} The theory has some symmetry, as semen movements carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is hot enough to overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if it is too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus [[particulate inheritance|particulate]] (definitely one trait or another), as in [[Mendelian genetics]], unlike the [[Hippocratic]] model which was continuous and [[blending inheritance|blending]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}} The child's sex can be influenced by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}

==Morality and politics==
According to Aristotle, there should be "political rule" of the husband over the wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' I, 1259a–b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zamfir&gt;Korinna Zamfir, ''Men and Women in the Household of God: A Contextual Approach to Roles and Ministries in the Pastoral Epistle'', Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2013, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As for the differences between husband and wife, Aristotle says that these "always" consisted in external appearances, in speeches, and in honors.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 1259b.&lt;/ref&gt; The household functions of a man and of a woman are different because his business is "to get" and hers "to keep".&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' 1277b.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===On good wives===
[[Image:Aristotelous Oikonomikos.png|thumb|upright|Book cover of an edition of [[Economics (Aristotle)|''Economics'']] from 1830.]]
In his [[Economics (Aristotle)|''Economics'']], Aristotle wrote that it befits not a man of sound mind to bestow his person promiscuously, or have random intercourse with women; for otherwise the base-born will share in the rights of his lawful children, and his wife will be robbed of her honor due, and shame be attached to his sons. It is fitting that he should approach his wife in honor, full of self-restraint and awe, and in his conversation with her, should use only the words of a right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are themselves lawful and honorable. Aristotle's thought that a wife was best honored when she saw that her husband was faithful to her, and that he had no preference for another woman, but before all others loves, trusts her and holds her as his own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics and Economics of Aristotle'', Edward English Walford and John Gillies, trans. (London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1908), pp. 298ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle wrote that a husband should secure the agreement, loyalty, and devotion of his wife, so that whether he himself is present or not, there may be no difference in her attitude towards him, since she realizes that they are alike guardians of the common interests, and so when he is away she may feel that to her no man is kinder or more virtuous or more truly hers than her own husband.

===Spartan women===
{{Main article|Women in ancient Sparta}}
Aristotle wrote that in [[Sparta]], the legislator wanted to make the whole city (or country) hardy and temperate, and that he carried out his intention in the case of the men, but he overlooked the women, who lived in every sort of intemperance and wealth. He added that in those regimes in which the condition of the women was bad, half the city could be regarded as having no laws.&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics of Aristotle'', Book 2, Ch. 9, trans. Benjamin Jowett, London: Colonial Press, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal weight to female and male happiness===

Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his ''Rhetoric'' that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too. In an article titled "Aristotle's Account of the Subjection of Women", Stauffer explains that Aristotle believed that in nature a common good came of the rule of a superior being. But he does not indicate a common good for men being superior to women. He uses the word κρείττων ''kreitton'' to indicate superiority, meaning stronger. Aristotle believed that rational reasoning is what made you superior over lesser beings in nature, yet still used the term meaning stronger, not more rational or intelligent.&lt;ref name=Stauffer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauffer |first=Dana |title=Aristotle's Account of the Subjection of Women |journal=The Journal of Politics |date=Oct 2008 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=929–941 |jstor=30219476 |doi=10.1017/s0022381608080973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

On children, he said, "And what could be more divine than this, or more desired by a man of sound mind, than to beget by a noble and honored wife children who shall be the most loyal supporters and discreet guardians of their parents in old age, and the preservers of the whole house? Rightly reared by father and mother, children will grow up virtuous, as those who have treated them piously and righteously deserve that they should..."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Aristotle's Politics: Writings from the Complete Works: Politics, Economics, Constitution of Athens'', Princeton University Press, 2016, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed we all have a biological drive to procreate, to leave behind something to take the place and be similar to ourselves. This then justifies the natural partnership between man and woman. And each person has one specific purpose because we are better at mastering one specific trait rather than being adequate at multiple. For Aristotle, women's purpose is to give birth to children. Aristotle stressed that man and woman work together to raise the children and that how they raise them has a huge influence over the kind of people they become and thus the kind of society or community that everyone lives in.

==Comparison with Plato's views on women&lt;!--'Plato's views on women' redirects here--&gt;==

Aristotle appears to disagree with [[Plato]] on the topic whether women ought to be educated, as Plato says that they must be. Both of them, however, consider women to be inferior. Plato in ''Timaeus'' (90e) claims that men who were cowards and were lazy throughout their life shall be reborn as women and in the ''Laws'' (781b), he offers his reasons why women should be educated: "Because you neglected this sex, you gradually lost control of a great many things which would be in a far better state today if they had been regulated by law. A woman's natural potential for virtue is inferior to a man's, so she's proportionately a greater danger, perhaps even twice as great." Plato further establishes his opinion on the inferiority of women's "natural potential" by claiming in ''Republic'' (455d) that "Women share by nature in every way of life just as men do, but in all of them women are weaker than men."

Plato firmly believed in reincarnation and this was very important for the distinction he made between the nature of men and women. This was not the case for Aristotle, who saw the differences as biological. Plato discusses this matter with more detail in ''Timaeus'', where he states that men have a superior soul than women (42a): "Humans have a twofold nature, the superior kind should be such as would from then on be called "man". He added, once again, that men who led bad lives shall be reborn as women (42b): "And if a person lived a good life throughout the due course of his time, he would at the end return to his dwelling place in his companion star, to live a life of happiness that agreed with his character. But if he failed in this, he would be born a second time, now as a woman."

Plato also appears to use the term "womanish" or "female-like" as an derogatory term implying inferiority and emotional instability, as this is clear from ''Republic'' 469d and 605e, amongst others.

==Legacy==
===Galen===
Aristotle's assumptions on female coldness influenced [[Galen]] and others for almost two thousand years until the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Tuana, Nancy|title=The Less Noble Sex: Scientific, Religious and Philosophical Conceptions of Women's Nature|year=1993|pages=21, 169|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-36098-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church Fathers===
Joyce E. Salisbury argues that the [[Women in the patristic age|Church Fathers]], influenced by Aristotle's opinions, opposed the practice of independent female [[Asceticism|ascetism]] because it threatened to emancipate women from men.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce E. Salisbury, ''Church Fathers, Independent Virgins'', Verso, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Otto Weininger===
In his ''[[Sex and Character]]'', written in 1903, [[Otto Weininger]] explained that all people are composed of a mixture of the male and the female substance, and that these views are supported scientifically. Weininger cited Aristotle's views in the chapter "Male and Female Psychology" of his book.

{{Christian mysticism}}
'''Aspects of Christian meditation''' was the topic of a 15 October 1989 document of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. The document is titled "'''Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on some aspects of Christian meditation'''" and is formally known by its [[incipit]], '''''Orationis formas'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] 82 (1990) 362-379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/doc_doc_index.htm|title=Complete List of Documents - Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19891015_meditazione-cristiana_en.html Vatican website: ''LETTER TO THE BISHOPS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ON SOME ASPECTS OF CHRISTIAN MEDITATION'' October 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

The document issues warnings on differences, and potential incompatibilities, between [[Christian meditation]] and the styles of [[meditation]] used in eastern religions such as [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm|title=Congregation for Doctrine of Faith|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The meeting of religions and the Trinity'' by Gavin D'Costa 2000 {{ISBN|0-567-08730-1}} page 152&lt;/ref&gt; The document warns of fundamental errors in combining Christian and non-Christian styles of meditation. 

Referring to the constitution ''[[Dei verbum]]'' the document emphasizes that all Christian prayer and meditation should "proceed to converge on Christ" and be guided by the gift of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. It reaffirmed that the Church recommends the reading of the Scripture prior to and as a source of Christian prayer and meditation.

Similar warnings were issued in 2003 in ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'' which characterized [[New Age]] activities as essentially incompatible with Christian teachings and values.&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tablet /&gt;

==Warnings==
This document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential [[Christology|Christocentric]] nature of Christian meditation.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholicism in dialogue: conversations across traditions'' by Wayne Teasdale 2004 {{ISBN|0-7425-3178-3}} Page 74&lt;/ref&gt; 

The letter warns that "euphoric states" obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, [[meditation]], which should be a ''flight from the self'', can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.&lt;ref name="nytimes_vatican"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1D61531F934A35752C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=|title=Trying to Reconcile the Ways of the Vatican and the East |last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=1990-01-07|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter warns against concentration on the self, rather than on Christ, and states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Christian prayer, ..., the communion of redeemed creatures with the intimate life of the Persons of the Trinity, based on Baptism and the Eucharist, source and summit of the life of the Church, implies an attitude of conversion, a flight from "self" to the "You" of God. Thus Christian prayer is at the same time always authentically personal and communitarian. It flees from impersonal techniques or from concentrating on oneself, which can create a kind of rut.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The letter also warns that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation "can degenerate into a cult of the body" and that equating bodily states with mysticism "could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations."

==Structure==

The document has seven sections:

{{ordered list|type=upper-roman
|  ''Introduction'': discusses the fact that many Christians wish to experience a deeper and authentic prayer life despite the speed of modern culture, and that some have come to see eastern meditation as a possible solution. But it indicates that Christian meditation is different.
| ''Christian Prayer In The Light Of Revelation'': Traces the origins of Christian meditation and its roots in the [[Bible]].
| ''Erroneous Ways Of Praying'': Warns of errors in specific approaches to prayer.
| ''The Christian Way To Union With God'': Discusses the prominent features of the "way of Christ" as a key to [[Christian prayer]].
| ''Questions Of Method'': Emphasizes that it is impossible to arrive at a perfect love of God if one "ignores his giving of himself to us through his [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnate]] Son".
|  ''Psychological-Corporal Methods'': Discusses the "position and demeanor of the body" and "psychophysical symbolism".
| ''"I Am The Way"'': Emphasizes that each person should not be led so much by his personal tastes as by the [[Holy Spirit]], who guides him, through Christ, to the Father.
}}

==Papal references==
[[Pope John Paul II]] later referred to the document in addresses at a general audience in 1999 and to a particular group in 2003, using it as an example of how Christians need to focus their prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_19051999_en.html|title=19 May 1999 - John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2003/january/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20030120_equipes-notre-dame_en.html|title=To participants in the Meeting sponsored by the Teams of Our Lady (January 20, 2003) - John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to it also when saying, in the letter with which he marked the closing of the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, that, by opening our heart to the love of God, prayer   also opens it to the love of our brothers and sisters, and makes us capable of  shaping history according to God's plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20010106_novo-millennio-ineunte_en.html Apostolic Letter ''Novo millennio ineunte'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bunyip 1890.jpg|thumb|A bunyip depicted in 1890]]
'''Bunyip aristocracy''' is an Australian term satirising attempts to develop an aristocracy in the colonies now forming that country. It was first coined in 1853 by [[Daniel Deniehy]] who made a speech lambasting the attempt by [[William Wentworth]] to establish a titled [[aristocracy]] in the [[New South Wales]] government. This speech came to be known as the ''Bunyip Aristocracy speech''.

Deniehy made speeches opposing the new self-titled Australian aristocracy in the Victorian theatre and on the [[soapbox]] at [[Circular Quay]].

In response to Wentworth's proposal to create a hereditary [[peerage]] in New South Wales, Deniehy's satirical comments included: "''Here, we all know the common water mole was transferred into the [[platypus|duck-billed platypus]], and in some distant emulation of this degeneration, I suppose we are to be favoured with a "bunyip aristocracy.''" (The [[bunyip]] is an Ancestral Being of [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Aboriginal Dreaming]].) Deniehy's ridicule caused the idea to be dropped.

Among those singled out in his speech by Deniehy was [[James Macarthur (Australian politician)|James MacArthur]] (1798–1867), the son of [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John MacArthur]], who had been nominated to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] in 1839 and was later (1859) elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] (the lower house was only created in 1856): &lt;blockquote&gt;''Next came the native aristocrat James MacArthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green, and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg&lt;ref&gt;This is a reference to the [[Rum Rebellion]] in which [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] played a major role.&lt;/ref&gt; of a New South Wales order of chivalry.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The strong popular support for Deniehy's views caused the abandonment of the proposal to which he was responding. It probably also delayed the introduction of an Australian honours system. The [[Order of Australia]] was not introduced until 1975. Until that time Australians were awarded [[British honours system|British honours]].

'Bunyip aristocracy' is now a [[pejorative]] term for those Australians who consider themselves to be aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bunyip aristocracy definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561546451/bunyip_aristocracy.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTLSSN?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561546451/bunyip_aristocracy.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dan Deniehy's Bunyip aristocracy speech ==

''Note: Deniehy had a habit of writing speeches and articles that addressed himself in the third person''

{{Quotation|Mr. Deniehy seconded the resolution [that this meeting pledges itself to resist, by every constitutional means in its power, the formation of a second chamber which is not based on popular suffrage]. Why he had been selected to speak to the present resolution he knew not, save that as a native of the colony he might naturally be expected to feel something like real interest, and to speak with something like real feeling on a question connected with the political institutions of the country. He would do his best to respond to that invitation 'Speak up,' and would perhaps balance deficiencies flowing from a small volume of voice by in all cases calling things by their right names.

He protested against the present daring and unheard-of attempt to tamper with a fundamental popular right – that of having a voice in the nomination of men who were to make, or control the making of, laws binding on the community – laws perpetually shifting and changing the nature of the whole social economy of a given state, and frequently operating in the subtlest forms on the very dearest interests of the citizen – on his domestic, his moral, perhaps his religious relations.

The name of Mr. Wentworth had frequently been mentioned there that day, and that on one or two occasions with an unwise tenderness, a squeamish reluctance to speak plain, English, and call certain nasty doings of Mr. Wentworth by the usual homely appellatives, simply because they were Mr. Wentworth's. He for one was nowise disposed, as preceding speakers had seemed, in tapping the vast shoulder of Mr. Wentworth's political recreancies, to '[[Damn with faint praise|damn him with faint praise]] and mistimed eulogy.

He had listened from boyhood upwards to grey tradition, Mr. Wentworth's demagogic Areopagitas – his speeches for the liberty of unlicensed printing regime of Darling; and for these and divers other deeds of a time when the honourable member for Sydney had to the full his share of the chivalrous pugnacities of five-and-twenty, he was as much disposed to give Mr Wentworth credit as any man. But with these perpetual fantasies, these everlasting variations on the 'Light of the other Days,' continually ringing in his ears, he [Dan Deniehy] was fain to enquire by what rule of moral and political appraisal, it was sought to throw in a scale opposite to that containing the flagrant and shameless political dishonesty of years, the democratic escapades, sins long since repented of in early youth.

The subsequent political conduct-rather the systemic political principles of Mr. Wentworth – had been such as would have been sufficient to cancel the value of even a century of action. The British Constitution had been frequently spoken of that afternoon in terms of unbounded laudation. That Constitution certainly deserved to be spoken of with respect; he [Dan Deniehy] respected it, no doubt they all respected it.

But his was a qualified respect at best, and in all presumed assimilations of the political hypotheses of our colonial Constitution-makers with the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|Constitution of Great Britain]], he warned them not be seduced by mere words and phrases-sheer 'talkee talkee.' Relatively, it was not only an admirable example of slowly growing and gradually elaborated political experience, applied, set in action, but it was also eminent and exemplary as a long history, still evolving, of political philosophy. But it was after all but relatively good for its wonderfully successful fusion of principles the most antagonistic.

Circumstances entirely alter cases, and he would warn them to be seduced by no mere vague association exhaled from the use of venerable phrases, that had, what phrases now-a-days seldom could boast, genuine meanings attached to them. The patrician element existed in the British Constitution as did the regal, for good reasons-it had stood in the way of all late legislatorial thought and operation as a great fact; as such it was handled, and in a deep and prudential spirit of conservatism allowed to stand-but as affecting the basis and foundation of the architecture of a Constitution-the elective principle neutralised for all detrimental influence, by conversion, practically, into a mere check upon the deliberations of the initiative section of the Legislature.

And having the right to frame, to embody, to shape it as we would, with no great stubborn facts to work upon as in England, there was nothing but the elective principle and the inalienable freedom of every colonist upon which to work out the whole organisation and body of our political institution.

But because it was the good pleasure of Mr. Wentworth and the respectable tail of that puissant Legislative body, whose serpentine movements were so ridiculous, we were not to form our own Constitution, but instead of this we were to have an Upper House and a Constitution cast upon us, upon a pattern which should suit the taste and propriety of political oligarchs who treated the people at large as if they were cattle to be bought and sold in the market; or as they indeed were in American slave States, and now in Australian markets, where we might find bamboozled coolies and kidnapped Chinamen.

And being in a figurative humour, he might endeavour to make some of the proposed nobility to pass before the stage of our imagination, as the ghost of Banquo walked along in the vision of Macbeth, so that we might have a fair view of these Harlequin aristocrats, these Botany Bay magnificos (laughter), these Australian mandarins.

Let them walk across the stage in all the pomp and circumstances of hereditary titles. First, then, in the procession stalks the hoary Wentworth. But he could not imagine that to such a head the strawberry leaves [a reference to the decoration on a Duke's coronet] would add any honour.

Next came the native aristocrat Mr. James Macarthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of Camden, and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green- (great cheers and laughter) -and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg of a New South Wales order of chivalry. There was also the colonial starred Terence Aubrey Murray, with more crosses and orders-not perhaps orders of merit-than a state of mandarinhood.

Another friend who claimed a colonial title was George Robert Nichols, the hereditary Grand Chancellor of all the Australias. Behold him in the serene and moody dignity of that portrait of Rodius' that smiled on us in all the public – house parlours – the gentleman who took Mr. Lowe to task for altering his opinions; this conqueror in the lists of jaw, and the victor in the realms of gab. It might be well to ridicule the doings of such a clique, but their doings merited burning indignation-yet, to speak seriously of such a project would too much resemble the Irishman's kicking at nothing, it wrenched one horribly.

But, though their weakness was ridiculous, he could assure them that these pygmies might do a great deal of mischief. They would bring contempt on a country whose interest he was sure they all had at heart, until even the poor Irishman in the streets of Dublin would fling his jibe at the Botany Bay aristocrats. In fact, he was puzzled how to classify them. They could not aspire to the miserable and effete dignity of the grandees of Spain.

They had antiquity of birth, but these he would defy any naturalist properly to classify them. But perhaps it was only a specimen of the remarkable contrariety that existed at the Antipodes. Here they all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulations of this degeneration, he supposed they were to be favoured with a '''bunyip aristocracy'''.

He trusted that this was only the beginning of a more extended movement, and from its auspicious commencement he augured the happiest results. A more orderly, united, and consolidated movement he had never witnessed. He must say that he was proud to belong to Botany Bay.

He took it as no term of reproach, when he saw that there was such a keen sensibility on the subject of their political sights – that the instant the liberties of their country were threatened, they could assemble, and with one voice, declare their determined and undying opposition.

But he would remind them that this was not a selfish consideration, there were wider interests at stake. In the present disturbed state of Europe, they must calculate on having to receive the poor Russian flying from the [[knout]] of his oppressor.

And also, looking at the gradually increasing pressure of political parties at home, they must prepare to open their arms and receive the fugitives from England, Scotland, and Ireland, who would hasten to gain a security and a competence, that appeared to be denied them in their own country.

The interests of these countless thousands were involved in their decision on this occasion, and they looked, and were entitled to look, for a heritage befitting the dignity of free men. Bring them not here with delusive hopes-let them not find a new-fangled aristocracy haunting these free shores.

But it is to yours to offer them a land, where man is rewarded for his labour, and where the law no more recognises the supremacy of a class, than it recognises the predominance of a religion. But there is an aristocracy worthy of our ambition. Wherever man's skill is eminent, wherever glorious manhood asserts its elevation, there is an aristocracy that confers honour on the land that possesses it. That is God's aristocracy.

That is an aristocracy that will grow and expand under free institutions, and bless the land where it flourishes. He hoped they would take into consideration the hitherto barren condition of the country they were legislating for. He was a native of this young but glorious continent. Its past was not hallowed in history by the achievements of men whose names reflected a light on the times in which they lived. They had no long line of poets, of statesmen, and warriors; in this country art had done nothing, but nature everything. It was theirs to inaugurate the future.

In no country had the attempt been successfully made to manufacture an aristocracy ''pro re nata''. It could not be done. They might as well expect honour to be paid to the nobles of King Kamehameha, or the ebony earls of the Emperor Soulouque of Hayti.

The aristocracy of England was founded on the sword. The men that came over with William the Conqueror were the masters of the Saxons, and so were the aristocracy. The soldiers of Cromwell were the masters of the Irish, and so became their aristocracy. But he should like to know how Wentworth and his clique had conquered the inhabitants of New South Wales – except in the artful dodgery of doctoring up a Franchise Bill.

If we were to be blessed with an aristocracy he would rather it should not resemble that of William the Bastard but of Jack the Strapper.

But he trespassed too long on their time and would only seek in conclusion, but to record two things. First, his indignant denunciation of any tampering with the purity of the elective principle, the only basis upon which good government could be placed; and, secondly, he wished them to regard the future destinies of their country.

Let them, with prophetic eye, behold the troops of weary pilgrims, from foreign despotism, which would, ere long, be floating to their shores, and let them now – give the most earnest assurance, that such men as composed the Wentworth clique, were not the representations of the spirit, the intelligence, of the freemen of New South Wales.&lt;ref name="Martin1884"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Alfred Martin|title=The life and speeches of Daniel Henry Deniehy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjciBDj5JIgC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=18 December 2012|year=1884|publisher=McNeil and Coffee|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial peerage==

A Committee, consisting of Messrs. [[Charles Cowper]], [[Terence Aubrey Murray|T.A. Murray]], [[George Macleay]], [[Edward Deas Thomson|E. Deas Thomson]], J.H. Plunkett, Dr. Douglas, W. Thurlow, James Macarthur, [[James Martin (Australian politician)|James Martin]], and W.C. Wentworth, appointed on the motion of W.C.Wentworth, held its first meeting, Sydney, 27 May 1853. Fifteen meetings were called. Half the members did not attend the meetings. The Bill was reported 28 July 1853. It was almost universally condemned by the people and a large public meeting was called to oppose it. In the advertisement convening the meeting were the following paragraphs :
* A committee of the Legislative Council has framed a new Constitution for the colony, by which it is proposed 
**(1.) To create a colonial nobility with hereditary privileges.
**(2.) To construct an Upper House of Legislature in which the people will have no voice.
**(3.) To add eighteen new seats to the Lower House, only one of which is to be allotted to Sydney while the other seventeen are to be allotted among the country and squatting districts.
**(4.) To squander the public revenue by pensioning off the officers of the Government on their full salaries ! thus implanting in our institutions a principle of jobbery and corruption.
**(5.) To fix irrevocably on the people this oligarchy in the name of free institutions so that no future Legislature can reform it even by absolute majority. The Legislative Council has the hardihood to propose passing this unconstitutional and anti-British measure with only a few days notice, and before it can possibly be considered by the colonists at large.  
The meeting was addressed by Sir Henry Parkes and other Liberals, and the result of the agitation was that the most objectionable clause, to create an hereditary colonial peerage, was struck out.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, J.H. 1984, The Bedside Book of Colonial Doings, previously published in 1879 as 'Australian Dictionary of Dates containing the History of Australasia from 1542 to May 1879, pp. 183–185&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CIETmapAnalysis.jpg|thumb|CIETmap includes CIETanalysis, a tool for epidemiological analysis.]]'''CIETmap''' will be open source software under development by the CIET group to help build the community voice into planning. Currently no downloads are made available. CIETmap integrates epidemiological analysis tools with raster and vector mapping capabilities geared towards decision-making for planners. It includes a Windows interface with the statistical programming language, [[R (programming language)|R]].

Neil Andersson conceived of and designed CIETmap and, with Steven Mitchell, defined its functionality. DM Solutions Group initiated the programming and interface design and Mario Beauchamp now maintains it. Development funding included contributions from the Canadian Assembly of First Nations, [[Canadian International Development Agency|CIDA]], [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]] and [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research|CIHR]].

CIETmap is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses [[PyGTK]] for its graphical interface. The raster and vector mapping is handled by a custom library built on top of the [[GTK+]], [[GDAL]] and GtkGLExt libraries. [[NumPy]] provides analytical and calculation support and RPy is the Python access to R. The CIET group is currently testing CIETmap to make it available to communities and researchers. Once released, CIETmap will be freely available under the GNU [[General Public License]].

CIETmap integrates epidemiological and geomatic analysis on a single platform:[[File:CIETmapRastermap.jpg|thumb|The CIETmap module creates interpolated raster maps out of data from sample communities.]]

'''Epidemiological analysis''': 
Using commands similar to those in [[Epi Info|EpiInfo]], CIETanalysis produces basic frequencies (like the proportion with a given disease) through to multivariate models of gains (like the proportion that can be "saved" by a given intervention). Users can generate descriptive stats (mean, standard deviation, standard error); odds ratios, risk difference, gains and confidence intervals. An interface with R gives access to most statistical capabilities available in that language; some of these are available through customised drop-down menus. CIETmap can import data in other formats as [[SPSS]], [[dBase]] or [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]. Other features are available through user friendly interfaces such as meta-analysis, regression modelling, and Bayesian inference.[[File:CIETmapMorphmaps.jpg|thumb|Animation makes it easier for viewers to follow changes, as they happen–or would happen–in each place on the map.]]

'''Mapping''': The CIETmap module creates interpolated raster maps out of data from sample communities. The software also adjusts for over- or under-representation in the sample communities during the interpolation. It then displays user defined ranges with an associated legend. If they choose, users can see the maps in three dimensions and from different angles. CIETmap can also classify or display administrative boundaries and geographic features, as well as pictorial symbols. A morph/animation module can help make predictions based on epidemiological risk analysis (such as the likely impact of an intervention), or show changes in a situation over time –i.e.: data from repeat surveys. It does this through animation, which makes it easier for viewers to follow the changes, as they happen –or would happen- in each place on the map. These "morph" maps can either be run from within CIETmap or exported to external animated gifs.

The first published use of CIETmap's population weighted raster maps came from Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, Neil; Mitchell, S (2006). "Epidemiological geomatics in evaluation of mine risk education in Afghanistan: introducing population weighted raster maps". International Journal of Health Geographics 5: 1. doi:10.1186/1476-072X-5-1.&lt;/ref&gt; These maps have wide applicability for communicating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, S; Cockcroft A, Andersson N. (2011). "Population weighted raster maps can communicate findings of social audits: examples from three continents.". BMC Health Services Research. supp2 11: S5. doi:10.1186/1472-6963-11-S2-S14&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological taxonomy]], '''circumscription''' is the definition of a [[taxon]], that is, a group of [[organisms]].

One goal of biological taxonomy is to achieve a stable circumscription for every taxon.  Achieving stability is not yet a certainty in most taxa, and many that had been regarded as stable for decades are in upheaval in the light of rapid developments in [[molecular phylogenetics]]. In essence, new discoveries may invalidate the application of irrelevant attributes used in established or obsolete circumscriptions, or present new attributes useful in [[cladistic taxonomy]]. 

An example of a taxonomic group with unstable circumscription is [[Anacardiaceae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[flowering plant]]s. Some experts favor a circumscription&lt;ref&gt;[http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/anacardi.htm Anacardiaceae] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315000926/http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/anacardi.htm |date=March 15, 2005 }} in [http://delta-intkey.com/angio/ L.

'''Conversion theory''' is [[Serge Moscovici]]'s conceptual analysis of the cognitive and interpersonal processes that mediate the direct and indirect impact of a consistent minority on the majority (Moscovici, 1976). Initially, Moscovici's conversion theory of [[minority influence]] began as a minority opinion that was rejected by many researchers, but eventually members of opposition validated it, thus confirming the theory's exact predictions. Asch's studies highlighted the power that majorities have over groups and their subsequent conformity, but Moscovici was more interested in the power exerted by minorities.

Contrasting the "majority rules" model of social influence, conversion theory maintains that disagreement within the group results in conflict, and that group members are motivated to reduce that conflict—either by changing their own opinions or attempting to get others to change. Minorities have a different process of influence, and Moscovici theorized that they do so by a ''validation process'' (majorities undergo comparison processes). If someone within the minority breaks that unanimity of the majority, this captures the majority's attention, causing them to consider their arguments and reasoning for disagreement (Moscovici, 1976). If the new information/opinions garnered from the minority are validated, this may sway the majority and lead to more long lasting changes than changes occurring via comparison processes.  This is because validation leads to private acceptance, whereas comparison processes result in direct influence as members publicly comply.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Generally, validation is a long process, so the effects of a minority are somewhat slower to emerge and identify.

One of the first tests of this theory was a reversal of [[Asch conformity experiments]] by adding two confederates in a six person group, and arranging for them to systematically disagree with the majority decision. Instead of lines, the participants judged (aloud) the color and brightness of a series of 36 colored slides (all were blue with varying luminosity). The confederates were told to consistently state "green" rather than "blue." When tested alone, the error rate of participants was 0.25% (i.e., saying green when the answer was blue), but when tested in the presence of the green-saying confederates, the error rate increased to 8.4%, thus confirming the power of a minority (Forsyth, 2010).

'''Critical realism''', a philosophical approach associated with [[Roy Bhaskar]] (1944–2014), combines a general [[philosophy of science]] ([[transcendental realism]]) with a [[philosophy of social science]] ([[critical naturalism]]) to describe an interface between the natural and social worlds.

==Contemporary critical realism==
===Overview&lt;!--'Critical naturalism' redirects here--&gt;===
Bhaskar developed a general [[philosophy of science]] that he described as transcendental realism and a special philosophy of the human sciences that he called '''critical naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The two terms were combined by other authors to form the umbrella term critical realism.

Transcendental realism attempts to establish that in order for scientific investigation to take place, the object of that investigation must have real, manipulable, internal mechanisms that can be ''actualized'' to produce particular outcomes.  This is what we do when we conduct experiments.  This stands in contrast to empiricist scientists' claim that all scientists can do is observe the relationship between [[Causality|cause and effect]] and impose meaning.  Whilst empiricism, and positivism more generally, locate causal relationships at the level of events, critical realism locates them at the level of the generative mechanism, arguing that causal relationships are irreducible to empirical [[constant conjunction]]s of [[David Hume]]'s doctrine; in other words, a constant conjunctive relationship between events is neither sufficient nor even necessary to establish a causal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Research design : qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches|last=W.|first=Creswell, John|others=Creswell, J. David|isbn=9781506386706|edition= Fifth |location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=1004576152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implication of this is that science should be understood as an ongoing process in which scientists improve the concepts they use to understand the mechanisms that they study.  It should not, in contrast to the claim of empiricists, be about the identification of a coincidence between a postulated independent variable and dependent variable. [[Positivism]]/[[falsificationism]] are also rejected due to the observation that it is highly plausible that a mechanism will exist but either a) go unactivated, b) be activated, but not perceived, or c) be activated, but counteracted by other mechanisms, which results in its having unpredictable effects.  Thus, non-realisation of a posited mechanism cannot (in contrast to the claim of some positivists) be taken to signify its non-existence. [[Falsificationism]] can be viewed at the statement level (naive falsificationism) or at the theorem level (more common in practice). In this way, the two approaches can be reconciled to some extent.

Critical naturalism argues that the transcendental realist model of science is equally applicable to both the physical and the human worlds.  However, when we study the human world we are studying something fundamentally different from the physical world and must, therefore, adapt our strategy to studying it.  Critical naturalism, therefore, prescribes social scientific method which seeks to identify the mechanisms producing social events, but with a recognition that these are in a much greater state of flux than those of the physical world (as human structures change much more readily than those of, say, a leaf).  In particular, we must understand that human agency is made possible by social structures that themselves require the reproduction of certain actions/pre-conditions.  Further, the individuals that inhabit these social structures are capable of consciously reflecting upon, and changing, the actions that produce them—a practice that is in part facilitated by social scientific research.

Critical realism has become an influential movement in British [[sociology]] and [[social science]] in general as a reaction to, and reconciliation of, [[postmodern]] critiques.

=== Developments ===
Since Bhaskar made the first big steps in popularising the theory of critical realism in the 1970s, it has become one of the major strands of social scientific method, rivalling positivism/empiricism, and [[post-structuralism]]/[[relativism]]/[[Antipositivism|interpretivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.e-ir.info/2014/12/11/the-impact-of-roy-bhaskar-and-critical-realism-on-international-relations/|title=The Impact of Roy Bhaskar and Critical Realism on International Relations|work=E-International Relations|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/roy-bhaskar-philosopher-whose-school-of-critical-realism-challenged-established-ways-of-thinking-10009456.html|title=Roy Bhaskar: Philosopher whose school of critical realism challenged|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/04/roy-bhaskar|title=Roy Bhaskar obituary|last=Graeber|first=David|date=2014-12-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his development of critical realism, Bhaskar went on to develop a philosophical system he calls dialectical critical realism, which is most clearly outlined in his weighty book, ''Dialectic: The Pulse of Freedom''.

An accessible introduction to Bhaskar's writings was written by Andrew Collier. [[Andrew Sayer]] has written accessible texts on critical realism in social science. Danermark et al. have also produced an accessible account. [[Margaret Archer]] is associated with this school, as is the [[ecosocialist]] writer [[Peter Dickens (ecosocialist)|Peter Dickens]].

[[David Graeber]] relies on critical realism, which he understands as a form of '[[Heraclitus|heraclitean]]' philosophy, emphasizing flux and change over stable essences, in his anthropological book on the concept of value, ''Toward an anthropological theory of value: the false coin of our own dreams''.

Recently, attention has turned to the challenge of implementing critical realism in applied social research. An edited volume examined the use of critical realism for studying organizations (Edwards, O'Mahoney, and Vincent 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Paul K.|last2=O'Mahoney|first2=Joe|last3=Vincent|first3=Steve|title=Studying Organizations Using Critical Realism: A Practical Guide|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966553-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Other authors (Fletcher 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fletcher|first1=Amber J.|title=Applying critical realism in qualitative research: methodology meets method|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=181–194|date=2016|doi=10.1080/13645579.2016.1144401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parr 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parr|first1=Sadie|title=Integrating critical realist and feminist methodologies: ethical and analytical dilemmas|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|date=2015|volume=8|issue=2|pages=193–207|doi=10.1080/13645579.2013.868572|url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/9155/1/Parr_Critical_Realist_Research.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunt 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunt|first1=Sarah|title=Critical realism and grounded theory: Analysing the adoption outcomes for disabled children using the retroduction framework|journal=Qualitative Social Work|volume=17|issue=2|pages=176–194|date=2018|doi=10.1177/1473325016664572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoddy 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoddy|first1=Eric|title=Critical realism in empirical research: employing techniques from Grounded theory methodology|journal=International Journal of Social Research Methodology|pages=1–14|date=2018|doi=10.1080/13645579.2018.1503400}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have discussed which specific research methodologies and methods are conducive (or not) to research guided by critical realism as a philosophy of science.

==In economics==
Heterodox economists like [[Tony Lawson]], [[Lars Pålsson Syll]], [[Frederic Sterling Lee|Frederic Lee]] or [[Geoffrey Hodgson]] are trying to work the ideas of critical realism into economics, especially the dynamic idea of macro-micro interaction.

According to critical realist economists, the central aim of economic theory is to provide explanations in terms of hidden generative structures. This position combines [[transcendental realism]] with a critique of [[mainstream economics]]. It argues that mainstream economics (i) relies excessively on deductivist methodology, (ii) embraces an uncritical enthusiasm for formalism, and (iii) believes in strong conditional predictions in economics despite repeated failures.

The world that mainstream economists study is the empirical world. But this world is "out of phase" (Lawson) with the underlying [[ontology]] of economic regularities. The mainstream view is thus a limited reality because empirical realists presume that the objects of inquiry are solely "empirical regularities"—that is, objects and events at the level of the experienced.

The critical realist views the domain of real causal mechanisms as the appropriate object of economic science, whereas the positivist view is that the reality is exhausted in empirical, i.e. experienced reality. Tony Lawson argues that economics ought to embrace a "social ontology" to include the underlying causes of economic phenomena.

==Marxism==
A development of Bhaskar's critical realism lies at the ontological root of contemporary streams of Marxist political and economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, D. (2002), “Marxism”, in Marsh D. Stoker, G. (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, D, &amp; Furlong, P. (2002), “Ontology and Epistemology in Political Science”, in Marsh D. Stoker, G. (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science, Basingstoke'', Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The realist philosophy described by Bhaskar in ''A Realist Theory of Science'' is compatible with Marx's work in that it differentiates between an intransitive reality, which exists independently of human knowledge of it, and the socially produced world of science and empirical knowledge. This dualist logic is clearly present in the Marxian theory of ideology, according to which social reality may be very different from its empirically observable surface appearance. Notably, [[Alex Callinicos]] has argued for a 'critical realist' ontology in the philosophy of social science and explicitly acknowledges Bhaskar's influence (while also rejecting the latter's 'spiritualist turn' in his later work).&lt;ref&gt;Callinicos, A. (2006), ''The Resources of Critique'', Cambridge, Polity, pp.155-158&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between critical realist philosophy and Marxism has also been discussed in an article co-authored by Bhaskar and Callinicos and published in the ''Journal of Critical Realism''.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, R. Callinicos, A. (2003), 'Marxism and Critical Realism: A Debate', in ''Journal of Critical Realism'', 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international relations theory==
Since 2000, critical realist philosophy has also been increasingly influential in the field of international relations (IR) theory. Patrick Thaddeus Jackson has called it 'all the rage' in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Patrick Thaddeus (2011) The Conduct of Inquiry in International Relations, Routledge p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Jessop]], Colin Wight, Milja Kurki, Jonathan Joseph and Hidemi Suganami have all published major works on the utility of beginning IR research from a critical realist social ontology—an ontology they all credit Roy Bhaskar with originating.&lt;ref&gt;Jessop, Bob (2007) State Power, Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurki, Milja (2008), Causation in International Relations: Reclaiming Causal Analysis, Cambridge: CUP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wight, Colin (2006) Agents, Structures and International Relations: Politics as Ontology, Cambridge: CUP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Jonathan (2012) The Social in the Global, Cambridge: CUP&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological economics ==
The British [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Clive Spash]] holds the opinion that critical realism offers a thorough basis—as a philosophy of science—for the theoretical foundation of ecological economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spash|first=Clive L.|date=2012-05-26|title=New foundations for ecological economics|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=77|pages=36–47|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.004|issn=0921-8009|citeseerx=10.1.1.634.2763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spash|first=Clive|date=2017-01-31|publisher=transcript Verlag|language=en|doi=10.14361/9783839427255-008|isbn=9783839427255|title=Critical Realism meets kritische Sozialtheorie|chapter=Soziales, ökologisches und ökonomisches Wissen zum Synthetisierungspotenzial des Critical Realism}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore uses a critical realist lens for conducting research in (ecological) economics.

However, also other scholars base ecological economics on a critical realist foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge handbook of ecological economics : nature and society|others=Spash, Clive L.|isbn=9781317395096|location=Abingdon, Oxon|oclc=982187453|last1 = Spash|first1 = Clive L.|date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Leigh Price]] from [[Rhodes University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical realism, environmental learning, and social-ecological change|others=Lotz-Sisitka, Heila, 1965-, Price, Leigh|isbn=9781317338475|location=London|oclc=932622677|last1 = Price|first1 = Leigh|last2=Lotz-Sistka|first2=Heila|date=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dejan Stojanovic, 1981.jpg|thumb|Dejan Stojanović, Belgrade, 1981]]

== Early life ==
Dejan Stojanović was born on 11 March 1959 in [[Peć]], [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Autonomous District of Kosovo and Metohija]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|PR Serbia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]. In 1972, he moved with his family to [[Sutomore]], near [[Bar, Montenegro]], where he completed his secondary education. He attended the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] at [[Kosovo]]. While he was predominantly interested in philosophy and the arts during his youth, he earned a degree in law.&lt;ref&gt;Stojanović, Dejan (2000). ''Krugovanje,'' English translation: ''Circling,'' Beleška o autoru (English translation: About the author), Pub: Narodna knjiga, Alpha, Belgrade, page 83..&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing background ==

===Poetry===
He began to write poetry in the late seventies&lt;ref&gt;Stojanović, Dejan (1993). Poems written between 1978 and 1987; ''Krugovanje: 1978–1987''; English translation: ''Circling: 1978–1987,'' Pub: Narodna knjiga, Alpha, Belgrade; Series: Contemporary Yugoslavian writers.&lt;/ref&gt; and kept his work private for three to four years, after which he published his poems in literary magazines in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Serbian magazines in which his work was published include ''[[Stremljenja]]'' (English translation: ''Trends'') and ''[[Jedinstvo]]'' (English translation: ''Unity'') &lt;ref name=worldcat&gt;{{cite web|author= Stojanović, Dejan.

By 1983, he became a member of a literary club (Karagač) in his hometown of Peć. During this time, he was named as the secretary and later promoted to president of the club.&lt;ref&gt;One of the founding members of the club, participating in all activities, was poet Alija Dzogović and among other members was poet Radenko Bjelanović.&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, he conducted interviews with some local artists from Kosovo.

In his early adulthood, Stojanović developed a philosophical system of ideas that dealt primarily with metaphysical questions and the structure of the Universe. He wrote several hundred pages in his notebooks exploring these ideas, along with essays on language and literature. In 1999, these manuscripts, along with his library of more than a thousand books (carefully chosen for years), were lost due to fire shortly after the war in Kosovo ended.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite web|author=Stojanović, Dejan (2007). ''Ples vremena,'' Napomene u vezi s knjigom prvom, str. 113, Konras, Series: Biblioteka Beli vuk -- knj. 7, Beograd (English translation: ''Dance of Time,'' Notes, p. 113, Konras, Belgrade, 2007) |url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2389735W/Ples_vremena |title=Ples vremena |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books, along with his manuscripts, were held temporarily in his brother's office in the center of downtown Peć.

=== Publishing ===
In 1990, Stojanović established a private publishing firm known as Metoh (English translation: the church's land).&lt;ref name=Kosovo&gt;{{cite web|author1=What means Kosovo |author2=what Metohia? |url=http://www.kosovo.net/hist.html |title=Metoh |publisher=Kosovo.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the organization was located in Peć, the firm planned to publish a literary magazine in Kosovo. The firm's staff included writers from Belgrade, one of whom was Alek Vukadinović, a Serbian poet who supported Stojanović's plan to publish a magazine. While Stojanović's first book of poetry, ''Krugovanje'' (English translation: ''Circling'') was ready for publication in 1983, it was not published until 1993. During those ten years, several poems that were initially planned for inclusion in the book had been replaced by newer poems, which had been written between 1983 and 1986. The last poem in the book had actually been written in Chicago, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;"Melodija najstarijeg zavicaja," Ciklus: "Mrak čeka," p. 67, ''Krugovanje: 1978-1987'' (1993); English translation: "A Melody of the Premival Homeland," Sequence: "Darkness Is Waiting," ''Circling: 1978-1987''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===

In early 1990, Stojanović joined the writing staff of Serbian magazine, ''[[Pogledi]]'' (English translation: ''Viewpoints''). At this time, he began a series of interviews with several Serbian writers in Belgrade, including [[Momo Kapor]], Alek Vukadinović, and [[Nikola Milošević (politician)|Nikola Milošević]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrov, Aleksandar (December 2000), "A Poet before the Open Door," ''American Srbobran,'' Literary Supplement ("Pesnik pred otvorenim vratima," ''Amerikanski Srbobran,'' Književni dodatak)&lt;/ref&gt; During his second visit to Paris in May and June 1990, he interviewed&lt;ref&gt;Popović, Aleksandar I.

In the nineties, as a foreign correspondent, he published all his interviews in a Serbian weekly magazine, ''Views (Pogledi).'' At its peak in 1990, the magazine was selling up to 200,000 copies.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he conducted interviews with prominent American writers, including [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Saul Bellow]], [[Charles Simic]], and [[Steve Tesich]]. He did not return to his homeland in summer 1991, when the [[Yugoslav Wars]] started in the former [[Yugoslavia]], and has been living in Chicago since 1990.&lt;ref name=openlibraz/&gt; In honor of his series of interviews published in ''Conversations'', published in 1999 by [[Književna reč]] of Belgrade, Stojanović received the Rastko Petrović Award, presented by the [[Association of Writers of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;Vidaković, Dušan (November–December 2000).

Stojanović’s poetry collections are characterized by sequences of compact, dense poems, simple yet complex in carefully organized overall structure, and that is why some more visibly than others appear as long poems. This is especially characteristic of the books, ''The Sign and its Children,''&lt;ref&gt;Mirković, Miroslav Buca (10, 7, 2000). "Prkos tamnim silama," ''Ilustrovana politika,'' rubrika ''Čitati ili ne čitati,'' broj 2177, 7. X 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Shape'',&lt;ref&gt;Urošević, Draginja (2001). [[Borba (newspaper)|''Borba'']], Beograd&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Creator''&lt;ref&gt;Janković, Oliver (28, 29, 30. 11. 2000). "Belina sveta i papira," [[Borba (newspaper)|''Borba'']], Beograd&lt;/ref&gt; (''Znak I njegova deca'',&lt;ref&gt;Vitošević, Nevena (February 2001).  "Simfonija znakova ili skladna porodica," ''Knjizevna reč,'' broj 513, februar 2001, Beograd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=open&gt;{{cite web|author=Dejan Stojanović |url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2389739W/Znak_i_njegova_deca |title=Znak i njegova deca |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oblik,''&lt;ref name=openlibra&gt;{{cite web|author=Dejan Stojanović |url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2389734W/Oblik |title=Oblik |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Tvoritelj''&lt;ref name=openlibrary&gt;{{cite web|author=Dejan Stojanović |url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2389738W/Tvoritelj |title=Tvoritelj |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), in which, with a relatively small number of words repeated in different contexts, Stojanović built his own poetic [[cosmogony]]. For that reason, writer and critic, David Kecman, described him as a ''cosmosophist.''&lt;ref&gt;Kecman, David Dako (March 15, 2001). "Znakovi smisla," [[Borba (newspaper)|''Borba'']], Beograd&lt;/ref&gt;

In his poems, he covers the smallest and the largest topics with equal attention, often juxtaposing them to the level of paradox and absurdity, gradually building new perspectives and meanings that are not only poetic either in origin or in purpose. Some themes and preoccupations, be they stones or galaxies, are present in all of his books and it can be said that his poetry books are, in themselves, long poems and that all of them serve as ingredients of a hyper-poetry book that is still in the making.

He used many poetic forms never used before in Serbian poetry and also created some new forms. "If elegance is represented by simplicity, then these are some of the most elegant verses imaginable,"&lt;ref&gt;Mikasinovich, Branko ( Spring 2000). ''[[World Literature Today]],'' (Abb: WLT), A Literary Quarterly of the [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], [[Oklahoma]], Volume 74, Number 2, Page 442&lt;/ref&gt; [[Branko Mikasinovich]] stated.

== Published works ==
The majority of Stojanović's poems, initially written in Serbian and compiled into six volumes of poetry, have been translated into English &lt;ref&gt;''Circling: 1978-1987,'' 56 poems, six sequences: "Recircling," "Light Bugs," "A Conversation with Atoms," "A Grain," "A Warden with No Keys," "Darkness is Waiting."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun Watches the Sun,'' 118 poems, eleven sequences: "Sky-Motion," "God and Circles," "Skywalking," "Forgotten Place," "A Stone and a Word," "What After," "A Game," "Is It Possible to Write a Poem," "Hopelessness," "Sound of the Silence," "Beethoven and Death."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sign and Its Children,'' 43 poems, five sequences: "The Supreme Sign," "The Sign and Nothing," Sign Face," "A Word and a Sign," "The Sign and the Dream."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Shape,'' 46 poems, six sequences: "Home of the Shape," "Happiness of Atoms," "Bells," "Pit of the Stone," "Wonders," "Big Chamber."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Creator,'' 63 poems, nine sequences: "The Light-Bearer," "Forest of the Universe," "A Talk of Fire," "The Whisper of Eternity," "A Smiling Sky," "Thought and Flight," "Same and Change," "The Dream Chamber," "Nostalgic Elements."&lt;/ref&gt; and a selection of his poems has been translated into French.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{cite web|author=Stojanović, Dejan.

'''Ecofascism''' is a pejorative term used by opponents of the [[environmental movement]] to accuse environmental activists of [[totalitarianism]];&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mez&gt;Zimmerman, Michael E. (2008). "Eco-Fascism". Pp. 531-532 in ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'', ed. [[Bron Taylor]]. Continuum International Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, it has also been used to refer to far-right efforts to gain influence within the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]].&lt;ref name=RPDW1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wall|first1=Derek|title=Darker shades of green|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/darker-shades-of-green/|accessdate=9 January 2016|work=[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]|date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some writers have used it to refer to the hypothetical danger of future dystopian governments, which might resort to extreme or "fascist" policies to deal with environmental issues.&lt;ref name=mez/&gt; Other writers have used it to refer to segments of historical [[fascist]] movements that focused on environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;"...the phenomenon one might call "actually existing ecofascism," that is, the preoccupation of authentically fascist movements with environmentalist concerns". Peter Staudenmeier, "Fascist Ecology: The 'Green Wing' of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents in Germany". In [http://www.spunk.org/library/places/germany/sp001630/ecofasc.html "Ecofascism: Lessons from the German experience,"] by Janet Biehl and Peter Staudenmaier, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Jonathan. {{date missing}} ''Nature and Nationalism: Right-Wing Ecology and the Politics of Identity''. New York: St. Martin’s Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Environmental historian [[Michael E. Zimmerman]] defines "ecofascism" as "a totalitarian government that requires individuals to sacrifice their interests to the well-being and glory of the 'land', understood as the splendid web of life, or the organic whole of nature, including peoples and their states".&lt;ref name=mez /&gt; Zimmerman argues that while no ecofascist government has so far existed, "important aspects of it can be found in [[German National Socialism]], one of whose central slogans was "[[Blood and Soil]]".&lt;ref name=mez /&gt;

According to environmentalist [[David Orton (deep ecology)|David Orton]], the term is pejorative in nature and has "social ecology roots, against the [[deep ecology]] movement and its supporters plus, more generally, the environmental movement. Thus, 'ecofascist' and 'ecofascism', are used not to enlighten but to smear."&lt;ref name=Orton&gt;{{cite web|author=Hoffmann, Helga |url=http://home.ca.inter.net/~greenweb/Ecofascism.html |title=Ecofascism: What is It? A Left Biocentric Analysis |publisher=Home.ca.inter.net |date=2004-12-19 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of ecofascism==
Accusations of ecofascism are common but usually strenuously denied.&lt;ref name=Orton/&gt;&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; Such accusations have come from both those on the political left who see it as an assault on [[human rights]], as in [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologist]] [[Murray Bookchin]]'s use of the term, and from those on the political right, as in [[Rush Limbaugh]] and other conservative and [[Wise Use|Wise Use Movement]] commentators. In the latter case, it is sometimes a [[hyperbole|hyperbolic]] use of the term that is applied to all environmental activists, including more mainstream groups such as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Sierra Club]].&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news|title=Green historian to Brandis: My Work's Been Abused|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/13/1068674308841.html|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=November 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By topic or ideology ===
==== Bookchin's critique of deep ecology ====

In the former case, Bookchin criticizes the political position of [[deep ecology|deep ecologists]] such as [[David Foreman]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are barely disguised racists, survivalists, macho [[Daniel Boone]]s, and outright social reactionaries who use the word ecology to express their views, just as there are deeply concerned naturalists, communitarians, social radicals, and feminists who use the word ecology to express theirs.... It was out of this former kind of crude eco-brutalism that Hitler, in the name of 'population control,' with a racial orientation, fashioned theories of blood and soil.... The same eco-brutalism now reappears a half-century later among self-professed deep ecologists who believe that Third World peoples should be permitted to starve to death and that desperate Indian immigrants from Latin America should be excluded by the border cops from the United States lest they burden 'our' ecological resources."&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/social-versus-deep-ecology-bookchin/ Bookchin, Murray. ''Social Ecology versus Deep Ecology: A Challenge for the Ecology Movement''.] Originally published in ''Green Perspectives'': Newsletter of the Green Program Project, nos. 4–5 (summer 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Sakai on "natural purity" ====
Such observations among the left are not exclusive to Bookchin. In his review of Anna Bramwell's biography of [[Richard Walther Darré]], J. Sakai observes the fascist ideological undertones of natural purity.&lt;ref name=Sakai&gt;{{cite book|title=The Green Nazi - an investigation into fascist ecology|last=Sakai |first=J.|year=2003|publisher= Kerspledebeb|isbn= 978-0-9689503-9-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[tsarist]] [[intelligentsia]] was divided on the one hand between [[Social Liberalism|liberal]] "[[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] naturalists", who were "taken with the idea of creating a paradise on earth through scientific mastery of nature" and influenced by [[nihilist movement|nihilism]] as well as Russian [[zoologists]] such as [[Anatoli Petrovich Bogdanov]], and "cultural-[[aesthetic]]" conservationists such as Ivan Parfenevich Borodin, who were influenced in turn by [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] and [[Idealism|idealist]] concepts such as ''Landschaftspflege'' and ''Naturdenkmal''.&lt;ref name=Weiner&gt;{{cite book|title= Models Of Nature: Ecology, Conservation, and Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia|last=Weiner|first=Douglas R.|year= 2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn= 978-0-8229-5733-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nouvelle Droite movement====
The influential European ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movement, developed by [[Alain de Benoist]] and other individuals involved with the [[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne|GRECE]] think tank, have also combined green politics with right-wing ideas, such as European ethnonationalism.&lt;ref name="rg"&gt;"Fascism" by Roger Griffin, in ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'', edited by Bron Taylor.

==Biography==
Ernst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach was born in [[Chrlice]] ({{lang-de|Chirlitz}}), [[Moravia]] (then in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian empire]], now part of [[Brno]] in the [[Czech Republic]]). His father, who had graduated from [[Charles University in Prague]], acted as tutor to the noble [[Brethon]] family in [[Zlín]] in eastern Moravia. His grandfather, Wenzl Lanhaus, an administrator of the Chirlitz estate, was also master builder of the streets there. His activities in that field later influenced the theoretical work of Ernst Mach. Some sources give Mach's birthplace as Tuřany ({{lang-de|Turas}}, now also part of Brno), the site of the Chirlitz registry-office. It was there that Ernst Mach was baptized by Peregrin Weiss. Mach later became a [[socialist]] and an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ernst Mach, Physicist and Philosopher|year=1975|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-277-0016-2|author=R. S. Cohen|author2=Raymond J. Seeger|page=158|quote=And Mach, in personal conviction, was a socialist and an atheist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory and life, though, was sometimes compared with [[Buddhism]], namely by [[Heinrich Gomperz]] who addressed Mach as the "Buddha of Science" due to the [[phenomenalist]] approach of the "Ego" in his ''Analysis of Sensations''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ursula Baatz: [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-011-2771-4_9#page-1 "Ernst Mach – The Scientist as a Buddhist?"] In: John Blackmore (ed.): ''Ernst Mach — A Deeper Look. Documents and New Perspectives'' (''Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science'', vol. 143). Springer, Dordrecht 1992, pp. 183–199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0520018494|title= Ernst Mach, His Work, Life, and Influence]|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520018494|author=John T. Blackmore|chapter=Chapter 18 - Mach and Buddhism|page=293|quote=Mach was logically a Buddhist and illogically a believer in science.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the age of 14, Mach received his education at home from his parents. He then entered a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Kroměříž]] ({{lang-de|Kremsier}}), where he studied for three years. In 1855 he became a student at the [[University of Vienna]]. There he studied [[physics]] and for one semester medical physiology, receiving his doctorate in physics in 1860 under [[Andreas von Ettingshausen]] with a thesis titled "Über elektrische Ladungen und Induktion", and his [[habilitation]] the following year. His early work focused on the [[Doppler effect]] in [[optics]] and [[acoustics]]. In 1864 he took a job as Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Graz]], having turned down the position of a chair in surgery at the University of Salzburg to do so, and in 1866 he was appointed as Professor of Physics. During that period, Mach continued his work in [[psycho-physics]] and in sensory perception. In 1867, he took the chair of Experimental Physics at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|Charles University]], [[Prague]], where he stayed for 28 years before returning to Vienna.

Mach's main contribution to physics involved his description and photographs of spark shock-waves and then ballistic shock-waves. He described how when a bullet or shell moved faster than the speed of sound, it created a compression of air in front of it. Using [[schlieren photography]], he and his son Ludwig were able to photograph the shadows of the invisible shock waves. During the early 1890s Ludwig was able to invent an interferometer which allowed for much clearer photographs. But Mach also made many contributions to psychology and physiology, including his anticipation of [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] phenomena, his discovery of the [[oblique effect]] and of [[Mach bands]], an inhibition-influenced type of visual illusion, and especially his discovery of a [[Vestibular system|non-acoustic function]] of the inner ear which helps control human balance.

One of the best-known of Mach's ideas is the so-called "[[Mach's principle|Mach principle]]," concerning the physical origin of inertia. This was never written down by Mach, but was given a graphic verbal form, attributed by [[Philipp Frank]] to Mach himself, as, "When the subway jerks, it's the fixed stars that throw you down."
&lt;!--In this form its incompatibility with Einstein's conviction of the universal retardation of distant action is apparent. As an experimental physicist Mach tended to think that scientific theories were only provisional and had no lasting place in physics. This attitude made it hard for him to accept Einstein's special theory of relativity, especially since the second axiom seemed like an absolute of the kind Mach opposed, which was criticized in the preface to a posthumously published book on light which appeared in 1921.--&gt;

[[File:Photography of bow shock waves around a brass bullet, 1888.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Ernst Mach’s historic 1887 photograph ([[shadowgraph]]) of a bow shockwave around a supersonic bullet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=John D. Anderson, Jr.|authorlink1=John D. Anderson|title=Research in Supersonic Flight and the Breaking of the Sound Barrier -- Chapter 3|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter3.html|website=history.nasa.gov|accessdate=5 September 2016|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mach also became well known for his philosophy developed in close interplay with his science.&lt;ref&gt;On this interdependency of Mach's physics, physiology, history and philosophy of science see Blackmore (1972), Blackmore (ed.) 1992 and Hentschel 1985 against Paul Feyerabend's efforts to decouple these three strands.&lt;/ref&gt; Mach defended a type of [[phenomenalism]] recognizing only [[Sensation and perception psychology|sensations]] as real. This position seemed incompatible with the view of atoms and molecules as external, mind-independent things. He famously declared, after an 1897 lecture by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] at the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Science]] in [[Vienna]]: "I don't believe that atoms exist!"&lt;ref name="Yourgrau"&gt;Yourgrau, P. (2005). ''A World Without Time: The Forgotten Legacy of Gödel and Einstein''. Allen Lane&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1908 to 1911 Mach's reluctance to acknowledge the reality of atoms was criticized by [[Max Planck]] as being incompatible with physics. Einstein's [[Annus Mirabilis papers#Brownian motion|1905 demonstration]] that the statistical fluctuations of atoms allowed measurement of their existence without direct individuated sensory evidence marked a turning point in the acceptance of [[atomic theory]].  Some of Mach's criticisms of Newton's position on space and time influenced Einstein, but later Einstein realized that Mach was basically opposed to Newton's philosophy and concluded that his physical criticism was not sound.

In 1898 Mach suffered from cardiac arrest and in 1901 retired from the University of Vienna and was appointed to the upper chamber of the Austrian parliament. On leaving Vienna in 1913 he moved to his son's home in [[Vaterstetten]], near [[Munich]], where he continued writing and corresponding until his death in 1916, only one day after his 78th birthday.

==Physics==
Most of Mach's initial studies in the field of experimental physics concentrated on the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], [[diffraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and [[refraction]] of light in different media under external influences. From there followed important explorations in the field of [[supersonic]] fluid mechanics. Mach and physicist-photographer [[Peter Salcher]] presented their paper on this subject&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mach|first=Ernst|last2=Salcher|first2=Peter|date=1887|title=Photographische Fixirung der durch Projectile in der Luft eingeleiteten Vorgänge|url=https://archive.org/stream/sitzungsbericht503klasgoog#page/n804/mode/2up|journal=Sitzungsber. Kaiserl. Akad. Wiss., Wien, Math.-Naturwiss. Cl.|volume=95|issue=Abt. II|pages=764–780|access-date=24 October 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1887; it correctly describes the sound effects observed during the supersonic motion of a [[projectile]]. They deduced and experimentally confirmed the existence of a [[shock wave]] of conical shape, with the projectile at the apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/history/q0149.shtml|title=Ernst Mach and Mach Number|last1=Scott|first1=Jeff|date=9 November 2003|website=Aerospaceweb.org|access-date=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of the speed of a fluid to the local [[speed of sound]] ''v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''/''v&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is now called the [[Mach number]]. It is a critical parameter in the description of high-speed fluid movement in [[aerodynamics]] and [[hydrodynamics]]. Mach also contributed to [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] the hypothesis known as [[Mach's principle]].

==Philosophy of science==
[[File:Ernst Mach - Rathauspark, Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Mach in the [[Rathauspark]] (City Hall Park) in [[Vienna]], Austria]]
===Empirio-criticism&lt;!--'Empirio-criticism' and 'Empiriocriticism' redirect here--&gt;===
From 1895 to 1901, Mach held a newly created chair for "the history and philosophy of the inductive sciences" at the University of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;On Mach's historiography, cf., e.g., Hentschel (1988); on his impact in Vienna, see Stadler et al. (1988), and Blackmore et al. (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  In his historico-philosophical studies, Mach developed a phenomenalistic [[philosophy of science]] which became influential in the 19th and 20th centuries. He originally saw scientific laws as summaries of experimental events, constructed for the purpose of making complex data comprehensible, but later emphasized mathematical functions as a more useful way to describe sensory appearances. Thus scientific laws while somewhat idealized have more to do with describing sensations than with reality as it exists beyond sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Selections are taken from his essay ''The Economical Nature of Physical Inquiry'', excerpted by Kockelmans and slightly corrected by Blackmore. (citation below).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote
|The goal which it ([[physics|physical science]]) has set itself is the ''simplest'' and ''most economical'' abstract expression of facts.

When the human mind, with its limited powers, attempts to mirror in itself the rich life of the world, of which it itself is only a small part, and which it can never hope to exhaust, it has every reason for proceeding economically.

In reality, the law always contains less than the fact itself, because it does not reproduce the fact as a whole but only in that aspect of it which is important for us, the rest being intentionally or from necessity omitted.
}}

{{cquote|In mentally separating a body from the changeable environment in which it moves, what we really do is to extricate a group of sensations on which our thoughts are fastened and which is of relatively greater stability than the others, from the stream of all our sensations.

Suppose we were to attribute to nature the property of producing like effects in like circumstances; just these like circumstances we should not know how to find. Nature exists once only. Our schematic mental imitation alone produces like events.
}}

Mach's positivism also influenced many Russian [[Marxist]]s, such as [[Alexander Bogdanov]] (1873–1928). In 1908, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] wrote a philosophical work, ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]]'' (published 1909), in which he criticized Machism and the views of "[[Russian Machism|Russian Machists]]" (Lenin also cited in this work the concept of the 'Ether', as the medium through which light waves propagated, and the concept of time as an absolute). '''Empirio-criticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the term for the rigorously positivist and radically empirical philosophy established by the German philosopher [[Richard Avenarius]] and further developed by Mach, which claims that all we can know is our sensations and that knowledge should be confined to pure experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067956_ss1-46 "empirio-criticism"]: entry in ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy''.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with empirio-critical philosophy, Mach opposed [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and others who proposed an [[atomic theory]] of physics. Since one cannot observe things as small as atoms directly, and since no atomic model at the time was consistent, the atomic hypothesis seemed to Mach to be unwarranted, and perhaps not sufficiently "economical". Mach had a direct influence on the [[Vienna Circle]] philosophers and the school of [[logical positivism]] in general.

To Mach are attributed a number of principles that distill his ideal of physical theorisation—what is now called "Machian physics":
# It should be based entirely on directly observable phenomena (in line with his positivistic leanings)&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Barbour|Barbour, J.]] ''The End of Time'', p. 220: "In the Machian view, the properties of the system are exhausted by the masses of the particles and their separations, but the separations are mutual properties. Apart from the masses, the particles have no attributes that are exclusively their own. They — in the form of a triangle — are a single thing. In the Newtonian view, the particles exist in absolute space and time. These external elements lend the particles attributes — position, momentum, angular momentum — denied in the Machian view. The particles become three things. Absolute space and time are an essential part of atomism."&lt;/ref&gt;
# It should completely eschew [[absolute space and time]] in favor of [[relative motion]]&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, R., ''The Road to Reality'', p. 753: "Mach’s principle asserts that physics should be defined entirely in terms of the relation of one body to another, and that the very notion of a background space should be abandoned"&lt;/ref&gt;
# Any phenomena that would seem attributable to absolute space and time (e.g., [[inertia]] and [[centrifugal force]]) should instead be seen as emerging from the large scale distribution of matter in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. ''The Science of Mechanics''. "&gt; [The] investigator must feel the need of ... knowledge of the immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe.  There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last is singled out, particularly by [[Albert Einstein]], as "the" [[Mach's principle]]. Einstein cited it as one of the three principles underlying [[general relativity]]. In 1930, he stated that "it is justified to consider Mach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pais, ''Subtle is the Lord'', 2005, OUP&lt;/ref&gt; though Mach, before his death, would apparently reject Einstein's theory.&lt;ref&gt;The preface of the posthumously published ''Principles of Physical Optics'' explicitly rejects Einstein's relativistic views but it has been argued that the text is inauthentic; see Gereon Wolters, ''Mach and Einstein, or Clearing Troubled Waters in the History of Science.'' "Einstein and the Changing Worldviews of Physics". Birkhäuser, Boston, 2012. 39-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein was aware that his theories did not fulfill all Mach's principles, and no subsequent theory has either, despite considerable effort.

===Phenomenological constructivism===
According to Alexander Riegler, Ernst Mach's work was a precursor to the influential perspective known as [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Riegler, A. (2011) "Constructivism". In: L'Abete, L. (Ed.) ''Paradigms in Theory Construction'', pp. 235–255 ({{DOI|10.1007/978-1-4614-0914-4_13}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism holds that all knowledge is constructed rather than received by the learner. He took an exceptionally non-dualist, phenomenological position. The founder of radical constructivism, [[Ernst von Glasersfeld|von Glasersfeld]], gave a nod to Mach as an ally.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[File:Mach's spinning chair.jpg|thumb|right|Spinning chair devised by Mach to investigate the experience of motion]]

==Physiology==
In 1873, independently of each other&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, J.E. and Schacht, J. [http://www.aro.org/announcements/ANO-Otohistory-8.pdf "The Emergence of Vestibular Science"] (Part 8 of "Sketches of Otohistory") in ''Audiology and Neurotology'', April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Mach and the physiologist and physician [[Josef Breuer]] discovered how the [[sense of balance]] (i.e., the perception of the head’s imbalance) functions, tracing its management by information which the brain receives from the movement of [[Endolymph|a fluid]] in the [[semicircular canal]]s of the [[Vestibular system|inner ear]]. That the sense of balance depended on the three semicircular canals was discovered in 1870 by the physiologist [[Friedrich Goltz]], but Goltz did not discover how the balance-sensing apparatus functioned. Mach devised a swivel chair to enable him to test his theories, and Floyd Ratliff has suggested that this experiment may have paved the way to Mach's critique of a physical conception of absolute space and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratliff|first1=Floyd|article=On Mach's Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations|editor1-last=Seeger|editor1-first=Raymond J.|editor2-last=Cohen|editor2-first=Robert S.|title=Ernst Mach, Physicist and Philosopher|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
[[File:Mach bands - animation.gif|thumb|right|Exaggerated contrast between edges of the slightly differing shades of gray, appears as soon as they touch]]

In the area of sensory perception, psychologists remember Mach for the [[optical illusion]] called [[Mach bands]]. The effect exaggerates the contrast between edges of the slightly differing shades of gray, as soon as they contact one another, by triggering edge-detection in the human visual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mach_bands_quantitative_studies_on_neura.html?id=iwwpAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Mach bands: quantitative studies on neural networks in the retina|last=Ratliff|first=Floyd|date=1965|publisher=Holden-Day|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More clearly than anyone before or since Mach made the distinction between what he called ''physiological'' (specifically [[Visual space|visual]]) and ''geometrical'' spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1906) ''Space and Geometry''. Chicago: Open Court Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mach's views on mediating structures inspired [[B. F. Skinner]]'s strongly [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] position, which paralleled Mach's in the field of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6873">'''Evolutionary rescue''' is a theoretical situation in which a population recovers from environmental pressure through advantageous genetic change rather than increased gene flow, migration, dispersal or other demographic rescue techniques. While the term was first used in 1995 in Richard Gomulkiewicz and Robert Holt's essay in the journal ''Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomulkiewicz|first1=Richard|last2=Holt|first2=Robert|title=When does natural selection save a population from extinction?|journal=Evolution|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory has since academically matured through review and modeling. The most commonly used meaning of the term was established in Gonzalez et al. (2012), which states that evolutionary rescue "occurs when genetic adaptation allows a population to recover from demographic effects initiated by environmental change that would otherwise cause extirpation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Andrew|title=Evolutionary rescue; an emerging focus at the intersection between ecology and evolution|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical framework ==
Due to rapid losses of [[biodiversity]], [[climate change]], and rapid spread of [[non-native species]] due to [[globalization]], natural environments are changing faster now than in any other time point in human history. Given that traditional framework of [[evolution]] emphasizes that ecologically relevant evolution occurs slowly for the plant and animal kingdoms, the 20th century and 21st century shift in the rate of environmental change naturally raises questions of contemporary evolution. The central question in the framework of evolutionary rescue remains, "If contemporary evolution, also referred to as rapid evolution, occurs, can it be fast enough to foster population persistence in extremely small time-scales?". Proponents of the evolutionary rescue hypothesis argue that evolutionary rescue is a unique phenomenon, separate from two commonly studied escapes from ecological pressures, demographic and genetic rescues. While [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] is a key aspect to all three population survival strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=G|title=Evolutionary rescue and the limits of adaptation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolutionary rescue is the only one driven by adaptive evolution mechanistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzales|first1=A.|title=Evolutionary rescue: an emerging focus at the intersection between ecology and evolution|journal= Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci.|date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographic rescue is simply a dynamic driven by source-sink immigration dynamics, whereas genetic rescue is primarily driven by hybridization in combination with immigration. Given the reliance on immigration, it can be difficult to disentangle demographic rescue from genetic rescue. The distinction between these three rescue strategies may be difficult to prove, if it exists, although rescue from negative population growth may be a hallmark.

[[File:Theoretical Depiction of Evolutionary Rescue.png|thumb|left|alt=a theoretical depiction of evolutionary rescue.|The theoretical characterization of evolutionary rescue may be a U-shaped curve.]]

It may be easier to find quantifiable evidence for evolutionary rescue in rapidly shifting environments versus gradually shifting environments (climate change, ocean acidification, etc.). High localization and source-sink biogeographic demographic dynamics may also increase the likelihood of evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue may also be highly characterized by a U-shaped curve, in which the population declines sharply until it passes a stochastic threshold, at which the adaptive allele frequency rapidly increases, with the population rebounding at a slower rate as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomulkiewicz|first1=R.|title=When does evolution by natural selection prevent extinction? |journal=Evolution|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most vulnerable part of the evolutionary rescue process, theoretically, should be the time point during which the population is beyond the stochastic threshold, which exposes the population to random outcomes not determined by genetic or evolutionary mechanisms.

== Empirical evidence ==

While there is empirical evidence for evolutionary rescue, it is important to note that missing temporal, demographic or allelic data makes the majority of these examples suggestive of evolutionary rescue at best. For example, the demographic shifts in ''Gasterosteus aculeatus'' from weakly armored to heavily armored variants following [[bioremediation]] of water clarity in Lake Washington, USA, suggest that increased the predatory efficiency of ''Oncorhynchus clarkii'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitano|first1=J|title=Reverse evolution of armor plates in the threespine stickleback|journal=Current Biology|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although inclusion versus exclusion treatments at controlled densities would provide stronger mechanistic support. Another possible example of evolutionary rescue in nature is the selective response of redbellied black snakes (''Pseudechis porphyriacus'') to cane toads (''Rhinella marina'') in [[Australia]], in which ''P. porphyriacus'' exposed to ''R. marina'' for long periods of time demonstrated rapid adaptive shifts in resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=B.L|last2=Shine|first2=R|title=An invasive species induces rapid adaptive change in a native predator: cane toads and black snakes in Australia|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unresolved questions ==
At the point in time, more substantial theoretical, modeling and empirical work is needed to distinguish evolutionary rescue from traditionally adaptation discourse in the evolutionary biology field.  Currently, one of the key arguments separating evolutionary rescue from adaptation is the reliance on absolutely fitness versus relative fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kliman|first1=Richard|title= AN Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Biology|publisher= Academic Press|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the theory of evolutionary rescue may help inform future [[Conservation biology|conservation]] efforts, more work is needed to explain the role of the interplay between dispersal and negative density dependence on an organism's short-term and long-term capacity for adaptation and evolutionary rescue. Furthermore, more in-depth work on the role of [[stochastic]] fluctuations, particularly in the determination of stochastic thresholds, is needed to establish evolutionary rescue as a viable explanation for trends in evolutionary biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2884">'''Fabius Mieses''' (31 October 1824 - 10 October 1898) was a [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n litterateur and philosopher.

Mieses was born at [[Brody]] on October 31, 1824. Till the age of 15, he studied Hebrew literature exclusively. At an early age he showed signs of great intellectual power, and was hailed as a genius. In the house of his father-in-law, I. Mieses, a scholar living in [[Dresden]], he met, besides [[Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport]] and other [[Maskilim]], his future teacher, M. Sehongut, who initiated him into the study of philosophy, and with whom he used to converse in Hebrew during their regular daily walks. At the same time, he assiduously applied himself to the study of German, French, Italian, Latin, mathematics, and astronomy. In 1846, his German essay "Gegenwart und Vergangeuheit im Judenthume" appeared in [[Julius Fürst]]'s ''Der Orient''; and from that time, he became assistant editor of and a regular contributor to that paper. In 1878, he published (at [[Lyck]]) a didactic poem entitled "HaEmunah weha-Tebunah," treating of Darwinism and its opponents. By this production, he gained for himself a prominent and lasting place among Hebrew poets. Mieses was a prolific writer. Besides frequently contributing to various Hebrew and German periodicals, he wrote the following independent works: "Ha-Kabbalah weha-Hasidut" (Breslau, 1866; Odessa, 1871); "Korot ha-Filusufiyah ha-Hadashah" (Leipsic, 1887), a history of modern philosophy from Kant to Mieses' own time; "Shirim" (Cracow, 1891), a collection of miscellaneous poems; "Die Bibel der Vernunft" (Leipsic, 1895). Upon this last work rests his chief notability, as it is the first and only one of its kind which was written in the Hebrew language. Mieses was opposed to all religious reforms. He died at [[Leipzig]] on 10 October 1898.{{sfn|Singer|Adler|1912|p=582}}

{{Japanese name|Hanawa}}

{{nihongo|'''Hanawa Hokiichi'''|塙 保己一||23 June 1746 &amp;ndash; 7 October 1821}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] famous blind scholar and buddhist monk of the [[Edo period]].

Hokiichi became blind when he was 5 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Japan Encyclopedia'', Harvard University, 2002, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; He learned history, literature, medical science and jurisprudence from several masters. One of them was [[Kamo no Mabuchi]]. Hokiichi compiled "[[Gunsho Ruijū]]" (群書類従 Great collection of old documents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Hanawa Hokiichi and ''Monumenta Japonica Historica'' |title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing: 1400-1800 |last=Rabasa |first=José |author2=Andrew Feldherr |author3=Daniel R.

In 1937, [[Helen Keller]] came to Japan and visited Hokiichi's memorial house. She expressed her impression as follows: "When I was a child, my mother told me that Mr. Hanawa should be my role model. To visit this place and touch his statue was the most significant event during this trip to Japan. The worn desk and the statue facing down earned more respect of him. I believe that his name would pass down from generation to generation like a stream of water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onkogakkai.com/english_page.htm English page of Hanawa Hokiichi Shiryoukan]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60113">The '''history of philosophy in Poland''' parallels the evolution of [[philosophy]] in [[Europe]] in general.  

==Overview==
Polish philosophy drew upon the broader currents of European philosophy, and in turn contributed to their growth.  Among the most momentous Polish contributions were made, in the thirteenth century, by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher and scientist [[Witelo]], and, in the sixteenth century, by the [[Renaissance]] [[polymath]] [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys dziejów filozofii w Polsce'' (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] partook in the intellectual ferment of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which for the multi-ethnic Commonwealth ended not long after the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] and political annihilation that would last for the next 123 years, until the collapse of the three partitioning empires in [[World War I]].

The period of [[Messianism]], between the [[November Uprising|November 1830]] and [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprisings]], reflected European [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Idealist]] trends, as well as a Polish yearning for political [[resurrection]].  It was a period of [[maximalist]] [[metaphysics|metaphysical systems]].

The collapse of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] prompted an agonizing reappraisal of Poland's situation.  Poles gave up their earlier practice of "measuring their resources by their aspirations," and buckled down to hard work and study.  "[A] Positivist," wrote the novelist [[Bolesław Prus]]' friend, [[Julian Ochorowicz]], was "anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible."&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'' (History of Philosophy), vol. 3, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century brought a new quickening to Polish philosophy.  There was growing interest in western philosophical currents.  Rigorously trained Polish philosophers made substantial contributions to specialized fields—to [[psychology]], the [[history of philosophy]], the [[theory of knowledge]], and especially [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref name="Zarys. p. 32"&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] gained world fame with his concept of [[many-valued logic]] and his "[[Polish notation]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], ''A Half Century of Polish Mathematics'', pp. 23–24, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Tarski]]'s work in [[truth theory]] won him world renown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], ''A Half Century of Polish Mathematics'', p. 30 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], for over four decades, world-class Polish philosophers and [[history of philosophy|historians of philosophy]] such as [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] continued their work, often in the face of adversities occasioned by the dominance of a politically enforced official philosophy.
The [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Roman Ingarden]] did influential work in [[esthetics]] and in a [[Husserl]]-style [[metaphysics]]; his student [[Karol Wojtyła]] acquired a unique influence on the world stage as Pope [[John Paul II]].

[[File:Witelo-Perspectiva.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Page from a manuscript of ''De perspectiva'', with miniature of its author [[Witelo]]]]
[[File:Witelo, book.gif|thumb|150px|Cover of ''Vitellonis Thuringopoloni opticae libri decem'' (Ten Books of Optics by the [[Thuringia|Thuringo]]-[[Poland|Pole]] [[Witelo]])]]
The formal history of [[philosophy]] in [[Poland]] may be said to have begun in the fifteenth century, following the revival of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]] by King [[Jagiello|Władysław II Jagiełło]] in 1400.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 5"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The true beginnings of Polish philosophy, however, reach back to the thirteenth century and [[Witelo]] (c. 1230&amp;nbsp;– c. 1314), a [[Silesia]]n born to a Polish mother and a [[Thuringia]]n settler, a contemporary of [[Thomas Aquinas]] who had spent part of his life in [[Italy]] at centers of the highest intellectual culture.  In addition to being a [[philosopher]], he was a [[scientist]] who specialized in [[optics]].  His famous treatise, ''Perspectiva'', while drawing on the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[Book of Optics]]'' by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], was unique in [[Latin]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and in turn helped inspire [[Roger Bacon]]'s best work, Part V of his ''Opus maius'', "On Perspectival Science," as well as his supplementary treatise ''On the Multiplication of Vision''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]], ''The Age of Faith'', p. 1011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Witelo's ''Perspectiva'' additionally made important contributions to [[psychology]]:  it held that [[visual perception|vision]] ''per se'' apprehends only [[color]]s and [[light]] while all else, particularly the distance and size of objects, is established by means of [[association (psychology)|association]] and unconscious [[deductive reasoning|deduction]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 5"/&gt;

Witelo's concept of [[being]] was one rare in the [[Middle Ages]], neither [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] as among conservatives nor [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] as among progressives, but [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]]. It was an [[emanationism|emanationist]] concept that held [[radiation]] to be the prime characteristic of being, and ascribed to radiation the nature of [[light]].  This "metaphysic of light" inclined Witelo to [[optics|optical]] research, or perhaps ''vice versa'' his optical studies led to his [[metaphysic]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Polish historian of philosophy, [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], no Polish philosopher since [[Witelo]] has enjoyed so eminent a European standing as this thinker who belonged, in a sense, to the [[prehistory]] of Polish philosophy.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Collegium Maius in Krakow 01.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Courtyard of [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]]'s ''Collegium Maius'', a site of Polish higher learning since 1400]]
From the beginning of the fifteenth century, Polish philosophy, centered at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]], pursued a normal course. It no longer harbored exceptional thinkers such as Witelo, but it did feature representatives of all wings of mature [[Scholasticism]], ''via antiqua'' as well as ''via moderna''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/&gt;

The first of these to reach Kraków was ''via moderna'', then the more widespread movement in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 311"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 1, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[physics]], [[logic]] and [[ethics]], [[Terminism]] ([[Nominalism]]) prevailed in Kraków, under the influence of the [[France|French]] Scholastic, [[Jean Buridan]] (died c. 1359), who had been [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Paris]] and an exponent of views of [[William of Ockham]].  Buridan had formulated the [[theory]] of "''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]''"—the [[force]] that causes a body, once set in [[Motion (physics)|motion]], to persist in motion—and stated that impetus is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[speed]] of, and amount of [[matter]] comprising, a body:  Buridan thus anticipated [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton]].  His theory of impetus was momentous in that it also explained the motions of [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] without resort to the [[spirit]]s—''"intelligentiae"''—to which the [[Peripatetics]] (followers of [[Aristotle]]) had ascribed those motions.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 1, pp. 303–4.&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Kraków]], physics was now expounded by (St.) [[John Cantius|Jan Kanty]] (1390–1473), who developed this concept of "impetus."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/&gt;

A general trait of the Kraków [[Scholastics]] was a provlivity for [[compromise]]—for reconciling [[Nominalism]] with the older tradition. For example, the Nominalist, Benedict Hesse, while in principle accepting the theory of [[Theory of impetus|impetus]], did not apply it to the heavenly spheres.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/&gt;

In the second half of the fifteenth century, at Kraków, ''via antiqua'' became dominant. [[Nominalism]] retreated, and the old [[Scholasticism]] triumphed.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 311"/&gt;

In this period, [[Thomism]] had its chief center at [[Cologne]], whence it influenced Kraków.  Cologne, formerly the home ground of [[Albertus Magnus]], had preserved Albert's mode of thinking.  Thus the Cologne philosophers formed two wings, the Thomist and Albertist, and even Cologne's Thomists showed [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] traits characteristic of Albert, affirming [[emanation]], a [[hierarchy]] of [[being]], and a [[metaphysic]] of [[light]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/&gt;
[[File:Jan z Głogowa.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Jan of Głogów]]]]
The chief Kraków adherents of the Cologne-style Thomism included [[Jan of Głogów]] (c. 1445 – 1507) and [[Jakub of Gostynin]] (c. 1454 – 1506).  Another, purer teacher of Thomism was [[Michał Falkener]] of [[Wrocław]] (c. 1450 – 1534).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost at the same time, [[Scotism]] appeared in Poland, having been brought from [[Paris]] first by [[Michał Twaróg of Bystrzyków]] (c. 1450 – 1520).  Twaróg had studied at Paris in 1473–77, in the period when, following the [[anathema]]tization of the [[Nominalist]]s (1473), the Scotist school was there enjoying its greatest triumphs.  A prominent student of Twaróg's, [[Jan of Stobnica]] (c. 1470 – 1519), was already a moderate Scotist who took account of the theories of the [[William of Ockham|Ockhamists]], [[Thomist]]s and [[Humanism|Humanists]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 7"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Nominalism]] was revived in [[western Europe]] at the turn of the sixteenth century, particularly thanks to [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] (''Faber Stapulensis''), it presently reappeared in [[Kraków]] and began taking the upper hand there once more over [[Thomism]] and [[Scotism]].  It was reintroduced particularly by Lefèvre's pupil, [[Jan Szylling]], a native of Kraków who had studied at Paris in the opening years of the sixteenth century.  Another follower of Lefèvre's was [[Grzegorz of Stawiszyn]], a Kraków professor who, beginning in 1510, published the Frenchman's works at Kraków.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 7"/&gt;

Thus [[Poland]] had made her appearance as a separate philosophical center only at the turn of the fifteenth century, at a time when the creative period of [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophy had already passed.  Throughout the fifteenth century, Poland harbored all the currents of Scholasticism.  The advent of [[Humanism]] in Poland would find a Scholasticism more vigorous than in other countries.  Indeed, Scholasticism would survive the 16th and 17th centuries and even part of the 18th at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków]] and [[Wilno University|Wilno Universities]] and at numerous [[Jesuit]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

To be sure, in the sixteenth century, with the arrival of the [[Renaissance]], [[Scholasticism]] would enter upon a decline; but during the 17th century's [[Counter-reformation]], and even into the early 18th century, Scholasticism would again become Poland's chief philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirit of [[Humanism]], which had reached Poland by the middle of the fifteenth century, was not very "philosophical." Rather, it lent its stimulus to [[linguistics|linguistic]] studies, [[political]] thought, and [[science|scientific]] research. But these manifested a philosophical attitude different from that of the previous period.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empirical]] [[natural science]] had flourished at [[Kraków]] as early as the fifteenth century, side by side with speculative philosophy. The most perfect product of this blossoming was [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543, {{lang-pl|Mikołaj Kopernik}}). He was not only a scientist but a philosopher. According to [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], he may have been the greatest—in any case, the most renowned—philosopher that Poland ever produced. He drew the inspiration for his cardinal discovery from philosophy; he had become acquainted through [[Marsilio Ficino]] with the philosophies of [[Plato]] and the [[Pythagoreans]]; and through the writings of the philosophers [[Cicero]] and [[Plutarch]] he had learned about the [[ancient history|ancients]] who had declared themselves in favor of the Earth's movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], "Outline of the History of Philosophy in Poland," translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XVIII, no. 3, 1973, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copernicus may also have been influenced by Kraków philosophy:  during his studies there, [[Terminism|Terminist]] [[physics]] had been taught, with special emphasis on "''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]''."  His own thinking was guided by philosophical considerations.  He arrived at the [[heliocentric]] thesis (as he was to write in a youthful treatise) "''ratione postea equidem sensu''":  it was not [[observation]] but the discovery of a [[logic]]al [[contradiction]] in [[Ptolemy]]'s system, that served him as a point of departure that led to the new astronomy.  In his dedication to [[Pope Paul III]], he submitted his work for judgment by "philosophers."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its turn, Copernicus' theory transformed man's view of the structure of the [[universe]], and of the place held in it by the earth and by man, and thus attained a far-reaching philosophical importance.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/&gt;

Copernicus was involved not only in [[natural science]] and [[natural philosophy]] but also—by his postulation of a [[quantity theory of money]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus Copernicus, memorandum on monetary policy, 1517.&lt;/ref&gt; and of "[[Gresham's Law]]" (in the year, 1519, of [[Thomas Gresham]]'s birth&lt;ref&gt;"Copernicus seems to have drawn up some notes [on the displacement of good coin from circulation by debased coin] while he was at [[Olsztyn]] in 1519.  He made them the basis of a report on the matter, written in German, which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522 at [[Grudziądz]]...  He later drew up a revised and enlarged version of his little treatise, this time in Latin, and setting forth a general theory of money, for presentation to the Diet of 1528."  Angus Armitage, ''The World of Copernicus'', 1951, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;)—in the philosophy of man.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/&gt;

In the early sixteenth century, [[Plato]], who had become a model for philosophy in [[Italy]], especially in [[Medici|Medicean]] [[Florence]], was represented in [[Poland]] in some ways by [[Adam of Łowicz]], author of ''Conversations about Immortality''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/&gt;

Generally speaking, though, Poland remained [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]. [[Sebastian Petrycy]] of [[Pilzno]] (1554–1626) laid stress, in the [[theory of knowledge]], on [[experiment]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]; and in [[psychology]], on [[feeling]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]]; while in [[politics]] he preached [[democracy|democratic]] ideas. Petrycy's central feature was his linking of philosophical theory with the requirements of practical national life. In 1601–18, a period when [[translation]]s into [[modern language]]s were still rarities, he accomplished Polish translations of [[Aristotle]]'s practical works. With Petrycy, [[vernacular]] Polish philosophical [[terminology]] began to develop not much later than did the French and German.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another [[Renaissance]] current, the new [[Stoicism]], was represented in Poland by [[Jakub Górski]] (c. 1525 – 1585), author of a famous ''Dialectic'' (1563) and of many works in [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[theology]] and [[sociology]].  He tended toward [[eclecticism]], attempting to reconcile the [[Stoics]] with [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 10"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A later, purer representative of [[Stoicism]] in Poland was [[Adam Burski]] (c. 1560 – 1611), author of a ''Dialectica Ciceronis'' (1604) boldly proclaiming Stoic [[sensationalism|sensualism]] and [[empiricism]] and—before [[Francis Bacon]]—urging the use of [[inductive reasoning|inductive method]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 10"/&gt;

A star among the [[Pleiades|pleiade]] of progressive [[political]] philosophers during the [[Polish Renaissance]] was [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] (1503–72), who advocated on behalf of [[social equality|equality]] for all before the law, the accountability of [[monarch]] and [[government]] to the nation, and social assistance for the weak and disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  His chief work was ''De Republica emendanda'' (On Reform of the Republic, 1551–54).

Another notable political thinker was [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]] (1530–1607), best known in Poland and abroad for his book ''De optimo senatore'' (The Accomplished Senator, 1568).  It propounded the view—which for long got the book banned in [[England]], as subversive of [[monarchy]]—that a ruler may legitimately govern only with the sufferance of the people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Józef Kasparek|Joseph Kasparek]], ''The Constitutions of Poland and of the United States:  Kinships and Genealogy'', pp. 245–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first decades of the 17th century, the [[war]]s, [[invasion]]s and internal [[wikt:dissension|dissension]]s that beset the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], brought a decline in philosophy.  If in the ensuing period there was independent philosophical thought, it was among the religious [[dissenter]]s, particularly the Polish [[Polish Brethren|Arians]],&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; also known variously as [[Antitrinitarian]]s, [[Socinian]]s, and [[Polish Brethren]]—forerunners of the [[Great Britain|British]] and [[United States|American]] Socinians, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deist]]s who were to figure prominently in the intellectual and political currents of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparek, ''The Constitutions...'', pp. 218–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish [[dissenter]]s created an original [[ethical]] theory radically condemning evil and [[violence]].  Centers of intellectual life such as that at [[Leszno]] hosted notable thinkers such as the [[Czech people|Czech]] [[pedagogue]], [[Jan Amos Komensky]] (Comenius), and the Pole, [[Jan Jonston]].  Jonston was tutor and physician to the [[Leszczyński]] family, a devotee of Bacon and experimental knowledge, and author of ''Naturae constantia'', published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1632, whose [[geometrical]] method and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]], almost [[pantheistic]] concept of the world may have influenced [[Benedict Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11"/&gt;

The [[Leszczyński]] family itself would produce an 18th-century [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian]] king, [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] (1677–1766; reigned in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] 1704–11 and again 1733–36), "''le philosophe bienfaisant''" ("the beneficent philosopher")—in fact, an independent thinker whose views on [[culture]] were in advance of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s, and who was the first to introduce into Polish intellectual life on a large scale the [[France|French]] influences that were later to become so strong.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1689, in an exceptional miscarriage of justice, a Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher, [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], author of a manuscript treatise, ''De non existentia Dei'' (On the Non-existence of God), was accused of atheism by a priest who was his debtor, was convicted, and was executed in most brutal fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnlIAAAAMAAJ|title=Historical sketch of the rise, progress, and decline of the Reformation in Poland: and of the influence which the scriptural doctrines have exercised on that country in literary, moral, and political respects|first=Valerian Krasinski|last=(Count)|date=23 May 2018|publisher=Printed for the author and sold by Murray|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The execution of the nobleman Lyszczynski, accused of atheism, [a] religious murder ordered by the Diet of 1689, remained an isolated case."

After a decline of a century and a half, in the mid-18th century, Polish philosophy began to revive.  The hub of this movement was [[Warsaw]].  While Poland's capital then had no institution of higher learning, neither were those of [[Kraków]], [[Zamość]] or [[Vilnius|Wilno]] any longer agencies of progress.  The initial impetus for the revival came from religious thinkers:  from members of the [[Piarist]] and other teaching orders.  A leading patron of the new ideas was [[Bishop]] [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11"/&gt;

[[Scholasticism]], which until then had dominated Polish philosophy, was followed by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  Initially the major influence was [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and, indirectly, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].  The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s [[Royal elections in Poland|elected]] king, [[August III the Saxon]], and the relations between Poland and her neighbor, [[Saxony]], heightened the [[Germany|German]] [[Sphere of influence|influence]].  Wolff's doctrine was brought to Warsaw in 1740 by the [[Theatine]], Portalupi; from 1743, its chief Polish champion was [[Wawrzyniec Mitzler de Kolof]] (1711–78), court physician to [[August III]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s last king, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (reigned 1764–95), the [[Polish Enlightenment]] was radicalized and came under [[France|French]] influence.  The philosophical foundation of the movement ceased to be the [[Rationalist]] doctrine of Wolff and became the [[Sensationalism|Sensualism]] of [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]].  This spirit pervaded Poland's [[Commission of National Education]], which completed the reforms begun by the [[Piarist]] priest, [[Stanisław Konarski]].  The Commission's members were in touch with the French [[Encyclopedists]] and [[Freethought|freethinkers]], with [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] and [[Condorcet]], [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]].  The Commission abolished school instruction in [[theology]], even in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[empiricist]] and [[positivist]] Enlightenment philosophy produced several outstanding Polish thinkers.  Though active in the reign of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], they published their chief works only after the loss of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s independence in 1795.  The most important of these figures were [[Jan Śniadecki]], [[Stanisław Staszic]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another adherent of this empirical Enlightenment philosophy was the minister of education under the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and under the [[Congress Poland]] established by the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Stanisław Kostka Potocki]] (1755–1821).  In some places, as at [[Krzemieniec]] and its [[Lyceum]] in southeastern Poland, this philosophy was to survive well into the nineteenth century.  Though a belated philosophy from a western perspective, it was at the same time the philosophy of the future.  This was the period between [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] and [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]; and even as this variety of [[positivism]] was temporarily fading in the West, it was carrying on in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the nineteenth century, as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s fame was spreading over the rest of Europe, in Poland the Enlightenment philosophy was still in full flower.  Kantism found here a hostile soil.  Even before Kant had been understood, he was condemned by the most respected writers of the time:  by [[Jan Śniadecki]], [[Stanisław Staszic|Staszic]], [[Hugo Kołłątaj|Kołłątaj]], [[Tadeusz Czacki]], later by [[Anioł Dowgird]] (1776–1835). [[Jan Śniadecki]] warned against this "fanatical, dark and apocalyptic mind," and wrote:  "To revise [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], to desire ''a priori'' knowledge of things that human nature can grasp only by their consequences, is a lamentable aberration of mind."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Śniadecki's younger brother, however, [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]], was the first respected Polish scholar to declare (1799) for Kant.  And in applying Kantian ideas to the [[natural sciences]], he did something new that would not be undertaken until much later by [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]], [[Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz]] and other famous scientists of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Polish proponent of Kantism was [[Józef Kalasanty Szaniawski]] (1764–1843), who had been a student of Kant's at [[Königsberg]].  But, having accepted the fundamental points of the critical theory of knowledge, he still hesitated between Kant's metaphysical agnosticism and the new metaphysics of [[Idealism]].  Thus this one man introduced to Poland both the antimetaphysical Kant and the post-Kantian metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, Kant's foremost Polish sympathizer would be [[Feliks Jaroński]] (1777–1827), who lectured at Kraków in 1809–18.  Still, his Kantian sympathies were only partial.  And this half-heartedness was typical of Polish Kantism generally.  In Poland there was no actual Kantian period.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a generation, between the age of the [[French Enlightenment]] and that of the Polish national [[metaphysic]], the Scottish philosophy of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|common sense]] became the dominant outlook in Poland.  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]] held sway in most European countries—in Britain till mid-century, and nearly as long in France.  But in Poland, from the first, the Scottish philosophy fused with Kantism, in this regard anticipating the West.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kantian and Scottish ideas were united in typical fashion by [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]] (1768–1838).  The younger brother of [[Jan Śniadecki]], Jędrzej was an illustrious scientist, biologist and physician, and the more creative mind of the two.  He had been educated at the universities of [[Kraków]], [[Padua]] and [[Edinburgh]] and was from 1796 a professor at [[Wilno]], where he held a chair of [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacy]].  He was a foe of [[metaphysics]], holding that the fathoming of [[first cause]]s of [[being]] was "impossible to fulfill and unnecessary."  But foe of metaphysics that he was, he was not an [[Empiricist]]—and this was his link with Kant.  "Experiment and observation can only gather... the materials from which [[common sense]] alone can build science."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analogous position, shunning both [[positivism]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical speculation]], affined to the Scots but linked in some features to Kantian [[critique]], was held in the period before the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]] by virtually all the university professors in Poland:  in [[Wilno]], by Dowgird; in [[Kraków]], by [[Józef Emanuel Jankowski]] (1790–1847); and in [[Warsaw]], by [[Adam Ignacy Zabellewicz]] (1784–1831) and [[Krystyn Lach Szyrma]] (1791–1866).&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, following a generation imbued with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, Poland passed directly to a [[maximalism|maximalist]] philosophical program, to absolute [[metaphysics]], to [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|syntheses]], to great [[system]]s, to [[reform]] of the world through philosophy; and broke with [[positivism]], the doctrines of the Enlightenment, and the precepts of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish metaphysical blossoming occurred between the [[November Uprising|November 1830]] and [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprisings]], and stemmed from the spiritual aspirations of a politically humiliated people.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/&gt;

The Poles' metaphysic, though drawing on [[Germany|German]] [[Idealism]], differed considerably from it; it was [[Spiritualist]] rather than Idealist.  It was characterized by a [[theistic]] belief in a personal [[God]], in the immortality of [[soul]]s, and in the superiority of spiritual over corporeal forces.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/&gt;

The Polish metaphysic saw the mission of philosophy not only in the search for [[truth]], but in the [[reform]]ation of life and in the [[salvation]] of mankind.  It was permeated with a faith in the metaphysical import of the [[nation]] and convinced that man could fulfill his [[vocation]] only within the communion of [[spirit]]s that was the nation, that nations determined the evolution of mankind, and more particularly that the Polish nation had been assigned the role of [[Messiah]] to the nations.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/&gt;

These three traits—the founding of a [[metaphysic]] on the concept of the [[soul]] and on the concept of the [[nation]], and the assignment to the latter of [[reform]]ative-[[soteriological]] tasks—distinguished the Polish metaphysicians.  Some, such as [[Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński|Hoene-Wroński]], saw the Messiah in [[philosophy]] itself; others, such as the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]], saw Him in the [[Polish nation]].  Hence Hoene-Wroński, and later Mickiewicz, adopted for their doctrines the name, "[[Messianism]]".  It came to apply generically to Polish metaphysics of the nineteenth century, much as the term "[[Idealism]]" does to [[Germany|German]] metaphysics.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the nineteenth century there appeared in Poland a host of metaphysicians unanimous as to these basic precepts, if strikingly at variance as to details.  Their only center was [[Paris]], which hosted [[Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński]] (1778–1853).  Otherwise they lived in isolation: [[Bronisław Trentowski]] (1808–69) in [[Germany]]; [[Józef Gołuchowski]] (1797–1858) in [[Congress Poland]]; [[August Cieszkowski]] (1814–94) and [[Karol Libelt]] (1807–75) in [[Wielkopolska]] (western Poland); [[Józef Kremer]] (1806–75) in [[Kraków]].  Most of them became active only after the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important role in the Messianist movement was also played by the Polish [[Romantic poet]]s, [[Adam Mickiewicz]] (1798–1855), [[Juliusz Słowacki]] (1809–49) and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]] (1812–59), as well as by religious activists such as [[Andrzej Towiański]] (1799–1878).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18"/&gt;

Between the [[philosopher]]s and the [[poet]]s, the method of reasoning, and often the results, differed.  The poets desired to create a specifically ''Polish'' philosophy, the philosophers—an absolute ''universal'' philosophy.  The Messianist philosophers knew contemporary European philosophy and drew from it; the poets created more of a home-grown metaphysic.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important difference among the Messianists was that some were [[rationalist]]s, others—[[mysticism|mystics]].  Wroński's philosophy was no less rationalist than [[Hegel]]'s, while the poets voiced a mystical philosophy.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18"/&gt;

The Messianists were not the only Polish philosophers active in the period between the 1830 and 1863 uprisings.  Much more widely known in Poland were [[Catholic]] thinkers such as Father [[Piotr Semenenko]] (1814–86), [[Florian Bochwic]] (1779–1856) and [[Eleonora Ziemięcka]] (1819–69), Poland's first woman philosopher.  The Catholic philosophy of the period was more widespread and fervent than profound or creative.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also active were pure [[Hegelian]]s such as [[Tytus Szczeniowski]] (1808–80) and leftist Hegelians such as [[Edward Dembowski]] (1822–46).&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

An outstanding representative of the philosophy of Common Sense, [[Michał Wiszniewski]] (1794–1865), had studied at that Enlightenment bastion, [[Krzemieniec]]; in 1820, in [[France]], he had attended the lectures of [[Victor Cousin]]; and in 1821, in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], he had met the head of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]] at the time, [[Dugald Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Active as well were [[wikt:Precursor|precursors]] of [[Positivism]] such as [[Józef Supiński]] (1804–93) and [[Dominik Szulc]] (1797–1860)—links between the earlier Enlightenment age of the brothers Śniadecki and the coming age of [[Positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Positivism==

The [[Positivism|Positivist]] philosophy that took form in Poland after the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] was hardly identical with the philosophy of [[Auguste Comte]].  It was in fact a return to the line of [[Jan Śniadecki]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]]—a line that had remained unbroken even during the Messianist period—now enriched with the ideas of Comte.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 176"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it belonged only partly to [[philosophy]].  It combined Comte's ideas with those of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], for it was interested in what was common to them all:  a sober, [[empirical]] attitude to life.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish Positivism was a reaction against philosophical speculation, but also against [[romanticism]] in poetry and [[idealism]] in politics.  It was less a scholarly movement than [[literature|literary]], [[politics|political]] and [[society|social]].  Few original books were published, but many were translated from the philosophical literature of the West—not Comte himself, but easier writers: [[Hippolyte Taine]], Mill, Spencer, [[Alexander Bain]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the Germans [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Friedrich Albert Lange]], the Danish philosopher [[Höffding]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 176"/&gt;

The disastrous outcome of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] had produced a distrust of romanticism, an aversion to ideals and illusions, and turned the search for redemption toward sober thought and work directed at realistic goals.  The watchword became "organic work"—a term for the campaign for economic improvement, which was regarded as a prime requisite for progress.  Poles prepared for such work by studying the [[natural sciences]] and [[economics]]:  they absorbed [[Charles Darwin]]'s biological theories, Mill's [[economic]] theories, [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s [[determinism|deterministic]] theory of [[civilization]].  At length they became aware of the connection between their own convictions and aims and the [[Positivism|Positivist]] philosophy of [[Auguste Comte]], and borrowed its name and watchwords.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PiotrChmielowski.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Piotr Chmielowski|Chmielowski]]]]
This movement, which had begun still earlier in [[Austria]]n-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], became concentrated with time in the [[Russia]]n-ruled [[Congress Poland]] centered about [[Warsaw]] and is therefore commonly known as the "Warsaw Positivism."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its chief venue was the Warsaw ''Przegląd Tygodniowy'' (Weekly Review);&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177"/&gt; [[Warsaw University]] (the "Main School") had been closed by the [[Russia]]ns in 1869.

The pioneers of the Warsaw Positivism were [[natural scientist]]s and [[physician]]s rather than philosophers, and still more so [[journalist]]s and [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]]: [[Aleksander Świętochowski]] (1849–1938), [[Piotr Chmielowski]] (1848–1904), [[Adolf Dygasiński]] (1839–1902),&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolesław Prus]] (1847–1912).  Prus developed an original [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]]-inspired [[ethics|ethical]] system in his book, ''[[s:The Most General Life Ideals|The Most General Life Ideals]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Edward Pieścikowski, ''Bolesław Prus'', pp. 138–39.&lt;/ref&gt; his 1873 public lecture "[[s:On Discoveries and Inventions|On Discoveries and Inventions]]", subsequently printed as a pamphlet, is a remarkably prescient contribution to what would, in the following century, become the field of [[logology (science of science)#Discoveries and inventions|logology ("the science of science")]].
[[File:Adam_Mahrburg_frotispice.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Adam Mahrburg]]]]
The movement's leader was [[Bolesław Prus|Prus]]' friend, [[Julian Ochorowicz]] (1850–1917), a trained philosopher with a doctorate from the [[University of Leipzig]].  In 1872 he wrote:  "We shall call a Positivist, anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177"/&gt;

The Warsaw Positivists—who included faithful [[Catholic]]s such as Father [[Franciszek Krupiński]] (1836–98)—formed a common front against Messianism together with the [[Neo-Kantian]]s.  The Polish [[Kantian]]s were rather loosely associated with Kant and belonged to the Positivist movement.  They included [[Władysław Mieczysław Kozłowski]] (1858–1935), [[Piotr Chmielowski]] (1848–1904) and [[Marian Massonius]] (1862–1945).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant philosophical mind in this period was [[Adam Mahrburg]] (1855–1913).  He was a [[Positivist]] in his understanding of philosophy as a discipline and in his uncompromising ferreting out of speculation, and a [[Kantian]] in his interpretation of mind and in his centering of philosophy upon the [[theory of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kraków]], Father [[Stefan Pawlicki]] (1839–1916), professor of philosophy at the [[University of Kraków]], was a man of broad culture and philosophical bent, but lacked talent for writing or teaching.  Under his thirty-plus-year tenure, Kraków philosophy became mainly a historical discipline, alien to what was happening in the West and in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
Even before Poland regained independence at the end of [[World War I]], her intellectual life continued to develop.  This was the case particularly in [[Russia]]n-ruled [[Warsaw]], where in lieu of underground lectures and secret scholarly organizations a ''[[Wolna Wszechnica Polska]]'' (Free Polish University) was created in 1905 and the tireless [[Władysław Weryho]] (1868–1916) had in 1898 founded Poland's first philosophical journal, ''Przegląd Filozoficzny'' (The Philosophical Review), and in 1904 a Philosophical Society.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 356"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 Weryho founded a Psychological Society, and subsequently Psychological and Philosophical Institutes.  About 1910 the small number of professionally trained philosophers increased sharply, as individuals returned who had been inspired by Mahrburg's underground lectures to study philosophy in [[Austria]]n-ruled [[Lwów]] and [[Kraków]] or abroad.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 356"/&gt;
[[File:Kazimierz Twardowski 1933.jpg|thumb|left|70px|[[Kazimierz Twardowski]]]]
[[File:Leon Petrazycki ii.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Leon Petrażycki]]]]
[[Kraków]] as well, especially after 1910, saw a quickening of the philosophical movement, particularly at the [[Polish Academy of Learning]], where at the prompting of [[Władysław Heinrich]] there came into being in 1911 a Committee for the History of Polish Philosophy and there was an immense growth in the number of philosophical papers and publications, no longer only of a [[historical]] character.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Lwów]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938) from 1895 stimulated a lively philosophical movement, in 1904 founded the [[Polish Philosophical Society]],&lt;ref&gt;"Twardowski, Kazimierz," ''Encyklopedia powszechna PWN'', vol. 4, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1911 began publication of ''[[Ruch Filozoficzny]]'' (The Philosophical Movement).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27"/&gt;

There was growing interest in western philosophical currents, and much discussion of [[Pragmatism]] and [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[Henri Poincaré]]'s [[Conventionalism]], [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], the [[Marburg School]], and the [[social science|social-science]] [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Heinrich Rickert]].  At the same time, original ideas developed on Polish soil.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27"/&gt;

[[File:Władysław Tatarkiewicz.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]]]]
Those who distinguished themselves in Polish philosophy in these pre-[[World War I]] years of the twentieth century, formed two groups.

One group developed apart from [[higher education|institutions of higher learning]] and [[learned societies]], and appealed less to trained philosophers than to broader circles, which it (if but briefly) captured.  It constituted a reaction against the preceding period of [[Positivism]], and included [[Stanisław Brzozowski (writer)|Stanisław Brzozowski]] (1878–1911), [[Wincenty Lutosławski]] (1863–1954) and, to a degree, [[Edward Abramowski]] (1868–1918).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group of philosophers who started off Polish philosophy in the twentieth century had an [[academic]] character.  They included [[Władysław Heinrich]] (1869–1957) in [[Kraków]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938) in [[Lwów]], and [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867–1931) abroad—all three, active members of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]].  Despite the considerable differences among them, they shared some basic features:  all three were [[empiricist]]s concerned not with metaphysics but with the foundations of philosophy; they were interested in philosophy itself, not merely its history; they understood philosophy in positive terms, but none of them was a Positivist in the old style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the restoration of Poland's independence in 1918, the two older universities ([[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]], [[Lwów University]]) were joined by four new ones ([[Warsaw University]], [[Poznań University]], [[Wilno University]], [[Lublin University]]).  New philosophical journals appeared; all the university cities formed philosophical associations; conventions of Polish philosophers were held; philosophy became more professional, academic, scholarly.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 363–64.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jan Łukasiewicz.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Jan Łukasiewicz]]]]
A characteristic of the [[interbellum]] was that [[maximalist]], metaphysical currents began to fade away.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dominant ambition in philosophical theory now was not breadth but [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].  This was a period of [[Academic specialization|specialization]], consistent with the conviction that general philosophy would not yield precise results such as could be obtained in [[logic]], [[psychology]] or the [[history of philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 366"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tadeusz Kotarbiński.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]]]]
[[File:Stanisław Leśniewski.jpg|thumb|right|75px|[[Stanisław Leśniewski]]]]
A few individuals did develop a general philosophical outlook:  notably, [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] (1886–1981), [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]] (1885–1939), and [[Roman Ingarden]] (1893–1970).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, however, [[Academic specialization|specialization]] was the rule.  The Kraków school, true to tradition, showed an eminently historical character and produced a [[medievalist]] of world renown, Father [[Konstanty Michalski]] (1879–1947).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lwów school concentrated on the analysis of [[concept]]s; and in doing so, it considered both their aspects, the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]—hence, the [[psychological]] and the [[logical]].  Twardowski himself continued working at the border of psychology and logic; his pupils, however, generally split in their interests, specializing in either psychology or logic.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 366"/&gt;

The [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] program that Twardowski passed on to his pupils, and which they in turn spread throughout Poland, was affined to that of [[Franz Brentano]]'s school (Twardowski's ''[[alma mater]]'') in [[Austria]] and to that of the [[Great Britain|British]] [[analytic philosophy|analytic school]], which likewise had arisen as a reaction against [[Speculative philosophy|speculative]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[alumni]] of the Lwów school entered three distinct fields.  Some devoted themselves to [[psychology]]: [[Stefan Błachowski]] (1889–1962), professor at [[Poznań]], entirely; [[Władysław Witwicki]] (1878–1948), professor at [[Warsaw]], partly.  Others pursued the [[theory of knowledge]]:  they included [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] (1890–1963), professor at [[Lwów]], and after [[World War II]] at [[Poznań]], whose views resembled [[Neopositivism]] and who developed an original theory of radical [[Conventionalism]].  The third group worked in [[mathematical logic|mathematical, or symbolic, logic]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/&gt;
[[File:AlfredTarski1968.jpeg|thumb|left|120px|[[Alfred Tarski]]]]
The most important center for mathematical logic was Warsaw.  The Warsaw school of logic was headed by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1878–1956) and [[Stanisław Leśniewski]] (1886–1939), professors at [[Warsaw University]].  The first of their pupils to achieve eminence, even before [[World War II]], was [[Alfred Tarski]] (1902–83),&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/&gt; from 1939 in the [[United States]], where he became a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Another pupil of Łukasiewicz, Bolesław Sobociński (28 June 1906 – 31 October 1980), became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Notre Dame]].  The Warsaw logic gained a worldwide importance similar to that of the Kraków [[medievalism]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/&gt;
[[File:Konstanty Michalski.png|thumb|left|100px|[[Konstanty Michalski]]]]
Warsaw was not, however, the sole Polish venue for logic studies.  They were initiated at [[Kraków]] by [[Ivan Śleszyński]] (''aka'' Jan Śleszyński, ''aka'' Ivan Vladislavovich Sleshinsky; 23 July 1854 – 9 March 1931), professor of mathematics and logic.  At Kraków also, and later at [[Lwów]], logic studies were conducted by [[Leon Chwistek]] (1884–1944), a multi-faceted and somewhat eccentric thinker—mathematician, philosopher, [[esthetics|esthetician]], painter—whose name came to be associated popularly with his concept of "plural realities."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Florian Znaniecki.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Florian Znaniecki]]]] 

After [[Leon Petrażycki|Petrażycki]]'s death, the outstanding [[legal]] philosopher was [[Czesław Znamierowski]] (1888–1967), professor of philosophy at Poznań.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 367–68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another leading thinker of the period, active on the borderlines of [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]], in both [[Poland]] and the [[United States]], was [[Florian Znaniecki]] (1882–1958).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[interbellum]], the philosopher members of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] included [[Władysław Heinrich]] (1869–1957; Kraków), [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938; Lwów), [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867–1931; Warsaw), and, from the following generation: [[Konstanty Michalski]] (1879–1947), [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1878–1956), and [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886–1980).  Michalski's historical works revolutionized prevailing views on ''via moderna'' in late [[medieval philosophy]].  Łukasiewicz gained world fame with his concept of [[many-valued logic]] and is known for his "[[Polish notation]]."  Tatarkiewicz was the first to prepare in [[Polish language|Polish]] a large-scale comprehensive history of [[western philosophy]] and a ''History of Aesthetics'' and worked at systematizing the [[concept]]s of [[aesthetics]] and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[Roman Ingarden]] (1893–1970), [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] (1886–1981), and [[Alfred Tarski]] became members of the Academy.&lt;ref name="Zarys. p. 32"/&gt;
[[File:Leszek Kolakowski 1971.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Leszek Kołakowski]]]]
For some four decades following World War II, in Poland, a disproportionately prominent official role was given to [[Marxist philosophy]].  This, and contemporaneous sociopolitical currents, stimulated [[Leszek Kołakowski]] (1927–2009), writing in [[exile]], to publish influential critiques of [[Marxist]] theory and [[communist]] practice.  Kołakowski also wrote a remarkable history of ''Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leszek Kołakowski]], ''Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle'', Penguin Books, 1972, ASIN B000OIXO7E.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jan-wolenski-2009.jpg|thumb|left|thumb|170px|[[Jan Woleński]]]]
Similarly notable for his critiques of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Marxism]] was [[Józef Maria Bocheński]] (1902–95), [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]], a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] philosopher of the [[Dominican Order]] who lectured in [[Rome]] at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]] (the ''Angelicum'') and at the [[University of Fribourg]] in [[Switzerland]]. Bocheński also gained renown for his work in [[logic]] and [[ethics]].

Other Polish philosophers of the postwar period included [[:pl:Andrzej Zabłudowski|Andrzej Zabłudowski]] (1938–2008), a logician and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] of world influence, especially in the theory of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], working at Warsaw University except for a three-decade hiatus beginning in 1968; [[Marek Siemek]] (1942–2011), a historian of [[Germany|German]] [[Transcendental Philosophy|transcendental philosophy]] and recipient of an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Bonn University]]; and [[Jan Woleński]] (born 1940), a broadly erudite thinker at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], specializing in the history of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lwów-Warsaw school]] and in [[analytic philosophy]] and widely recognized in Poland as an [[atheism|atheist]] and exponent of replacing religion classes in Polish schools with philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDgWy_9GqwU|title=Laureat Nagrody FNP w obszarze nauk humanistycznych i społecznych, prof.

A '''philosophical interpretation''' is the assignment of meanings to various concepts, symbols, or [[wikt:object|objects]] under consideration. Two broad types of interpretation can be distinguished: interpretations of physical objects, and interpretations of concepts ([[Conceptual model]]).

== Conceptual interpretations ==

=== Aesthetic interpretation ===
{{Main|Aesthetic interpretation}}

Interpretation is related to perceiving the things. An [[aesthetic]] interpretation is an explanation of the [[meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] of some work of art. An aesthetic interpretation expresses an understanding of a work of art, a poem, performance, or piece of literature. There may be different interpretations to same work by art by different people owing to their different perceptions or aims. All such interpretations are termed as 'aesthetic interpretations'. Some people, instead of interpreting work of art, believe in interpreting artist himself. It pretty much means "how or what do I believe about (subject)"&lt;ref&gt;http://classof1.com/homework_answers/philosophy/aesthetics_interpretation/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial interpretation ===
{{Main|Judicial interpretation|Textualism|Strict constructionism|5=Originalism|6=Prudentialism }}

A judicial interpretation is a conceptual interpretation that explains how the judiciary should interpret the law, particularly [[constitution]]al documents and [[legislation]] (see [[statutory interpretation]]).

=== Logical interpretation ===
{{Main|Logical interpretation}}

In [[logic]], an interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the [[Symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a language. The [[formal languages]] used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called ''formal semantics''.

=== Religious interpretation ===
{{Main|Religious interpretation}}

Religious interpretation and similarly religious self-interpretation define a section of religion-related studies (theology, comparative religion, reason) where attention is given to aspects of perception—where religious symbolism and the self-image of all those who hold religious views have important bearing on how others perceive their particular belief system and its adherents.

== Scientific interpretation ==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}

=== Descriptive interpretation ===
{{Main|Descriptive interpretation}}

An interpretation is a ''descriptive interpretation'' (also called a ''factual interpretation'') if at least one of the undefined symbols of its formal system becomes, in the interpretation, the name of a physical object, or observable property. A descriptive interpretation is a type of interpretation used in science and logic to talk about empirical entities.

=== Scientific model ===
{{Main|Scientific modeling}}

When scientists attempt to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences, they use an interpretation to [[Scientific model|model reality]], in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic. The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system that will serve as a conceptual model of reality. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">'''Jean Trembley''' (1749 &amp;ndash; September 18, 1811), born at [[Geneva]], contributed to the development of [[differential equation]]s, [[finite difference]]s, and the [[Probability theory|calculus of probabilities]]. He was also active in philosophy, astronomy and psychology.

Nephew of the naturalist [[Abraham Trembley]], Jean Trembley first studied law in Geneva, before turning to astronomy under the direction of Jacques-André Mallet, director of the Geneva Observatory. He also traveled in the Alps with [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] and made with him his doctoral dissertation on the theory of generation (1767). In it, he advocated the views of [[Charles Bonnet]], whose disciple he always pretended to be in the fields of philosophy and psychology.&lt;ref&gt; Fernando Vidal, « Psychologie empirique et méthodologie des sciences au siècle des Lumières. L'exemple de Jean Trembley », "Archives des Sciences", 57, 2004, pp. 15-35&lt;/ref&gt;

He made part of his career in Berlin, where he was a member of the Prussian Academy of Science and Letters. 

He published 30 articles in the ''Mémoires de l'Académie de Berlin'' and a few others in Bode's ''Jahrbuch'' and in other periodicals. 

He was a correspondent of the Paris Academy of Sciences (1784), later Institute of France (1804), an honorary member of the Imperial Academy of Russia in St. Petersburg (1793), and a member of the Berlin Academy of Prussia (1794; honorary member in 1807).

'''John Constance Parnis''' (1695–1735) was a major Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in [[metaphysics]], [[physics]], and [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Parnis was born at [[Mdina]], [[Malta]], in 1695. He began studying philosophy before he joined the [[Franciscans]]. His name at that time was John Baptist, and between 1712 and 1715 he followed courses given by [[Constance Vella]] at the [[Franciscans]]’ College of Philosophy and Literature at [[Rabat, Malta]].

Subsequently, he joined the [[Franciscans]] in 1715, and followed his initial institutional studies with them. After his ordination to the priesthood, he began teaching theology at the ''Studium Generale'' which the [[Franciscans]] had at [[Naples]], [[Italy]]. During this time, Parnis was also appointed the Royal Theologian to the Viceroy of [[Sicily]].

At 35 years of age, in 1730, Parnis was elected Provincial Minister (or general superior) of his religious order for [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]]. While residing in [[Malta]], he taught at the College of Philosophy and Literature at [[Rabat, Malta]]. This was between 1723 and 1725.

He probably spent his last ten years in [[Malta]], and died here.

==Extant work==
===Composition===
It seems that only one major work of Parnis survived. This is the '''''Amalthéa Aristotelico-Scoticos''''' (A Compendium of Aristotelian-Scotist Philosophy), and still exists in manuscript form at the [[Franciscan]] Archive in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]] (''unmarked'').&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', vol. I, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was composed during the 1723/24 academic year (and finalised on February 19, 1724). It is a very elaborate composition made up of 394 back-to-back folios, and written in Parnis’ charming calligraphy.

The work is divided in three main parts. They respectively deal with logic, physics, and metaphysics. Though they contain a philosophy according to [[Scholasticism]] and [[Aristotelianism]], all of them take the perspective of [[John Duns Scotus]].

===Appreciation===
All parts are dealt with by Parnis is great detail. His philosophical explanations are long, meticulous and comprehensive. Despite the fact that he divides his work in a traditional manner – that is, in Disputations, Questions, and Treatises – Parnis does not limit his comments with any conventional modes of analysis. Throughout the whole work, in fact, Parnis expressly states his own opinion, and contrasts it with those of classical and contemporary philosophers.

Since the massive work has never been transcribed and much less translated to any modern language, its teachings have not been studied professionally.

'''John Cook Wilson''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (6 June 1849 – 11 August 1915) was a British philosopher.

==Biography==
Cook was born in [[Nottingham]], United Kingdom, the only son of a Methodist minister. After [[Derby Grammar School]], 1862–7, Wilson went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1868, where he read both Classics and Mathematics. He graduated with a rare double double-first: gaining a 1st in Mathematical Moderations, 1869, 1st in Classical Moderations, 1870, 1st in Mathematics finals, 1871, and a 1st in Literae Humaniores ('Greats') in 1872. (He was, along with [[H. A. Prichard]], one of Oxford's few early twentieth-century philosophers, to have a mathematical background.) Wilson became a Fellow of [[Oriel College, Oxford]] in 1874. He was [[Wykeham Professor of Logic]] and a Fellow of [[New College, Oxford]], from 1889 until his death. [[H. A. Prichard]] and [[W. D. Ross]] were among his students.

Mathematics, he said, is the best preparation for logic (''Statement and Inference'', I : xxxviii). There is an amusing story of how he introduced calculus in a lecture to classically trained undergraduates. At the end of the lecture 'he walked smartly to the door, locked, or pretended to lock, it, and then standing there with his back to it said with decision : 'No one shall leave this room until you all grasp the essentials of this simple matter' (''Statement and Inference'', I : xv). He had, however, little sympathy with the mathematical logic developed by [[Bertrand Russell]].

Belonging to a generation brought up in the atmosphere of [[British idealism]], he espoused the cause of [[direct realism]]. His posthumous collected papers, ''Statement and Inference'', were influential on a generation of [[Oxford]] philosophers, including [[H. H. Price]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]]. He also features prominently in the work of [[J.L. Austin]], [[John McDowell]], and [[Timothy Williamson]]. [[P.F. Strawson]]'s expression, 'the attributive tie', in ''[[Individuals]]'' (1959, 168) is named 'in memory of Cook Wilson'.

In his inaugural lecture Cook Wilson acknowledged that his deepest intellectual debts were to his mathematics tutor at Balliol, Henry Smith, to his Balliol philosophy tutor, T. H. Green, and to the classicist Henry Chandler.

Cook Wilson often argued for the existence of God as an experiential reality. He is quoted saying 'We don't want merely inferred friends, could we be satisfied with an inferred God?' He also had a long running dispute with [[Lewis Carroll]] over the [[Barbershop paradox|Barber Shop Paradox]].

Cook Wilson's classical contributions should not be overlooked : 'On rearrangements of the Fifth Books of the Ethics' (1879), 'On the Structure of the Seventh Book of the Nicomachean Ethics, ch. i – x (1879); 'On the Interpretation of Plato's Timaeus' (1889); 'On the Geometrical Problem in Plato's ''Meno''' (1903) and others listed at lxvi–lxxii of ''Statement and Inference'', I. The latest discussion of Cook Wilson's classical work – on the ''Meno'' – is to be found in David Wolfsdorf, ''Trials of Reason'' (Oxford, 2008, 164–9, 172).

Cook Wilson married a German woman, Charlotte Schneider, in 1876.  They had no children.

The '''Kalām cosmological argument''' is a modern formulation of the [[cosmological argument]] for the [[existence of God]]; named for the ''[[kalam]]'' (medieval Islamic scholasticism), it was popularized by  [[William Lane Craig]] in his  ''[[The Kalām Cosmological Argument]]'' (1979).
The argument is a variant of the [[unmoved mover]] in [[Aristotelianism]]; it is named for medieval Islamic scholasticism because Craig, arguing against the possibility of the existence of [[actual infinities]], traced the idea to 11th-century philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]]. 
 
Since Craig's original publication, the  Kalam cosmological argument has elicited public debate between Craig and [[Graham Oppy]], [[Adolf Grünbaum]], [[J. L. Mackie]] and [[Quentin Smith]], and has been used in [[Christian apologetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham Smith, “Arguing about the Kalam Cosmological Argument,” Philo, 5(1), 2002: 34–61. See also: [[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], the cosmological arguments presented by Craig, Bruce Reichenbach, and [[Richard Swinburne]] are "among the most sophisticated and well argued in contemporary theological philosophy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 101&lt;/ref&gt; while also noting that, in reference to Craig's argument specifically, "there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Kalam argument's underpinning is the impossibility of an actual infinite, which is what distinguishes it from other cosmological arguments such as [[Five Ways (Aquinas)|that of Thomas Aquinas]], which rests on the impossibility of an essentially ordered infinite regress, and that of Leibniz and Clark, which uses the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 October 2017 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#TypoCosmArgu |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form of the argument==

Craig states the Kalam cosmological argument as a brief [[syllogism]], most commonly rendered as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Whatever begins to exist has a cause;
#The universe began to exist;
#:''Therefore'':
#The universe has a cause.

From the conclusion of the initial syllogism, he appends a further premise and conclusion based upon [[ontological]] analysis of the properties of the cause:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 194&lt;/ref&gt;
#The universe has a cause;
#If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful;
#:''Therefore'':
#An uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists, who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and infinitely powerful.

Referring to the implications of [[Classical Theism]] that follow from this argument, Craig writes:

:"... transcending the entire universe there exists a cause which brought the universe into being ''[[ex nihilo]]'' ... our whole universe was caused to exist by something beyond it and greater than it. For it is no secret that one of the most important conceptions of what theists mean by 'God' is Creator of heaven and earth."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgKC|Craig, 2000]]: 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
{{off topic|date=September 2014}}
The Kalam cosmological argument is based on the concept of the [[unmoved mover|prime-mover]], introduced by [[Aristotle]], and entered early Christian or Neoplatonist philosophy  in Late Antiquity, being developed by [[John Philoponus]].&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, S., ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Its History Since 1955'' (2010), Humanities-Ebooks, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with much of classical Greek philosophy, the concept was adopted into medieval Islamic tradition, where it received its fullest articulation at the hands of Muslim scholars, most directly by Islamic theologians of the [[Sunni]] tradition.

Its historic proponents include [[Al-Kindi]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Kindi]], On First Philosophy, with an Introduction and Commentary by Alfred L. Ivry (Albany, N. Y.: State University of New York Press, 1974), pp. 67–75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]],&lt;ref&gt;al Ghazali, Kitab al lqtisad, with a foreword by Î. A. Çubukçu and H. Atay (Ankara: University of Ankara Press, 1962), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bonaventure|St. Bonaventure]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Kovach, 'The Question of the Eternity of the World in St. Bonaventure and St. Thomas – A Critical Analysis', Southwestern Journal of Philosophy 5 (1974), pp. 141–172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#smith|Smith, 2007]]: 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgKC|Craig, 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest formulations of the cosmological argument in Islamic tradition comes from Al-Kindi (9th century), who was one of the first Islamic philosophers to attempt to introduce an argument for the existence of God based upon purely empirical premises. His chief contribution is the cosmological argument (dalil al-huduth) for the existence of God, in his work "On First Philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, trans. Seyyed Hossein, An introduction to Islamic cosmological doctrines. Albany : State University of New York Press, 1993 pp. 168&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:

:"Every being which begins has a cause for its beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it possesses a cause for its beginning."&lt;ref name="Craig, 1994: 80"&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1994]]: 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 9th to 12th centuries, the cosmological argument developed as a concept within Islamic theology. 
It was refined in the 11th century by Al-Ghazali (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), and in the 12th by [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes).&lt;ref&gt;Averroes, Ibn Rushd, The Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-Tahafut) London:Luzac, 1954, pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt; It reached medieval Christian philosophy in the 13th century, and was discussed by Bonaventure, as well as [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (I, q.2, a.3) and ''[[Summa Contra Gentiles]]'' (I, 13).

Islamic perspectives may be divided into positive Aristotelian responses strongly supporting the argument, such as those by Al-Kindi, and [[Averroes]], and negative responses critical of it, including those by Al-Ghazali and [[Muhammad Iqbal]].&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal, Muhammad The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam Lahore:Institute of Islamic Culture, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Ghazali was unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Al-Kindi, arguing that only the infinite ''per se'' is impossible, arguing for the possibility of the infinite ''per accidens''. He writes:

:"According to the hypothesis under consideration, it has been established that all the beings in the world have a cause. Now, let the cause itself have a cause, and the cause of the cause have yet another cause, and so on ad infinitum. It does not behove you to say that an infinite regress of causes is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ghazzali, Tahafut Al-Falasifah (The Incoherence of Philosophers), translated by Sabih Ahmad Kamali. Lahore: Pakistan Philosophical Congress, 1963 pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Iqbal]] also stated:

:"A finite effect can give only a finite cause, or at most an infinite series of such causes. To finish the series at a certain point, and to elevate one member of the series to the dignity of an un-caused first cause, is to set at naught the very law of causation on which the whole argument proceeds."

==Modern debate==

According to atheist philosopher [[Quentin Smith]], "a count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig’s defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher’s contemporary formulation of an argument for God’s existence."&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Smith, "Kalam Cosmological Arguments for Atheism", in Michael Martin (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalam cosmological argument has received criticism from philosophers such as [[J. L. Mackie]], [[Graham Oppy]], [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], Quentin Smith, physicists [[Paul Davies]], [[Lawrence Krauss]] and [[Victor Stenger]], and authors such as [[Dan Barker]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 4.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern discourse encompasses the fields of both philosophy and science ([[quantum physics]] and [[cosmology]]), which Bruce Reichenbach summarises as:
:"... whether there needs to be a cause of the first natural existent, whether something like the universe can be finite and yet not have a beginning, and the nature of infinities and their connection with reality".&lt;ref&gt;[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] stated in [[The God Delusion]] when referring to cosmological arguments "The five ‘proofs’ asserted by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century don’t prove anything, and are easily—though I hesitate to say so, given his eminence—exposed as vacuous. The first three are just different ways of saying the same thing, and they can be considered together. All involve an [[infinite regress]]—the answer to a question raises a prior question, and so on ad infinitum.
:1. The Unmoved Mover. Nothing moves without a prior mover. This leads us to a regress, from which the only escape is God. Something had to make the first move, and that something we call God.
:2. The Uncaused Cause. Nothing is caused by itself. Every effect has a prior cause, and again we are pushed back into regress. This has to be terminated by a first cause, which we call God.
:3. The Cosmological Argument. There must have been a time when no physical things existed. But, since physical things exist now, there must have been something non-physical to bring them into existence, and that something we call God.
All three of these arguments rely upon the idea of a regress and invoke God to terminate it. They make the entirely unwarranted assumption that God himself is immune to the regress. Even if we allow the dubious luxury of arbitrarily conjuring up a terminator to an infinite regress and giving it a name, simply because we need one, there is absolutely no reason to endow that terminator with any of the properties normally ascribed to God: omnipotence, omniscience, goodness, creativity of design, to say nothing of such human attributes as listening to prayers, forgiving sins and reading innermost thoughts." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The God Delusion|first=Richard|last=Dawkins|date=16 January 2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premise one: "Whatever begins to exist has a cause."===

Craig defends the first premise as follows:&lt;ref name="Craig, 1994: 92"&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1994]]: 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 182-190&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Innatism|Rational intuition]]: He states that the first premise is [[axiom|self-evidently]] true, being based upon the  [[causality|Causal Principle]] that "something cannot come into being from nothing", or [[Nothing comes from nothing|"Ex nihilo nihil fit"]], originating from [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] philosophy. He attests that this is a crucial [[first principle]] of science.
#[[Reductio ad absurdum]]: If false, it would be inexplicable why anything and everything does not randomly appear into existence without a cause.
#[[Inductive reasoning]] from both common experience and scientific evidence, which constantly verifies and never falsifies the truth of the first premise.

According to Reichenbach, "the Causal Principle has been the subject of extended criticism", which can be divided into philosophical and scientific criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 5.1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophical objections====

[[Graham Oppy]], [[J. L. Mackie]] and Wes Morriston have objected to the intuitiveness of the first premise.&lt;ref&gt;Oppy G (2002). Arguing About The Kalam Cosmological Argument. Philo 5 (1):34-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mack|Mackie, 1982]]: 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morriston W (2002). Causes and Beginnings in the Kalam Argument. Faith and philosophy, 19(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Oppy states:

:"Mackie, [Adolf] Grunbaum, [Quentin] Smith and I  —among many others— have taken issue with the first premise: why should it be supposed that absolutely everything which begins to exist has a cause for its beginning to exist?"

Mackie affirms that there is no good reason to assume ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' that an uncaused beginning of all things is impossible. Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience. He appeals to [[David Hume]]'s thesis (''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'') that effects without causes can be conceived in the mind, and that what is conceivable in the mind is possible in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mack|Mackie, 1982]]: 85&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been criticised by Bruce Reichenbach and [[G.E.M. Anscombe]], who point out the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and logical problems in inferring factual possibility from conceivability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]: 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.E.M. Anscombe, '"Whatever has a beginning of existence must have a cause": Hume's argument exposed', Analysis XXXIV (1974), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig notes:

:"Hume himself clearly believed in the causal principle. He presupposes throughout the Enquiry that events have causes, and in 1754 he wrote to John Stewart, 'But allow me to tell you that I never asserted so absurd a Proposition as that anything might arise without a cause'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/professor-mackie-and-the-kalam-cosmological-argument Professor Mackie and the Kalam Cosmological Argument], William Lane Craig&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Hume to John Stewart, February 1754, in The Letters of David Hume, 2 vols., ed. J. T. Grieg (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1932), 1, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Morriston asserts that causal laws are physical processes for which we have intuitive knowledge in the context of events within time and space, but that such intuitions do not hold true for the beginning of time itself. He states:

:"We have no experience of the origin of worlds to tell us that worlds don't come into existence like that. We don't even have experience of the coming into being of anything remotely analogous to the “initial singularity” that figures in the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Morriston W (2000). Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause? A Critical Examination of the Kalam Cosmological Argument. Faith and Philosophy, 17:149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reply, Craig has maintained that causal laws are unrestricted metaphysical truths that are "not contingent upon the properties, causal powers, and dispositions of the natural kinds of substances which happen to exist", remarking that:

:"The history of twentieth century astrophysical cosmology belies Morriston's claim that people have no strong intuitions about the need of a causal explanation of the origin of time and the universe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/must-the-beginning-of-the-universe-have-a-personal-cause-a-rejoinder Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause?: A Rejoinder], William Lane Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the first premise, Andrew Loke reasons that if something (e.g. universe=physical reality as a whole) begins to exist without any antecedent necessary condition whatsoever, then many other kinds of things which can begin to exist within our universe would also begin to exist within our universe without antecedent condition, because (i) there would not be any antecedent condition which would make it the case that only universes (rather than these other kinds of things) begins to exist, and (ii) the properties of universes and the properties of other kinds of things which differentiate between them would be had by them only when they had already begun to exist. In that case our universe would have been very different.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Andrew2017|Andrew Loke, &lt;em&gt;God and Ultimate Origins&lt;/em&gt; (Cham: Springer International, 2017), viii-ix, 138-153]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quantum physics====

A common objection to premise one appeals to the phenomenon of [[quantum indeterminacy]], where, at the subatomic level, the [[causality|causal principle]] appears to break down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Superforce|edition= |last= Davies|first= Paul|year= 1982|publisher= Clarendon Press|location= Oxford|isbn= |page= 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig replies that the phenomenon of indeterminism is specific to the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] of [[Quantum Mechanics]], pointing out that this is only one of a number of different interpretations, some of which he states are fully deterministic (mentioning [[David Bohm]]) and none of which are as yet known to be true. He concludes that subatomic physics is not a proven exception to the first premise.&lt;ref&gt;Moreland, James Porter, and William Lane. Craig. Philosophical foundations for a Christian worldview. Downers Grove, Ill: InterVarsity P. 469&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Quentin Smith has cited the example of [[virtual particles]], which appear and disappear from observation, apparently at random, to assert the tenability of uncaused natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Q (1988), "The Uncaused Beginning of the Universe," Philosophy of Science 55:39-57.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing]]'', cosmologist Lawrence Krauss has proposed how quantum mechanics can explain how space-time and matter can emerge from "nothing" (referring to the quantum vacuum). Philosopher Michael Martin has also referred to quantum vacuum fluctuation models to support the idea of a universe with uncaused beginnings. He writes:

:"Even if the universe has a beginning in time, in the light of recently proposed cosmological theories this beginning may be uncaused. Despite Craig's claim that theories postulating that the universe 'could pop into existence uncaused' are incapable of 'sincere affirmation,' such similar theories are in fact being taken seriously by scientists."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 106. Martin lists the following sources as examples: Edward P. Tryon, "Is the Universe a Vacuum Fluctuation?" ''Nature'', 246, December 14, 1973, pp. 396–397; Edward P. Tryon, "What Made the World? ''New Scientist'', 8, March 1984, pp. 14–16; Alexander Vilenkin, "Creation of Universes from Nothing," ''Physics Letters'', 117B, 1982, pp. 25–28; Alexander Vilenkin, "Birth of Inflationary Universes," ''Physical Review'', 27, 1983, pp. 2848–2855; L. P. Grishchuck and Y. B. Zledovich, "Complete Cosmological Theories," ''The Quantum Structure of Space and Time'', ed. M. J. Duff and C. J. Isham (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 409–422; Quentin Smith, "The Uncaused Beginning of the Universe," ''Philosophy of Science'', 55, 1988, pp. 39–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher of science [[David Albert]] has criticised the use of the term "nothing" in describing the quantum vacuum. In a review of Krauss's book, he states:

:"Relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical vacuum states — no less than giraffes or refrigerators or solar systems — are particular arrangements of elementary physical stuff. The true relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical equivalent to there not being any physical stuff at all isn’t this or that particular arrangement of the fields — what it is (obviously, and ineluctably, and on the contrary) is the simple ''absence'' of the fields."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html?_r=0 On the Origin of Everything], David Albert, The New York Times, March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Craig also argued that the quantum vacuum, in containing quantifiable, measurable energy, cannot be described as "nothing", therefore, that phenomena originating from the quantum vacuum cannot be described as "uncaused". On the topic of virtual particles, he writes:

:"For virtual particles do not literally come into existence spontaneously out of nothing. Rather the energy locked up in a vacuum fluctuates spontaneously in such a way as to convert into evanescent particles that return almost immediately to the vacuum."&lt;ref&gt;"The Caused Beginning of the Universe: a Response to Quentin Smith." British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 44 (1993): 623-639.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premise two: "The universe began to exist."===

Craig justifies premise two using both physical arguments with evidence from cosmology and physics, and metaphysical arguments for the impossibility of [[actual infinities]] in reality.

====Cosmology and physics====

For physical evidence, Craig appeals to:

#Scientific confirmation against a past-infinite universe in the form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-existence-of-god-and-the-beginning-of-the-universe The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe], William Lane Craig&lt;/ref&gt;
#Scientific evidence that the universe began to exist a finite time ago at the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
#The [[Borde-Guth-Vilenkin Theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Borde, A. Guth and A. Vilenkin (2003). "Inflationary space-times are incomplete in past directions". Physical Review Letters 90 (15): 151301.&lt;/ref&gt; a cosmological theorem which deduces that any universe that has, on average, been expanding throughout its history cannot be infinite in the past but must have a past space-time boundary.

Professor [[Alexander Vilenkin]], one of the three authors of the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem, writes:

:"A remarkable thing about this theorem is its sweeping generality. We made no assumptions about the material content of the universe. We did not even assume that gravity is described by Einstein’s equations. So, if Einstein’s gravity requires some modification, our conclusion will still hold. The only assumption that we made was that the expansion rate of the universe never gets below some nonzero value, no matter how small."&lt;ref&gt;Vilenkin, A. (2007) Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor J. Stenger]] has referred to the Aguirre-Gratton model&lt;ref&gt;Aguirre A and Gratton S (2002). Steady-state eternal inflation; Phys. Rev. D 65, 083507&lt;/ref&gt; for [[eternal inflation]] as an exemplar by which others disagree with the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Victor J. Stenger. God and the Folly of Faith: The Incompatibility of Science and Religion. Prometheus Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In private correspondence with Stenger, Vilenkin remarked how the Aguirre-Gratton model attempts to evade a beginning by reversing the "arrow of time" at ''t = 0'', but that: "This makes the moment ''t = 0'' rather special. I would say no less special than a true beginning of the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Victor J. Stenger | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=h9BAXtVsfdcC | title = The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning: Why the Universe Is Not Designed for Us | orig-year = | agency =  | edition = | location = | year = 2011-04-15 | publisher = Prometheus Books| at = | volume = | issue = | pages = | page = 244 | series =  | isbn = 9781616144449| ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the "State of the Universe" conference at Cambridge University in January 2012, Vilenkin discussed problems with various theories that would claim to avoid the need for a cosmological beginning, alleging the untenability of eternal inflation, cyclic and cosmic egg models, eventually concluding: "All the evidence we have says that the universe had a beginning."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328474.400-why-physicists-cant-avoid-a-creation-event.html Why Physicists Can't Avoid A Creation Event], New Scientist 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://now.tufts.edu/articles/beginning-was-beginning In the Beginning Was the Beginning], Tufts Now 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Vilenkin said:

:"In quantum physics, events do not necessarily have a cause, just some probability. As such, there is some probability for the universe to pop out of 'nothing.' You can find the relative probability for it to be this size or that size and have various properties, but there will not be a particular cause for any of it, just probabilities. I say 'nothing' in quotations because the nothing that we were referring to here is the absence of matter, space and time. That is as close to nothing as you can get, but what is still required here is the laws of physics. So the laws of physics should still be there, and they are definitely not nothing."

When asked if his work "proves the existence of God or at least of a divine moment of creation," Vilenkin responded "I don’t think it proves anything one way or another."

In 2015, cosmologists Ahmed Farag Ali and Saurya Das published a paper outlining a model which applies quantum correction terms to complement Einstein's theory of general relativity and suggests that the universe may have existed forever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269314009381 Cosmology from quantum potential], Physics Letters B, February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Actual infinities====

On the impossibility of [[actual infinities]], Craig asserts:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;

#The metaphysical impossibility of an actually infinite series of past events by citing [[David Hilbert]]'s famous [[Hilbert's Hotel]] [[thought experiment]] and [[Laurence Sterne]]'s story of [[Tristram Shandy]].{{huh|date=July 2017}}
#The mathematical impossibility of forming an actual infinite by successive addition.

Michael Martin disagrees with these assertions by Craig, saying:

:"Craig's ''a priori'' arguments are unsound or show at most that actual infinities have odd properties. This latter fact is well known, however, and shows nothing about whether it is logically impossible to have actual infinities in the real world."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Loke, however, thinks that even if an actual infinite is possible, there is an argument to show that it is impossible to traverse it. He proposes the following argument:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# If time is beginningless, then it would be the case that a causal series which has members being generated one after another as long as time exists would arrived at an actual infinite of generations of members at a particular time.
# It is not metaphysically possible for a causal series which has members being generated one after another as long as time exists to arrive at an actual infinite of generations of members at a particular time.
# Therefore, it is not metaphysically possible that time is beginningless.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Andrew2017|Andrew Loke, &lt;em&gt;God and Ultimate Origins&lt;/em&gt; (Cham: Springer International, 2017)]], 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Loke, in fact, also proposes an argument against the metaphysical possibility of a concrete actual infinite using the case of a  ‘Christmas present generator’ and a 'person generator.' &lt;ref&gt;[[#Andrew2017|Loke, 2017)]], 55-61&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Conclusion: "The universe has a cause."===

In a critique of Craig's book ''The Kalam Cosmological Argument'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Craig79|Craig, 1979]]&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1979, Michael Martin states:
:"It should be obvious that Craig's conclusion that a single personal agent created the universe is a ''non sequitur''. At most, this Kalam argument shows that some personal agent or agents created the universe. Craig cannot validly conclude that a single agent is the creator. On the contrary, for all he shows, there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103&lt;/ref&gt;
Martin also claims that Craig has not justified his claim of creation "''ex nihilo''", pointing out that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in deducing that the creating agent is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent "creating" a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103–14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent ''Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'', published in 2009, Craig discusses the properties of the cause of the universe, explaining how they follow by [[logical consequence|entailment]] from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

#A first state of the material world cannot have a material explanation and must originate ''ex nihilo'' in being without material cause, because no natural explanation can be causally prior to the very existence of the natural world (space-time and its contents). It follows necessarily that the cause is outside of space and time (''timeless'', ''spaceless''), ''immaterial'', and ''enormously powerful'', in bringing the entirety of material reality into existence.
#Even if positing a plurality of causes prior to the origin of the universe, the causal chain must terminate in a cause which is absolutely first and ''uncaused'', otherwise an [[infinite regress]] of causes would arise.
#[[Occam's Razor]] maintains that ''unicity'' of the First Cause should be assumed unless there are specific reasons to believe that there is more than one causeless cause.
#[[Agency (philosophy)|Agent causation]], volitional action, is the only ontological condition in which an effect can arise in the absence of prior determining conditions. Therefore, only ''personal, free agency'' can account for the origin of a first temporal effect from a changeless cause. 
#[[Abstract objects]], the only other ontological category known to have the properties of being uncaused, spaceless, timeless and immaterial, do not sit in causal relationships, nor can they exercise volitional causal power.

Craig concludes that the cause of the existence of the universe is an "uncaused, personal Creator ... who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties.

===Theories of time===

Craig maintains that the Kalam cosmological argument involves a commitment to the [[A-series and B-series|A-theory of time]], also known as the "tensed theory of time" or [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]], as opposed to its alternative, the [[B-theory of time]], also known as the "tenseless theory of time" or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]. The latter would allow the universe to exist tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block, under which circumstances the universe would not "begin to exist":

:"From start to finish, the kalam cosmological argument is predicated upon the A-Theory of time. On a B-Theory of time, the universe does not in fact come into being or become actual at the Big Bang; it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block that is finitely extended in the earlier than direction. If time is tenseless, then the universe never really comes into being, and, therefore, the quest for a cause of its coming into being is misconceived."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig has defended the A-theory against objections from [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] and [[Hybrid A-B theory of time|Hybrid A-B]] theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oaklander |first=L. Nathan |chapter=Presentism, Ontology and Temporal Experience |title=Time, reality &amp; experience |year=2002 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-52967-9 |pages = 73–90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IxIlqbSWg4gC |editor=[[Craig Callender]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Yuri Balashov has criticised Craig's attempt to reconcile the A-theory with special relativity by relying on a [[Lorentz ether theory|‘neo‐Lorentzian interpretation’ of Special Relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1=Yuri |last1=Balashov |first2=Michel |last2=Janssen |title=Presentism and Relativity |journal=British Jnl. for the Philosophy of Sci. |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=327–346 |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/2/327.short |accessdate =2014-04-11| doi= 10.1093/bjps/54.2.327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balashov claims:

:"Despite the fact that presentism has the firm backing of common sense and eternalism revolts against it, [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] is widely regarded as almost the default view in contemporary debates, and [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]] as a highly problematic view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1=Yuri |last1=Balashov |title=A Future for Presentism |journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews |year=2007 |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23018-a-future-for-presentism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Balashov, Craig criticises Balashov for adopting a [[verificationism|verificationist]] methodology that fails to address the metaphysical and theological foundations of the A-theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/response-to-mccall-and-balashov Response to McCall and Balashov], William Lane Craig&lt;/ref&gt;

It has recently been argued that a defense of the Kalam cosmological argument does not have to involve such a commitment to the A-theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Watr|Waters, 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3514">[[File:Louis Bautain.jpg|right|thumb|Louis Eugène Marie Bautain]]
'''Louis Eugène Marie Bautain''' (17 February 1796{{snd}}15 October 1867), was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]].

==Life==
Bautain was born at [[Paris]].  At the ''[[École Normale]]'' he came under the influence of [[Victor Cousin]]. In 1816 he adopted the profession of higher teaching, and was soon after called to the chair of philosophy in the [[University of Strasbourg]]. He held this position for many years, and gave a parallel course of lectures as professor of the literary faculty in the same city. The reaction against speculative philosophy, which carried away [[Joseph de Maistre|De Maistre]] and [[Hughes Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Lamennais]], influenced him also.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1828 he took orders, and resigned his chair at the university. For several years he remained at [[Strasbourg]], lecturing at the Faculty and at the [[college of Juilly]], but in 1849 he set out for Paris as vicar of the diocese. At Paris he obtained considerable reputation as an orator, and in 1853 was made professor of moral theology at the theological faculty. This post he held till his death.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Like the [[Scholastics]], he distinguished [[reason]] and [[faith]], and held that revelation supplies facts, otherwise unattainable, which philosophy is able to group by scientific methods. Theology and philosophy thus form one comprehensive science. Yet Bautain was no rationalist; like [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[John Henry Newman|Newman]] he exalted faith above reason. He pointed out, following chiefly the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] criticism, that reason can never yield knowledge of [[noumenon|things in themselves]]. But there exists in addition to reason another faculty which may be called intelligence, through which we are put in connection with spiritual and invisible truth. This intelligence does not of itself yield a body of truth; it merely contains the germs of the higher ideas, and these are made productive by being brought into contact with revealed facts. This fundamental conception Bautain worked out in the departments of psychology and morals.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The details of this theology are highly imaginative. He says, for instance, that there is a spirit of the world and a spirit of nature; the latter gives birth to a physical and psychical spirit, and the physical spirit to the animal and vegetable spirits. His theories may well be compared with the arbitrary mysticism of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]] and the [[Gnostics]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Works==
The most important of his works are:
*''Philosophie du Christianisme'' (1835)
*''Psychologie expérimentale'' (1839), new edition entitled ''Esprit humain et ses facultés'' (1859)
*''Philosophie morale'' (1840)
*''Religion et liberté'' (1848)
*''La morale de l’Évangile, comparée aux divers systèmes de morale'' (Strassburg, 1827; Paris, 1855)
*''De l'éducation publique en France au XIX siècle'' (Paris, 1876).

{{Vajrayana}}
'''Mahasiddha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''mahāsiddha'' "great adept; {{bo|t=གྲུབ་ཐོབ་ཆེན་པོ|w=grub thob chen po|s=druptop chenpo}}) is a term for someone who embodies and cultivates the "[[siddhi]] of perfection". A [[siddha]] is an individual who, through the practice of [[sādhanā]], attains the realization of [[siddhi]]s, psychic and spiritual abilities and powers.
Mahasiddhas were practicioners of [[yoga]] and [[tantra]], or ''tantrika''s. Their historical influence throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Himalayas]] was vast and they reached mythic proportions as codified in their [[songs of realization]] and [[hagiography|hagiographies]], or [[Namtar (biography)|namtar]]s, many of which have been preserved in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]]. The Mahasiddhas are the founders of [[Vajrayana]] traditions and [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineages]] such as [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]].

[[Robert Thurman]] explains the symbiotic relationship between Tantric Buddhist communities and the Buddhist universities such as [[Nalanda]] which flourished at the same time:
{{quote|The Tantric communities of India in the latter half of the first Common Era millennium (and perhaps even earlier) were something like "Institutes of Advanced Studies" in relation to the great Buddhist monastic "Universities". They were research centers for highly cultivated, successfully graduated experts in various branches of Inner Science (adhyatmavidya), some of whom were still monastics and could move back and forth from university (vidyalaya) to "site" (patha), and many of whom had resigned vows of poverty, celibacy, and so forth, and were living in the classical Indian [[sannyasa|sannyāsin]] or sādhu style. I call them the "psychonauts" of the tradition, in parallel with our “astronauts”, the materialist scientist-adventurers whom we admire for their courageous explorations of the "outer space" which we consider the matrix of material reality. Inverse astronauts, the psychonauts voyaged deep into "inner space", encountering and conquering angels and demons in the depths of their subconscious minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David B. Gray|others=Thomas F. Yarnall |year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBbYAAAAMAAJ||title=The Cakrasamvara Tantra: The Discourse of Śrī Heruka (Śrīherukābhidhāna) |pages=ix-x |publisher=American Institute of Buddhist Studies at Columbia University |isbn=978-0-9753734-6-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Genealogy and historical dates==
The exact [[genealogy]] and historical dates of the Mahasiddhas are contentious. Dowman (1986) holds that they all lived between 750 and 1150 CE.

==Primary tradition==
[[Abhayadatta Sri]] is an Indian scholar of the 12th century who is claimed to have recorded the [[hagiographies]] of the eighty-four [[siddha]]s in a text known as ''The History of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas'' (Sanskrit: ''Caturasitisiddha pravrtti''; {{bo|w=grub thob brgyad bcu tsa bzhi'i lo rgyus}}).

Dowman holds that the eighty-four Mahasiddha are spiritual [[archetypes]]:

{{quote|The number eighty-four is a "whole" or "perfect" number. Thus the eighty-four siddhas can be seen as archetypes representing the thousands of exemplars and adepts of the tantric way. The siddhas were remarkable for the diversity of their family backgrounds and the dissimilarity of their social roles. They were found in every reach of the social structure: kings and ministers, priests and yogins, poets and musicians, craftsmen and farmers, housewives and whores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Keith Dowman |last=Dowman |first=Keith |year=1984 |title=The Eighty-four Mahasiddhas and the Path of Tantra |work=KeithDowman.net |url=http://www.keithdowman.net/essays/siddhas.htm |accessdate=2015-03-21}} From the Introduction to ''Masters of Mahamudra'', SUNY, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reynolds (2007) states that the mahasiddha tradition "evolved in North India in the early Medieval Period (3–13 cen. CE). Philosophically this movement was based on the insights revealed in the Mahayana Sutras and as systematized in the Madhyamaka and Chittamatrin schools of philosophy, but the methods of meditation and practice were radically different than anything seen in the monasteries.&lt;ref name=MTT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=John Myrdhin|title=The Mahasiddha Tradition in Tibet|url=http://www.vajranatha.com/teaching/MahasiddhaTradition.htm|website=Vajranatha|publisher=Vajranatha|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proffers that the mahasiddha tradition "broke with the conventions of Buddhist monastic life of the time, and abandoning the monastery they practiced in the caves, the forests, and the country villages of Northern India. In complete contrast to the settled monastic establishment of their day, which concentrated the Buddhist intelligenzia [''sic.''] in a limited number of large monastic universities, they adopted the life-style of itinerant mendicants, much as the wandering Sadhus of modern India."&lt;ref name=MTT /&gt;

The [[charnel ground]] conveys how great mahasiddhas in the [[Nath]] and Vajrayana traditions such as [[Tilopa]] (988–1069) and [[Gorakshanath]] (fl. 11th – 12th century) yoked adversity to till the soil of the path and accomplish the fruit, the "ground" (Sanskrit: āśraya; {{bo|w=gzhi}}) of realization:&lt;ref&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche (2002), p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The charnel ground is not merely the hermitage; it can also be discovered or revealed in completely terrifying mundane environments where practitioners find themselves desperate and depressed, where conventional worldly aspirations have  become devastated by grim reality. This is demonstrated in the sacred biographies of the great siddhas of the Vajrayāna tradition. Tilopa attained realization as a grinder of sesame seeds and a procurer for a prominent prostitute. Sarvabhakṣa was an extremely obese glutton, Gorakṣa was a cowherd in remote climes, Taṅtepa was addicted to gambling, and Kumbharipa was a destitute potter. These circumstances were charnel grounds because they were despised in Indian society and the siddhas were viewed as failures, marginal and defiled.&lt;ref&gt;Simmer-Brown (2002), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his study of the Hevajra Tantra, David Snellgrove outlines the typical tantric siddha or yogi. After experiencing the consummation of enlightenment in the embrace of a female consort:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thereafter the pupil is free to pursue the practice of strenuous meditation and physical self-control, and after five years or more he will perhaps succeed. He receives the five symbolic adornments, crown, ear-rings, necklace, bracelets, girdle, signs of his success. These he wears on those set occasions, the eighth or fifteenth day of the dark-fortnight, when perfected yogins and yoginis come together, to consume the flesh and wine, to sing and dance, and realize their consummation of bliss. He is free from all conventions and wanders as he pleases, knowing no distinction between friend or foe, clean or unclean, good or evil.&lt;ref&gt;Snellgrove, David; The Hevajra Tantra: A Critical Study, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other traditions==
According to Ulrich von Schroeder, Tibet has different traditions relating to the mahasiddhas. Among these traditions, two were particularly popular, namely the Abhayadatta Sri list and the so-called Vajrasana list. The number of mahasiddhas varies between eighty-four and eighty-eight, and only about thirty-six of the names occur in both lists. In many instances more than one [[siddha]] with the same name exists, so it must be assumed that fewer than thirty siddhas of the two traditions actually relate to the same historical persons. In the days when the siddhas of the later Tibetan traditions flourished in India (i.e., between the 9th and 11th centuries), it was not uncommon for initiates to assume the names of famous adepts of the past. Sometimes a disciple would have the same name as his guru, while still other names were based on caste or tribe. In such a context the distinction between siddhas of the same name becomes blurred. The entire process of distinguishing between siddhas with the same name of different texts and lineages is therefore to large extent guesswork. The great variation in phonetic transcription of Indian words into Tibetan may partly be the result of various Tibetan dialects. In the process of copying the Tibetan transcriptions in later times, the spelling often became corrupted to such an extent that the recognition or reconstitution of the original names became all but impossible. Whatever the reasons might be, the Tibetan transcription of Indian names of mahasiddhas clearly becomes more and more corrupt as time passes.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Geographical sites==
Local folk tradition refers to a number of icons and sacred sites to the eighty-four Mahasiddha at [[Bharmour]] (formerly known as [[Brahmapura]]) in the Chaurasi complex.&lt;ref&gt;Hāṇḍā (1994), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''chaurasi'' means "eighty-four".

{{quote|It is also very significant that nowhere else, except at Bharmaur in Chamba district, may be seen the living tradition of the Eighty-four Siddhas. In the Chaurasi temple complex, near which the famous temple of goddess Lakshana (8th century A.D.) stands, there once were eighty-four small shrines, each dedicated to a Siddha.&lt;ref&gt;Hāṇḍā (1994), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A number of archaeological sacred sites require iconographic analysis in the Chaurasi complex in [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh]]. Although it might be hagiographical accretion and folk lore, it is said that in the reign of  [[Sahil Varman]]:

{{quote|Soon after Sahil Varman's accession Brahmapura was visited by 84 yogis/mahasidhas, who were greatly pleased with the Raja's piety and hospitality; and as he had no heir, they promised him ten sons and in due course ten sons were born and also a daughter named Champavati.{{cite quote|date=December 2015}} }}

==Caturāsiti-siddha-pravṛtti==
The ''Caturasiti-siddha-pravrtti'' (CSP), “The Lives of the Eighty-four Siddhas”, compiled by Abhayadatta Sri, a Northern Indian Sanskrit text dating from the 11th or 12th century, comes from a tradition prevalent in the ancient city-state of Campa in the modern district of Bihar. Only Tibetan translations of this Sanskrit text seem to have survived. This text was translated into Tibetan by sMon grub Shes rab and is known as the ''Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi’i lo rgyus'' or “The Legends of the Eighty-four Siddhas”. It has been suggested that Abhayadatta Sri is identical with the great Indian scholar Mahapandita Abhayakaragupta (late 11th–early 12th century), the compiler of the iconographic compendiums ''Vajravali'', ''Nispannayogavali'', and ''Jyotirmanjari''.

The other major Tibetan tradition is based on the list contained in the ''Caturasiti-siddhabhyarthana'' (CSA) by Ratnakaragupta of Vajrasana, identical with Bodhgaya (Tib.: rDo rje gdan) located in Bihar, Northern India. The Tibetan translation is known as ''Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi’i gsol ’debs '' by rDo rje gdan pa. There exist several Tibetan versions of the list of mahasiddhas based on the Vajrasana text. However, these Tibetan texts differ in many cases with regard to the Tibetan transcriptions of the Indian mahasiddhas names.&lt;ref name="vonSchroeder2006"&gt;von Schroeder (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eighty-four Mahasiddhas==
By convention there are eighty-four Mahasiddhas in both Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions, with some overlap between the two lists. The number is congruent with the number of siddhi or occult powers held in the [[Indian Religions]]. In [[Tibetan art|Tibetan Buddhist art]] they are often depicted together as a matched set in works such as [[thangka]] paintings where they may be used collectively as border decorations around a central figure.

Each Mahasiddha has come to be known for certain characteristics and teachings, which facilitates their pedagogical use. One of the most beloved Mahasiddhas is [[Virupa]], who may be taken as the patron saint of the [[Sakyapa]] sect and instituted the [[Lamdré]] (Tibetan: ''lam 'bras'') teachings. Virupa (alternate orthographies: [[Birwapa]]/[[Birupa]]) lived in 9th century [[India]] and was known for his great attainments.

Some of the methods and practices of the Mahasiddha were codified in Buddhist scriptures known as [[Tantras]]. Traditionally the ultimate source of these methods and practices is held to be the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, but often it is a transhistorical aspect of the Buddha or deity [[Vajradhara]] or [[Samantabhadra]] who reveals the Tantra in question directly to the Mahasiddha in a vision or whilst they dream or are in a [[trance]]. This form of the deity is known as a [[sambhogakaya]] manifestation.  The [[sadhana]] of [[Dream Yoga]] as practiced in [[Dzogchen]] traditions such as the Kham, entered the Himalayan tantric tradition from the Mahasiddha, [[Ngagpa]] and [[Bonpo]]. Dream Yoga or "[[Dream Yoga|Milam]]" (T:rmi-lam; S:svapnadarśana), is one of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Four of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/mahasid2.html |work=Yoniversum.nl |title=Names of the 84 Mahasiddhas |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:
*''Manibhadra'', the Perfect Wife
*''Lakshmincara'', The Princess of [[Crazy wisdom]]
*''[[Mekhala and Kanakhala|Mekhala]]'', the elder of the 2 Headless Sisters
*''[[Mekhala and Kanakhala|Kanakhala]]'', the younger of the 2 Headless Sisters
 
Von Schroeder (2006) states:

{{quote|Some of the most important Tibetan Buddhist monuments to have survived the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976 are located at Gyantse (rGyal rtse) in Tsang province of Central Tibet. For the study of Tibetan art, the temples of dPal ’khor chos sde, namely the dPal ’khor gTsug lag khang and dPal ’khor mchod rten, are for various reasons of great importance. The detailed information gained from the inscriptions with regard to the sculptors and painters summoned for the work testifies to the regional distribution of workshops in 15th-century Tsang. The sculptures and murals also document the extent to which a general consensus among the various traditions or schools had been achieved by the middle of that century. Of particular interest is the painted cycle of eighty-four mahåsiddhas, each with a name inscribed in Tibetan script. These paintings of mahasiddhas, or “great perfected ones endowed with supernatural faculties” (Tib. Grub chen), are located in the Lamdre chapel (Lam ’bras lha khang) on the second floor of the dPal ’khor gTsug lag khang. Bearing in mind that these murals are the most splendid extant painted Tibetan representations of mahasiddhas, one wonders why they have never been published as a whole cycle. Several scholars have at times intended to study these paintings, but it seems that difficulties of identification were the primary obstacle to publication. Although the life-stories of many of the eighty-four mahasiddhas still remain unidentified, the quality of the works nevertheless warrants a publication of these great murals. There seems to be some confusion about the number of mahåsiddhas painted on the walls of the Lam ’bras lha khang. This is due to the fact that the inscription below the paintings mentions eighty [[siddha]]s, whereas actually eighty-four were originally represented. [Note: According to the Myang chos ’byung, eighty-eight siddhas are represented. G. Tucci mentions eighty-four, whereas Erberto Lo Bue assumed that only eighty siddhas were shown, as stated in the inscription. Cf. Lo Bue, E. F. andRicca, F. 1990. Gyantse Revisited, pp. 411–32, pls. 147–60]. Of these eighty-four siddhas painted on the walls, two are entirely destroyed (G55, G63) and another retains only the lower section; the name has survived (G56). Thus, the inscribed Tibetan names of eighty-two mahasiddhas are known. Of the original eighty-six paintings, eighty-four represent a cycle of mahåsiddhas (G1–G84).&lt;ref name="vonSchroeder2006"/&gt;}}

===Names according to the Abhayadatta Sri tradition===
According to Ulrich von Schroeder, Tibet has different traditions relating to the mahasiddhas. Among these traditions, two were particularly popular, namely the Abhayadatta Sri list and the so-called Vajrasana list. The number of mahasiddhas varies between eighty-four and eighty-eight, and only about thirty-six of the names occur in both lists. It is therefore also wrong to state that in Buddhism are 84 Mahasiddhas. The correct title should therefore be ''Names of the 84 Mahasiddhas according to the Abhayadatta Sri Tradition''. It should also be clearly stated that only Tibetan translations of this Sanskrit text ''Caturasiti-siddha-pravrtti'' (CSP) or ''The Lives of the Eighty-four Siddhas'' seem to have survived. This means that many Sanskrit names of the Abhayadatta Sri tradition had to be reconstructed and perhaps not always correctly.

===Identification===
According to Ulrich von Schroeder for the identification of Mahasiddhas inscribed with Tibetan names it is necessary to reconstruct the Indian names. This is a very difficult task because the Tibetans are very inconsistent with the transcription or translation of Indian personal names and therefore many different spellings do exist. When comparing the different Tibetan texts on mahasiddhas, we can see that the transcription or translation of the names of the Indian masters into the Tibetan language was inconsistent and confused. The most unsettling example is an illustrated Tibetan block print from Mongolia about the mahasiddhas, where the spellings in the text vary greatly from the captions of the xylographs.&lt;ref&gt;Egyed (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; To quote a few examples: Kankaripa [Skt.] is named Kam ka li/Kangga la pa; Goraksa [Skt.]: Go ra kha/Gau raksi; Tilopa [Skt.]: Ti la blo ba/Ti lla pa; Dukhandi [Skt.]: Dha khan dhi pa/Dwa kanti; Dhobipa [Skt.]: Tom bhi pa/Dhu pi ra; Dengipa (CSP 31): Deng gi pa / Tinggi pa; Dhokaripa [Skt.]: Dho ka ra / Dhe ki ri pa; Carbaripa (Carpati) [Skt.]: Tsa ba ri pa/Tsa rwa ti pa; Sakara [Skt.]: Phu rtsas ga’/Ka ra pa; Putalipa [Skt.]: Pu ta la/Bu ta li, etc. In the same illustrated Tibetan text we find another inconsistency: the alternate use of transcription and translation. Examples are Nagarjuna [Skt.]: Na ga’i dzu na/Klu sgrub; Aryadeva (Karnaripa) [Skt.]: Ka na ri pa/’Phags pa lha; and Ghantapa [Skt.]: Ghanda pa/rDo rje dril bu pa, to name a few.&lt;ref name="vonSchroeder2006"/&gt;

===Concordance lists===
For the identification of individual mahasiddhas the concordance lists published by Ulrich von Schroeder are useful tools for every scholar. The purpose of the concordance lists published in the appendices of his book is primarily for the reconstitution of the Indian names, regardless of whether they actually represent the same historical person or not. The index of his book contains more than 1000 different Tibetan spellings of mahasiddha names.&lt;ref name="vonSchroeder2006"/&gt;

==Other mahasiddhas==
Tibetan masters of various lineages are often referred to as mahasiddhas. Among them are [[Marpa Lotsawa|Marpa]], the Tibetan translator who brought [[Buddhist texts]] to [[Tibet]], and [[Milarepa]]. In Buddhist [[iconography]], Milarepa is often represented with his right hand cupped against his ear, to listen to the needs of all beings. Another interpretation of the imagery is that the teacher is engaged in a secret yogic exercise (e.g. see [[Lukhang]]).  (Note: Marpa and Milarepa are not mahasiddhas in the historical sense, meaning they are not 2 of the 84 traditional mahasiddhas.  However, this says nothing about their realization.) [[Lawapa]] the progenitor of [[Dream Yoga]] sadhana was a mahasiddha.

'''Maurine Stuart''' (3 March 1922 &amp;ndash; 26 February 1990), a.k.a. '''Ma Roshi''' or '''Mother Roshi''', was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] [[Zen]] ''[[rōshi]]'' who was one of the first female Zen masters to teach in the [[United States]]. She became president and spiritual director of the [[Cambridge Buddhist Association]] in 1979.

Stuart was granted her teaching title during an informal ceremony in 1982 held by her teacher [[Soen Nakagawa]]. Nakagawa, who had given [[Dharma transmission]] previously to five individuals (all male), granted Stuart the title in defiance of convention. While she had accepted the roshi title, she never declared to be a Dharma heir or lineage holder. The title was conferred upon her independent of her previous Zen practice and 1977 ordination as a Zen priest by [[Eido Tai Shimano]].&lt;ref&gt;Prebish, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Stuart was born in [[Keeler, Saskatchewan]], Canada in 1922.&lt;ref name="Krátky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krátky|first1=Martin|title=Seeds of Zen in the Prairies: Introducing Maurine Stuart|journal=[[WHOLifE Journal]]|date=March–April 2005|volume=10|issue=6|url=http://www.wholife.com/issues/10_6/04_article.html|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=Wholeness &amp; Wellness Journal of Saskatchewan}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied music and graduated from the [[University of Manitoba]].

Stuart moved to [[Paris, France]] in 1949 to study [[piano]] under [[Nadia Boulanger]], [[Robert Casadesus|Robert]] and [[Gaby Casadesus]], and [[Alfred Cortot]]. While there she developed her interest in [[Zen Buddhism]].

In 1966, Stuart joined the [[Zen Studies Society]] in [[New York City]], then led by [[Eido Tai Shimano]]. She also practiced under [[Haku'un Yasutani]] for some time during this period. In 1970 she moved to [[Newton, Massachusetts]] and opened the [[Chestnut Hill Zendo]]—joining the [[Cambridge Buddhist Association]] not long after. She was ordained as a priest by Shimano in 1977.

Stuart is featured in ''Zen in America: Five Teachers and the Search for American Buddhism'' by [[Helen Tworkov]]. Tworkov reports that Stuart left the Shimano lineage in 1977 because of his mistreatment of  women.

In 1979, Stuart became president and spiritual director of the [[Cambridge Buddhist Association]].

In 1985, Stuart ordained [[Sherry Chayat]] as a Zen priest.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1988, Stuart ordained Susan Jion Postal as a Zen priest.  (See Empty Hand Zen Center site - emptyhandzen.org)

===Death===
Stuart died of [[liver cancer]] in 1990. She left behind no successors.&lt;ref&gt;Oldmeadow, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; As she wished, her ashes were buried under [[birch tree]]s in the garden of the [[Cambridge Buddhist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boucher|first1=Sandy|title=Turning the Wheel: American Women Creating the New Buddhism|date=1993|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0807073059|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ht4QqV_HIh8C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=Maurine+Stuart+died&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MracsnANxH&amp;sig=pAZV40edsWb82So30sebPr8XnEc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mgktVYizLYGVNoidgdgK&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Maurine%20Stuart%20died&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mihai Șora''' ({{IPA-ro|miˈhaj ˈʃora}}; born November 7, 1916 in [[Remetea Mare|Ianova]]) is a [[Romania]]n philosopher and essayist.

==Life==
The son of an [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=7639|title=Un om liber este ambasadorul perplexitatii|last=Pecican|first=Ovidiu|publisher=Dilema Veche|number=139|date=September 22–29, 2006|accessdate=July 21, 2014|language=Romanian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924123638/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=7639|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihai Șora studied philosophy at the [[University of Bucharest]] from 1934 to 1938, where he was a student of [[Mircea Eliade]]. From 1939 to 1948 he studied in [[Paris]] and [[Grenoble]] on a fellowship granted by the French government. He joined the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Proiecte-culturale-indreptate-catre-spatiul-public-(I).-Interviu-cu-Mihai-SORA*articleID_5368-articles_details.html|title=Proiecte culturale indreptate catre spatiul public (I).

After travelling back to Romania in 1948, Șora was prevented from returning to France. Barred from holding a teaching appointment in communist Romania, he nevertheless became an influential editor. Șora's family emigrated to the West in the 1970s, and he was allowed to visit them in the 1980s, but he was forced to publish under pseudonyms rather than use his own name.&lt;ref name="BradatanOushakine2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aurelia Craiutu|editor=Costica Bradatan; Serguei Oushakine|title=In Marx's Shadow: Knowledge, Power, and Intellectuals in Eastern Europe and Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cK9H35gDSz4C&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=24 January 2013|year=2010|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-3626-3|pages=261–|chapter=Mihai Șora: A Philosopher of Dialogue and Hope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1989 he joined intellectuals protesting the treatment of dissident poet [[Mircea Dinescu]]. After the fall of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in December 1989, he briefly served as minister of education in [[Petre Roman]]'s postrevolutionary coalition.

{{Aristotelianism}} / {{The Works of Aristotle}}
--&gt;
'''''On Ideas''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Περὶ Ἰδεῶν, ''Peri Ideōn'') is a philosophical work which deals with the [[problem of universals]] with regards to Plato's [[Theory of Forms]].  The work is supposedly by [[Aristotle]], but there is not universal agreement on this point.  It only survives now as fragments in quotations by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] in his commentary of Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.

==Summary==
''On Ideas'' gives greater detail to many of the arguments which Aristotle recounts in ''Metaphysics'' A.9.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin and Fine, ''Aristotle Selections'' (Hackett Publishing, 1995), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; There and here objections to arguments for Plato's theory of Forms are given. A point made in multiple places is that the Platonist arguments establish only that there are universals in a general and metaphysically slim sense, and not there are full-blown Forms of the Platonic kind.  A version of the [[third man argument]] is also given.

==Authenticity==
Alexander of Aphrodisias does attribute his quotations which form the extant text of ''On Ideas'' to Aristotle.  The content also matches with what Aristotle says of the Platonist arguments in his ''Metaphysics''.  However, the external evidence that ''On Ideas'' is an authentic work of Aristotle is ambiguous and its status as such is not universally recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''On Ideas: Aristotle's Criticism of Plato's Theory of Forms'' (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barnes, Review of Fine's 1993 ''On Ideas'' in [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2108541 Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 6, no. 2 (1996), pp.489-491].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Morgan, Review of Fine's 1993 ''On Ideas'' in [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20129819 The Metaphysics Review, Vol. 45, no. 1 (1995), pp. 132-134].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text and translations==
The full Greek text of Alexander's commentary which includes ''On Ideas'' is published in the first volume of the ''[[Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca]]''. Excerpts from this, along with an English translation and commentary by [[Gail Fine]], are available in ''On Ideas: Aristotle's Criticism of Plato's Theory of Forms'' published by the Oxford University Press in 1993.  This translation is also reproduced with notes in ''Aristotle: Selections'', edited by Terence Irwin and Gail Fine and published by Hackett Publishing in 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9199">The '''Peelian principles''' summarise the ideas that [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] developed to define an [[ethical]] [[police force]]. The approach expressed in these principles is commonly known as '''policing by consent''' in the United Kingdom and other countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=UKP&gt;{{cite web|title=Policing by consent|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policing-by-consent|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=29 December 2013|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Lint|first=Willem|title=Public Order Policing in Canada|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/inquiries/ipperwash/policy_part/research/pdf/deLint.pdf|accessdate=29 December 2013|page=9|date=December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Andrew|title=Police Power and Democracy in Australia|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=192675|publisher=National Criminal Justice Reference Service|accessdate=29 December 2013|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buttle|first=John|title=The Case Against Arming The New Zealand Police|url=https://www.academia.edu/395156/The_Case_Against_Arming_The_New_Zealand_Police|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model of policing, police officers are regarded as citizens in uniform. They exercise their powers to police their fellow citizens with the implicit consent of those fellow citizens. "Policing by consent" indicates that the [[Police legitimacy|legitimacy of policing]] in the eyes of the public is based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveillance Camera Code of Practice|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204775/Surveillance_Camera_Code_of_Practice_WEB.pdf|publisher=UK Government Home Office|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=5|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In early 19th-century Britain, attempts by the government to set up a police force for London met with a lot of opposition:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Robert Peel and the new Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/candp/prevention/g08/g08cs2.htm|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* People were suspicious of the idea of a large police force, possibly armed. They feared that it could be used to suppress protest or support unpopular rule.
* Paris had the best-known, best-organised and best-paid police force at the time. Britain was at war with France almost continuously from 1793 to 1815, and during most of that time, France had a secret and political police, so many people disliked the idea because of the association with France.
* People did not think that it was the job of the national government to set up and control a police force. They thought it should be under local control.

The [[History of the Metropolitan Police Service#The new police|concept of professional policing]] was taken up by Robert Peel when he became [[Home Secretary]] in 1822. Peel's [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the Greater London area, known as the Metropolitan Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolitan Police|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/laworder/policeprisons/overview/metropolitanpolice/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine principles of policing==
Nine principles were set out in the "General Instructions" issued to every new police officer in the [[Metropolitan Police]] from 1829.&lt;ref name=UKP /&gt;&lt;ref name=CIVITAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of Good Policing|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/research/crime/facts-comments/principles-of-good-policing/|publisher=The Institute for the Study of Civil Society|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peel discussed the spirit of some of these principles in his speeches and other communications, the historians Susan Lentz and Robert Chaires found no proof that he compiled a formal list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Home Office]] has suggested that the instructions were probably written, not by Peel himself, but by Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, the joint Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police when it was founded.&lt;ref name=UKP /&gt;&lt;ref name=CIVITAS /&gt;

The nine principles were as follows:

# To deter crime and disorder, as an alternative to their repression by military force and severity of legal punishment.
# To recognise always that the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour, and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect.
# To recognise always that to secure and maintain the respect and approval of the public means also the securing of the willing co-operation of the public in the task of securing observance of laws.
# To recognise always that the extent to which the co-operation of the public can be secured diminishes proportionately the necessity of the use of physical force and compulsion for achieving police objectives.
# To seek and preserve public favour, not by pandering to public opinion, but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to law, in complete independence of policy, and without regard to the justice or injustice of the substance of individual laws, by ready offering of individual service and friendship to all members of the public without regard to their wealth or social standing, by ready exercise of courtesy and friendly good humour, and by ready offering of individual sacrifice in protecting and preserving life.
# To use physical force only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient to obtain public co-operation to an extent necessary to secure observance of law or to restore order, and to use only the minimum degree of physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police objective.
# To maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.
# To recognise always the need for strict adherence to police-executive functions, and to refrain from even seeming to usurp the powers of the judiciary, of avenging individuals or the State, and of authoritatively judging guilt and punishing the guilty.
# To recognise always that the test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, and not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with them.

==Policing by consent==
The historian Charles Reith explained in his ''New Study of Police History'' (1956)&lt;ref name=UKP /&gt; that these principles constituted an approach to policing "unique in history and throughout the world, because it derived, not from fear, but almost exclusively from public co-operation with the police, induced by them designedly by behaviour which secures and maintains for them the approval, respect and affection of the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reith|first=Charles|title=''A New Study of Police History''|year=1956|publisher=London: Oliver &amp; Boyd|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Home Office]] in 2012 explained this approach as "the power of the police coming from the common consent of the public, as opposed to the power of the state. It does not mean the consent of an individual" and added an additional statement outside of the Peelian principles: "No individual can choose to withdraw his or her consent from the police, or from a law."&lt;ref name=UKP /&gt;

Modern police reformers have described the Peelian Principles as being relevant in the present day, with American law-enforcement officer [[William Bratton]] calling them "my bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/nyregion/sir-robert-peels-nine-principles-of-policing.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2014-04-16|accessdate=2017-12-19|title=Sir Robert Peel's Nine Principles of Policing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronald Albert McClamrock''', usually known as '''Ron McClamrock''', is an associate professor of philosophy at the [[University at Albany, The State University of New York]]. His primary areas of research are the [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of science]], and [[cognitive science]].

==Existential cognition==

In his book, ''Existential Cognition: Minds in the World'', McClamrock argued for the extreme importance of the external environment (both social and physical) in the determination of almost all varieties of human and animal behavior. His position is that the [[methodological individualism]] inherent in many contemporary forms of computational theories of the mind are completely inadequate and that we must look to the interactions between organism and world in order to find "external mechanisms that mediate behavior" as well as the usual internal mechanisms. Borrowing from [[Herbert A. Simon]] and also influenced by the ideas of [[existential phenomenology|existential phenomenologists]] such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], McClamrock suggests that man's condition of being-in-the-world makes it impossible for him to understand himself by abstracting away from it and examining it as if it were a detached experimental object of which he himself is not an integral part. 

However, unlike the continental philosophers, McClamrock relies upon results from modern information sciences, biology and cognitive science to support his conclusions about the ''bounded and embedded'' nature of consciousness and the mind as a whole. One of his examples, taken from [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], discusses the exploitation of local environmental regularities in the control mechanisms of the common fly. 

:"Flies, it turns out, don't quite know that to fly they should flap their wings. They don't take off by sending some signal from the brain to the wings. There is a direct control link from the fly's ''feet'' to its wings such that when the feet cease to be in contact with a surface, the fly's wings begin to flap. To take off, the fly simply jumps and then lets the signal from the feet trigger the wings.

The local surface mediates the signal from brain to wings, illustrating the point that the human nervous system may be said, in a certain sense, to extend to parts of its external environment.

In another example, McClamrock cites the case of a man driving from one destination to another. On the way, he encounters various external signals and stimuli (street names, direction signs, people who provide information when asked, landmarks, etc..) and all of these help him, in many cases are indispensable to, his successfully finding his way from point A to point B. The path he ends up traveling to get to point B from point A is, in any case, partially determined by his environment. In the case of ants, this is even clearer. When we look at the tracks that ants make as a result of their movements, they seemed to be highly ordered and preplanned. But, in fact, an ant will usually encounter unforeseen and unforeseeable obstacles as it makes its way along from one point to another. At each obstacle, it will be constrained to make a choice that it otherwise wouldn't. The path that it ultimately travels will therefore be heavily determined by its exterior environment, as well its behavior.

==Argument against Kim==
McClamrock's article "Emergence Unscathed: Kim on Non-Reducible Types"  took on [[Jaegwon Kim]]'s famous "causal powers" argument against [[multiple realizability]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Jaegwon (1992) "Multiple Realization and the Metaphysics of Reduction", ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'' 52: 1-26&lt;/ref&gt; Kim argued that multiple realizability conflicts with fundamental constraints on the definition of kinds and with general rules of scientific taxonomy. Kim's argument is based on two essential premises: 

: ''The Causal Inheritance Principle'': if mental property M is realized in a system at time t in virtue of physical realization base P, the causal powers of M are identical with the causal powers of P.

From this it follows that:

:Instances of M that are realized by the same physical base must be grouped under one kind, since the physical base is a causal kind, and instances of M with different realization bases must be grouped under distinct kinds.

The second premise is 

: ''The Principle of the Causal Individuation of Kinds'': kinds in science are individuated on the basis of their causal powers.

From all of this, it follows, according to Kim, that "if mental kinds are multiply realizable, then they are disqualified as proper scientific kinds...because they are realized by diverse physical causal kinds."&lt;ref&gt;Kim (1992), 18&lt;/ref&gt;

McClamrock flatly rejected Kim's claim that "instances of M that are realized by the same physical base must be grouped under one kind". It is a consequence of token materialism that a complete specification of the causal powers of a mental kind at a certain time will be a complete specification of the causal powers of the physical state which implements it. But Kim's assertion only follows if we assume that the ''only'' specification of causal kinds can be in terms of causal powers of tokens. McClamrock suggested understanding higher-level causal powers as simply more general and abstract ''characterizations'' of the lower-level causal powers implemented in the physical structure of a system. There are many varieties of causal taxonomy classifying things according to various kinds of causal powers they possess. For example, a taxonomy of orbiting bodies may specify the causal powers of objects in terms of mass, position and velocity – abstracting from the body's chemical composition, geology or microbiotic agglomerations. Such an abstract and incomplete characterization of the causal powers of a system makes it possible to group together physically type-distinct instances of the higher-level kind (in this case, planets, stars and other orbiting bodies).

Moreover, taxonomies in computer science are typically characterized by such abstractions. What is of interest at the level of information processing are such things as registers and microprogramming operations, not the causal powers of the material structure of semiconductors.

==Etymology==
''Satchitananda'' (Sanskrit: सच्चिदानन्द) is a compounded Sanskrit word consisting of "sat", "cit" and "ananda", all three considered as inseparable from the nature of ultimate reality called Brahman in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca578&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Sacchidananda" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 578&lt;/ref&gt; The different forms of spelling is driven by euphonic (sandhi) rules of Sanskrit, useful in different contexts.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca578/&gt;

* '''sat''' (सत्):&lt;ref name=mmwsat1134/&gt; In Sanskrit ''sat'' means "being, existing", "living, lasting, enduring", "real, actual", "true, good, right", "beautiful, wise, venerable, honest", or "that which really is, existence, essence, true being, really existent, good, true".&lt;ref name=mmwsat1134&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1100/mw__1167.html Sat], A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 1134&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Another translation is offered by Sugirtharajah, who suggests a "''palpable force of virtue and truth''".{{sfn|Sugirtharajah|2004|p=115}}}} 
* '''cit''' (चित्):&lt;ref name=mmwsat395/&gt; means "to perceive, fix mind on", "to understand, comprehend, know", "to form an idea in the mind, be conscious of, think, reflect upon".&lt;ref name=mmwsat395&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0400/mw__0428.html Cit], A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 395&lt;/ref&gt; Loctefeld and other scholars translate it as "consciousness".&lt;ref name="James Lochtefeld 2002 page 35"&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Ananda" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Hinduism"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones |author2=James D.

* '''ānanda''' (आनन्द):&lt;ref name=mmwsat139/&gt; means "happiness, joy, enjoyment, sensual pleasure", "pure happiness, one of three attributes of Atman or Brahman in the Vedanta philosophy".&lt;ref name=mmwsat139&gt;Sir Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0100/mw__0172.html Ananda], A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages, Oxford University Press (Reprinted: Motilal Banarsidass), {{ISBN|978-8120831056}}, page 139&lt;/ref&gt; Loctefeld and other scholars translate ''ananda'' as "bliss".&lt;ref name="James Lochtefeld 2002 page 35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Hinduism"/&gt;

''Satchitananda'' is therefore translated as "Truth Consciousness Bliss",&lt;ref name=gsmurty303&gt;Gurajada Suryanarayana Murty (2002), Paratattvaganṇitadarśanam, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120818217}}, page 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasant Merchant (2000), Savitri: A Legend &amp; a Symbol-Sri Aurobindo's Modern Epic, International Journal of Humanities and Peace, vol. 16, no. 1, pages 29-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Holm and John Bowker (1998), Hinduism, in ''Picturing God'', Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1855671010}}, page 71&lt;/ref&gt; "Reality Consciousness Bliss",&lt;ref&gt;Julian Woods (2001), Destiny and Human Initiative in the Mahabharata, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791449820}}, page 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Hastings et al (2000), The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198600244}}, page 324&lt;/ref&gt; "Existence Consciousness Bliss",{{sfn|Werner|2004|p=88}}

==Discussion==
The term is contextually related to "the ultimate reality" in various schools of Hindu traditions.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca578/&gt; In theistic traditions, ''sacchidananda'' is same as God such as Vishnu,&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermair (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791470817}}, page 246&lt;/ref&gt; Shiva&lt;ref&gt;Hilko Wiardo Schomerus and Humphrey Palmer (2000), Śaiva Siddhānta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815698}}, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; or Goddess in Shakti traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Sherma | first=Rita | year=1998 | editor-last=Lance E.

=== Vedanta philosophy ===
{{Main article|Vedanta}}
The [[Vedantic]] philosophy understands ''saccidānanda'' as a synonym of the three fundamental attributes of Brahman. In [[Advaita Vedanta]], states Werner, it is the sublimely blissful experience of the boundless, pure consciousness and represents the unity of spiritual essence of ultimate reality.{{sfn|Werner|2004|p=88}}

Saccidānanda is an epithet for [[Brahman]], considered indescribable, unitary, ultimate, unchanging reality in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Devadutta Kali 2005 page 365"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lochtefeld|first1=James G.|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|date=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9780823931798|pages=593, 578, 604|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta : A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''service flag''' or '''service banner''' is a [[banner]] that family members of those serving in the [[United States Armed Forces]] can display. The flag or banner is officially defined as a white field with a red border, with a blue star for each family member serving in the [[Armed Forces of the United States]] during any period of war or hostilities. A gold star (with a blue edge) represents a family member that died during Military Operations.  This includes those who lost their lives during World War I, World War II, or during any subsequent period of armed hostilities in which the United States was engaged before July 1, 1958;  

or those who lost or lose their lives after June 30, 1958:

# &lt;span name="a_2_A"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;
# &lt;span name="a_2_B"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or
# &lt;span name="a_2_C"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict in which the United States is not a belligerent party against an opposing armed force; 

&lt;span name="a_2_C"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;or those who lost or lose their lives after March 28, 1973, as a result of:

# &lt;span name="a_3_A"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;an international terrorist attack against the United States or a foreign nation friendly to the United States, recognized as such an attack by the Secretary of Defense; or
# &lt;span name="a_3_B"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;military operations while serving outside the United States (including the commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States) as part of a peacekeeping force. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/1126|title=10 U.S. Code § 1126 - Gold star lapel button: eligibility and distribution|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the star symbols used on the service flag, the term "Blue Star" has come into use in the United States as a reference to having a family member in active military service, and the term "Gold Star" has come to refer to the loss of a family member in military service. For example, the mother of a person who died in service is referred to as a "Gold Star mother", and the wife of an active service member is referred to as a "Blue Star wife". Charitable support organizations have been established for [[American Gold Star Mothers|Gold Star mothers]], [[Gold Star Wives of America|Gold Star wives]], [[Blue Star Mothers Club|Blue Star mothers]], and [[Blue Star Mothers Club|Blue Star wives]]. The last Sunday in September is observed as Gold Star Mother's Day, Gold Star family members are entitled to wear a [[Gold Star Lapel Button]], and all 50 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Guam]] offer some form of a [[Vehicle registration plates of the United States#Vanity and specialty plates|specialty license plate]] for motor vehicles owned by Gold Star family members.

The use of the terms has sometimes been restricted to refer to service during specific armed conflicts. For example, the service banner originally applied only to [[World War I]], and it was later expanded to include service in [[World War II]], then the [[Korean War]], then other specific conflicts, and then "any period of war or hostilities". In some current uses of the "star" terminology, there is no longer any distinction made about the place or time or degree of hostility involved in the military service.&lt;ref name=Criteria&gt;{{cite web |title=Membership Criteria |url=http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Members/Membership.htm |website=American Gold Star Mothers official website |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816211141/http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Members/Membership.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Gold Stars, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] also makes a distinction about the manner and place of death, but some other organizations do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Join |url=http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Members/HowToJoin.htm |website=American Gold Star Mothers official website |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816184210/http://www.goldstarmoms.com/Members/HowToJoin.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold Star term is also sometimes interpreted to apply to those [[missing in action]] and those who did not die during active service but died later as a result of an in-service injury.&lt;ref name=Criteria/&gt;

A lesser-known practice of using a silver star to indicate a service member that has been disabled is sometimes also followed, although this practice is not recognized in federal law.

Queisser of the [[Fifth Ohio Infantry]], in honor of his two sons who were serving in [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="usnaval"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.usflag.org/history/serviceflag.html|title = The Service Flag of the United States|website = USFlag.org|accessdate = September 22, 2008|date = 10 February 2005|last = Streufert|first = Duane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legion/&gt; It was quickly adopted by the public and by government officials. On September 24, 1917, an [[Ohio]] congressman read into the [[Congressional Record]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mayor of [[Cleveland]], the Chamber of Commerce and the [[Governor of Ohio]] have adopted this service flag. The world should know of those who give so much for liberty. The dearest thing in all the world to a father and mother – their children.&lt;ref name=Legion&gt;{{cite web |website=[[American Legion]] |url=http://www.legion.org/troops/bluestar |title= Blue Star Banner |accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Usage==
These flags were first used in World War I, with subsequent standardization and codification by the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Artimovich (May 2, 1997). [http://www.fotw.net/flags/us%5Esvc.html Description] at [[Flags of the World]].&lt;!-- verified September 22, 2008 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were not popular during the [[Vietnam War]], but have come back into use since the first [[Gulf War]] / [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;John M. Simpson (December 30, 2005)&lt;!-- verified September 22, 2008 --&gt;. [http://www.jms1.net/flag/ Service Flag Graphics].&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, an organization may fly a service flag if one of its members is serving active duty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serviceflags.com Service Flags.com].&lt;!-- verified September 22, 2008 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacture of these flags is only allowed by specific government license in the territories under U.S. jurisdiction. The same section of the [[United States Code]] that limits manufacture of the banner also mentions [[lapel pin]]s. There is no legal specification of the banner's size, but according to the DoD code,&lt;ref name="DoD 1348.33-M"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/publicationsregulations/p/m134833.htm|title=DoD 1348.33-M, Manual of Military Decorations and Awards|last=Ebbesen|first=LGEN Samuel B.|date=September 1996|work=[[United States Assistant Secretary of Defense|Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management Policy)]]|publisher=[[About.com]]|pages=88–92|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the flag size ratio must be 10:19, the same as the [[Flag of the United States]]. When displayed with the national flag, the latter should take the place of honor. If the flags displayed differ in size, the national flag should be larger.

Blue and gold are the only colors specified for use, but silver stars are increasingly in use to represent those discharged from service because of wounds or being invalided home.&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Historical Images (2007), [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/002160.asp ''World War I "Sons in Service" Flag''].&lt;!-- verified September 22, 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Silver Star Families of America]] is an organization attempting to encourage the U.S. Congress to make the Silver Star Service Banner official for those wounded or injured in a war zone. Forty-nine states, Guam, Saipan, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Chickasaw Nation and over 2,700 cities and counties have issued proclamations in support of the Silver Star Banner and of Silver Star Service Banner Day on May 1 of every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silverstarfamilies.org Silver Star Families] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2010, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed House Resolution 855, a stand-alone resolution recognizing the Silver Star Service Banner and making May 1 Silver Star Service Banner Day. One state, Missouri, took steps to make such recognition a state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=May 1 named Silver Star Service Banner Day |first=Cory |last=de Vera |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/news_leader/access/2016671101.html?FMT=ABS |newspaper=[[Springfield News-Leader]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |location=[[Springfield, Missouri]] |issn=0893-3448 |oclc=44919665 |date=April 23, 2010 |page=A.11 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |quote=In Missouri and in more than 2,700 cities and counties, government officials have declared May 1 as a day to recognize service men and women injured, ill or dying from service in a war zone.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, the Brazilian ''Clube Militar'' (Military Club) and the ''Casino da Urca'' adopted the concepts of the U.S. service banner by giving posters to the family members of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]]. On these posters the phrase ''Daqui saiu um Expedicionário'' was written, which means "From here came an Expeditionary". Although the design differs from the U.S. banners, the mothers of the Brazilian soldiers also received a pin prominently featuring a blue star similar to U.S. pins.&lt;ref&gt;http://museuvirtualfeb.blogspot.com/2010/08/lembrancas-para-as-maes-dos-pracinhas.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individuals entitled to display==
The individuals entitled to display the service flag are officially defined in {{UnitedStatesCode|36|901}} which reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A service flag approved by the Secretary of Defense may be displayed in a window of the place of residence of individuals who are members of the immediate family of an individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United States during any period of war or hostilities in which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged.&lt;ref name=Title36&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2014-title36/html/USCODE-2014-title36.htm |title=Title 36 – Patriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The U.S. Code also discusses the wearing of lapel pins.

{{Chinese salvationism}}
'''Shanrendao''' (善人道 "Way of the Virtuous Man") is a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] religious movement in [[northeast China]]. Its name as a social body is the '''Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue''' (万国道德会 ''Wànguó Dàodéhuì'') or simply the '''Church of the Way and its Virtue''' (道德会 ''Dàodéhuì''), which is frequently translated as the '''Morality Church'''. Shanrendao can be viewed as one of the best examples of the ''jiàohuà'' (教化 "spiritual transformation") movements.{{sfnb|Duara|2014|p=182}}

It is one of the most prominent [[Chinese salvationist religions|religions of redemption]] of [[China]],{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=27, 79}} and was formally established as the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in [[Shandong]] in 1921 by Jiang Shoufeng (1875-1926), a member of the Confucian Church (孔教会 ''Kǒngjiàohuì'') of [[Kang Youwei]].{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=130}} Kang Youwei himself was the president of the church during the last year of his life.{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=130}} The movement was concerned with a reconstitution of morality, at a time in which people no longer understood what morality means because of the decline of religion.{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=130}} By the 1930s the religion had a strong presence in [[Manchuria]],{{sfnb|Kiely|Goossaert|Lagerwey|2015|p=688}} where it persists to the present day.&lt;ref name=Fruehauf&gt;Heiner Fruehauf, Ph.D. ''[https://www.jadeinstitute.com/jade/assets/files/Fruehauf-AllDiseaseComesFromTheHeart.pdf All Disease Comes from the Heart: The Pivotal Role of the Emotions in Classical Chinese Medicine]''. § "The Power of Ritual and the Emotional Therapy System of the Confucian Educator Wang Fengyi (1864-1937)" (7-13). chineseclassicalmedicine.org. [https://web.archive.org/web/20171231233513/https://www.jadeinstitute.com/jade/assets/files/Fruehauf-AllDiseaseComesFromTheHeart.pdf Archived on 31 December 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=298}}{{sfnb|Kiely|Goossaert|Lagerwey|2015|p=45, 786}}

A great contribution came from Jiang Shoufeng's son, Jiang Xizhang (1907-2004), an intellectual prodigy who composed commentaries on the [[Confucian classics]] before the age of ten.{{sfnb|Kiely|Goossaert|Lagerwey|2015|p=696}} Father and son composed vernacular versions of the classics in order to disseminate Confucianism among the Chinese masses.{{sfnb|Kiely|Goossaert|Lagerwey|2015|p=696}} After the [[World War I]], Xizhang wrote a leaflet, the ''Xizhanlun'' with anti-war teachings inspired by the content of the world religions.{{sfnb|Kiely|Goossaert|Lagerwey|2015|p=696}}

The strongest impetus in the social importance of the movement, however, came from Wang Fengyi (王凤仪 1864-1937), a charismatic healer and preacher of peasant origins who led the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in the 1930s.{{sfnb|Kiely|Goossaert|Lagerwey|2015|p=697}} He is celebrated as a peasant saint throughout northeast China, a ''shànrén'' (善人 "virtuous man") with the epithet "Wang the Good"{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=79}} or "Virtuous King" (王善人), a wordplay as his surname means "king" or "ruler".{{sfnb|Duara|2014|p=182}}

==Doctrine and practice==
[[File:Shanrendao.svg|thumb|150px|Coloured symbol of Shanrendao theory.]]
Wang Fengyi elaborated a doctrine and practice based on self-knowledge, self-realisation, and self-reliance, based on traditional [[Chinese theology]] and [[Chinese cosmology|cosmology]], especially the [[Wu Xing|five elements]] (五行 ''wǔxíng'') and the ''[[yin and yang|yinyang]]'' cosmology. The five elements constitute everything and also characterise the five behaviours of the human being. The harmony of the person and the society depends on the proper cultivation of these characters according to the different contexts.{{sfnb|Duara|2014|p=182}}

Shanrendao is deeply influenced by the Taizhou school of [[Wang Yangming]]'s [[Neo-Confucianism]], but the tradition synthesises the entirety of [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]]. Its goal is to find the roots of one's life; return to the principles of the bond between [[Tian|Heaven]], [[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]] and humanity according to one's own experience.{{sfnb|Duara|2014|p=182}}

All kinds of human emotions are thought to arise from social interaction, from the family to the larger community. Wang Fengyi's teachings emphasise the role of emotion in healing. Reconciliation, gathering for ritual and storytelling ([[parable]]s are taken from the Chinese tradition and the life of Master Wang) able to "turn the heart of the participants", are the primary practice of the movement. These methods are called "talking the disease away by appealing to one's higher nature".&lt;ref name=Fruehauf/&gt;{{rp|10-11}}

===Three natures and ''Dao''===
Wang Fengyi's doctrine holds that the human being tends to the five virtues of empathy (仁 ''rén''), ritual and propriety (礼 ''lǐ''), integrity and trust (信 ''xìn''), justice and righteousness (义 ''yì''), and wisdom (智 ''zhì''), and to the five vices of anger (怒 ''nù''), hatred (恨 ''hèn''), blame (怨 ''yuàn''), irritation and judgment (恼 ''nǎo''), and annoyance and disdain (烦 ''fán''). These tendences take part in the three natures of man, which they characterise more or less.

The state of virtue is ① ''tiānxìng'' (天性, "heavenly nature", which can be translated as "natural disposition"), while the outward disposition (meaning the tendency to impose oneself on others) is ② ''bǐngxìng'' (禀性), and it is generally dominated by vices and selfishness. ③ Habits (''xíxìng'' 习性) are neither of the two, and they are rather engendered by the necessity of interaction with the circumstances, which lead to certain choices and preferences. The aim of Wang's healing is to extinguish imposition of the self on others, and reduce habits, in order to deliver the heavenly nature of humanity.{{sfnb|Luo|2013|p=45}} ''Tianxing'' is the state of ''[[Tao|Dào]]'', and it is the integration and harmony of spirit, body and mind, of nature (性 ''xìng''), heart (心 ''xīn'') and body (身 ''shēn'').{{sfnb|Luo|2013|pp=47-48}}

===Social doctrine===
The Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue inherited Wang's teachings on the importance of the family, seen as the basis of citizenship and social regeneration. According to Wang's teachings the family institution has to be frugal and morally pure.{{sfnb|Yeh|2000|p=352}}

Wang protested the inadequacy of historical religions, protesting that they neglected or demeaned women. Wang emphasised the importance of the woman in the institution of the family, and the necessity of women's education and independence in the Way.{{sfnb|Yeh|2000|p=352}} Wang Fengyi promoted an indigenous mass female learning movement which competed with the missionary schools of the [[Catholic Church]] in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Li Ji. ''God's Little Daughters: Catholic Women in Nineteenth-Century Manchuria''. University of Washington Press, 2015. {{ISBN|0295806036}}. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and spread==
===The Jiangs and Kang Youwei===
Jiang Shoufeng and his son Jiang Xizhang began to organise the movement in 1916.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=96}} Jiang Shoufeng was originally a member of Confucian Church of [[Kang Youwei]] but was turned away by hard-line Confucian trends within the church.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=96}} The Jiangs theorised that a moral foundation was needed for the Chinese in order to contrast French, British and Japanese colonialisms, which rested on a policy of destruction of the morality of the conquered populations.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=96}} The Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue was officially founded on 28 September 1921, the birthday of Confucius, in [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]].{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=96}}

The church attracted members from various backgrounds and government officials. Even the American Christian missionary Gilbert Reid became a member of the church, and [[Kong Decheng]] (1920-2008), then Confucius' first descendant in direct line, became the honorary chairman.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=96}}{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=182}} Kang Youwei, the "Martin Luther of Confucianism", founder of the Confucian Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tay | first = Wei Leong | title = Kang Youwei: The Martin Luther of Confucianism and His Vision of Confucian Modernity and Nation | journal = Secularization, Religion and the State | publisher = University of Tokyo Center of Philosophy | date = 2010 | url = http://utcp.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publications/pdf/UTCPBooklet17_08_Tay.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171231233913/http://utcp.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publications/pdf/UTCPBooklet17_08_Tay.pdf | archive-date = 31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the president of the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in 1926-27, the last year of his life.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=95}}

The Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue underwent a significant reform in 1926-28 when Jiang Shoufeng died, Kang Youwei was ill and dying, and Jiang Xizhang went abroad. The leadership was taken by a capitalist from [[Heilongjiang]], Du Yannian (1878-1957), who recruited the charismatic healer and preacher Wang Fengyi.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=96}}

===Wang Fengyi's leadership===
[[File:Wang Fengyi.jpg|thumb|150px|Wang Fengyi (1864-1937).]]
Wang Fengyi was born on 1 November 1864 to a peasant family of Wangjiayinzi village, [[Chaoyang, Liaoning|Chaoyang]], [[Rehe Province|Rehe]] (nowadays [[Liaoning]]). His parents were [[Mongols in China|Mongolian]], and he was primarily a self-taught ox herder.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=96}} He had an older brother, Wang Shutian (王树田), and two younger brothers, Wang Shushen (王树森) and Wang Shuyong (王树永). At the age of 23 he married Bai Shoukun (白守坤) and they had a son, Wang Guohua (王国华). Wang Fengyi did not receive a high education because of poverty, and at the age of 35 he realised the ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' and became a wandering healer and preacher of traditional Confucian morality.{{sfnb|Luo|2013|p=39}}

By the time of his contact with Du Yannian, Wang had already founded the Voluntary Schooling movement for girls, which by 1925 had established 250 schools throughout Manchuria.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=96}} Wang's schools merged with the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, and by 1933 the church had 500 branches, 400 schools and 200.000 students in northeast China.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=97}}

Wang Fengyi gave a great impetus to the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, which in the 1930s had 8 million members in northeast China (25% of the population).{{sfnb|Ownby|2008|ps=. § 23: «the Daodehui eight million in Manchukuo alone (a quarter of the total population) in 1936-1937.»}} Nowadays he continues to be celebrated as a peasant saint throughout the region, a ''shànrén'' (善人 "virtuous man") with the epithet "Wang the Good"{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=79}} or "Virtuous King" (王善人) as his surname means "king" or "ruler".{{sfnb|Duara|2014|p=182}}

===Contemporary developments===
In mainland People's Republic of China the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue ceased to exist as a social organisation recognised by political authorities since the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist Revolution]] of 1949 until recent decades. Shanrendao persisted as an "underground" movement across the Maoist period and the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=298}}{{sfnb|Kiely|Goossaert|Lagerwey|2015|p=45, 786}}

Since the relaxation of antireligion policies in the 1980s the movement has resurfaced and it has grown back especially in its heartland, northeast China (Manchuria),{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=298}} where the members preach filiality and Wang Fengyi's healing methods, mostly organised in the form of [[house church (China)|house churches]].{{sfnb|Kiely|Goossaert|Lagerwey|2015|p=45, 786}} Lineages of local healers are organised in "farms", and successfully employ storytelling, lectures on virtue, personal confessions, and a set of five chanted affirmations modeled on the five elements.&lt;ref name=Fruehauf/&gt;{{rp|10-13}}&lt;ref&gt;Liu Yousheng's 劉有生 lectures: ''Let the Radiant Yang Shine Forth: Lectures on Virtue''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquarters of the "Church of the Way and its Virtue" have been established again in [[Beijing]] in the 2010s. Wang Fengyi's teachings have also been adopted by the contemporary [[Beijing]] Confucian group ''Yīdān xuétáng'' (一耽學堂).{{sfnb|Billioud|2015|p=182}}

'''Simon Critchley''' (born 27 February 1960) is an English philosopher and Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York City. He writes on a wide variety of topics including: [[history of philosophy]], [[political theory]], religion, [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], literature, theatre, David Bowie, Hamlet, Suicide, and most recently, Football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simoncritchley.org/work|title=simon-critchley|last=|first=|date=|website=simon-critchley|accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critchley's PhD dissertation resulted in the monograph ''The Ethics of Deconstruction'' (Blackwell, 1992). This text was published in the wake of a debate at Cambridge concerning [[Jacques Derrida]]'s honorary doctorate.&lt;ref name="simon-critchley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simoncritchley.org/about|title=simon-critchley|website=simon-critchley|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critchley holds the position of "chief philosopher" at the International Necronautical Society (INS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.necronauts.org/committee.htm|title=First Committee of The Necronautical Society|website=www.necronauts.org|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parody of twentieth century avant-garde cultural, artistic, and political organizations, the INS facilitates live events as well as denunciations and proclamations with the intention of "mapping, entering, and occupying the space of death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://necronauts.net/manifestos/1999_times_manifesto.html|title=International Necronautical Society:|website=necronauts.net|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archival documents from the INS produced between 1999 and 2010 have been compiled into a text edited by novelist [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] and Critchley entitled ''The Mattering of Matter'' (Sternberg Press, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sternberg-press.com/?pageId=1396|title=Sternberg Press - Tom McCarthy, Simon Critchley, et al.|website=www.sternberg-press.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from death, Critchley is also widely known for his encouragement of educating the living, in particular, the philosophical education of children at the [http://tiltkidsfestival.org/ Tilt Kids Festival at the Brooklyn Public Library].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/24/when-kids-philosophize|title=When Kids Philosophize|last=Mead|first=Rebecca|date=2017-04-17|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-12-11|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tiltkidsfestival.org/2017-events/simon-critchley|title=Simon Critchley|date=2015-11-16|work=TILT KIDS FESTIVAL|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a regular participant at the [https://www.nightofphilosophyandideas.com/ Brooklyn Public Library's Night of Philosophy], infamously reserving his lectures until the early hours of the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bpl.bklynlibrary.org/nopai2017/schedule.aspx#t4am|title=A Night of Philosophy and Ideas|website=bpl.bklynlibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An atheist,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief/hij-gelooft-in-wij~a3371407/|title=Hij gelooft in wij|author=Matthea Westerduin|date=3 January 2013|work=de Volkskrant|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critchley has publicly stated that his "only religious commitment is to Liverpool Football Club."&lt;ref name="simon-critchley"/&gt;

Critchley has taught at the University of Cardiff (1988–89), The University of Essex (1989-2003) and was the Directeur de Programme at the College International de Philosophie in Paris (1998-2004). Critchley was also part-time professor of philosophy at Tilburg University (2009–15). He has held visiting professorships at the University of Sydney, Notre Dame, and Cardozo Law School.

Critchley argues philosophy begins not in wonder, but disappointment. The two major forms of disappointment that he deals with are religious and political. Religious disappointment raises the question of meaning and has to, as he sees it, deal with the problem of [[nihilism]]. Political disappointment provokes the question of [[justice]] and raises the need for a coherent [[ethics]].&lt;ref name="simon-critchley"/&gt;

==Life and education==

Critchley believes in an "essential connection between biography and philosophy."&lt;ref name="simon-critchley"/&gt;

His father was a sheet-metal worker and his mother was a hairdresser. On at least one occasion Critchley has affectionately referred to his hometown as the "wasteland."&lt;ref name="simon-critchley"/&gt; As a child he was bullied but escaped this violence through study and football. As a young pupil Critchley was admitted into grammar school and then university despite his parents' disinclinations. During his adolescence he split his time between numerous punk bands but at the age of 18 suffered a serious industrial accident which almost severed his left hand. Unable to continue his career in music, Critchley underwent an intense period of depression. Working as a lifeguard one summer he read [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]] as well as works in middle English by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[Piers Plowman]]. At 22 he applied for college at the behest of a friend and was admitted to study philosophy and literature.

Critchley received a BA from the [[University of Essex]] in 1985. At Essex he joined the Communist Students' Society which introduced him to thinkers who would greatly shape his later thought including: [[Louis Althusser]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Derrida]]. During this period he quit writing poetry after reading [[W. H. Auden]].

In 1987 Critchley left Essex for the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis|University of Nice]] where he met [[Dominique Janicaud]], who would become a last influence and friend. Soon after, Critchley suffered a hospital accident that resulted in lifelong tinnitus. Despite this obstruction, Critchley completed a thesis in French concerning [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] on the question of overcoming [[metaphysics]]. For this achievement he earned his M. Phil.

Returning to Essex in 1987 Critchley was at a loss as to what to write on for his forthcoming dissertation. He eventually completed a dissertation on [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas|Levinas]] (which would later be expanded into his monograph, ''The Ethics of Deconstruction'' (Blackwell, 1992)). In 1988 he attained his PhD from Essex. Not long after he was appointed a lecturer of philosophy at Essex in 1989, becoming reader in philosophy in 1995, and professor in 1999.

Since 2004 Critchley has been professor of philosophy at the [[The New School for Social Research|New School for Social Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/faculty/simon-critchley/|title=Simon Critchley - Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy|website=www.newschool.edu|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was department chair from 2008-2011 and became Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy in 2011.

== Controversy with Slavoj Zizek ==
In Critchley's 2007 publication ''Infinitely Demanding'' (Verso) he remarks: "Anarchic political resistance should not seek to mimic and mirror the anarchic violent sovereignty it opposes" (168). In response, Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek|Slavoj Zizek]] responded with a polemical review in [[London Review of Books|the London Review of Books]] (November 15, 2007). In his review, Zizek criticizes Critchley as defending the liberal-democratic capitalist state. For Zizek, Critchley epitomizes how "the politics of  resistance is nothing but the moralizing supplement to a Third Way Left."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n22/slavoj-zizek/resistance-is-surrender|title=Resistance Is Surrender|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|date=2007-11-15|work=London Review of Books|access-date=2017-12-11|pages=7|issn=0260-9592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T.J. Clark (University of California Berkeley) and David Graeber (Goldsmiths, University of London) defended Critchley by pointing out a variety of Zizek's own vacillations concerning political violence and the state-form; in particular, Clark paraphrases Zizek's own prescription as a "sit at home and watch the barbarity on television" attempt at revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n24/letters#letter1|title=Letters · LRB 13 December 2007|website=www.lrb.co.uk|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zizek responded to his critics in the [[London Review of Books]] (vol.30 no.2 – 24 January 2008) by reiterating that his "opinion is that the left is not able to offer a true alternative to global capitalism."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n02/letters|title=Letters · LRB 24 January 2008|website=www.lrb.co.uk|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zizek defended his criticism of Critchley in remarking that resistance to the state may indeed vindicate and corroborate it. On this point Zizek remarks in regards to protests against the Iraq War that they "fitted all too smoothly [into] the space allotted to 'democratic protests' by the hegemonic state and ideological order."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2009 Critchley published a response to Zizek in ''[[Naked Punch Review|Naked Punch]].'' There, Critchley links Zizek's rapid production of monographs and prescription that "sometimes, doing nothing is the most violent thing to do,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence: Six Sedeways Reflections|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|publisher=Profile|year=2009|isbn=978 1 84668 017 5|location=London, UK|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to claim that what ultimately sustains Zizek's work is "a dream of divine violence, cruelty and force."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nakedpunch.com/articles/39|title=Violent Thoughts About Slavoj Zizek|website=www.nakedpunch.com|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zizek "ridicules others' attempts at thinking about commitment, resistance and action...while doing nothing himself."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Critchley concludes:&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is a serious debate to be had about the question of violence versus non-violence, the necessity of the state form, and the nature of radical politics given the seeming permanence of capitalism. This is a debate in which I’d like to engage as my own position on these matters is shifting as I give it more thought. Perhaps when we get beyond the windy rhetorical posturing of Zizek’s critique and his description of my position as ‘post-modern leftism’ (I defy anyone to find a word in favour of postmodernism in anything I have written), we can begin to have that debate."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the final chapter of his 2012 publication, ''The Faith of the Faithless'' (Verso), Critchley returns to his debate with Zizek in order to sum up some of his previously made points and prescribe resistance to systemic forms of oppression, discrimination and domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faith of the Faithless: Experiments in Political Theology|last=Critchley|first=Simon|publisher=Verso|year=2012|isbn=978-1-84467-737-5|location=London|pages=207–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since May 2010 Critchley has moderated an opinion blog published by ''[[The New York Times]]'' entitled ''[https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-stone The Stone].'' The Stone features the writing of contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless including art, war, ethics, gender and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/introducing-the-stone/ "The Stone"].

'''Guardian Commentary on Heidegger's ''Being and Time'''''

Over June and July 2009 Critchley wrote a serialized read-through of [[Martin Heidegger]]'s magnum opus, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jun/05/heidegger-philosophy|title=Being and Time, part 1: Why Heidegger matters Simon Critchley|website=the Guardian|accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the British newspaper, ''[[The Guardian]].'Over two months and eight separate articles, Critchley engages with and disentangles each difficult chapter of this infamously resistant text.

'''Critchley and Simmons'''

Critchley is an active and founding collaborator in the avant-garde music group "Critchley and Simmons." The sound of this group is self-described as if "David Bowie &amp; Jacques Derrida had love children who decided to form a band."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.critchleyandsimmons.com/contact|title=critchleyandsimmons|website=critchleyandsimmons|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Seymour Hoffman|Phillip Seymour Hoffman]] is a featured vocalist and collaborator on the track "So Happy." Critchley and Simmons have produced four studio albums: Humiliation (2004), The Majesty of the Absurd (2014), Ponders End (2017) and Moderate or Good, Occasionally Poor (2017).

'''Speaking Engagements'''

Critchley is also a renowned interviewer and has spoken in public engagements with [[Philip Seymour Hoffman|Phillip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Fiona Shaw]], [[Cornel West]] and [[Isabelle Huppert]], among others.

==Section I==

''General conception of the Nature of [[Ratiocination]]'' [Vernunftschlüsse]

A judgment is the comparison of a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] or thing with a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] or attribute [also called a "mark"]. The comparison is made by using the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] or linking verb "is" or its negative "is not." Therefore, a judgment is a declarative [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], which is a [[categorical proposition]]. Example: The [[tiger]] is four-footed. A predicate can also have its own predicate. In the example, the predicate "four-footed" can, itself, have the further predicate "animal."  One of these predicates is immediately and directly connected to the subject or thing.  The other predicate is mediate and indirectly connected to the subject.

"The tiger ----------is---------- a four-footed---------- animal."

(Subject)----------(Copula)-----(Immediate Predicate)------(Mediate Predicate)

In order to have clear knowledge of the relation between a predicate and a subject, I can consider a predicate to be a mediate predicate. Between this mediate predicate or attribute, I can place an intermediate predicate. For example, in the judgment "the sun is luminous," I attempt a clarification by inserting the predicate "star," which then becomes an immediate predicate, intermediate between the subject "sun" and the mediate predicate "luminous." 

''The sun is a star that is luminous."

Sun = subject

Is = copula

Star = immediate predicate (intermediate predicate) (middle term)

Luminous = remote mediate predicate

Kant calls this process ratiocination. It is the comparison of a remote, mediate predicate with a subject through the use of an intermediate predicate. The intermediate predicate is called the middle term of a rational inference. The comparison of a subject with a remote, mediate predicate occurs through three judgments:
#Luminous is a predicate of star;
#Star is a predicate of sun;
#Luminous is a predicate of sun (the original judgment).
This can be stated as an affirmative ratiocination: Every star is luminous; the sun is a star; consequently the sun is luminous.

Note: Kant's examples utilized obscure subjects such as [[Soul]], [[Spirit]], and [[God]] and their supposed predicates.  These do not facilitate easy comprehension because these subjects are not encountered in everyday experience and consequently their predicates are not evident.

==Section II==

''Of the Supreme Rules of all Ratiocination''

Kant declared that the primary, [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] rule of all [[affirmative (linguistics)|affirmative]] ratiocination is: A [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of a predicate is a predicate of the [[subject (grammar)]].

The primary, universal rule of all negative ratiocination is: Whatever is inconsistent with the predicate of a subject is inconsistent with the subject. 

Because proof is possible only through ratiocination, these rules can't be proved. Such a proof would assume the truth of these rules and would therefore be circular. However, it can be shown that these rules are the primary, universal rules of all ratiocination. This can be done by showing that other rules, that were thought to be primary, are based on these rules.

The ''dictum de omni'' is the highest principle of affirmative [[syllogism]]s. It says: Whatever is universally affirmed of a [[concept]] is also affirmed of everything contained under it. This is grounded on the rule of affirmative ratiocination. A concept that contains other concepts has been [[Abstract object|abstract]]ed from them and is a predicate. Whatever belongs to this concept is a predicate of other predicates and therefore a predicate of the subject.

The ''dictum de nullo'' says: Whatever is denied of a concept is also denied of everything that is contained under it. The concept is a predicate that has been abstracted from the concepts that are contained under it. Whatever is inconsistent with this concept is inconsistent with the subject and therefore also with the predicates of the subject. This is based on the rule of negative ratiocination.

==Section III==

''Of Pure and Mixed Ratiocination''

If one judgment can be immediately discerned from another judgment without the use of a middle term, then the inference is not a ratiocination.  A direct, non-ratiocinative inference would, for example, be: "from the proposition that all airplanes have wings, it immediately follows that whatever has no wings is not an airplane."

Pure ratiocination occurs by means of three propositions. Mixed ratiocination occurs by more than three propositions. A mixed ratiocination is still a single ratiocination. It is not compound, that is, consisting of several ratiocinations. 

An example of a mixed ratiocination is:

''Nothing immortal is a man,''

''Therefore, no man is immortal;'' (this is a negative conversion of the preceding premise)

''Socrates is a man,''

''Therefore, Socrates is not immortal.''

A mixed ratiocination interposes an [[immediate inference]], resulting in more than three propositions.  However, a mixed ratiocination may show only three propositions if the fourth proposition is unspoken, unexpressed, and merely thought. For example, the ratiocination

''Nothing immortal is a man,''

''Socrates is a man,''

''Therefore, Socrates is not immortal''

is only valid if the fourth proposition ''Therefore, no man is immortal'' is covertly thought. This unspoken proposition should be inserted after the first proposition and is merely its negative converse.

==Section IV==

''In the so-called First Figure only Pure Ratiocinations are possible, in the remaining Figures only mixed Ratiocinations are possible. ''

Pattern of First Figure:

'''''Subject'''''...............'''''Predicate'''''

Middle Term........Major Term........'''Major Premise'''

Minor Term.........Middle Term........'''Minor Premise'''

Minor Term........Major Term...........'''Conclusion'''  


A ratiocination is always in the first figure when it accords with the first rule of ratiocination: A predicate B of a predicate C of a subject A is a predicate of the subject A. This is a pure ratiocination. It has three propositions:

''C has the predicate B,''

''A has the predicate C,''

''Therefore, A has the predicate B.''


''In the Second Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible.''

Pattern of Second Figure:

'''''Subject'''''...............'''''Predicate'''''

Major Term........Middle Term........'''Major Premise'''

Minor Term.........Middle Term........'''Minor Premise'''

Minor Term........Major Term...........'''Conclusion'''

  
The rule of the second figure is: Whatever is inconsistent with the predicate of a subject is inconsistent with the subject. This is a mixed ratiocination because an unexpressed proposition must be added in thought in order to arrive at the conclusion. If I say,

''No B is C,''

''A is C,''

''Therefore, A is not B''

My inference is valid only if I silently interpose the immediate inference ''No C is B'' after the first premise. It is merely the negative converse of the first premise. Without it, the ratiocination is invalid.


''In the Third Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible.''

Pattern of Third Figure:

'''''Subject'''''...............'''''Predicate'''''

Middle Term........Major Term........'''Major Premise'''

Middle Term.........Minor Term........'''Minor Premise'''

Minor Term........Major Term...........'''Conclusion'''  


The rule of the third figure is: Whatever belongs to or contradicts a subject, also belongs to or contradicts some things that are contained under another predicate of this subject.

An example of a syllogism of the third figure is:

''All mammals are air-breathers,''

''All mammals are animals,''

''Therefore, some animals are air-breathers.''

This validly follows only if an immediate inference is silently interpolated. The added inference is a conversion that uses the word "some" instead of "all."

''All mammals are air-breathers,''

''All mammals are animals,''

''Hence, some animals are mammals,''

''Therefore, some animals are air-breathers.''


''In the Fourth Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible.''

Pattern of Fourth Figure:

'''''Subject'''''...............'''''Predicate'''''

Major Term........Middle Term........'''Major Premise'''

Middle Term.........Minor Term........'''Minor Premise'''

Minor Term........Major Term...........'''Conclusion'''  


Kant claimed that the fourth figure is based on the insertion of several immediate inferences that each have no middle term. The affirmative mode of this fourth figure is not possible because a conclusion cannot be derived from the premises. The negative mode of this fourth figure is possible only if each premise is immediately followed by its unexpressed, unspoken converse as an immediate inference.

In order to be valid, the negative mode ratiocination:

''No stupid man is learned,''

''Some learned persons are pious,''

''Therefore, some pious persons are not stupid''

must become:

''No stupid man is learned,''

''Consequently, no learned person is stupid;''

''Some learned persons are pious,''

''Consequently, some pious persons are learned,''

''Therefore, some pious persons are not stupid.''

==Section V==

''The Logical Division of the Four Figures is a Mistaken Subtlety.''

Legitimate conclusions can be drawn in all four figures. Only the first figure determines the conclusion by pure, unmixed reasoning. The other figures use unspoken, inserted inferences. Logic should consist of open, not covert, reasoning. It should be simple and unmixed, with no hidden inferences.

Previous logicians incorrectly considered all four figures as being simple and pure. The four figures were created by playfully changing the middle term’s position. This retained the rational conclusion but increased obscurity. Time should not be wasted on the study of the three mixed ratiocinations.

==Section VI==

''Concluding Observation.''

The first figure yields a correct inference in a simple, direct manner. The other figures yield a correct inference indirectly by the addition of hidden inferences. They can be changed into the simpler first figure by changing the position of the middle term.

Kant concluded the essay with several related remarks.

Distinct and complete concepts are only possible by means of judgments and ratiocinations. A distinct concept is one which is made clear by a judgment. This occurs when something is clearly recognized as a predicate of a subject. A complete concept is one which is made distinct by a ratiocination. The ratiocination can be simple or a chain of reasoning. 

The ability to understand and the ability to reason are both based on the ability to judge. Understanding is the immediate recognition that something is a predicate of a subject. Reason is the ability to judge mediately. It recognizes another predicate in the first predicate, thus conceiving a subject indirectly by means of a remote predicate.

Higher knowledge is based on judging. Framing a judgment is a reflection that results in a distinct concept. Non-human animals can have clear representations of things that are predicates of a subject.  Humans can also have knowledge that a predicate is a predicate of a subject and are therefore able to make a judgment. Non-human animals can distinguish things from one another. The different ideas are the causes of their actions, which are irrational. Humans can logically distinguish between things by means of judgment.  The higher knowledge of a human is based on the ability to make our own ideas the object of our thoughts. 

All affirmative judgments are based on the principle of Identity. A subject is identical to its predicate. All negative judgments have the principle of Contradiction as their foundation. A subject is opposed to its predicate. Judgments in which identity or contradiction is mediately known, by means of intermediate predicates and by means of the analysis of concepts, are provable. Judgments in which identity or contradiction is immediately known cannot be proved (See Section II). These unprovable judgments precede definitions because we must recognize a subject's predicate before we can define the subject.

==Reference in the Critique==
Kant summed up his thoughts on this topic in a short footnote that appeared in the second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', B141. He had been discussing the definition of judgment in general. Logicians had usually defined it as a relation between two concepts. Kant disagreed because, he claimed, only categorical judgments are so defined. Hypothetical and disjunctive judgments are a relation between two judgments. 

In his footnote, Kant asserted that the lengthy and detailed doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerned only categorical syllogisms or inferences.  He stated that this doctrine is only an artifice or trick for giving the appearance that there are three more kinds of inference or modes of drawing a conclusion than that of the first figure. This is done surreptitiously by secretly concealing immediate inferences&lt;ref&gt;An immediate inference is one in which "from the truth of one judgment that of another may be discerned immediately without any middle term." Immediate inferences are usually produced  by the use of contraposition or logical conversion. For example, the judgment '"nothing human is immortal" is immediately inferred by contraposing the judgment "nothing immortal is human." The truth of the judgment is understood immediately. An immediate inference is not to be confused with an immediate mark (predicate or attribute). An immediate mark is positioned between a subject and a remote mark (predicate).&lt;/ref&gt; in the premises of a pure syllogism. The only reason that this was generally accepted, Kant remarked, was that the logicians had made people believe that all of the other kinds of judgments could be reduced to being categorical judgments. Kant claimed to have disproved this in his Critique, A 73. There he argued that a categorical judgment relates two concepts, whereas a hypothetical or disjunctive judgment relates two judgments.

'''''An Inquiry into the Modern Prevailing Notions of the Freedom of the Will which is Supposed to be Essential to Moral Agency, Virtue and Vice, Reward and Punishment, Praise and Blame''''' or simply '''''The Freedom of the Will''''', is a work by Christian reformer, theologian, and author [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] which uses the text of [[The Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 9:16 as its basis. It was first published in 1754 and examines the nature and the status of humanity's [[free will|will]]. The book takes the classic [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] viewpoint on [[total depravity]] of the will and the need of humanity for God's grace in salvation.

Although written long before the modern introduction and debate over [[open theism|Open Theism]], Edwards' work addresses many of the concerns that have been raised today over this view.

One of the authors that provoked the writing of The Freedom of the Will was [[Daniel Whitby]]. Whitby was an [[Arminianism|Arminian]] minister of the [[Church of England]] who was known for his anti-[[Calvinism|Calvinist]] viewpoint and his statement that “It is better to deny prescience [foreknowledge] than liberty.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/primarysources/whitby.html Discourse on the Five Points by Daniel Whitby]&lt;/ref&gt; It is this claim that Edwards attempts to answer in The Freedom of the Will. Edwards responded that a person may freely choose whatever seems good, but that whatever it is that seems good is based on an inherent predisposition that has been foreordained by God.

'''The President's Council on Bioethics''' ('''PCBE''') was a group of individuals appointed by [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to advise his [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration]] on [[bioethics]]. Established on November 28, 2001, by [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] [[s:Executive Order 13237|13237]], the Council was directed to "advise the President on bioethical issues that may emerge as a consequence of advances in [[Biomedical engineering|biomedical]] [[science]] and [[technology]]".&lt;ref name="EO13237"&gt;[[s:Executive Order 13237|Executive Order 13237]] - ''Creation of the President's Council on Bioethics'', November&amp;nbsp;28,&amp;nbsp;2001, Vol.&amp;nbsp;66, No.&amp;nbsp;231,&amp;nbsp;{{USFedReg|66|59851}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It succeeded and largely replaced the [[National Bioethics Advisory Commission]], appointed by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1996, which expired in 2001.

The members of the council were appointed directly by the President; the President also chose the [[Chair (official)|chairperson]] of the Council (last appointed Chair was [[Edmund D. Pellegrino]]). Council members, totaling no more than 18, were appointed for a two-year [[Term of office|term]], after which time they could be reappointed by the President. Individuals appointed could not be officers or employees of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Executive Order 13237 was renewed in 2003, 2005 and again in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioethics.gov/about/ Creation of the Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050529232455/http://www.bioethics.gov/about/ |date=2005-05-29 }}, President's Council on Bioethics Website, Retrieved 2009-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expiration and replacement ==

In June 2009, President [[Barack Obama]]'s administration informed members of the Council that their services were no longer needed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wade, Nicholas.  Obama Plans to Replace Bush’s Bioethics Panel.  ''The New York Times'' June 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a spokesperson, Obama made clear that he intended to replace the committee with a body that "offers practical policy options" rather than philosophical guidance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Executive Order 13521 of November 24, 2009 superseded the previous council by establishing the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]].&lt;ref name="EO13521"&gt;[[s:Executive Order 13521|Executive Order 13521]] - ''Establishing the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues'', November&amp;nbsp;24,&amp;nbsp;2009, Vol.&amp;nbsp;74, No.&amp;nbsp;228,&amp;nbsp;{{USFedReg|74|62671}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Wednesday, Nov. 25, 2009, Obama named [[Amy Gutmann]], the president of the University of Pennsylvania, to chair his new advisory panel on bioethics.  [[James W. Wagner]], the president of Emory University, was appointed vice chairperson.&lt;ref&gt;"Obama taps Penn's Gutmann to lead bioethics panel," ''Philadelphia Inquirer, Nov. 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Critics have questioned the motives and goals of the PCBE. [[Elizabeth Blackburn]], who was dismissed from the Commission, co-authored an article, citing examples published by other members, suggesting that it was set up to justify President Bush's positions on stem cell research and abortion, writing "...our concern is that some of their contents... may have ended up distorting the potential of biomedical research and the motivation of some of its researchers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=AP| title=Scientists rally around stem cell advocate fired by Bush|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/2004-03-19-fired-bioethicist_x.htm| date=2004-03-19 |accessdate=2008-05-30|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn E, Rowley J (2004) Reason as Our Guide. PLoS Biol 2(4): e116 {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0020116}} [http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020116]

Bioethicist Leslie A. Meltzer accused the Council of wrapping "political and religious agendas in the guise of dignity," and described them as largely Christian-affiliated neoconservatives; philosophers and political scientists rather than bench scientists. Meltzer said that Council members mischaracterized the positions of their opponents and used invective rather than addressing the merits of the arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Human Dignity and Bioethics: Essays Commissioned by the President's Council on Bioethics, Book Review by Leslie A. Meltzer, New England Journal of Medicine,  359:660 (August 7, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The response to President Obama's decision to disband the Council drew both criticism and praise. [[Colleen Carroll Campbell]], a former speechwriter for President Bush and a member of the conservative advocacy group ''[[Ethics and Public Policy Center]]'' predicted that "Obama's desire to see his policies backed by expert 'consensus' more likely will be realized with a new commission composed of like-minded political liberals steeped in utilitarianism than with the brainy, diverse and unpredictable crew that populated the now-defunct council."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Colleen Carroll.

Dissolution of bioethics council is a loss for America]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} St. Louis Post Dispatch, July 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, [[Jacob M. Appel]] of New York's [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] wrote that "the panel itself, far from being an incubator of intellectual ferment, had evolved into a publicly funded right-wing think tank with a handful of token moderates for window dressing" and argued that "Obama was wise to scrap the entire panel and to start over."&lt;ref&gt;Moving Bioethics Forward, ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', July 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Think: Philosophy for Everyone''''' is an [[academic journal]] created to forge a direct link between contemporary philosophy and the general public. The central aim of the journal is to provide easily accessible and engaging writing by philosophers pre-eminent in their fields to a wide audience, unimpeded by academic jargon and technicality. The journal is sponsored by the [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] in London and published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. Think's editor is [[Stephen Law]].

''Think'' expressly aims to counter the popular impression that philosophy is pointless and wholly detached from everyday life. It also aims to expose some of the bad philosophy that currently passes as accepted wisdom, and offers contemporary philosophers the chance to help nurture and encourage philosophers of the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdcnet.org/think.html Journal website at Philosophy Documentation Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215022241/http://www.pdcnet.org/think.html |date=December 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11982">In [[game theory]], the '''traveler's dilemma''' (sometimes abbreviated '''TD''') is a type of non-[[zero-sum]] game in which two players attempt to maximize their own payoff, without any concern for the other player's payoff.

== Formulation ==
The original game scenario was formulated in 1994 by [[Kaushik Basu]] and goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaushik Basu]], "The Traveler's Dilemma: Paradoxes of Rationality in Game Theory"; ''American Economic Review'', Vol. 84, No. 2, pp. 391–395; May 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaushik Basu,[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-travelers-dilemma/ "The Traveler's Dilemma"]; ''Scientific American'', June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''An airline loses two suitcases belonging to two different travelers. Both suitcases happen to be identical and contain identical antiques. An airline manager tasked to settle the claims of both travelers explains that the airline is liable for a maximum of $100 per suitcase—he is unable to find out directly the price of the antiques.''

''To determine an honest appraised value of the antiques, the manager separates both travelers so they can't confer, and asks them to write down the amount of their value at no less than $2 and no larger than $100. He also tells them that if both write down the same number, he will treat that number as the true dollar value of both suitcases and reimburse both travelers that amount. However, if one writes down a smaller number than the other, this smaller number will be taken as the true dollar value, and both travelers will receive that amount along with a bonus/malus: $2 extra will be paid to the traveler who wrote down the lower value and a $2 deduction will be taken from the person who wrote down the higher amount. The challenge is: what strategy should both travelers follow to decide the value they should write down?''

== Analysis ==
One might expect a traveler's optimum choice to be $100; that is, the traveler values the antiques at the airline manager's maximum allowed price. Remarkably, and, to many, counter-intuitively, the [[Nash equilibrium]] solution is in fact just $2; that is, the traveler values the antiques at the airline manager's ''minimum'' allowed price.

For an understanding of why $2 is the [[Nash equilibrium]] consider the following proof:

*Alice, having lost her antiques, is asked their value. Alice's first thought is to quote $100, the maximum permissible value.
*On reflection, though, she realizes that her fellow traveler, Bob, might also quote $100. And so Alice changes her mind, and decides to quote $99, which, if Bob quotes $100, will pay $101.
*But Bob, being in an identical position to Alice, might also think of quoting $99. And so Alice changes her mind, and decides to quote $98, which, if Bob quotes $99, will pay $100. This is greater than the $99 Alice would receive if both she and Bob quoted $99.
*This cycle of thought continues, until Alice finally decides to quote just $2—the minimum permissible price.

Another proof goes as follows:
*If Alice only wants to maximize her own payoff, choosing $99 trumps choosing $100. If Bob chooses any dollar value 2–98 inclusive, $99 and $100 give equal payoffs; if Bob chooses $99 or $100, choosing $99 nets Alice an extra dollar.
*A similar line of reasoning shows that choosing $98 is always better for Alice than choosing $99. The only situation where choosing $99 would give a higher payoff than choosing $98 is if Bob chooses $100—but if Bob is only seeking to maximize his own profit, he will always choose $99 instead of $100.
*This line of reasoning can be applied to ''all'' of Alice's whole-dollar options until she finally reaches $2, the lowest price.

== Experimental results ==
The ($2, $2) outcome in this instance is the [[Nash equilibrium]] of the game. By definition this means that if your opponent chooses this Nash equilibrium value then your best choice is that Nash equilibrium value of $2. This will not be the optimum choice if there is a chance of your opponent choosing a higher value than $2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wolpert | first1= D | year=2009 | title=Schelling Formalized: Strategic Choices of Non-Rational Personas |journal=| ssrn=1172602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the game is played experimentally, most participants select a value higher than the Nash equilibrium and closer to $100 (corresponding to the Pareto optimal solution). More precisely, the Nash equilibrium strategy solution proved to be a bad predictor of people’s behavior in a traveler's dilemma with small bonus/malus and a rather good predictor if the bonus/malus parameter was big.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capra|first=C. Monica|last2=Goeree|first2=Jacob K.|last3=Gomez|first3=Rosario|last4=Holt|first4=Charles A.|date=1999-01-01|title=Anomalous Behavior in a Traveler's Dilemma?|jstor=117040|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=3|pages=678–690|doi=10.1257/aer.89.3.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the travelers are rewarded by deviating strongly from the Nash equilibrium in the game and obtain much higher rewards than would be realized with the purely rational strategy. These experiments (and others, such as [[focal point (game theory)|focal points]]) show that the majority of people do not use purely rational strategies, but the strategies they do use are demonstrably optimal. This paradox could reduce the value of pure game theory analysis, but could also point to the benefit of an expanded reasoning that understands how it can be quite rational to make non-rational choices, at least in the context of games that have players that can be counted on to not play "rationally." For instance, Capraro has proposed a model where humans do not act a priori as single agents but they forecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then they act so as to maximize the forecast. His model fits the experimental data on the Traveler's dilemma and similar games quite well.&lt;ref name="Capraro"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Capraro | first1= V | year=2013  |  title=A Model of Human Cooperation in Social Dilemmas |journal=PLoS ONE | volume=8 | issue=8 | pages=e72427 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072427 | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0072427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the traveler's dilemma was tested with decision undertaken in groups rather than individually, in order to test the assumption that groups decisions are more rational, delivering the message that, usually, two heads are better than one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=David J|last2=Kagel|first2=John H|date=2005-06-01|title=Are Two Heads Better Than One? Team versus Individual Play in Signaling Games|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201431|journal=American Economic Review|volume=95|issue=3|pages=477–509|doi=10.1257/0002828054201431|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental findings show that groups are always more rational – i.e. their claims are closer to the Nash equilibrium - and more sensitive to the size of the bonus/malus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morone|first=A.|last2=Morone|first2=P.|last3=Germani|first3=A. R.|date=2014-04-01|title=Individual and group behaviour in the traveler's dilemma: An experimental study|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804314000123|journal=Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics|volume=49|pages=1–7|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation ==
One variation of the original traveler's dilemma in which both travelers are offered only two integer choices, $2 or $3, is identical mathematically to the [[Prisoner's dilemma]] and thus the traveler's dilemma can be viewed as an extension of prisoner's dilemma. The traveler's dilemma is also related to the game [[Guess 2/3 of the average]] in that both involve deep [[Strategic dominance#Iterated elimination of dominated strategies .28IEDS.29|iterative deletion of dominated strategies]] in order to demonstrate the Nash equilibrium, and that both lead to experimental results that deviate markedly from the [[Game theory|game-theoretical]] predictions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">In American law, '''underdeterminacy''' is a concept particularly relevant to [[originalism]]. It is distinct from [[Indeterminacy debate in legal theory|'''''in'''determinacy'']].  The problem arises because even having established the original meaning of a clause of the Constitution, "''knowing the meaning of these words only takes us so far in resolving current cases and controversies.  Due either to ambiguity or vagueness, the original meaning of the text may not always determine a unique rule of law to be applied to a particular case or controversy.  While not ''indeterminate'', the original meaning can be ''underdeterminate" ([[Randy Barnett|R. Barnett]], ''[http://www.bu.edu/rbarnett/Original.htm#IB The original meaning of the Commerce Clause]'', text accompanying note 37).

Underdeterminacy is crucial to originalism, because it creates an important question of what an originalist judge should do in cases of underdeterminacy; different scholars and judges have proposed various alternatives, ranging from using tradition to fill in the gaps ([[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]]) to disempowering the judge to rule ([[Robert Bork|Bork]], Strang).

'''Sir William James Charles Maria Drummond of Logiealmond''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[FRSE]] DCL (c. 1770 – 1828) was a Scottish diplomat and Member of Parliament, poet and philosopher. His book ''Academical Questions'' (1805) is arguably important in the development of the ideas of English Romantic poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].

==Life==

He was born in [[Perthshire]] the son of John Drummond of Perth and educated at both [[St Andrew's University]] and [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], his proposers being [[Dugald Stewart]], Alexander Keith and [[John Playfair]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] the following year.

He lived in [[London]] from 1809 and died in [[Rome]] in [[Italy]] on 29 March 1828.

==Career==

In 1795 he was MP for [[St Mawes (UK Parliament constituency)|St. Mawes]], and in the elections of 1796 and 1801 was returned for [[Lostwithiel (UK Parliament constituency)|Lostwithiel]].  These were both [[rotten borough]]s in [[Cornwall]]. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1799 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/nation/drummond.htm Drummond&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He became sworn as a [[Privy Counsellor]] in 1801,&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; and left Parliament as a diplomat, as Envoy to the court of [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/drummond-william-1770-1828|title= DRUMMOND, William (?1770-1828), of Logie Almond, Perth.|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate= 22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803 he became British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;''...ambassador to the Court of Naples 1801-3; to the Ottoman Porte 1803-6; to the Court of Naples for the second time, 1806-9.''[http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext06/7blj210.htm]; this reference also gives opinions by [[Lord Byron]].&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed by the Levant Company on 14 January 1803, he arrived at the Dardanelles the following May. He was there for less than a year and then he returned to England in 1804. From 1806 to 1809 he served as Envoy to the Court of Naples for a second time.

He was knighted in 1813 or 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=2&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27drummond%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French writer [[Hippolyte Auger]] entered his service in Italy.

== The Argument of ''Academical Questions'' ==

The title of Drummond's book refers to the ''later'' [[Platonic Academy]], which was, in fact, not so much [[Platonist]] as [[Sceptical]] in orientation, based on the work of [[Pyrrho the Sceptic]] and later followers of Pyrrho such as [[Carneades]]. ''Academical Questions'' is a work in the Sceptic tradition, in this case influenced by the Sceptical Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]].

According to [[C. E. Pulos]]'s 1954 book ''The Deep Truth:  A Study of Shelley's Scepticism'', Drummond uses Sceptical [[Humean]] ideas in an attempt to refute the British philosophy predominant in his day, the Common Sense ideas of [[Thomas Reid]] and his followers.  These had been enunciated first in Reid's ''An Enquiry into the Human Mind'' (1765).

Drummond failed to unseat Reid's ideas in popularity; they remained dominant in English philosophy for the first half of the 19th century.

The well-known quotation: "He, who will not reason is a bigot; he who cannot, is a fool; and he, who dares not, is a slave", originates in the preface of this book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/09/25/cannot-reason/|title=He, Who Will Not Reason, Is a Bigot; He, Who Cannot, Is a Fool; and He, Who Dares Not, Is a Slave – Quote Investigator|website=quoteinvestigator.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Legacy ==

In contrast to other scholars he names, Pulos argues that Shelley was decisively influenced by ''Academical Questions'', and under its influence confidently abandoned 18th-century French [[materialism]]. According to Pulos, Drummond altered the poet Shelley's beliefs.  He ceased being an 18th-century French materialist; Shelley asserted that some passions (of the heart) are "innate."

==Other writings==

His ''[[Oedipus Judaicus]]'' references the ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' of [[Athanasius Kircher]], and was printed for private circulation. It was reprinted in 1866, having proved highly controversial (introduction to 1986 reprint by James P. Carley). It interprets passages from the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' (in particular the [[Chedorlaomer]] story), and the ''[[Book of Joshua]]'', in [[allegorical]] fashion, with a detailed argument based on [[astrology]].
