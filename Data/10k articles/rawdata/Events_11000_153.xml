{{DISPLAYTITLE: 2010 ''Tonight Show'' conflict}}
[[File:Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno.jpg|thumb|310px|Late-night talk show hosts [[Conan O'Brien]], left, and [[Jay Leno]], right, talk on the set of ''The Tonight Show'' in 2009.]]
The '''2010 ''Tonight Show'' conflict''' was a media and [[public relations]] conflict involving American television network [[NBC]] and two of its then-[[late-night talk show]] hosts, [[Conan O'Brien]] and [[Jay Leno]]. Leno, the host of long-running franchise ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' since 1992, and O'Brien, host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' since 1993, were strong ratings leaders for the network for much of the decade. When O'Brien's contract neared its end and he was courted by other networks in 2001, NBC extended his contract and guaranteed him he would be the fifth host of ''The Tonight Show''. The network neglected to let Leno know this until his contract extension in 2004, when they informed him he would remain host for five more years and then transition the show to O'Brien in 2009. When that time arrived, other networks conveyed interest in Leno; NBC, in an effort to keep both of its late-night stars, offered Leno a nightly primetime show before the local news and O'Brien's ''Tonight Show''.

''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' and ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' failed to attract immediate viewers, and NBC affiliates, seeing their viewership decline, grew restless. [[NBCUniversal]] CEO [[Jeff Zucker]], alongside chairman [[Jeff Gaspin]] and executive [[Rick Ludwin]], created a remedy: move Leno back to his 11:35&amp;nbsp;pm start time and bump O'Brien a half-hour later, to 12:05&amp;nbsp;am. O'Brien and his staff were both disappointed and furious; when it became clear O'Brien would not agree to the proposed changes, the situation grew heated. Though not a breach of either host's contract, the change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien. O'Brien's public statement that he would "not participate in the destruction of ''The Tonight Show''" led to negotiations with NBC for a settlement. O'Brien and his staff received US$45 million to walk away from the network, with his final ''Tonight Show'' airing January 22, 2010; Leno was reinstated as host that March, while after a contractual seven-month ban on appearing on television, O'Brien moved to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] to host ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]''.

The controversy surrounding the scheduling move and the reinstatement of Leno was described by media outlets as "embarrassing" for the network and a "public relations disaster".&lt;ref name="wsj11910"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704541004575011482898148788?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLTopStories |work=The Wall Street Journal |first1=Sam |last1=Schechner |first2=Shira |last2=Ovide |first3=Lauren A.E. |last3=Schuker |title=NBC to Pay $40 Million to Show Conan O'Brien the Door |date=January 19, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc11510"&gt;''[[ABC News]]'' article: "[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=9575927 NBC's Talk Show Wars Seen as PR Disaster for All]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:NBC logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[NBC]] remained a late-night ratings leader for years prior to the conflict.]]
On May 22, 1992, [[Johnny Carson]], host of NBC's ''The Tonight Show'' for nearly 30 years, retired from the program at the age of 66. The network signed [[Jay Leno]], Carson's "permanent guest host", to become the program's fourth host upon Carson's exit. Carson clearly held the view the position should be given to [[David Letterman]], host of his own program, ''[[Late Night with David Letterman|Late Night]]'', which had directly followed Carson's ''Tonight Show'' for ten years. NBC tried to appease both stars, but Letterman left the network in a very public conflict that resulted in the creation of his own competing show on CBS, which began in 1993. ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', "the first truly substantial competing franchise to ''Tonight''", regularly won in the Nielsen ratings against Leno for two years, "proving for the first time that late-night television—and the profits that came with it—could exist beyond ''The Tonight Show''."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=27}}

Leno's ''Tonight Show'' started rocky; prior to Letterman's move, NBC considered matching CBS's offer to allow Letterman to take over from Leno.&lt;ref name="hr1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jay-lenos-tonight-show-battles-431265|title=''Tonight Show'' Battles: a Timeline of Contending Hosts|author=Brandon Kirby|date=March 27, 2013|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letterman beat Leno for nearly two years until August 1995, when Leno welcomed [[Hugh Grant]], who had recently been arrested for soliciting a [[prostitute]] ("What the hell were you thinking?", Leno asked, to applause), to a previously-booked appearance on ''Tonight''. From that point on, Leno beat Letterman in the ratings, and ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' remained number one for the next 14 years (for Leno's entire run).

NBC chose to continue the ''Late Night'' franchise, and at the suggestion of ''Saturday Night Live'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]], hired [[Conan O'Brien]], a relatively unknown writer for ''SNL'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', to take over the time slot beginning in late 1993. ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' was constantly at risk for cancellation in its early years; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with [[Greg Kinnear]], who followed O'Brien with ''[[Later (talk show)|Later]]'' at 1:30&amp;nbsp;am., but Kinnear left to pursue a career in acting later on.&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt; Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts.&lt;ref name="nymag1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/14575/index3.html|title=Conan on the Couch|author=David Bianculli|date=September 26, 2005 |publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shales2"&gt;{{cite news|title=So I Was Wrong ...

Conan!!! |author=Lynn Hirschberg |date=May 20, 2009 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable episode of O'Brien's tenure at the show came when Letterman asked to appear as a guest and say some kind words to him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oksYO5TV48&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien considered this the turning point that changed everything for him, which he mentioned while paying tribute to Letterman in an opening monologue of [[Conan (talk show)|his own talk show on TBS]], which aired the same night as Letterman's final show; O'Brien notably asked his viewers to turn him off and watch Letterman later on in the monologue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV7NC0DGgVg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

===Contract renewals (2001–04)===
Near the turn of the millennium, NBC's late-night lineup—Leno at 11:35, O'Brien at 12:35, and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on the weekend—remained a leader in the ratings.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=27}} By 2001, O'Brien's contract at NBC had less than a year left to run, and despite arguably "coming into his own" in the preceding years, the network was reluctant to pay him on the same scale as other late-night hosts.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=28}} That year, competing network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] mounted an "extended, comprehensive campaign" to lure O'Brien away from the network, viewing his style suitable for the network's image—"young, hip, somewhat subversive".{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=28}} [[News Corporation]] chairman and CEO [[Peter Chernin]] pursued O'Brien personally, taking him and executive producer Jeff Ross to dinner on several occasions. Fox's plan involved making O'Brien the network's signature star: his program would begin 30 minutes before Leno's and Letterman's (the network's local news broadcasts aired earlier than other networks, allowing the head start) and he would receive cross-promotion via its [[Animation Domination|animated division]] and on [[Fox NFL|Sunday NFL games]].{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=28}} Chernin also offered the host seven times his current pay (a jump from US$3 million to US$21 million).{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=29}} Ross, friends with NBC president and CEO [[Jeff Zucker]], informed him that Fox was aggressively pursuing O'Brien; NBC returned with a more realistic offer, bumping up O'Brien's salary to US$8 million and renewing him through 2005.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=30}}

While many of O'Brien's professional advisors and managers pushed for the Fox deal, O'Brien's desire to one day perhaps take over ''The Tonight Show'' after Leno made it a difficult decision (O'Brien, like many comedians, had grown up idolizing Carson's incarnation).{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=29}} Chernin warned O'Brien that waiting around for Leno to leave would be "only an invitation to long-term disappointment, and potentially a path toward undermining a promising career."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=29}} Nevertheless, O'Brien signed the deal with NBC in March 2002; the contract extended him through 2005 and most significantly contained an "explicit [[Prince of Wales]] clause" that solidified the official line of succession: If anything were to happen to Leno, O'Brien would step in.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=31}} O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 [[54th Primetime Emmy Awards]] "sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer",{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=32}} and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=33}} By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of ''The Tonight Show''. Facing the prospect of attempting to keep both Leno and O'Brien, Zucker made the final call on Leno's deal: "Yes, we'll extend your deal. But this is your last contract. Time to hand over the keys."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=38}} The plan would extend Leno four additional years, after which he would give ''The Tonight Show'' to O'Brien.

In February 2004, NBC executive Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran the idea of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=39}} Zucker, along with top late-night executive [[Rick Ludwin]], met with Leno in March at his [[The Burbank Studios|Burbank]] studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=42}} While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted he did not want to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=42}} His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=43}} While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to ''Tonight Show'' producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt as if he had just been fired.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=43}} NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=44}} On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of ''The Tonight Show''; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=45}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/28CND-NBC.html | accessdate =April 4, 2010 | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Carter | title=Conan O'Brien to Succeed Jay Leno in 2009, NBC Announces | date=September 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; "'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty," Leno said. "You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don't want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who's better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!"{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=46}}&lt;ref name="Conan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6115643/|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|title=Leno promises smooth transition to O'Brien|date=September 28, 2004|accessdate=May 12, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080421162830/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6115643/| archivedate=April 21, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conan2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/27/leno.obrien/|publisher=CNN|title=O'Brien to replace Leno on 'The Tonight Show'|date=September 27, 2004| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Losing Leno (2005–08)===
[[File:Jeff Zucker, CEO of NBC Universal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Jeff Zucker]], former CEO of [[NBCUniversal]], was at the forefront of the conflict.]]
Leno was, in reality, overcome with incredulity; in private conversations, he likened the situation to a relationship, noting that he was loyal and still ended up "heartbroken".{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=68}}{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=70}} From his perspective, the situation made no sense, as they had remained number one in ratings and consistently brought in money.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=70}} He began frequently lamenting his confusion to producer Vickers, explaining that he was "sick of lying" when people inquired on his retirement.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=85}} Eventually, he began mulling over his options after ''Tonight'', telling his staff that after the transition, they could simply move to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and work at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Disney lot]] not far from their current Burbank studio.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=86}} His frustration with the situation came across in his nightly monologues, as more jokes regarding NBC's fourth-place position in the ratings, as well as jokes regarding the future transition, began to appear.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=86}} While NBC executives tended to not worry in the immediate years following the decision, by 2007 Zucker began to ponder what losing Leno might mean for the network.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=87}} Around this time, Fox and ABC began to court Leno privately, conveying interest and holding discreet conversations.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=89}}&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt;

More offers for Leno had sprung up (including a lucrative one for a [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] program by [[Sony Pictures Television]]), and in early 2008, Zucker began to make trips to the Burbank studio in an effort to keep Leno.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=110}} He gave him numerous suggestions, including a [[Bob Hope]]-type deal (high-profile specials), a Sunday night primetime show, or even a nightly cable show on [[USA Network]] (owned by [[NBCUniversal]]).{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=111}}&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt; Executives began to entertain an ideal solution—pay off O'Brien and retain Leno—but Zucker viewed the idea as "outrageous".{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=112}} By this time, NBC had already broken ground on a new studio for O'Brien's ''Tonight Show'', renovating Stage 1 at the [[Universal Studios|Universal lot]] in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], for a reported US$50 million.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=100}} During a spring lunch meeting with Jeff Ross, NBC sports chief [[Dick Ebersol]] advised that O'Brien retire silly antics (such as his signature "string dance") and focus more on pitching his show to middle America, which would involve stretching out his monologue.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=104}} O'Brien, then a year away from inheriting the sacred ground of ''The Tonight Show'', was indeed lengthening his monologue, but viewed suggestions from Ludwin as largely unnecessary: "I think people are overthinking the twelve-thirty-to-eleven-thirty shift", he said, instead desiring to put his own stamp on the show's tradition.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=115}} By this point, O'Brien's popularity, sky high at the time of the contract signing, had gone down slightly. He had opted not to change his act to suit a more mainstream audience (as NBC imagined he would), and CBS's [[Craig Ferguson]], who occupied the post-Letterman slot, had begun to occasionally trump O'Brien in overall ratings.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=119}} Though internal anxiety increased among executives, most tended to still support O'Brien.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=119}}

Zucker's last resort for Leno was a nightly 10&amp;nbsp;pm program.&lt;ref name="NewYorkT" /&gt; As ratings had slipped entirely for 10&amp;nbsp;pm shows on NBC, he imagined a nightly Leno at 10 could perhaps produce a "paradigm shift" and reverse NBC's fortunes.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=119}} On December 8, 2008, Leno verbally agreed to stay at the network—producing a nightly 10&amp;nbsp;pm variety show titled ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]''—and phoned ABC and Fox to inform them.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=127}}&lt;ref name="10pmleno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6620935.html|title=Jay Leno Taking Over 10 P.M.

In announcing his 10 pm show on ''The Tonight Show,'' Leno said, "People are asking me, 'What are you going to do after the last show? Are you going to go on vacation?' This kind of stuff. Actually, I'm going to a secluded spot where no one can find me: [[NBC]] primetime. As most of you know, we're not really leaving. We're coming back at 10 o'clock in September. It's a gamble.

===''The Tonight Show'' and ''The Jay Leno Show'' debut===

''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' pulled in over nine million viewers to its June 1, 2009 premiere, doing extremely well in the coveted young demographics.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=141}} Critics were generally very favorable; [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', once a Conan detractor, wrote that "There's every indication that O'Brien will be up to the job of his illustrious predecessors."&lt;ref name="shales"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/02/AR2009060200566.html|title=TV Review: Tom Shales on Conan O'Brien's ''Tonight Show'' Debut|author=[[Tom Shales]]|date=June 3, 2009|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older audiences, however, gradually checked out of the program night by night; seven episodes later, the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' had edged above O'Brien for the first time.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=141}}&lt;ref name="nydailynews20090807"&gt;{{cite news | title=Inner tube: David Letterman beats Conan O'Brien for fourth week | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/08/07/2009-08-07_inner_tube_david_letterman.html | publisher=[[nydailynews.com]] | date=August 7, 2009 | location=New York | first=Richard | last=Huff| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Zucker called O'Brien to reiterate that the generational change was expected, other executives were not as pleased. O'Brien and his team were not happy with the lack of promotion in the show's early weeks.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=142}} Against the wishes of several PR executives, Zucker authorized a press release proclaiming O'Brien "the New King of Late Night", a move that attracted ridicule. Zucker later regretted the decision, and many at O'Brien's ''Tonight Show'' offices were displeased.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=143}}

Over the following weeks, Zucker grew weary with O'Brien's performance and what he regarded as a booking of the wrong stars.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=147}} When a controversy erupted over a joke Letterman told regarding politician [[Sarah Palin]]'s family, Zucker eagerly pushed the O'Brien camp to bring her on their show, eyeing an opportunity to regain viewers and perhaps make it a turning point for a show not doing particularly well.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=151}} O'Brien disliked the idea, finding it pandering to viewers that would alienate fans and the press, as well as hurt his relationship with Letterman. "This reaction drove Zucker nuts", wrote Bill Carter in ''[[The War for Late Night]]''.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=151}} "As a producer, he knew how to manipulate audiences—that was simply what you did as part of the job. [ ... ] As a boss, he couldn't believe Conan would stand in the way of what was obviously the smart business move—for him and his network."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=151}} Meanwhile, Letterman continued to score higher ratings than O'Brien with regularity; his fall interview with President [[Barack Obama]] topped ''The Tonight Show'' by over 2.6 million viewers, and the next week, [[David Letterman#Extortion attempt and revelation of affairs|a scandal]] involving attempted [[extortion]] and personal affairs made him the talk of the country.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=183}}&lt;ref name="mediapost20090903"&gt;{{cite web | title=Conan Ratings Take Swing At Letterman | url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=113000 | publisher=mediapost.com | date=September 3, 2009 | accessdate=28 June 2010  }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By August, ''The Tonight Show'' was still losing to Letterman in total viewers, but, owing to O'Brien's appeal to a young audience, maintained its lead in the touted demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/late-night-old-letterman-beats-new-conan/|title=Late Night: Old Letterman Beats New Conan|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=Media Decoder Blog|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Leno was candid regarding his plans for his new show: "Even though it's ten o'clock, we're going to pretend it's eleven thirty."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=169}} ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' premiered on September 14, 2009, featuring [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Kanye West]] (just following his infamous rant against [[Taylor Swift]] at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]]) as guests. The program racked up 18.4 million viewers, doing much better than O'Brien's ''Tonight Show'' debut in both overall numbers and young demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2009/09/tv-ratings-the-jay-leno-show-debuts-to-17-million-plus.html | title=TV ratings: 'The Jay Leno Show' debuts to 17 million-plus | publisher=Zap2It | accessdate=September 15, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918183843/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2009/09/tv-ratings-the-jay-leno-show-debuts-to-17-million-plus.html | archivedate=September 18, 2009 | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics were harsh to Leno's program, with many viewing it as a rehash of the show he had just left.

Retrieved November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As the weeks wore on, producer Vickers noticed that NBC's plan—to save the best segments, such as Leno's signature "Headlines", for last in order to provide a strong lead-in for local news—was possibly hurting the program.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=179}} One month in, Leno often only made third place, and executives became more uneasy.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=184}}

===Slipping numbers===
Ratings for NBC affiliates' local news broadcasts at 11 began to slip by mid-October, especially on NBC [[owned-and-operated station]]s in the largest markets, creating high anxiety for the network.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=184}}&lt;ref name="lat101909"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/19/business/fi-ct-nbc-affils19 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Joe |last=Flint |title=Jay Leno's new time slot wreaks havoc for NBC affiliates |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tonight Show'' still retained a slightly higher share of the coveted 18–24 demographic against Letterman, but saw those numbers slip even more when ''The Jay Leno Show'' began.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=185}} Affiliates began to complain, and in addition to a [[domino effect]] on the local news, O'Brien, and ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' (O'Brien's successor at 12:30), the disastrous ratings for Leno had damaged NBC's existing primetime lineups.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=186}}&lt;ref name="nymag61857"&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Somebody Please Save NBC? |url=http://nymag.com/news/media/61857/ |last=Harris |first=Mark |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=November 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112180010/http://nymag.com/news/media/61857/ |archivedate=November 12, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This cascading effect caused by the lowered 10 pm lead-in was so significant that local news viewership fell an average of twenty-five percent nationwide, with the decline in some markets being as high as fifty percent.&lt;ref name="50percent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jay-leno-and-conan-obriens-on-air-battle/ |work=The Associated Press|title=Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien's On-Air Battle |date=January 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By November, two months after the debut of ''The Jay Leno Show'', ratings for ''The Tonight Show'' were brought down "roughly two million viewers a night year-to-year" from when Leno hosted the program.&lt;ref name="msnbc33808107"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33808107/ns/entertainment-television//|title=Is Leno's 10 p.m. experiment nearing an end?: Low prime-time ratings also pulling down local news, 'Tonight' numbers|last=Brioux|first=Bill|date=November 9, 2009|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111122548/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33808107/ns/entertainment-television/|archivedate=November 11, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clearing the 10 pm time period for Leno also damaged relations with the producers of shows that previously occupied that slot, such as ''Law &amp; Order: SVU''{{'s}} [[Dick Wolf]].{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=186}} Leno offered an October 29 interview to ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', which included a notable exchange on the possibility of ever returning to the 11:35 slot: "If it were offered to me, would I take it? If that's what they wanted to do, sure. That would be fine if they wanted to."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=187}} Industry trades were abuzz over the 11:35 comment, and when Conan sidekick [[Andy Richter]] called the move less than "classy" in a chat with [[TV Squad]], Leno called Ludwin to complain.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=187}}

As most programs went into repeats in December, the staff at Leno, notably Vickers, had focused on grabbing big-name guests for that month in an effort to save the show; these efforts were cut short when she was informed they had "until the end of November".{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=189}} Affiliate calls came at an alarming rate,{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=190}} and research analysis revealed O'Brien's drastically reduced median age for ''The Tonight Show''—age 56 to 46—could possibly reflect that he was too "niche" for the earlier time.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=191}} Any effort to take Leno off the air was halted by his contract, which had an enormously unusual catch in that Leno had signed a "pay-and-play" contract (as opposed to the usual "pay-or-play") guaranteeing NBC would both air his program and pay him for up to two years.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=190}} On November 6, NBC chairman [[Jeff Gaspin]] received an email from the sales division with a suggestion to cancel O'Brien and reinstate Leno as host of ''The Tonight Show''.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=189}} Upon Gaspin's legal interpretation of Leno's contract, the option to simply move Leno back to ''The Tonight Show'' became relevant.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=190}} When very poor ratings came in for the November "sweeps" period, affiliates became persistent and board members demanded something be done regarding the 10&amp;nbsp;pm lead-in.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=192}}

If something were not done by January, the affiliates reasoned, they would instate syndicated programming or move up their news broadcasts and pre-empt Leno.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=192}} Desperate for a decision, Ludwin, Gaspin, and Zucker kicked around possible solutions for their dilemma, such as cutting Leno to a few nights per week.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=193}} In an attempt to alleviate the situation, Vickers moved the most popular comedy segments to the second act of ''The Jay Leno Show'', moving their "10 at 10" segment to later in the broadcast.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=193}} Gaspin again received the suggestion to put Leno back at 11:35, and soon began working on a plan to cut ''The Jay Leno Show'' to a half-hour, leading into Conan's ''Tonight Show'' around midnight.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=195}} From their perspective, the biggest casualty in this scenario would be ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'', which would get bumped to 1&amp;nbsp;am.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=195}} The reconfigured lineup could start in March 2010, following NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=196}} Zucker preferred a plan for Leno to include an occasional guest and comedy piece, while Dick Ebersol favored returning to the way it once was, with Leno at 11:35 and O'Brien at 12:35.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=199}} Gaspin laid out his plan to Zucker one week before Christmas, but both agreed to wait it out for the new year, as to not "ruin anybody's holiday season".{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=196}}

The plan moved forward after confirmation that O'Brien's contract did not guarantee a strict 11:35 start time (a loophole included primarily to accommodate sports pre-emptions and specials such as [[New Year's Eve with Carson Daly|the network's New Year coverage]]).&lt;ref name=unsocial&gt;Carter, Bill.

News regarding Leno leaked to FTV Live by the following morning,{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=206}} which set the Internet abuzz with rumors regarding both Leno's and O'Brien's fates.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=207}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-01-10-leno-over_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Levin | title=After failed Leno experiment, a redefining moment at NBC | date=January 11, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/update-nbc-plans-leno-at-1130-conan-at-12/ |work=The New York Times |first=Bill |last=Carter |title=Update: NBC Plan Would Move Leno Back to Late Nights |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710074608/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/update-nbc-plans-leno-at-1130-conan-at-12/ |archivedate=July 10, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaspin scheduled an immediate meeting with Ross and O'Brien as soon as they arrived and explained the proposed changes. "I know how hard I worked for this", responded O'Brien. "It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=210}} Following the tense 15-minute meeting, O'Brien and Ross returned to the ''Tonight'' studio. [[TMZ]] reported on the story with a headline reading, "NBC Shakeup; Jay Leno Comes Out on Top."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=211}} O'Brien called an emergency staff meeting and assured all that they had not been canceled and all would be fine.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=211}} The TMZ story deeply bothered O'Brien ("the timing of the leak to TMZ—coming so soon after a story that Jay had been canceled—screamed of an attempt at diversionary action"), and he and Ross reasoned that they indeed were the last to be told of the changes.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=212}}

By the following morning, both men determined that they would have to leave NBC,{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=215}} and O'Brien opened that night's show with "We've got a great show for you tonight—I have no idea when it will air, but it's gonna be a great show."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=216}} Polone viewed the move as a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner [[General Electric]] (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to cable operator [[Comcast]].{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=252}} When a story ran that night on ''The New York Times'' website that Fox had an "overt interest" in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan,&lt;ref name="nyt 010810"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/arts/television/09leno.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Bill | last1=Carter | first2=Brian | last2=Stelter | title=NBC's Shift in Schedule May Be Up to O'Brien | date=January 9, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=217}} The situation became heated when Zucker placed a call to O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen, inquiring on the story and demanding an immediate answer from the O'Brien camp.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=217}} Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that "I obviously couldn't satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That's why I came up with this compromise."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=219}} Zucker, upon hearing that O'Brien still did not take the proposal well, threatened Rosen, saying "I'm going to tell you right now that I can [[Guarantee (filmmaking)|pay him or play him]]. I can [[non-compete clause|ice]] you guys."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=220}} On the following Monday's show, O'Brien continued jokes on the subject; responding to thunderous applause, he joked, "You keep that up, and this monologue won't start until 12:05."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=222}}

==="People of Earth"===
Rosen suggested they hire "perhaps the best known (and most feared) litigation lawyer in Hollywood", Patty Glaser, to help grasp the situation.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=218}} Following discussions on Leno's contract during a post-show conference, Glaser turned her attention to O'Brien for his opinion. He expressed his desire to write a statement expressing his feelings on the matter, and after hearing what he would possibly say in such a statement, Glaser agreed to the idea, although Ross was initially reluctant.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=224}} O'Brien went without sleep that night, crafting his statement obsessively.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=224}} He returned to the studio the following morning, listening as the lawyers and Glaser read over the statement (it remained largely unchanged before publication).{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=225}} According to ''The War for Late Night'', Glaser found "the statement as ideal for their purposes. It laid out Conan's point of view unequivocally, but without compromising his legal options. Nothing in there overtly said he was quitting, so he could not be accused of forsaking his contractual obligations."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=225}}

O'Brien's press release went out mid-day on January 12, which he addressed to "People of Earth":

&lt;blockquote&gt;For 60 years the ''Tonight Show'' has aired immediately following the late local news. I sincerely believe that delaying the ''Tonight Show'' into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. ''The Tonight Show'' at 12:05 simply isn't the ''Tonight Show''.

According to ''The War for Late Night'', "the 'People of Earth' letter—the manifesto, as NBC came to call it—changed the tone. This wasn't just Conan saying no; it was Conan saying no, and you're wrong, and, by the way, go fuck yourselves."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=229}} However, the moment that "represented the point of no return" came that Wednesday night, as a "clearly liberated" O'Brien joked in his monologue that "I'm trying very hard to stay positive here, and I want to tell you something. This is honest. Hosting ''The Tonight Show'' has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: You can do anything you want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=235}} Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?"{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=236}} Conversations changed to focus on what O'Brien would require to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=230}}

==Reaction and media coverage==

===Public support for O'Brien===
[[File:Im With Coco.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The "I'm With CoCo" poster was widely circulated online and at rallies during the conflict.]]
Public reaction was overwhelmingly in favor of O'Brien during the conflict; in the days following the switch announcement, 88% of related [[Twitter]] posts expressed support for O'Brien.&lt;ref name="mashable"&gt;Mashable article: "[http://mashable.com/2010/01/12/conan-obrien-statement/ Conan Wins the Hearts and Minds of the Internet]".&lt;/ref&gt; Over one million people joined the two most prominent [[Facebook]] groups supporting O'Brien: "Team Conan" and "I'm With Coco" (referring to an on-air [[nickname]] applied to O'Brien during his ''Tonight Show'' reign).&lt;ref name="nytsupport"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/arts/television/14fans.html|title=In Leno vs. O'Brien, Fans Show Allegiance Online|work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2010|page=C1| accessdate=June 28, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist Mike Mitchell designed a poster reminiscent of the [[Barack Obama "Hope" poster|Obama "Hope" poster]], depicting O'Brien superimposed with an [[American flag]] in the background with the caption "I'm With Coco".

Numerous media outlets offered support of O'Brien, such as [[Gawker]] and ''The Examiner'', as well as less usual outlets such as advertisements running on [[Adult Swim]]. Numerous parody videos appeared on sites like [[YouTube]] and [[Funny or Die]] in favor of O'Brien.

===Criticism of Leno===
Leno faced heated criticism and increasing negative publicity for his perceived role in the timeslot conflict, with some critics predicting that his reputation—along with those of Jeff Zucker and NBC as a whole—had been permanently damaged by the incident.&lt;ref name="latimes11510"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-leno-backlash16-2010jan16,0,4645138.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Scott | last1=Collins | first2=Matea | last2=Gold | title=Taking on America's 'nice guy' | date=January 16, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj11510"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/01/15/why-some-comics-arent-laughing-at-jay-leno-essay/ | accessdate =June 28, 2010 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Nathan | last=Rabin | title=Why Some Comics Aren't Laughing at Jay Leno (Essay) | date=January 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100723162841/https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/01/15/why-some-comics-arent-laughing-at-jay-leno-essay/| archivedate=July 23, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/15/leno.conan.reputation/ | work=CNN | title=Has Leno lost his nice guy appeal? | date=January 15, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kc11810"&gt;''[[Kansas City Star]]'' article: "[http://www.kansascity.com/238/story/1691791.html Jay Leno is Mr. Nice Guy no more&amp;nbsp;— but was he ever?]".&lt;/ref&gt; Critics pointed to the 2004 ''Tonight Show'' clip wherein Leno claimed he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident.&lt;ref name="kc11810" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dj11710"&gt;''Digital Journal'' article: [http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/285694 Jay Leno in 2004: "In '09, Conan, it's yours"]&lt;/ref&gt; Actor and comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] was among the first celebrities to openly voice disappointment with Leno, saying, "Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks;' it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation ... willfully has shut the switch off."&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;''[[Huffington Post]]'' article: "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/11/patton-oswalt-weighs-in-o_n_419015.html Patton Oswalt: Jay Leno Is Like Nixon, I Don't Like Him]".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosie O'Donnell]] was among O'Brien's most vocal and vehement supporters,&lt;ref name="RosieSupport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/thedishrag/2010/01/rosie-odonnell-is-on-team-conan.html|title=Rosie O'Donnell is on Team Conan|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|date=January 14, 2010|author=Porter, Rick|accessdate=January 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118084613/http://blog.zap2it.com/thedishrag/2010/01/rosie-odonnell-is-on-team-conan.html|archivedate=January 18, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/01/14/2010-01-14_rosie_odonnell_to_jay_leno_step_aside_and_let_conan_obrien_have_tonight_show.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | first=Michael | last=Sheridan | title=Rosie O'Donnell, Jimmy Kimmel slam Jay Leno over 'Tonight Show' battle | date=January 15, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling Leno a "bully" and his actions "classless and kind of career-defining".&lt;ref name="nyrosie"&gt;''[[New York Magazine]]'' article: "[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/01/rosie_odonnell_has_more_to_say.html#ixzz0dIY0bSPJ Rosie O’Donnell Has More to Say About Jay Leno]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Stern]] was also a harsh critic of Leno before and following the timeslot change announcement;&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ2fZH2XqNw "Rosie O'Donnell Slams Jay Leno (Part 1 of 2)"]; [[YouTube]]; January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Stern had previously appeared on ''Late Night'' in 2006 and told O'Brien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up ''Tonight'' to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkshownews.interbridge.com/2010/01/howard-stern-to-conan-in-2006-i-dont.html "Howard Stern to Conan in 2006: 'I don't see this guy leaving"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221232040/http://talkshownews.interbridge.com/2010/01/howard-stern-to-conan-in-2006-i-dont.html |date=February 21, 2010 }} Talk Show News; January 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[67th Golden Globe Awards]], which aired on NBC during the heat of O'Brien's settlement negotiations on January 17, featured numerous jokes on the controversy by [[Tina Fey]] and [[Tom Hanks]], as well as show host [[Ricky Gervais]] who quipped "Let's get on with it before NBC replaces me with Jay Leno."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=241}}

Additional criticism stemmed from the fact that the circumstances O'Brien found himself in recalled a similar dilemma that faced Leno toward the end of 1992.  Only months into his hosting job on ''The Tonight Show'', NBC considered reversing their decision to choose Leno over Letterman. Leno was aghast and angry that NBC refused to exhibit clear commitment to him as the franchise's new host, and expressed this disappointment publicly. He also made explicit that he would leave the network if he was asked to move back an hour to accommodate Letterman, saying "I'm not going to do some little happy hour from Omaha at 12:30." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/arts/jay-leno-criticizes-nbc-on-tonight-cliffhanger.html
|publisher=The New York Times |title=Jay Leno Criticizes NBC On 'Tonight' Cliffhanger |date=December 23, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators also faulted Leno for what they perceived as a disingenuous attempt on the host's part to forge an "everyman" persona in the way he carried himself throughout the controversy. During the episode of ''The Jay Leno Show'' that aired after it was made public that Leno had been offered the 11:35 time slot back, Leno portrayed himself as an ingenuous employee merely following NBC's instructions, making a point of stating "I don't have a manager, I don't have an agent" and referring to his preference of making direct, "handshake" deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.mediaite.com/tv/dont-blame-me-leno-addresses-late-night-mess-head-on/|publisher=Mediaite|title=Don't Blame Me! Leno Addresses Late-Night Mess Head On| date=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his claim of having no representation, Leno retained an agent (Steve Levine of International Creative Management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/media/nbc-s-tonight-show-cuts-staff-leno-takes-pay-cut-1.1063683|publisher=Gulf News Media|title=NBC's Tonight Show cuts staff, Leno takes pay cut| date=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a publicist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/12/jay-leno-revenge-of-the-everyman|publisher=Vanity Fair|title=JAY LENO: REVENGE OF THE EVERYMAN

Comedian [[Bill Burr]] found that Leno's ambition to take back ''The Tonight Show'' was less objectionable than his "passive-aggressive" behavior and the "powerless" public image Leno put forth instead of "owning up" to his maneuverings.  Burr argued that NBC "never gave [Conan] ''The Tonight Show''" in terms of network support, saying, "When Jay got ''The Tonight Show'', he didn't have to follow Johnny [Carson] bombing for an hour. [ ... ] Leno struggled for eighteen months before he got going, and he got to go on after a hit show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ZsYJLHfBo|publisher=YouTube|title=Bill Burr-Conan O'Brien Last Tonight Show| date=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian Jeff Garlin accused NBC of being "cheap", suggesting that the network tempted O'Brien with his dream job of hosting ''The Tonight Show'' because they did not want him to go to a competitor, but neither did they want to match what the competitors were offering.  Garlin accused Leno of undermining O'Brien's incipient ''Tonight Show'' by taking the 10 pm slot.  Garlin stated that while Leno had been nice to him over the years, the host displayed "no character" by taking the timeslot back.  Garlin vowed never to appear on Leno's ''Tonight Show'' thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tmz.com/2010/03/16/jay-leno-conan-obrien-jeff-garlin-tonight-show-nbc-radio-interview/|publisher=TMZ|title='Curb' Star Rips Jay Leno: He's Got No Character| date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', [[Nathan Rabin]] wrote that Leno had "raced past the reviled likes of [[Dane Cook]] and [[Carlos Mencia]] on the list of popular stand-ups hated by comedians and comedy writers."&lt;ref name="wsj11510"/&gt; Bill Zehme, the co-author of Leno's autobiography ''Leading with My Chin'', told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He's got everything to lose in terms of public popularity by going back. People will look at him differently. He'll be viewed as the bad guy."&lt;ref name="latimes11510-2"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-leno-backlash16-2010jan16,0,4645138.story?page=2 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Scott | last1=Collins | first2=Matea | last2=Gold | title=Taking on America's 'nice guy' | date=January 16, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Queenan]] from the ''Wall Street Journal'' went further in his criticism of Leno, jokingly comparing the controversy to [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Adolf Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704375604575023132215883398?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Joe | last=Queenan | title=NBC Will Regret Appeasing Leno | date=January 25, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Letterman]] was one of the more adamant critics of NBC and Leno's handling of the conflict. He noted that, "We went through our own version of this, 17, 18 years ago",&lt;ref name="letterman11510"&gt;''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' clip: "[http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/video/?pid=9jBgKjnj8VRTp7FwIvsOK8icPTJ7Dzpb&amp;vs=Big%20Show%20Highlights&amp;play=true David Letterman&amp;nbsp;– Will Jay Leno Do The Right Thing?]".&lt;/ref&gt; and he ridiculed Leno's recent "state of the network address", wherein Leno pleaded for viewers not to "blame Conan", with Letterman noting, "In the thousands and thousands of words that have been printed about this mess, who has blamed Conan?"&lt;ref name="lettermanvj"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-8LGTVF3_I "Dave responded to Jay's 'Don't Blame Conan'"] [[YouTube]]; January 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ct12010"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2010/01/conan-jay-david-letterman-blame-nbc-fiasco-mess-catastrophe-debacle.html | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Letterman on Leno's speech: 'He said we should not blame Conan ... and I said to myself no one is blaming Conan!' | date=January 20, 2010| accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mtv12010"&gt;''[[MTV News]]'' article: Anderson, Kyle.

[[Jon Stewart]] of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|The Daily Show]]'' reflected on the controversy, saying, "At least we don't have to deal with [[Jeff Zucker]]. That guy's like the [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] of television, [[Dick Cheney hunting incident|shooting shows in the face]]."&lt;ref name="tfp11710"&gt;''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]'' article: [http://timesfreepress.com/news/2010/jan/17/nbcs-slide-tvs-heights-late-night-punch-line/ NBC'S slide from TV's heights to a late-night punch line]".&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart also shouted "Team Conan" as his "Moment of Zen" at the end of the January 21 episode of ''The Daily Show''. [[Stephen Colbert]] of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' asked guest [[Morgan Freeman]] to read a list of "untrustworthy things", one of which paraphrased a statement made by Leno in 2004, "Conan: The 11:30 slot? Yours."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Colbert Report]]'' episode: "[http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/261286/january-11-2010/morgan-freeman January 11, 2010]."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jimmy Kimmel as Jay Leno.jpg|thumb|Fellow late-night host [[Jimmy Kimmel]] performed an entire show in character as Leno.]]
At ABC, [[Jimmy Kimmel]] of ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' donned a gray wig and fake chin, performing his entire January 12 show in character as Leno. With his bandleader Cleto Escobedo parodying Leno's bandleader [[Kevin Eubanks]], Kimmel started out his monologue with "It's good to be here on ABC. Hey, Cleto, you know what ABC stands for? Always Bump Conan." He also referenced the "People of Earth" letter, noting how O'Brien declined to participate in the "destruction" of ''The Tonight Show'', commenting as Leno that "Fortunately, though, I will! I'll burn it down if I have to!"{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=233}} Leno called Kimmel the next morning to discuss the bit, and at the end of the call, Leno suggested Kimmel come over and appear on his show. When his booking department called to confirm his appearance on a "10 at 10" segment (during which Leno asked 10 questions to a guest appearing remotely via satellite), Kimmel agreed immediately.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=235}} When he received the questions for his January 14 appearance—such as "What's your favorite snack junk food?"—he realized Leno intended to neutralize the scathing parody and paint the two as friends.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=237}}

Kimmel, however, was upfront with wanting to discuss the fiasco at hand, and during his appearance attempted to steer the questions that way; when asked about his favorite prank, he responded, "I think the best prank I ever pulled was, I told a guy once, 'Five years from now I'm going to give you my show.' And then when the five years came, I gave it to him and I took it back, almost instantly."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=238}} Later in the segment, when Leno asked, "Ever order anything off the TV?"  Kimmel replied, "Like when NBC ordered your show off the TV?"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcKpf6k3j5I&lt;/ref&gt;

Following similar remarks to more questions, Kimmel closed the segment with this comment: "Listen, Jay. Conan and I have children. All you have to take care of is cars! We have lives to lead here! You've got eight hundred million dollars! For God's sakes, leave our shows alone!"{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=238}} Leno never fought back and accepted the bit as comedy (he ascribed it as Kimmel attempting to score some publicity), but producer Vickers was furious.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=239}}

Kimmel discussed the appearance during an interview with [[Marc Maron]] for the latter's [[WTF with Marc Maron|podcast]] in 2012.  Kimmel stated that he felt O'Brien was not given a proper chance, but that he was also motivated by his own history with Leno. According to Kimmel, Leno had some years prior been in serious discussions with ABC about the possibility of jumping ship from NBC. During this period, Leno initiated a friendship with Kimmel, wanting to ensure that they would be on good terms if the move was made. (Under that scenario, Leno would have taken Kimmel's time slot and become his lead-in.)  However, after Leno made the arrangement to remain at NBC, "those conversations were gone," according to Kimmel. Realizing that Leno's relationship with him had been artificial, Kimmel felt "worked over," reasoning that Leno was using the ABC discussions as a bargaining tactic to try to get his old job back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_249_-_jimmy_kimmel "Episode 249&amp;nbsp;– Jimmy Kimmel"]. ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]''; January 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutrality of Jimmy Fallon===
The only late night host who remained neutral was [[Jimmy Fallon]], calling O'Brien and Leno "two of my heroes and two of my friends".&lt;ref name="hp11410"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/14/jimmy-fallon-weighs-in-on_n_423548.html "Jimmy Fallon Weighs In On Conan/Leno Drama"] ''[[Huffington Post]]''; January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He later joked that, "There's been three hosts of ''Late Night'': David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, and me. And if there's one thing I've learned from Dave and Conan, it's that hosting this show is a one-way ticket to ''not'' hosting ''The Tonight Show''." Ironically, Jimmy Fallon was selected to replace the retiring Jay Leno as host of ''The Tonight Show'' in February 2014.&lt;ref name = "hp11411"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/jimmy-fallon-to-take-over-tonight-show-official_n_3007684.html "Jimmy Fallon To Take Over 'The Tonight Show' From Jay Leno In Spring 2014"]. ''[[Huffington Post]]''; April 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense of Leno and criticism of O'Brien===
The comedians who came out in defense of Leno were far fewer and tended to have a professional or personal relationship with the host. Speaking to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', [[Jerry Seinfeld]] rebuffed the idea that NBC deserved blame and chastised O'Brien for pointing fingers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"What did the network do to him?" Seinfeld asked. "I don't think anyone's preventing people from watching Conan. Once they give you the cameras, it's on you. I can't blame NBC for having to move things around. I hope Conan stays, I think he's terrific. But there's no rules in show business, there's no [referees]."&lt;ref name="seinfeld"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thrfeed.com/2010/01/jerry-seinfeld-conan-has-nothing-to-complain-about.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304225011/http://www.thrfeed.com/2010/01/jerry-seinfeld-conan-has-nothing-to-complain-about.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 4, 2010 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |title=Jerry Seinfeld: Conan has nothing to complain about |date=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The irony of Seinfeld's stance was noted by at least one publication, as ''[[Seinfeld]]'' had itself weathered a rocky beginning thanks to the patience of NBC executive [[Rick Ludwin]], the benefit of a strong lead-in (''[[Cheers]]''), and years to develop its audience as opposed to O'Brien's six months.&lt;ref name="seinfeldcritic"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stereogum.com/1771932/shut_up_jerry_seinfeld/vg-loc/videogum/ |work=Stereogum |title=Shut Up, Jerry Seinfeld |date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]], who was a frequent contributor to Leno's shows, touched on the controversy repeatedly in interviews and on ''[[Opie and Anthony|The Opie &amp; Anthony Show]]'', calling the harsh criticism of Leno "amazing" and suggesting that Leno declining to walk away after stating otherwise was no worse than O'Brien "actually trying to force Jay out by telling the agents, 'If Conan doesn't get ''The Tonight Show'', he's leaving the network.'"&lt;ref name="nortonavcub"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jim-norton-talks-about-the-art-of-offensive-comedy-81923
|work=The AV Club|title=Jim Norton talks about the art of offensive comedy |date=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC executives served as Leno's chief defenders, with [[Dick Ebersol]], chairman of NBC Universal Sports, being particularly aggressive. Calling Leno's detractors "chicken-hearted and gutless," he summarized the late night situation as an "astounding failure" by O'Brien and further characterized O'Brien's and Letterman's barbed jokes about their rival as "professional jealousy." Addressing the common point about Conan's weak lead-in hurting his ability to build an audience in a different timeslot, Ebersol dismissed it as a "specious argument."&lt;ref name="ebersol"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/business/media/15conan.html |work=The New York Times |title=Executive leaps to Leno's defense |date=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Marc Maron that summer, O'Brien's longtime sidekick [[Andy Richter]] noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and the actions of the network. The demonstrable impact of ''The Jay Leno Show'' on the ratings of local news across the country was the direct cause of the cancellation of ''The Jay Leno Show'', and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that lead-ins are irrelevant. Leno's ''Tonight Show'', in contrast, had always enjoyed healthy lead-ins courtesy of a strong NBC primetime line-up.&lt;ref name="richterwtf"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_89_andy_richter |work=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast |title=Episode 89&amp;nbsp;– Andy Richter |date=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the network would have reportedly faced a US$150 million penalty in order to release Leno from his contract, making O'Brien the far less expensive host to get rid of.&lt;ref name="150million"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2010/01/20/conans-32m-leap-for-joy/|work=The New York Post |title=Conan's $32m leap for joy|date=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leno himself was among O'Brien's harshest critics, calling O'Brien's numbers "destructive to the franchise" despite O'Brien's success in the advertiser-friendly demographics combined with his significantly smaller salary.&lt;ref name="lenooprah"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/01/affiliates-executives-screwed-up-tonight-show-leno-tells-oprah.html|work=Chicago Tribune |title=Conan 'destructive' to 'Tonight Show' and media 'unfair,' Leno tells Oprah |date=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Leno's assessment of O'Brien's performance less than three months prior had been significantly different: "Personally, I think Conan is doing fine. He's beating Dave in the demo, maybe not in the popular one right now because Dave has a lot of other things going that have people watching for whatever reason, so I think that's not really a fair thing. It's a little too early to tell."&lt;ref name="lenofine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/jay-leno-talks-back-exclusive-interview-bc/35687/ |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |title=Jay Leno Talks Back: An Exclusive Interview With B&amp;C|date=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement==

===Negotiations===
Discussions neared completion regarding a financial settlement by January 14, and were expected to be in place following O'Brien's final week of shows—January 18–22—a concession O'Brien pushed to give his program a proper farewell.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=240}} Movement on the settlement slowed when run by General Electric (GE) executives, then-owners of NBCUniversal. NBC had several requests, among those that he not bring [[Howard Stern]] on the show his final week (which the O'Brien camp found slightly comical), and that they see the show's final week of scripts (which O'Brien never sent).{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=240}} Talks for much of the rest of the week went nowhere, and a Saturday ''[[New York Post]]'' story ran claiming that O'Brien's staff felt "betrayed" by his actions. The article claimed that the staff did not understand why O'Brien could not just take the 12:05 slot in order to keep their jobs, and that he was instead controlled by his ego. O'Brien was infuriated by the story—which he assumed to be a direct plant from NBC—as nearly all of his staff agreed he should walk.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=240}} He was personally appalled that the network challenged his character, as stressing severance for his employees was enormously important to him (he had paid them out of his own pocket [[2007–2008 Writer's Guild strike|during the writer's strike three years earlier]]).{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=240}}

NBC added more requests, which the O'Brien camp refused as unreasonable, such as the right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (e.g., a joke about the conflict/NBC).{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=241}} [[Jeffrey Immelt]], GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=241}} Negotiations continued into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=245}} On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host to walk away from the network.&lt;ref name="ew11910"&gt;''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' article: "[http://news-briefs.ew.com/2010/01/19/report-conan-getting-40-million-to-walk-from-nbc/ Report: Conan getting $40 million to walk from NBC]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nypost11610"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/nbc_near_deal_to_allow_conan_to_M1LlLoGAkxW4oLZS73jzTO |work=New York Post |title=NBC near deal to allow Conan to leave network |date=January 18, 2010 |accessdate= 28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cst11910"&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/television/1999598,conan-leno-staff-negotiation-nbc-011910.article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122070546/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/television/1999598%2Cconan-leno-staff-negotiation-nbc-011910.article |date=January 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his January 20 episode, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=245}} O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=246}}

In all, O'Brien received a US$45 million deal to leave NBC.&lt;ref name="bbc12110" /&gt; O'Brien received pay for the remaining two years of his contract (amounting to US$33 million), with additional payments to Jeff Ross, Andy Richter, and bandleader Max Weinberg.&lt;ref name="nola012110"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nola.com/tv/index.ssf/2010/01/conan_obrien_signs_departure_d.html |title=Conan O'Brien signs departure deal with NBC |author=Walker, Dave | newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]] | date=January 21, 2010 | accessdate=January 21, 2010| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20100126084903/http://www.nola.com/tv/index.ssf/2010/01/conan_obrien_signs_departure_d.html |archivedate=January 26, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severance pay for his staff was above standard GE levels (amounting in all to US$12 million), which O'Brien had stressed.&lt;ref name="abc12110-2" /&gt; O'Brien paid around 50 stagehands and various crew members at least six weeks severance pay out of his own pocket, as NBC gave those particular staffers nothing in the settlement.&lt;ref name="nydn"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/02/02/2010-02-02_conan_obrien_paying_salaries_of_former_staffers_left_out_of_nbc_deal__report.html | location=New York|date=February 2, 2010|title=Conan O'Brien paying salaries of former staffers left out of NBC deal|work=Daily News| accessdate= 10 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] said that they were "very happy" with how O'Brien treated his employees during the conflict.&lt;ref name="nydn" /&gt; The contract contained a clause prohibiting O'Brien from making negative remarks about NBC for a certain amount of time;&lt;ref name="abc12110-2"&gt;''[[ABC News]]'' article: "[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/nbc-confirms-deal-conan-obrien-speeds-nbc-show/story?id=9621682&amp;page=2 Conan's Payback: How Much Did O'Brien's Bugatti Stunt Cost NBC?]"&amp;nbsp;– Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ff12010"&gt;''Fairfield Mirror'' article: "[http://fairfieldmirror.com/2010/01/20/conan-o%E2%80%99brien-likely-to-sign-40-million-exit-deal-with-nbc/ Conan O’Brien Likely to Sign $40 Million Exit Deal with NBC]".&lt;/ref&gt; it did not, however, contain the previously rumored "mitigation clause", in which NBC would be able to keep some of the severance pay after O'Brien found a new network.&lt;ref name="abc12110-2" /&gt; It stipulated that he could return to television on another network no earlier than September 1, 2010.&lt;ref name="bbc12110"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8472865.stm |work=BBC News |title=Talk show host gets $45m pay-off |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc12110-2" /&gt;

===Final week===
[[File:I'm With Coco - Supporters.JPG|thumb|Supporters of Conan O'Brien rally outside [[Universal Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]]|alt=A gathering crowd where some people wear orange and hold signs that say "I'm With Coco".]]
The conflict only provided more comedy material for O'Brien's ''Tonight Show'' during its final episodes. Among other bits, O'Brien put the show up for sale on [[Craigslist]] ("Guaranteed to last for up to seven months; designed for 11:35, but can easily be moved!"), and then himself; looked back at clips from the show's seven-month tenure that were dubbed "Classic ''Tonight Show'' Moments"; and designed a bit to seem as though he were spending absurd amounts of NBC's money, such as customizing a [[Bugatti Veyron]], playing audio and video clips with expensive rebroadcast rights, and using a purported "rare ground sloth" to spray Beluga caviar on what was presented as an original Picasso.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=244}} Because the segments aired in days immediately following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] while national fundraising efforts (including some spearheaded by NBC) were ongoing, O'Brien received criticism for wasting resources. In response to the outcry over the expense of these sketches, O'Brien explained that the segments were indeed jokes, and many of the props were either [[counterfeit]]s or borrowed in exchange for promotional consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Episode #1.146 at Hulu |episodelink= |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/122598/the-tonight-show-with-conan-obrien-fri-jan-22-2010#s-p1-so-i0 |series=The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien |serieslink= |credits=Ross, Jeff (producer) |network=NBC |airdate=January 22, 2010 |season=1 |seriesno= |number=146 |minutes=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guest roster for O'Brien's final show on January 22—[[Tom Hanks]], [[Steve Carell]] and original first guest [[Will Ferrell]]—was regarded by O'Brien as a "dream lineup"; in addition, [[Neil Young]] performed his song "[[Long May You Run]]" and, as the show closed, was joined by [[Beck]], Ferrell (dressed as [[Ronnie Van Zant]]), [[Billy Gibbons]], [[Ben Harper]], O'Brien, [[Viveca Paulin]], and The Tonight Show Band to perform the [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song "[[Free Bird]]".{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=247}}

In his final moments on air, O'Brien stated that between ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', he had worked for NBC for over 20 years, and that he was "enormously proud of the work they have done together"; he then thanked NBC for the first time since announcing his intention to quit. O'Brien said his decision to quit as host was "the hardest thing [he] ever had to do".&lt;ref name="Goodbye"&gt;[http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/conan-says-goodbye-thank-you-nbc-and-free-bird-13418 " 'Conan Says Goodbye: A Thank-You to NBC and 'Free Bird' "],''thewrap.com'', Jan. 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He praised and gave thanks to his staff, and thanked his fans (specifically those who participated in the Los Angeles rally during periods of heavy rain) for their overwhelming support. He ended the show by offering heartfelt advice to his viewers in his farewell address, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All I ask of you is one thing ... I ask this particularly of the young people who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the taping, the studio set was used one final time for a party thrown by staff. O'Brien's monologue spot from the floor was framed and signed by his staff as a gift, which touched O'Brien.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=248}} 10.3 million people watched the final episode of ''The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien'', a notably high number for live late-night viewing and for a Friday night. The final episode scored a 7.0 household rating and a 4.4 rating in the 18–49 demo.&lt;ref name="Conan's Last Show"&gt;Gorman, Bill.

Leno's first ''Tonight Show'' back pulled in 6.6 million viewers, and his margin over Letterman again held for much of the rest of his run until his second ''Tonight Show'' departure in 2014.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=264}} While his numbers were down from his original incarnation of ''The Tonight Show'', "It's as if a collective erase button was pushed", said Robert Thompson, professor of television at [[Syracuse University]], "with the usual suspects back in their usual locations—except Conan is gone."{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=264}}

==Impact==
[[File:Conan O'Brien performing.jpg|right|200px|thumb|O'Brien performing a cover of "[[I Will Survive]]" on the first day of his tour in Eugene, Oregon.]]
According to NBC, if O'Brien continued hosting, it would have been the first year that ''The Tonight Show'' would have actually lost money, which Leno later contended was damaging to the franchise.&lt;ref name="Conan Destructive to Tonight Show"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/01/affiliates-executives-screwed-up-tonight-show-leno-tells-oprah.html |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Conan 'destructive' to 'Tonight Show' and media 'unfair,' Leno tells Oprah |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604022845/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2010/01/affiliates-executives-screwed-up-tonight-show-leno-tells-oprah.html |archivedate=June 4, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion was scorned by skeptical critics as it was calculated that Conan's ''Tonight Show'' would have made significantly more money in advertising than Leno's show did, due to his more favorable youth demographic numbers. Also Leno's larger staff, higher production costs, and higher salary would have by all accounts made Leno's ''Tonight Show'' more costly.&lt;ref&gt;Adalian, Josef.

==Aftermath==
''Conan'' premiered in November 2010 to 4 million viewers, leading all late-night talk shows and more than tripling the audience of its direct competition, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/09/conan-premiere-averages-4-2-million-viewers-2-5-adults-18-49-rating/71374 |title='Conan' Premiere Averages 4.2 Million Viewers, 2.5 Adults 18–49 Rating |publisher=TV by the Numbers |last=Gorman |first=Bill |accessdate=2010-11-14 |date=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ratings quickly fell; by the following fall, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' proclaimed that "TBS's pricey Conan O'Brien experiment is flopping."&lt;ref name="flop"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903639404576514691273411486?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424053111903639404576514691273411486.html |title=''Conan'' Falls Flat in Season 1| date=August 18, 2011 |author=Lauren A.E.

We've made him the centerpiece of TBS. If success were only about ratings, we'd just run Westerns all the time."&lt;ref name="HRcover" /&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' credited it with forging "a digital empire, his company's own shows and a young audience TBS hopes will follow him anywhere."  The show is currently renewed through 2022,&lt;ref name="ConanRenewal2022"&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/conan-obrien-tbs-late-night-contract-2022-1202429947/]. ''Variety''. Retrieved May 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; which will bring O'Brien to his twenty-ninth year as a late night host. He is currently the longest-running active late night host, and among all late night hosts only Johnny Carson (thirty years) and David Letterman (thirty-three years) have had longer tenures.

Many of the executives involved in the botched transition subsequently left NBC.&lt;ref name="HRcover" /&gt; Zucker was fired by Comcast Executive Vice President [[Steve Burke (businessman)|Steve Burke]], but stressed that Comcast's insistence to install their own team was the reason.{{sfn|Carter|2010|p=279}} Marc Graboff opted to leave his contract early that November, as did Gaspin.&lt;ref name="HRcover" /&gt; While O'Brien admitted in 2012 that he occasionally still felt resentment over the events that transpired, he noted that "I had an amazing partnership with NBC and was very disappointed at the outcome, but I didn't feel entitled to ''Late Night'' or ''Tonight'' or to the TBS show. If you're in this business and haven't experienced profound pain at some point, you're not doing it right. I strongly believe that."&lt;ref name="HRcover" /&gt; He has had no contact with Leno, noting "the odds are we will both leave this Earth without speaking to each other, which is fine.

A wax likeness of O'Brien that had been commissioned by NBC/Universal from [[Madame Tussauds]] and unveiled during a December 2009 episode of ''The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien'' was quietly returned to the Madame Tussauds museum on Hollywood Boulevard; the figure had originally been intended to permanently reside in the "NBC Universal Experience" theme park attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Universal-unveils-new-Conan-wax-statue/67461260506842/|title=Universal unveils new Conan wax statue |website=UPI|date=December 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A remote segment produced a few months into O'Brien's TBS show saw the host humorously reuniting with the wax statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wUTFaHkWlk|title= Conan Checks In On His Wax Figure |website=Youtube|date=January 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2011, O'Brien returned to [[GE Building|30 Rockefeller Plaza]] for a surprise, scripted appearance on ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' to ceremonially retrieve the [[Triumph the Insult Comic Dog]] puppet from the studio after NBC had finally granted him the rights to use the character on TBS's ''Conan''. During the two-and-a-half minute bit, O'Brien and Fallon joked about the controversy when Fallon said, "You were [host of ''Late Night''] for sixteen years. Then what happened?" to which O'Brien laughed and said, "Don't you worry about that. You're a young guy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5847216/conan-obrien-surprises-jimmy-fallon-on-late-night |title=Conan O'Brien Surprises Jimmy Fallon on Late Night |website=Gawker |first=Matt |last=Cherette |date=October 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720233420/http://gawker.com/5847216/conan-obrien-surprises-jimmy-fallon-on-late-night |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed by Marc Maron in 2011, O'Brien remarked, "I'm trying to avoid that thing where you get a story in your head that's very clean. I think there are too many people that come up with a very simple story where they're the hero, and they don't learn anything."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_163_-_conan_obrien "Episode 163&amp;nbsp;– Conan O'Brien"].

During his 2012 appearance on ''The Late Show with David Letterman'', O'Brien made it clear that he held no animosity toward NBC, pointing out that the individual executives he clashed with had departed the network shortly after he did due to a regime change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQF5JF06NYM "Conan O'Brien on Letterman"]. ''[[YouTube]]''; May 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Conan has occasionally shown clips from his NBC shows on his current TBS program with NBC's permission, and the character of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (owned by NBC) was eventually allowed to appear on the TBS show as well, with Triumph's performer [[Robert Smigel]] explaining that NBC only stands to gain by allowing him to give their property exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y9m04/hey_its_robert_smigel_creator_and_handupass_of/cp7kax0/ "Robert Smigel AMA"].

In an interview on ''Piers Morgan Live'', also in 2012, O'Brien acknowledged that in retrospect the plan to architect a transition for ''The Tonight Show'' five years in advance was "absurd," though he noted that he never anticipated Leno's ratings would fall in that interim, as the press had sometimes intimated, and he pointed out that all previous ''Tonight Show'' hosts had departed when they were on top in the ratings. He further remarked that he was happier in his current situation at TBS where he feels "liberated" and can do the material he wants without the baggage of upholding a legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQMuQK_B1og "Conan on Piers Morgan Live"].

In 2013, O'Brien was the headline performer invited to give remarks at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and ''The Tonight Show'' controversy was humorously alluded to throughout the evening.  During his own speech, President Obama quipped, "I understand that when the Correspondents' Association was considering Conan for this gig, they were faced with that age-old dilemma: Do you offer it to him now, or wait for five years and then give it to Jimmy Fallon?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON2XWvyePH8&amp;t=364s "President Obama at 2013 White House Correspondents' Dinner (C-SPAN)"]. ''[[YouTube]]''; April 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Brien himself referenced the affair with a joke that complimented President Obama on job creation: "Since [Obama] was first elected, the number of popes has doubled, and the number of ''Tonight Show'' hosts has tripled."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIgSgLFwEMs&amp;t=92s "Conan O'Brien remarks at 2013 White House Correspondents' Dinner (C-SPAN)"]. ''[[YouTube]]''; April 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceremony had also opened with a pre-recorded sketch that featured Kevin Spacey as his ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' character Frank Underwood, who at one point expresses sympathy toward O'Brien for "that backstabbing Leno."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7FVYJ6ONXk&amp;t=312s "'Frank Underwood' to Obama: 'Welcome to Nerd Prom' | ABC News Exclusive | ABC News"]. ''[[YouTube]]''; April 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, O'Brien was chosen to host ''Carson on TCM'', a series that re-aired classic interviews from ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2013/06/conan-obrien-to-host-carson-on-tcm-514047/|title=Conan O'Brien To Host 'Carson On TCM'|date=June 5, 2013|publisher=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Leno participated in a ''60 Minutes'' episode focused on the host's second and permanent departure from ''The Tonight Show'' desk.  Leno expressed to Steve Kroft that he had been "blindsided" in 2004 when NBC executives asked him to relinquish ''The Tonight Show'' in five years' time, though he admitted that he had accepted the decision with no argument or inquiry.  In spite of this and the public remarks Leno had made at the time blessing O'Brien's succession, both Leno and his wife Mavis characterized ''The Tonight Show'' as having been taken from the incumbent host, rather than being something that he had voluntarily surrendered.  When Leno explained that he was more willing to step aside the second time due to the considerable talent of Fallon and because "talented people will only wait so long before they get other opportunities," Kroft pointed out that Leno had said very similar things about O'Brien years before.  "Well, maybe I did, yeah," admitted Leno before joking, "Well, we'll see what happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jay-leno-on-leaving-the-tonight-show/|title=Jay Leno on leaving "The Tonight Show"|date=January 26, 2014|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, O'Brien explained that he prefers to avoid talking about the "craziness," stating that people in show business shouldn't complain, that "no one cares", and that he noticed addressing the topic even in joking response to an earnest question by a guest on his show invariably resulted in admonishments from the media to "let it go." He claimed that even in hindsight he does not regret doing five more years of ''Late Night'' instead of moving to FOX, nor does he regret his incarnation of ''The Tonight Show.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.howardstern.com/news/2015/2/26/conan-obrien-like-youve-never-heard-him-before/ "Conan O'Brien: Like You've Never Heard Him Before"].

Leno kept ''The Tonight Show'' number one for the rest of his run, until he handed the franchise to Fallon in February 2014. Fallon's credibility with younger viewers and presence online was why NBC instituted the change, which was announced only three years following O'Brien's departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/can-jimmy-fallon-convince-america-hes-a-worthy-successor-to-tonight-show-throne-1200581941/|title=Can Jimmy Fallon Convince America He's a Worthy Successor to ''Tonight Show'' Throne?|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 20, 2013|author= Brian Steinberg |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the show that aired the day of the announcement, Conan congratulated Fallon, stating, "Jimmy is the perfect guy to do it, and he's gonna do a fantastic job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJWxrCpRlgk|title=Conan Wishes Jimmy Fallon Good Luck |publisher=YouTube|date=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While alluding to (and joking about) the 2010 controversy many times over his last few weeks on the air, Leno did not directly acknowledge his nine-month absence from the franchise nor did he mention O'Brien when he delivered his thank-yous and goodbyes as he concluded his second tenure as host. During the February 6, 2014, episode of ''Conan'', however, which aired the same night as Leno's final ''Tonight Show'', O'Brien referenced Leno in his monologue by alluding to NBC's position as the American broadcaster of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;NBC has the Olympics. It's a big deal. NBC will finally get to show somebody who is okay with passing the torch.

Though NBC had made a considerable effort to scrub any references to O'Brien's brief tenure as ''The Tonight Show'' host both on-air and online, with one former blogger for NBC Sports noting a corporate policy banning any mention of O'Brien,&lt;ref name="ConanBanned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/video/conans-chris-christie-hostage-face-sketch-is-gold-as-christie-himself-denies-any-regrets/|title=CONAN'S CHRIS CHRISTIE 'HOSTAGE-FACE' SKETCH IS GOLD, BUT CHRISTIE HIMSELF DENIES ANY TRUMP REGRETS|first=Rick|last=Chandler|date=March 3, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016|publisher=Sportsgrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was acknowledged by the network during the buildup to the 2014 transition from Leno to Fallon.

Less than a month removed from hosting ''Tonight'', Leno appeared on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' on February 26, 2014, as a surprise guest to deliver the news that the revived program had been renewed by CBS Television Distribution for a second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/jay-leno-shows-arsenio-hall-show-article-1.1703332|title=Jay Leno makes surprise appearance on 'Arsenio Hall Show' to announce show's renewal|first=Don|last=Kaplan|website=[[New York Daily News]]|date=February 26, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be premature, however, as Hall's program was indeed canceled on May 30, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jay-leno-was-wrong-the-arsenio-hall-show-will-not-return-for-a-second-season/|title=Jay Leno Was Wrong: The Arsenio Hall Show Will Not Return for a Second Season|website=Mediaite.com|first=Matt|last=Wilstein|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian Bill Maher paid tribute to Leno when he was inducted into the TV Academy, an honor bestowed upon the host in 2014 when he stepped down from ''The Tonight Show'' a second time.  A longtime friend of Leno, Maher complained that Leno was "victimized" by the press during the NBC fiasco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2014/03/jay-leno-julia-louis-dreyfus-bill-maher-amy-poehler-david-e-kelly-rupert-murdoch-brandon-stoddard-tv-academy-hall-of-fame-697582/|title=Jay Leno Reminds Bill Maher Of Israel As He's Inducted Into TV Academy Hall Of Fame With Rupert Murdoch, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, David E Kelley, Ray Dolby &amp; Brandon Stoddard: Video|last=Moraes|first=Lisa de|date=2014-03-12|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 interview Leno reiterated his stance that O'Brien's own performance led to his ouster from 11:35 and that he remained mystified by the suggestion that he should have refused the time slot when it was offered back to him, saying "Why? Because Conan and I were good friends? No. At that point ... it's a business decision. I'm sure it could have been handled differently. But I think it was a matter of letting things take its course. If Conan's ratings would have been fine, it wouldn't have been an issue. It wouldn't have come up."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/theatre-and-performance/qa-jay-lenos-real-talk-on-comedy-conan-and-one-direction/article24119149/ "Q&amp;A: Jay Leno’s real talk on comedy, Conan and One Direction"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''; April 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Leno again absolved himself, instead emphasizing that he kept ''The Tonight Show'' number one after his return.  He addressed the longstanding claim that his contract was the more expensive one to break with equivocation: "I mean, if I'm that smart, how did I lose the show in the first place?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/awards-chatter-podcast-jay-leno-jay-lenos-garage-1016536|title='Awards Chatter' Podcast — Jay Leno ('Jay Leno's Garage')|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he took over ''Tonight'', Fallon insisted that Leno is welcome to appear on the show anytime he wishes, saying "whenever he wants, he's got a stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-fallon-invites-jay-leno-677326|title=Jimmy Fallon Invites Jay Leno to Be Guest on New 'Tonight Show'|first=Hilary|last=Lewis|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 5, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Leno|Leno]] made his first appearance as a guest on November 7, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/jay-leno-teases-jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-return-article-1.2003790|title=Jay Leno teases Jimmy Fallon during return to 'The Tonight Show' |first=Kirthana|last=Ramisetti|website=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 8, 2014|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he had previously appeared in a produced ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' [[parody]] on August 12, 2014, in which he is revealed as the mystery man who pushes Fallon (as [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]]) onto the tracks in front of a speeding subway train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/house-cue-cards-perfect-parody-article-1.1902728|title='House of Cue Cards' on 'Tonight Show' is the perfect 'House of Cards' parody|first=Kirthana|last=Ramisetti|website=[[New York Daily News]] |date=August 13, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leno has subsequently appeared on ''Tonight'' several times in the years since.

On February 13, 2015, Robert Smigel appeared in character as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog on ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'' to promote ''[[The Jack and Triumph Show]]''. During the interview, he joked about the conflict to a visibly nervous Fallon.  "Listen, we love NBC. NBC ... we kid, you know?  NBC will always be the place where Jack and I got our start.  And where they f**cked Conan."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxup-VFuLrQ "Jack McBrayer Struggles to Talk over Triumph's Quiet Reading"]. ''[[YouTube]]''; February 13th, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2015, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' made reference to the controversy. When former host [[Jon Stewart]] made a guest appearance on the show, current host [[Trevor Noah]] jokingly remarked "Are you here to take the show back? Oh, man, I heard about this in American TV. Are you taking the show back?". Stewart replied, quietly, "Trust me, a thousand times no".

Over time, as the controversy has become more distant, formal acknowledgement of O'Brien's lengthy career at NBC has become more common by the network.  In 2017, mention was made of the host in NBC's 90th Anniversary Special, and a display for him (along with all other former ''Tonight Show'' hosts) appears in the ride queue of the ''[[Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' theme park attraction at [[Universal Studios Florida]].  A plaque on the O'Brien display reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In September 1993, Conan O'Brien made his television debut on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' after working as a writer on such television comedy institutions as ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''The Simpsons''.  O'Brien's brand of irreverent humor proved to be a hit with the late night audience, including memorable sketches like "If They Mated," "In the Year 2000," and "Triumph the Insult Comic Dog."  In September 2004, on the 50th anniversary of ''The Tonight Show'', NBC announced that O'Brien would take over hosting duties from Jay Leno in 2009.  While his time as host proved to be short-lived, O'Brien went on to launch a new late night talk show, ''Conan'', on TBS in November 2010.  Conan O'Brien remains a true comedy innovator and, at almost 25 years on the air, has enjoyed one of the longest runs of any late night television host.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In conjunction with his 25th anniversary as a late-night host, it was announced that O'Brien, TBS and NBC had come to an arrangement that would allow the entirety of O'Brien’s late night archive (with the exception of musical performances, which posed insurmountable licensing issues), totaling over four thousand episodes, to become available in January 2019 via a state-of-the-art web site dubbed "Conan 25".  The launch marks the first time O'Brien's NBC programs have been made legally available since ''The Tonight Show'' conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/conan-obriens-complete-late-night-tv-archive-will-be-posted-online-in-january/ "Conan O’Brien’s complete late-night TV archive will be posted online in January [Updated]"].

From mid 2014 to 2016, Brazil experienced a severe [[economic crisis]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/michel-temer-signs-security-decree-stem-rio-violence-180216183747559.html|title=Michel Temer signs security decree to stem Rio violence|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barua |first1=Akrur |title=Brazil: Yearning for the good times |url=http://dupress.com/articles/global-economic-outlook-q2-2016-brazil/ |series=Global Economic Outlook, Q2 2016 |location= |publisher=Deloitte University Press |accessdate=21 May 2016 |date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic crisis became coupled with a political crisis in Brazil that resulted in the impeachment of president [[Dilma Rousseff]] and in widespread dissatisfaction with the political system.

In 2015, Brazil's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) fell by 3.9% due to a drop in salaries, restrictions on credit and a rise in the basic [[interest rate]]. In 2016, Brazil's GDP fell by 3.6% with reductions across all sectors of the economy. It was the first time since 1931 that the GDP had fallen in two consecutive years.
In 2017 first quarter the economy up 1.4% and the recession had finally ended.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/08/c_136110450.htm |title=Brazil GDP falls by 3.6 percent in 2016 |author=Mu Xuequan |date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unemployment ==
Before the recession, Brazil's [[unemployment]] rate hovered around 6.8% for most of 2014 and had been generally increasing since February 2015, averaging 8.5% in 2015. The economy lost more than 1.5 million jobs throughout 2015, fueling public discontent against the political establishment and the political leadership of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]] and President [[Dilma Rousseff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-15/brazil-s-unemployment-jumps-in-2015-adding-to-rousseff-s-woes|title=Brazil's unemployment jumps in 2015, adding to Rousseff's woes|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unemployment rate continued to rise throughout 2016 to finish the year at 12.0%, with 12.3 million people unemployed and an estimated 2.8 million private sector jobs cut over the preceding two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-economy-employment-idUSKBN15F1LE|title=Brazil's jobless rate ends 2016 at 12 percent with 12.3 million unemployed|publisher=Reuters|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Budget deficit ==
Brazil is currently experiencing a [[fiscal crisis]] and an increasing [[budget deficit]] which, according to Bloomberg, has been "the largest-ever primary budget gap ... as a two-year [[economic recession]] sapped tax collection while expenses grew further."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-30/brazil-posts-largest-budget-deficit-for-february-ever
|title=Brazil posts largest budget deficit for february ever
|publisher=Bloomberg
|accessdate=18 May 2016
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The government deficit reached 5.8 billion reais (U$1.7 billion) in the first three months of 2016, the widest reported since December 2001. The two-year fiscal deterioration can be explained by the decrease in government revenue from taxes as a result of the recession, while expenses from government have been growing constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/brazil-records-worst-ever-first-quarter-budget-deficit|title=Brazil records worst ever first quarter budget deficit|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==
[[File:Entrevistas Diversas (30847431200).jpg|[[Henrique Meirelles]], the [[Ministry of Finance (Brazil)|Minister of Finance]] from May 2016 to April 2018.|thumb]]Since the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff and the subsequent rise of [[Michel Temer]] to power a variety of projects, many of which seen as unpopular, were proposed in order to get the economy back on track. In early 2017, there were already signals that the economy was beginning to recover, however, it was agreed that the process would be long and slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recuperação da economia brasileira será longa e lenta, aponta 'FT'|url=http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,recuperacao-da-economia-brasileira-sera-longa-e-lenta-aponta-ft,70001658076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recuperação da economia brasileira ainda é lenta, diz presidente do Itaú|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2017/04/1876544-recuperacao-da-economia-brasileira-ainda-e-lenta-diz-presidente-do-itau.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, a 1% rise in GDP in the first quarter of the year was reported.&lt;ref name="jn"&gt;{{Citar web |id= periódico|data=2017-06-01|titulo=PIB do primeiro trimestre cresce 1% após oito quedas seguidas |obra=Jornal Nacional |url= http://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2017/06/pib-do-primeiro-trimestre-cresce-1-apos-oito-quedas-seguidas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first rise of the GDP after eight consecutive falls (two years).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;
{{Cite news|title= PIB do Brasil cresce 1% no 1º trimestre de 2017, após 8 quedas seguidas|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/pib-do-brasil-cresce-10-no-1-trimestre-de-2017.ghtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of Finance [[Henrique Meirelles]] said that the country had exited the "greatest recession of the century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=PIB sobe 1% no 1º trimestre, após oito quedas consecutivas|url=http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,pib-sobe-1-0-no-1-trimestre-apos-oito-quedas-consecutivas,70001821658}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economists say that the growth characterizes only the end of the "technical recession" and that it is still too early to claim that the crisis is over, given that unemployment remains high and there's still widespread uncertainty regarding the future of the economy, especially in the aftermath of the recent political scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PIB positivo é 'saída técnica' da recessão, mas recuperação é incerta; entenda|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/pib-positivo-e-saida-tecnica-da-recessao-mas-recuperacao-e-incerta-entenda.ghtml|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article documents expected notable '''spaceflight events during the year 2019'''.

China intends to launch [[Chang'e 5]], the first [[sample-return mission]] to the Moon since [[Luna 24]] in 1976, and to test a new generation of crewed spacecraft. Both of these missions will use the recently developed [[Long March 5]] [[heavy-lift rocket]]. India plans to launch the delayed [[Chandrayaan-2]] lunar orbiter/lander/rover in January. Some of the participants in the expired [[Google Lunar X Prize]] plan to launch their private missions to the Moon in 2019, first being [[SpaceIL]] with their [[Sparrow (spacecraft)|''Sparrow'']] lander.&lt;ref name=Shoshanna /&gt;

The United States are expected to regain crewed launch capabilities lost after the [[Space Shuttle]] retirement in 2011. Crew capsules [[Dragon 2]] by [[SpaceX]] and [[CST-100 Starliner]] by [[Boeing]] are scheduled to fly their demonstration missions to the [[International Space Station]] as part of NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] program.&lt;ref name=us-com /&gt;

[[Blue Origin]] plans to send its own employees on board of [[New Shepard]] for the first crewed suborbital flight in the first half of 2019.&lt;ref name=gw-20181010&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geekwire.com/2018/blue-origin-resets-schedule-first-crew-space-2019-first-orbital-launch-2021/ |title=Blue Origin resets schedule: First crew to space in 2019, first orbital launch in 2021 |publisher=[[Geekwire]] |date=10 October 2018 |access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of this section, the yearly tally of orbital launches by country assigns each flight to the country of origin of the rocket, not to the launch services provider or the spaceport. For example, [[Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre|Soyuz launches by Arianespace in Kourou]] are counted under Russia because [[Soyuz-2]] is a Russian rocket.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">'''''23 Minutes Over Brussels''''' is a recording of a live performance by [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] on June 16, 1978, at the [[Ancienne Belgique]] in [[Brussels]], Belgium, while supporting [[Elvis Costello]] and [[The Clash]]. The recording was first released as a promo in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/suicide/21__minutes_in_berlin___23_minutes_in_brussels/ |title=21½ Minutes in Berlin / 23 Minutes in Brussels by Suicide : Reviews and Ratings - Rate Your Music|publisher=rateyourmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained largely unheard until its release in 1998 with the reissue of the band's [[Suicide (1977 album)|self-titled debut album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Suicide-Suicide/release/627068 |title=Suicide - Suicide (CD, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording "gives some indication of the public's reaction to this confrontational duo in their heyday".&lt;ref name="Hear Before You Die Page 386"&gt;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2008 Edition)-Dimmery, Robert Page 386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
A friend of the band, Howard Thompson, recorded the performance on cassette tape, and it was later released as a flexi-disc insert for a music magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/641/ Recording notes&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, while [[Mute Records]] was rereleasing Suicide's catalog, the tape was remastered and included as a bonus track for their [[Suicide (1977 album)|first album]]. The entire performance is mixed as a single track.

==History==

Before Suicide even starts playing, booing can be heard from the crowd indicating that they wanted to hear the main act, [[Elvis Costello]], straight away. Suicide is introduced and begins to play "Ghost Rider". Once it ends, there is booing from the crowd. The second song is "Rocket U.S.A". After that, at roughly 9:30, the audience can be heard chanting "ELVIS! ELVIS!". This attitude continues through the third and fourth songs, "Cheree" and "Dance".

The audience becomes more active during the performance of "[[Frankie Teardrop]]". At roughly 19:30, loud applause can be heard; someone steals [[Alan Vega]]'s microphone (a woman at 20:35 can be heard saying "They took the mic"). Shortly afterwards, the music stops and the promoter comes on, warning the audience that if they don't give the microphone back, there will be "no show". Vega joins in, swearing at the audience. After receiving the microphone, he continues to sing "Frankie Teardrop" [[a cappella]]. After even more booing, Vega shouts "SHUT THE FUCK UP! THIS IS ABOUT FRANKIE!". A few moments later, there is rapturous applause as the band leaves the stage.

Later, Elvis Costello played a very short and angry set in which he made no secret of his outrage over Suicide's treatment by the crowd. This incited a riot. The show was cancelled and Vega's nose was broken. The story is detailed in the liner notes of the 2000 re-release.&lt;ref name="headheritage1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/review/641/ |title=Julian Cope presents Head Heritage &amp;#124; Unsung &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Suicide - 23 Minutes Over Brussels |publisher=Headheritage.co.uk |date=1978-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack |url=http://poundforpound.blogspot.com/2008/12/suicide-23-minutes-over-brussels.html |title=Pound for Pound: Suicide - 23 Minutes Over Brussels |publisher=Poundforpound.blogspot.com |date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Suicide would only become famous after the peak of their activity was over. During the 1980s and 90s, they were responsible for influencing many bands and shaping genres such as [[industrial music]], [[dance music]] and notably [[electroclash]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This performance has been called "a record of proof of an innovative band’s struggle with an unreceptive audience" and has been compared to the audience's reactions to [[Electric Dylan controversy|Dylan going electric]]. It also "clearly demonstrates two individuals flying in the face of convention, screaming their guts out to be heard, and failing to make a poignant imprint on the listening audience".&lt;ref name="headheritage1"/&gt; [[Allmusic]] said that "though the (reissues) extra tracks dilute the original album's impact somewhat, they're worthwhile supplements to one of the punk era's most startlingly unique works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phares |first=Heather |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r19328/review |title=Suicide [First Album&amp;#93; - Suicide |publisher=AllMusic |date=1978-06-16 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In review of their debut album for [[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]], [[Chris Shade]] called it a "riotous comedy", and noted that "(their) lack of [[rock 'n' roll]] accoutrements such as a drummer or guitarist often aroused violent reactions in their bewildered audiences".&lt;ref name="Hear Before You Die Page 386"/&gt;

==Motivation of perpetrators==
The intention of the attacker is often to humiliate rather than to kill the victim. In Britain such attacks, particularly those against men, are believed to be underreported, and as a result many of them do not show up in official statistics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Some of the most common motivations of perpetrators include:
* Personal conflict regarding intimate relationships, and sexual rejection&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673610618636/fulltext?rss=yes|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|issue=9748|page=1209|accessdate=20 April 2016 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61863-6|year=2010|last1=Solberg|first1=Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; 
* Racial motivations
* Sexual related jealousy and lust&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206231722/http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 February 2017|title=Wayback Machine|date=6 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social, political and religious motivations
* Gang violence and rivalry
* Attacks against minorities
* Conflicts over land ownership, farm animals, housing and property&lt;ref name=Bahl_Syed/&gt;
* Revenge for refusal of sexual advances, proposals of [[marriage]] and demands for [[dowry]]&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay_Khan" /&gt;

Additionally, anecdotal evidence for acid attacks exists in other regions of the world such as [[South America]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=13a /&gt; However, [[South Asia]]n countries maintain the highest incidence of acid attacks.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

Police in the United Kingdom have noted that many victims are afraid to come forward to report attacks, meaning the true scale of the problem may be unknown.&lt;ref name=telegraph_policestats&gt;{{cite news|title=True scale of acid attacks hidden as victims too scared to come forward, police say|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/22/partner-towie-star-wanted-nightclub-acid-attack-thought-have/|date=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
An accurate estimate of the gender ratio of victims and perpetrators is difficult to establish because many acid attacks are not reported or recorded by authorities. According to a 2010 study in ''[[The Lancet]]'', there are "no reliable statistics" on the prevalence of acid attacks in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A 2007 literature review analyzed 24 studies in 13 countries over the past 40 years, covering 771 cases.&lt;ref name=3a/&gt; According to the London-based charity Acid Survivors Trust International 60% of acid attacks are on women, and acid assaults are grossly under-estimated. In some regions, assaults perpetrated on female victims by males are often driven by the mentality "If I can't have you, no one shall."&lt;ref&gt;Bhalla, Nita (9 July 2013) [http://www.trust.org/item/20130709160626-j5dfo/?source=dpagehead India's top court says gov't not trying to stop acid attacks]. ''Thomson Reuters Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bangladesh, throwing acid has been labeled as a "gender crime", as there is a dominance of female victims who are assaulted by males, for the reason of refusing to marry, or refusing sexual advances from male perpetrators&lt;ref name="kln.ac.lk"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.05.002|pmid=17095164|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206231722/http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-02-06|title=Cases of chemical assault worldwide: A literature review|journal=Burns|volume=33|issue=2|page=149|year=2007|last1=Mannan|first1=Ashim|last2=Ghani|first2=Samuel|last3=Clarke|first3=Alex|last4=Butler|first4=Peter E.M.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In Jamaica, women throwing acid on other women in relation to fights over male partners is a common cause.&lt;ref name="kln.ac.lk"/&gt; In the UK, the majority of victims are men, and many of these attacks are related to gang violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Another factor that puts victims at increased risk for an acid assault is their [[socioeconomic status]], as those living in [[poverty]] are more likely to be attacked.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; {{as of|2013}}, the three nations with the most noted incidence of acid attacks – Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia – were ranked 75th, 101st, and 104th, respectively, out of 136 countries on the [[Global Gender Gap]] Index, a scale that measures equality in opportunities between men and women in nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2013.pdf|title=The Global Gender Gap report|website=3.weforum.org|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, American attorney [[Burt Pugach]] hired a man to throw [[lye]] in the face of his ex-girlfriend Linda Riss. Riss suffered blindness and permanent scarring.

===Mexico===
Drug cartels such as the [[Los Zetas]] are known to use acid on civilians. For example, In the [[2011 San Fernando massacre]], Los Zetas members took away children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the civilians in a bus. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten. Screams of the women and of the children being put in acid were also heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2011/288998/6/de-frente-y-de-perfil.htm|title=De frente y de perfil|work=El Informador :: Noticias de Jalisco, México, Deportes &amp; Entretenimiento|access-date=2018-04-04|language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Asia===
In South Asia, acid attacks have been used as a form of revenge for refusal of sexual advances, proposals of [[marriage]] and demands for [[dowry]].&lt;ref name="Bandyopadhyay_Khan" /&gt; Scholars Taru Bahl and M.H. Syed say that [[territorial dispute|land/property disputes]] are another leading cause.&lt;ref name=Bahl_Syed/&gt;

====Bangladesh====
[[File:Supporting acid attack survivors in Bangladesh (6395599437).jpg|thumb|250px|Acid attack victims in Bangladesh.]]
In Bangladesh, such attacks are relatively common.&lt;ref name="Scholte_Spiegel" /&gt;
Bangladesh has the highest reported incidence of acid assault in the world.&lt;ref name=3a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mannan|first=Ashim|author2=Samuel Ghani|author3=Alex Clarke|author4=Peter E.M.

They describe it as a relatively recent form of violence, with the earliest record in Bangladesh from 1983.&lt;ref name=Bandyopadhyay_Khan/&gt;

Acid attacks are often referred to as a "[[crime of passion]]", fueled by jealousy and revenge.&lt;ref name=3a /&gt; Actual cases though, show that they are usually the result of rage at a woman who rebuffs the advances of a male. For the country of Bangladesh, such passion is often rooted in [[marriage]] and relationships. One study showed that refusal of [[marriage proposal]]s accounted for 55% of acid assaults, with abuse from a husband or other family member (18%), property disputes (11%) and refusal of sexual or romantic advances (2%) as other leading causes.&lt;ref name="6a"/&gt; Additionally, the use of acid attacks in dowry arguments has been reported in Bangladesh,&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; with 15% of cases studied by the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]] citing dowry disputes as the motive.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; The chemical agents most commonly used to commit these attacks are [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name=Anwary1&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Anwary | first = Afroza | date = 2002 | title = Acid Violence And Medical Care In Bangladesh: Women's Activism as Carework |journal= Gender &amp; Society | pages = 305–313 | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1177/0891243202250851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
Acid attacks in India, like Bangladesh, have a gendered aspect to them: analyses of news reports revealed at least 72% of reported attacks  included at least one female victim.&lt;ref name="12a2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/AvonGlobalCenterforWomenandJustice.pdf|title=Combating Acid Violence In Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia|authors=Avon Global Center for Women and Justice at Cornell Law School, Committee on International Human Rights of the New York City bar Association, Cornell Law School international Human Rights Clinic, and the Virtue Foundation|year=2011|publisher=Avon Foundation for Women|pages=1–64|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Bangladesh, India's incidence rate of chemical assault has been increasing in the past decade, with a high 27 reported cases in 2010.&lt;ref name="12a2" /&gt; Altogether, from January 2002 to October 2010, 153 cases of acid assault were reported in Indian print media&lt;ref name="12a2" /&gt; while 174 judicial cases were reported for the year of 2000.&lt;ref name="9a2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=N.|date=September 2011|title=Acid attacks on women: An appraisal of the Indian legal response|journal=Asia Pacific Journal on Human Rights and the Law|volume=12|issue=2|pages=55–72|doi=10.1163/138819011X13215419937940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation behind acid attacks in India mirrors those in Bangladesh: a study of Indian news reports from  January 2002 to October 2010 uncovered that victims’ rejected sex or marriage proposals motivated attacks in 35% of the 110 news stories providing a motive for the attack.&lt;ref name="12a2" /&gt; Notable cases of acid attacks are [[Sonali Mukherjee]]'s case of 2003 and [[Laxmi Agarwal]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.beaninspirer.com/laxmi-agarwal-brave-acid-attack-victim-presenting-hope-acid-attack-victims/|title=Laxmi Agarwal – A Brave Acid Attack Victim who is presenting hope to all of the Acid-attack Victims|date=2016-12-05|work=Be An Inspirer|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2002 riots in Gujarat]], targeted violence against Muslim women and children documented by civil society groups reported "mass rapes, live burials and burnings, acid attacks, impaling, and other brutal forms of torture that was deeply gendered, and linked violence against women with violence on their children – both born and unborn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children and Violence – Politics of Conflict in South Asia|last1=Jacob|first1=Cecilia|date=October 2016|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9781107117242|editor1-last=D'Costa|editor1-first=Bina|page=203|chapter=Children Affected by Political Violence in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kandhamal riots|2008 Kandhamal Riots]], more than 100 Christians were gang-raped, disemboweled, burned alive and had acid thrown to their faces by [[Hindu extremism|Hindu extremists]] for refusing to convert.

Police in India are also known to use acid on individuals, particularly on their eyes, causing blindness to the victims. A well known such case is the [[1980 Bhagalpur blindings|Bhagalpur blindings]], where police blinded 31 individuals under trial (or convicted criminals, according to some versions) by pouring acid into their eyes. The incident was widely discussed, debated and acutely criticized by several human rights organizations. The Bhagalpur blinding case had made criminal jurisprudence history by becoming the first in which the Indian Supreme Court ordered compensation for violation of basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/19801231-bhagalpur-blindings-represents-one-of-the-darkest-chapters-in-indias-history-773650-2013-11-29|title=Bhagalpur blindings represents one of the darkest chapters in India's history|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
According to ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Nicholas D. Kristof]], acid attacks are at an all-time high in Pakistan and increasing every year. The Pakistani attacks he describes are typically the work of husbands against their wives who have "[[Honor killing|dishonored them]]."&lt;ref name="video.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| title=Acid Attacks |url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2008/11/29/opinion/1194834033797/acid-attack.html | work=The New York Times | first=Rob | last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics compiled by the [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]] (HRCP) show that 46 acid attacks occurred in Pakistan during 2004 and decreased with only 33 acid assaults reported for 2007.&lt;ref name=13a /&gt; According to a ''New York Times'' article, in 2011 there were 150 acid attacks in Pakistan, up from 65 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/world/asia/hope-in-pakistan-for-curbing-acid-attacks.html?pagewanted=all|title= After Suicide, New Focus on Acid Attacks in Pakistan|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2012-04-10|first=Declan|last=Walsh}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, estimates by the [[Human Rights Watch]] and the HRCP cite the number of acid attack victims to be as high 400–750 per year.&lt;ref name=13a /&gt; Motivation behind acid assaults range from [[marriage proposal]] rejections to [[religious fundamentalism]].&lt;ref name=13a /&gt;

===East Asia and Southeast Asia===
{{see also|Hong Kong acid attacks}}

====China====
The [[Hong Kong acid attacks|Mong Kok acid attacks]] were incidents in 2008, 2009, and 2010 where plastic bottles filled with [[corrosive]] liquid ([[drain cleaner]]) were thrown onto shoppers on [[Sai Yeung Choi Street]] South, Hong Kong, a pedestrian street and popular shopping area. A reward, originally [[HK$]]100,000, for information about the perpetrator or perpetrators, was raised to [[HK$]]300,000 following the second incident, and cameras were to be installed in the area following the December incident. The third incident occurred the very day the cameras were turned on. The fifth incident happened after Hong Kong government announced its new strategies against the incident. 130 people were injured in these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/6961804/Hong-Kong-acid-attack-man-arrested-after-tourists-targeted.html|title=Hong Kong acid attack: man arrested after tourists targeted|last=Eimer|first=David|date=2010|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cambodia====
Recent studies on acid attacks in Cambodia found the victims were almost equally likely to be men or women (48.4% men, 51.6% women).&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; As with [[India]], rates of acid attacks in Cambodia have generally increased in the past decades, with a high rate of 40 cases reported for 2000 that started the increasing trend.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; According to the [[Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity]], 216 acid attacks were reported from 1985 to 2009, with 236 reported victims.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; Jealousy and hate is the biggest motivator for acid attacks in Cambodia, as 28% of attacks reported those emotions as the cause. Such assaults were not only perpetrated by men—some reports suggest women attack other women occur more frequently than men do.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; Such incidents usually occur between a husband's wife and mistress to attain power and socioeconomic security.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-2001-07-22"&gt;{{cite news

A particularly high-profile case of this nature was the attack on Cambodian teenager [[Tat Marina]] in 1999, allegedly carried out by the jealous wife of a government official (the incident prompted a rash of [[copycat crime]]s that year, raising the number from seven in 1998 to 40 in 1999).

Acid attacks are common in Vietnam although not to the level of countries such as Pakistan and India.

{{Further|Acid attacks on women in Isfahan}}
According to [[Afshin Molavi]], in the early years of the revolution and following the mandating of the covering of hair by women in Iran, some women were threatened with acid attacks by Islamic vigilantes for failing to wear [[hijab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Molavi |first=Afshin|title=The Soul of Iran: A Nation's Journey to Freedom|year=2005|publisher=W.

Recently, acid assault in [[Iran]] has been met with increased sanctions.

In October 2014, a series of acid attacks on women occurred in the city of [[Isfahan]], resulting in demonstrations and arrests of journalists who had covered the attacks.

[[Moshe Hirsch]] was the leader of the [[anti-Zionist]] [[Neturei Karta]] group in [[Jerusalem]]. Hirsch had one [[glass eye]] due to an injury sustained when someone threw acid in his face.

In Uganda, 57% of acid assault victims were female and 43% were male.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; A study focusing on chemical burns in Nigeria revealed a reversal in findings—60% of the acid attack patients were male while 40% were female.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt; In both nations, younger individuals were more likely to suffer from an acid attack: the average age in the Nigeria study was 20.6 years,&lt;ref name=5a /&gt; while Ugandan analysis shows 59% of survivors were 19–34 years of age.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt;

Motivation for acid assault in these African countries is similar to that of Cambodia. "Relationship conflicts" caused 35% of acid attacks in Uganda in 1985–2011, followed by property conflicts at 8%, and business conflicts at 5%.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; Disaggregated data was not available in the Nigeria study, but they reported that 71% of acid assaults resulted from an argument with either a jilted lover, family member, or business partner.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt; As with the other nations, researchers believe these statistics to be under-representative of the actual scope and magnitude of acid attacks in African nations.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
On July 31, 2018, [[Kateryna Handziuk]], an anti-corruption activist and political advisor from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, was attacked with sulfuric acid outside her home by an unknown attacker. She died of her injuries on November 3, 2018.

=== South America ===
'''Colombia'''[[File:Natalia Ponce de Leon IWOC 2.jpg|thumb|[[Natalia Ponce de León]] (right), survivor of a 2014 acid attack, receiving an award for her activism for other survivors]]
Though comprehensive statistics on acid attacks in [[South America]] are sparse, a recent study investigating acid assault in [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]], provides some insight for this region. According to the article, the first identified survivor of acid violence in Bogota was attacked 15 years ago. Since then reported cases have been increasing with time. The study also cited the Colombian Forensics Institute, which reported that 56 women complained of aggression by acid in 2010, 46 in 2011, and 16 during the first trimester of 2012. The average age of survivors was about 23 years old, but ranged from 13 to 41 years.&lt;ref name=15a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Linda|title=Burns due to acid assaults in Bogotá, Colombia|journal=Burns|date=October 2012|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2012.10.022|volume=39|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study reported a male:female victim ratio of 1:30 for acid assault in Bogota, Colombia, although recent reports show the ratio is closer to 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.las2orillas.co/hay-456-hombres-en-colombia-que-tambien-son-natalia-ponce/ | work=las2orillas | title=Hay 456 hombres en Colombia que también son Natalia Ponce | date=2014-04-10 | accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons behind these attacks usually stemmed from poor interpersonal relationships and domestic intolerance toward women. Moreover, female victims usually came from low [[socioeconomic class]]es and had low education. The authors state that the prevalence of acid attacks in other areas of South America remains unknown due to significant underreporting.&lt;ref name=15a /&gt;

On March 27, 2014, a woman named [[Natalia Ponce de León]] was assaulted by Jonathan Vega, who threw a liter of [[sulphuric acid]] on her face and body. Vega, a former neighbor, was reported to have been "obsessed" with Ponce de León and had been making death threats against her after she turned down his proposal for a relationship.&lt;ref name="america.aljazeera.com"/&gt; 24% of her body was severely burned as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia: Man accused of high profile acid attack arrested.

Three years before the attack took place, [[Colombia]] reported one of the highest rates of [[acid attack]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fucsia.co/personajes/nacionales/article/colombia-lider-vergonzoso-en-ataques-con-acido/49533|title=Colombia, líder vergonzoso en ataques con ácido|website=Fucsia.co|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was not an effective law in place until Ponce de León's campaign took off in the months after her attack. The new law, which is named after her, defines acid attacks as a specific crime and increases [[Sentence (law)|maximum sentences]] to 50 years in jail for convicted offenders.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord3"/&gt; The law also aims to provide victims with better state medical care including reconstructive surgery and psychological therapy. Ponce de León expressed hope that the new law would act as a deterrent against future attacks.&lt;ref name="dailyrecord3" /&gt;

==Health effects==
The most notable effect of an acid attack is the lifelong bodily disfigurement. According to the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]] in [[Pakistan]], there is a high survival rate amongst victims of acid attacks. Consequently, the victim is faced with physical challenges, which require long-term surgical treatment, as well as psychological challenges, which require in-depth intervention from [[psychologist]]s and counselors at each stage of physical recovery.&lt;ref name=ASF&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Adnan|title=The real miracle workers fighting, and healing, Pakistan’s acid attacks|url=http://acidsurvivorspakistan.org/|publisher=Acid Survivors Foundation, Pakistan|date=Apr 21, 2012|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These far-reaching effects on their lives impact their psychological, social and economic viability in communities.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;

===Medical===
The medical effects of acid attacks are extensive. As a majority of acid attacks are aimed at the face,&lt;ref name="3a" /&gt; several articles thoroughly reviewed the medical implications for these victims. The severity of the damage depends on the [[concentration]] of the acid and the time before the acid is thoroughly washed off with water or [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] with a neutralizing agent. The acid can rapidly eat away skin, the layer of fat beneath the skin, and in some cases even the underlying bone. Eyelids and lips may be completely destroyed and the nose and ears severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cequinindia.org/pdf/Special_Reports/Acid%20Throwing.pdf|title=Gender-Based Violence In Public Places: Acid Throwing|author=Keerthi Bollineni|publisher=[[Centre for Equality and Inclusion]]|access-date=2012-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526012923/http://cequinindia.org/pdf/Special_Reports/Acid%20Throwing.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not exhaustive, Acid Survivors Foundation Uganda findings included:&lt;ref name="10a" /&gt;
* The [[skull]] is partly destroyed/deformed and hair lost.
* [[Ear]] cartilage is usually partly or totally destroyed; [[deafness]] may occur.
* [[Eyelids]] may be burned off or deformed, leaving the [[eye]]s extremely dry and prone to [[blindness]]. Acid directly in the eye also damages [[eyesight|sight]], sometimes causing blindness in both eyes.
* The [[nose]] can become shrunken and deformed; the [[nostril]]s may close off completely due to destroyed [[cartilage]].
* The [[mouth]] becomes shrunken and narrow, and it may lose its full range of motion. Sometimes, the [[lip]]s may be partly or totally destroyed, exposing the [[teeth]]. Eating and speaking can become difficult.
* [[Scar]]s can run down from the [[chin]] to [[neck]] area, shrinking the chin and extremely limiting [[range of motion]] in the neck.
* [[Inhalation]] of acid vapors usually creates [[respiratory]] problems, exacerbated restricted [[airway]] pathways (the [[esophagus]] and [[nostril]]s) in acid patients.

In addition to these above-mentioned medical effects, acid attack victims face the possibility of [[septicemia]], [[renal failure]], skin [[depigmentation]], and even death.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt;

A 2015 attack that involved throwing sulfuric acid on a man's face and body while he lay in bed caused him, among other serious injuries, to become paralyzed from the neck down.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/23/berlinah-wallace-jailed-years-sadistic-acid-attack-mark-van-dongen?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
Acid assault survivors face many [[mental health]] issues upon recovery. One study showed that when compared to published Western [[norm (social)|norms]] for psychological well-being, non-Caucasian acid attack victims reported higher levels of [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and scored higher on the Derriford appearance scale, which measures [[psychological distress]] due to one's concern for their appearance. Additionally, female victims reported lowered [[self-esteem]] according to the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale|Rosenberg scale]] and increased [[self-consciousness]], both in general and in the social sphere.&lt;ref name=6a /&gt;

===Social===
In addition to medical and psychological effects, many social implications exist for acid survivors, especially women.&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; For example, such attacks usually leave victims [[handicapped]] in some way, rendering them dependent on either their spouse or family for everyday activities, such as eating and running errands. These dependencies are increased by the fact that many acid survivors are not able to find suitable work, due to impaired vision and [[Physical disability|physical handicap]]. This negatively impacts their economic viability, causing hardships on the families/spouses that care for them. As a result, divorce rates are high, with abandonment by husbands found in 25% of acid assault cases in [[Uganda]] (compared to only 3% of wives abandoning their disfigured husbands).&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; Moreover, acid survivors who are single when attacked almost certainly become [[social rejection|ostracized]] from society, effectively ruining marriage prospects.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; Some media outlets overwhelmingly avoid reporting acid attack violence, or the description of the attack is laconic or often implies that the act was inevitable or even justified.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Halim and Marian Meyers (2010), ''News Coverage of Violence Against Muslim Women: A View From the Arabian Gulf'', Communication, Culture &amp; Critique. Volume 3, Issue 1, pages 85–104, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment for burn victims remains inadequate in many [[developing nation]]s where incidence is high. Medical underfunding has resulted in very few [[burn center]]s available for victims in countries such as Uganda,&lt;ref name="10a" /&gt; Bangladesh,&lt;ref name="7a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faga|first=A.|author2=D.

In addition to inadequate medical capabilities, many acid assault victims fail to report to the [[police]] due to a lack of trust in the force, a sense of hopelessness due to the attackers' [[impunity]], and a fear of male brutality in dealing with their cases.&lt;ref name=2a /&gt; Most of the female victims suffer more because of police apathy in dealing with cases of harassment as safety issues as victims refused to register a police case despite being attacked thrice before meriting police aid after an acid attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2854918.ece A case of police apathy?], ''The Hindu'', February 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are exacerbated by a lack of knowledge of how to treat burns: many victims applied oil to the acid, rather than rinsing thoroughly and completely with water for 30 minutes or longer to [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralize]] the acid. Such [[home remedy|home remedies]] only serve to increase the severity of damage, as they do not counteract the acidity.&lt;ref name=5a /&gt;

==Prevention==
Research has prompted many solutions to the increasing incidence of acid attacks in the world. Many countries look to Bangladesh, whose rates of attack have been decreasing, as a model, following their lead in many legislative reforms.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; However, several reports highlighted the need for an increased, legal role of NGOs to offer rehabilitation support to acid survivors.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; Additionally, nearly all research stressed the need for stricter [[regulation]] of acid sales to combat this social issue.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;&lt;ref name=10a /&gt;&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

===Role of NGOs===
Many [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) have been formed in the areas with the highest occurrence of acid attacks to combat such attacks. Bangladesh has its [[Acid Survivors Foundation]], which offers acid victims [[legal]], [[medical]], [[rehabilitation counseling|counseling]], and monetary assistance in rebuilding their lives.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; Similar institutions exist in Uganda, which has its own Acid Survivors Foundation,&lt;ref name=10a /&gt; and in Cambodia which uses the help of [[Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity]].&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; NGOs provide rehabilitation services for survivors while acting as advocates for [[social reform]], hoping to increase support and awareness for acid assault.

In Bangladesh, the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]], Nairpokkho, [[Action Aid]], and the [[Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee]]'s Community Empowerment &amp; Strengthening Local Institutions Programme assist survivors.&lt;ref name=Anwary&gt;Anwar, Afroza, 'Acid Violence and Medical Care in Bangladesh: Women's Activism as Carework' in Mary K.

The Acid Survivors Foundation India operates from different centres with national headquarters at Kolkata and chapters at Delhi and Mumbai.

[[Acid Survivors Trust International]] (UK registered charity no. 1079290) provides specialist support to its sister organizations in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depilexsmileagain.com/zakat.htm|title=Depilex Smileagain Foundation|website=Depilexsmileagain.com|accessdate=15 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105184536/http://www.depilexsmileagain.com/zakat.htm|archive-date=2009-01-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asti.org.uk|title=Home – Acid Survivors Trust International|author=Whitespace Design|website=Asti.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid Survivors Trust International is the only international organisation whose sole purpose is to end acid violence. The organisation was founded in 2002 and now works with a network of six Acid Survivors Foundations in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Uganda that it has helped to form. Acid Survivors Trust International has helped to provide medical expertise and training to partners, raised valuable funds to support survivors of acid attacks and helped change laws. A key role for ASTI is to raise awareness of acid violence to an international audience so that increased pressure can be applied to governments to introduce stricter controls on the sale and purchase of acid.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acidviolence.org/index.php/acid-violence/|title=Acid Violence|author=Whitespace Design|website=Acidviolence.org|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian acid attack survivor Shirin Juwaley founded the Palash Foundation&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palashfoundation.org/index.html |title=Home |publisher=Palash Foundation |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220201559/http://www.palashfoundation.org/index.html |archive-date=2014-02-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to help other survivors with psychosocial rehabilitation. She also spearheads research into social norms of beauty and speaks publicly as an advocate for the empowerment of all victims of disfigurement and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernandes|first=Joeanna|title=In the eyes of the beholder|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/In-the-eyes-of-the-beholder/articleshow/10458336.cms?intenttarget=no|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the principal of an Indian college refused to have Juwaley speak at her school for fear that Juwaley's story of being attacked by her husband would make students "become scared of marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sujan|first=Dheera|date=September 6, 2011|title=An open letter about beauty and ugliness|periodical=Women News Network|url=http://womennewsnetwork.net/2011/09/06/open-letter-beauty-and-ugliness/|accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of acid sales===
A positive correlation has been observed between acid attacks and ease of acid purchase.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; [[sulfuric acid|Sulfuric]], [[nitric acid|nitric]], and [[hydrochloric acid]] are most commonly used and are all cheap and readily available in many instances. For example, often acid throwers can purchase a liter of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] at motorbike mechanic shops for about 40 U.S. cents. [[Nitric acid]] costs around $1.50 per liter and is available for purchase at gold or jewelry shops, as polishers generally use it to purify gold and metals. [[Hydrochloric acid]] is also used for polishing jewelry, as well as for making [[soy sauce]], [[cosmetics]], and traditional medicine/[[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] drugs.&lt;ref name=13a /&gt;

Due to such ease of access, many organizations call for a stricter regulation on the acid economy. Specific actions include required [[license]]s for all acid traders, a ban on concentrated acid in certain areas, and an enhanced system of monitoring for acid sales, such as the need to document all transactions involving acid.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt; However, some scholars have warned that such stringent regulation may result in [[black market]] trading of acid, which law enforcements must keep in mind.&lt;ref name=11a /&gt;


==History==
Acid has been used in [[metallurgy]] and for etching since ancient times. The rhetorical and theatrical term "La Vitrioleuse" was coined in France after a "wave of vitriolage" occurred according to the popular press where, in 1879, 16 cases of vitriol attacks were widely reported as [[Crime of passion|crimes of passion]] perpetrated predominantly by women against other women.&lt;ref name=13a/&gt; Much was made of the idea that women, no matter how few, had employed such violent means to an end. On October 17, 1915, acid was fatally thrown on [[Prince Leopold Clement of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], heir to the [[House of Koháry]], by his distraught mistress, [[Camilla Rybicka]], who then [[Murder–suicide|killed herself]]. Sensationalizing such incidents made for lucrative newspaper sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TC19160107.2.10|title=Royal Love Tragedy|work=[[The Colonist]]|publisher=Papers Past, [[National Library of New Zealand]]|date=1916-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of acid as a weapon began to rise in many [[developing country|developing nations]], specifically those in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=7a /&gt; The first recorded acid attacks in South Asia occurred in Bangladesh in 1967,&lt;ref name=12a&gt;{{cite web |title=Combating Acid Violence In Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/AvonGlobalCenterforWomenandJustice.pdf|publisher=Avon Foundation for Women|accessdate=6 March 2013|authors=Avon Global Center for Women and Justice at Cornell Law School, Committee on International Human Rights of the New York City bar Association, Cornell Law School international Human Rights Clinic, and the Virtue Foundation|pages=1–64|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; India in 1982, and Cambodia in 1993.&lt;ref name=13a/&gt; Since then, research has witnessed an increase in the quantity and severity of acid attacks in the region. However, this can be traced to significant underreporting in the 1980s and 1990s, along with a general lack of research on this phenomenon during that period.&lt;ref name=2a&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseline Report: Violence Against Women in Bangladesh |url=http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |publisher=International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific |accessdate=6 March 2013 |author=Naripokkho |author2=Bangladesh Mahila Parishad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922173913/http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows acid attacks increasing in many [[developing country|developing nations]], with the exception of Bangladesh which has observed a decrease in incidence in the past few years.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

==Legislations==
Many countries have begun pushing for [[legislation]] addressing acid attacks, and a few have recently employed new [[law]]s against this crime.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; Under the [[Qisas]] law of Pakistan, the perpetrator may suffer the same fate as the victim, and may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes.&lt;ref name="quisas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1908/context/archive|title=Pakistan's Acid-Attack Victims Press for Justice|accessdate=2008-05-30|publisher=Women's eNews|date=July 13, 2004|author=Juliette Terzieff|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612174357/http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1908/context/archive|archivedate=2008-06-12|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is not binding and is rarely enforced according to a ''New York Times'' report.&lt;ref name="video.nytimes.com"/&gt; In Pakistan, the Lower House of [[parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] unanimously passed the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill on May 10, 2011. As punishment, according to the bill individuals held responsible for acid attacks face harsh fines and [[life in prison]]. However, the country with the most specific, effective legislation against acid attacks is Bangladesh, and such legal action has resulted in a steady 20–30% decrease in acid violence for the past few years.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt; In 2013, India introduced an amendment to the [[Indian Penal Code]] through the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]], making acid attacks a specific offence with a punishment of imprisonment not less than 10 years and which can extend to life imprisonment and with fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 |url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417194151/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India's top court ruled that authorities must regulate the sale of acid. The Supreme Court's ruling on July 16, 2013, came after an incident in which four sisters suffered severe burns after being attacked with acid by two men on a motorbike. Acid which is designed to clean rusted tools is often used in the attacks can be bought across the counter. But the judges said the buyer of such acids should in future have to provide a photo identity card to any retailer when they make a purchase. The retailers must register the name and address of the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India's top court moves to curb acid attacks|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/07/2013718134222947132.html|work=[[Al Jazeera English]]|date=2013-07-18|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Section 326 A of the Indian Penal Code|section 326 A]] of [[Indian Penal Code]] was enacted by the Indian Parliament to ensure enhanced punishment for acid throwing.

===Bangladesh===
In 2002, Bangladesh introduced the [[death penalty]] for acid attacks and laws strictly controlling the sale, use, storage, and [[international trade]] of acids. The acids are used in traditional trades carving marble nameplates, [[conch]] bangles, goldsmiths, tanneries, and other industries, which have largely failed to comply with the legislation. Salma Ali of the [[Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association]] derided these laws as ineffective.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh laws"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/south_asia/5133410.stm|title=Bangladesh's acid attack problem|accessdate=2008-06-14|publisher=BBC News|date=28 July 2006|author=Roland Buerk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of these laws are the Acid Crime Control Act (ACCA) and the Acid Control Act (ACA), respectively.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

The ACCA directly impacts the [[criminal law|criminal]] aspect of acid attacks, and allows for the death penalty or a level of punishment corresponding to the area of the body affected. If the attack results in a [[Deafness|loss of hearing]] or [[Loss of sight|sight]] or damages the victim's [[face]], [[breast]]s, or [[sex organ]]s then the perpetrator faces either the death penalty or [[life imprisonment|life sentencing]]. If any other part of the body is maimed, then the criminal faces 7–14 years of [[imprisonment]] in addition to a fine of US$700. Additionally, throwing or attempting to throw acid without causing any physical or mental harm is punishable by this law and could result in a prison term of 3–7 years along with a US$700 fine. Furthermore, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspirators]] that aid in such attacks assume the same [[legal liability|liability]] as those actually committing the crime.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

The ACA regulates the sale, usage, and storing of acid in Bangladesh through the creation of the National Acid Control Council (NACC). The law requires that the NACC implement policies regarding the trade, misuse, and disposal of acid, while also undertaking initiatives that raise awareness about the dangers of acid and improve victim treatment and rehabilitation. The ACA calls for district-level committees responsible for enacting local measures that enforce and further regulate acid use in towns and cities.&lt;ref name=12a /&gt;

===Pakistan===
Under the [[Qisas]] law of Pakistan, the perpetrator could suffer the same fate as the victim, if the victim or the victim's guardian chooses. It may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes.&lt;ref name="womensenews.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html|title=Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860)|website=www.pakistani.org|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 336B of Pakistan Penal Code states: "Whoever causes hurt by corrosive substance shall be punished with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description which shall not be less than fourteen years and a minimum fine of one million rupees."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, section 299 defines ''Qisas'' and states: "''Qisas'' means punishment by causing similar hurt at the same part of the body of the convict as he has caused to the victim or by causing his death if he has committed qatl-iamd (intentional manslaughter) in exercise of the right of the victim or a Wali (the guardian of the victim)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
After a spate of attacks in London in 2017, the [[Home Office]] said it would consider changes in laws and measures regarding sales of acid, as well as changes in prosecution and sentencing guidelines. As of 2017, it is unlawful to carry acid with the intent to cause harm. Attacks are prosecuted as acts of [[actual bodily harm]] and [[grievous bodily harm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40621303|work=BBC News|title=Acid attack punishments assessed in government review|date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/acid-attacks-uk-london-sale-law-change-theresa-may-latest-news-abh-gbh-a7840776.html|title=Theresa May hints at changing law after 'horrific' acid attacks in London|date=14 July 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three quarters of police investigations do not end in prosecution, either because the attacker could not be found, or because the victim is unwilling to press charges.&lt;ref name=telegraph_policestats /&gt; According to ASTI, of the 2,078 acid attack crimes recorded for the years 2011-2016 in UK, only 414 of those crimes resulted in charges being brought. Most acid attack crimes happened in London, where over 1,200 cases were recorded over the past five years. From 2011–2016 there were 1,464 crimes involving acid or corrosive substance. Northumbria recorded the second highest with 109 recorded attacks, Cambridgeshire had 69 attacks, Hertfordshire 67, Greater Manchester 57 and Humberside 52.

==Terms==
'''Vitriolage''' is the deliberate splashing of a person or object with acid, also known as [[vitriol]], in order to deface or kill. A female who engages in such an act is known as a '''vitrioleuse'''. There are instances of this act throughout history and in modern times, often in places where [[honor killings]] are also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vday.org/contents/violence/glossary/acidattacks |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072005/http://www.vday.org/contents/violence/glossary/acidattacks |archive-date=2008-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14988">An '''address confidentiality program''' allows victims of [[domestic violence]], [[sexual assault]], [[stalking]] or other types of crime to receive mail at a [[confidential]] address, while keeping their actual address undisclosed. This is usually done through the state's [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State's]] address or some other address which will legally substitute the agency's address for the victim's physical address on public records.

According to the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;Address Confidentiality Programs (ACP) and Confidential Voter Listings are programs administered by the state enabling victims of domestic violence (and sometime victims of sexual assault and/or stalking) to participate in the voting process without fear of being found by their abusers. ACPs generally provide a substitute address for all public records. Confidential Voter Listings only provide confidentiality on election-related public records.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Bank Accounts and Address Confidentiality==
The rules implementing the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] require a financial institution to implement a [[Customer Identification Program]] that includes procedures that enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its customers. The rules also require that a financial institution obtain a residential or business street address from each customer. Unfortunately, the substitute address under an Address Confidentiality Program does not meet the standards.

The [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] issued a letter ruling to help the situation. The [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] regulations also allow: "If the individual customer does not have a residential or business street address, then the rules permit the individual customer to provide a "residential or business street address of next of kin or of another contact individual."

In FIN-2009-R003, the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] found: "A customer who participates in a state-created ACP shall be treated as not having a residential or business street address and a secretary of state, or other state entity serving as a designated agent of the customer consistent with the terms of the ACP, will act as another contact individual for the purpose of complying with FinCEN's rules. Therefore, a financial institution should collect the street address of the ACP sponsoring agency for purposes of meeting its CIP address requirement."

Machado's reign came as American businessman [[Donald Trump]] took ownership of the Miss Universe pageant. While preparing for Miss Universe, Machado underwent intense dieting. Machado said that, when she won, she weighed 116 pounds and was anorexic and bulimic.&lt;ref name="Martin, Lydia"/&gt;

During her reign as Miss Universe, Machado gained what she said was about 12 pounds in weight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barbaro|first1=Michael|last2=Twohey|first2=Megan|title=Shamed and Angry: Alicia Machado, a Miss Universe Mocked by Donald Trump|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/us/politics/alicia-machado-donald-trump.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|work=The New York Times|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing considerable press attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Jessica|title=That Time Donald Trump Humiliated Miss Universe for Gaining Weight|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/05/17/when_donald_trump_humiliated_miss_universe_for_gaining_weight.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|work=Slate|date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President of Miss Universe Organization denied that the organization was considering replacing her with runner-up, Taryn Mansell of Aruba.&lt;ref name="Martin, Lydia"/&gt;  After mounting pressure to lose weight from Trump and other pageant officials, Machado asked Trump to assist her with orienting toward a healthier lifestyle. Trump arranged for 80 reporters to "watch [her] sweat" in a gym, which Machado later called "in very bad taste".&lt;ref name="Martin, Lydia"/&gt;

In 1998 Machado had her first starring [[telenovela]] role as the title character in [[Samantha (telenovela)|Samantha]]. In 2001, she had a small role on the international soap opera ''Secreto de Amor''. During 2004–2005, she pursued a career as a TV commercial model with particular success in promoting a dieting product. In 2005, Machado appeared on a Spanish reality show called ''[[The Farm (TV series)|La Granja de los famosos]]'' ("The Farm"). On February 19, 2006, Machado debuted on the Mexican reality show ''[[Cantando Por Un Sueño]]'' ("Singing For A Dream").

Machado appeared in (and on the cover of) the February 2006 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's Mexican edition, becoming the only Miss Universe to pose nude for that magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womendiary.net/2006/02/06/alicia-machado-pose-for-playboy Alicia Machado Pose For Playboy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060407013041/http://womendiary.net/2006/02/06/alicia-machado-pose-for-playboy |date=April 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Machado was cast in the comedic soap opera ''[[Una familia con suerte]]'' where she played a woman who fell in love with her brother's enemy.

On September 9, 2012, Machado was one of ten competitors on the third season of [[Mira Quien Baila (U.S.)|''Mira Quien Baila'']]. On November 18, 2012, Alicia won 3rd place in the 3rd season of [[Univision]]'s dance competition [[Mira Quien Baila]]. In 2013, Machado starred as the protagonist of ''[[La Madame]]'', a television serial produced by RTI Productions and RCN TV in Colombia.

== Involvement in politics ==

In 1998 Machado publicly supported the presidential campaign of [[Henrique Salas Römer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Bart|title=Hugo!: The Hugo Chavez Story from Mud Hut to Perpetual Revolution|publisher=Steerforth Press|isbn=9781586421694|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAlfajLRpkgC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=25 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 she criticized populist Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chavez]] in an interview with ''Playboy''.&lt;ref name="El Comercio"/&gt;

In July 2015, after Donald Trump launched his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]], Machado announced that she would publish a book detailing what she called his "abuses of power" and "racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romero|first1=Angie|title=Ex-Miss Universe Alicia Machado to Write Book About Donald Trump's 'Abuses of Power' &amp; 'Racism'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6627228/alicia-machado-donald-trump-book-former-miss-universe|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that, during her year as Miss Universe, Trump called her "Miss Piggy" because she gained weight and "Miss Housekeeping" because of her Hispanic background. Trump's spokeswoman denied that Trump had made those insults.&lt;ref name=gryn/&gt; Machado has repeatedly called Trump a "nazi rat", compared him to [[Hugo Chavez]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], and said that he was capable of starting a new [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blakely|first1=Rhys|title=Subscribe {{!}} theaustralian|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the-times/us-election-beauty-queen-could-tip-scales-for-hillary-clinton/news-story/bb4624a7e408e10e52b2116c02c85f42|accessdate=25 October 2016|work=www.theaustralian.com.au|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paquette|first1=Danielle|title=‘Public slut-shaming’ and Donald Trump’s attack on a former Miss Universe’s alleged sex history|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/30/public-slut-shaming-and-donald-trumps-attack-on-a-former-miss-universitys-alleged-sex-history/|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=Washington Post|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tras escándalo de Donald Trump, Alicia Machado lo compara con Hitler|url=http://www.publimetro.co/entretenimiento/tras-escandalo-de-donald-trump-alicia-machado-lo-compara-con-hitler/lmkofy!UYhgxGAp40D3Y/|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=Publimetro|agency=Publimetro|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alicia Machado arremete contra Donald Trump|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/entretenimiento/article26940556.html|accessdate=6 October 2016|work=elnuevoherald|agency=El Nuevo Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cindy/&gt;

On September 26, 2016, Hillary Clinton brought up Machado's statements against Trump during the [[United States presidential election debates, 2016#First presidential debate (Hofstra University)|first presidential debate]]. The following day, Trump responded on ''[[Fox and Friends]]'', describing Machado as "impossible" and saying that "she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.

==Personal life==

In 1998, a Venezuelan judge accused Machado of threatening to kill him while he was presiding over a case against her then-boyfriend for attempted murder. Machado was also accused of driving the boyfriend's getaway car. Machado denied both accusations and was never charged with a crime. The controversy caused a media sensation in Venezuela unseen since the conviction of President [[Carlos Andres Perez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kraul|first1=Chris|last2=Mogollon|first2=Mery|title=Trump says former Miss Universe was tied to a murder attempt.

Machado once dated professional baseball player [[Bobby Abreu]]; the couple later split, calling off their engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Sanchez, [http://mlb.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20060612&amp;content_id=1501609&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;fext=.jsp 'Comedulce' a hero in his country: Phillies' Abreu often underrated in the United States], [[MLB.com]] (June 12, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Berardino, [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-05-15/sports/0505150013_1_jason-varitek-giambi-cantu Mom, this homer is for you], ''Orlando Sentinel'' (May 15, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Machado has one daughter.

In 2010, responding to being mocked on Twitter after mistakenly referring to North and South Korea as China, Machado closed her Twitter account and wrote, "I now have a lot of psychopaths on the account and it's best I start another one, kisses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Venezuelan beauty queen stumbles over Korea crisis|agency=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oukoe-uk-korea-north-venezuela-idAFTRE6AN67020101124|date=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">The '''Asian Pacific American Heritage Festival''', hosted by the Coalition of Asian Pacific Americans in [[New York City]], is one of the largest outdoors celebrations of [[Asian Pacific American Heritage Month]] in the [[United States]]. Each year, in May, the festival offers music, performances, arts, food, history and corporate outreach. The first festival in 1979 grew out of the [[civil rights movement]]s of that era when President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed the proclamation to declare the first week in May to be Asian American Heritage Week. The proclamation was later extended to Asian Pacific American Heritage Month for the entire month of May. The festival has continued every year to celebrate the diverse cultures of [[Asian Americans]] and their contribution to American society.  It has become so large that it takes the Coalition all year to put together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rT2TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=%22Asian+Pacific+American+Heritage+Festival%22+new++york&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mhCVd-cW_T&amp;sig=lf_CgnvzoAUIM0kuCuNmW2h3H6M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ9r3ZjaTSAhVozFQKHUUHBEUQ6AEIdTAS#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Asian%20Pacific%20American%20Heritage%20Festival%22&amp;f=false|title=Speak it Louder: Asian Americans Making Music|last=Wong|first=Deborah|date=2004-07-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135878234|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Bear Garden, Bankside, London.png|thumb|The Beargarden from Visscher's ''Map of London'', published in 1616, but representing the city as it was several years earlier.]]
[[File:Bankside - the Bear Garden and the Rose Theatre - Norden's Map of London, 1593.png|thumb|The Beargarden and the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] depicted in Norden's ''Map of London'', 1593]]
The '''Beargarden''' or '''Bear Pit''' was the facility for [[bear-baiting]], [[bull-baiting]], and other "[[Bait (dogs)|animal sports]]" in the London area during the 16th and 17th centuries, from the [[Elizabethan era]] to the [[English Restoration]] period. [[Samuel Pepys]] visited the venue in 1666 and described it as "a rude and nasty pleasure". The last recorded event at the Beargarden was the baiting of "a fine but vicious horse" in 1682.

==History==
The Beargarden was a round or polygonal open structure, comparable to the public theatres built in and around London starting in 1576. Contemporaneous illustrated maps of the city show a substantial three-storey building that resembles the theatres nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, pp. 25-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It was located in the [[Bankside]], across from the [[City of London]] on the south bank of the [[River Thames]] in [[Southwark]]; but its exact location is unclear, and apparently changed over time. Documentary sources from the middle 16th century refer to the bear-baiting rink as being in Paris Garden, the [[Liberty (division)|liberty]] at the western end of the Bankside. The names of the facility and its location were merged in popular usage: [[John Stow]], writing in 1583, calls it "The Beare-garden, commonly called the Paris garden."&lt;ref&gt;Similarly, the prison located in the liberty of the Clink was called [[The Clink]] Prison, from which derived the colloquialism "in the clink." The origins of the names of both liberties, Paris Garden and the Clink, are obscure and debated.&lt;/ref&gt; Late-16th-century sources, however &amp;mdash; the ''Speculum Britanniae'' map of 1593, and the ''Civitas Londini'' map of 1600 &amp;mdash; show the Beargarden farther to the east, in the liberty of the Clink, where it sits on the northwestern side of the [[the Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The building could have been moved from its original location, much as [[The Theatre]] was moved and rebuilt into the [[Globe Theatre]] in 1598&amp;ndash;99.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 188-9, 490.&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of the Beargarden's construction is unknown; it was in existence by the 1560s, when it is shown on the [[Woodcut map of London|"woodcut" map]] of the city. Questions of the Beargarden's location and date are complicated by the fact that animal sports were conducted at more than one place in Southwark in this era; the Agas map shows both a bull-baiting and a bear-baiting ring, situated near each other (bulls to the west, bears to the east).&lt;ref&gt;Ordish, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor the Water Poet]], testifying in the [[Court of Exchequer Chamber|Court of Exchequer]] in 1620 or 1621, said that "the game of bear-baiting hath been kept in four several [i.e. separate] places, at Mason Stairs on the Bankside, near Maid Lane by the corner of Pike Garden, at the beargarden which was parcel of the possession of William Payne, and at the place where they now are kept."&lt;ref&gt;Ordish, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet one main bear-baiting facility, the "Paris Garden," stood out in the public mind. In 1578, William Fleetwood, "Sergeant-in-law" and Recorder of London, described it as a place where foreign ambassadors met their spies and agents; at night it was so dark and obscured by trees that a man needed "cat's eyes" to see.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of States Papers Domestic'', 1547&amp;ndash;80; p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassadors and travellers were often shown the Beargarden; The prominent French nobleman the Duke of Biron&lt;ref&gt;[[George Chapman]] wrote plays about him: ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was escorted there by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] on September 7, 1601.

On Sunday, January 13, 1583, eight people were killed and others injured when the scaffold seating in the Beargarden collapsed under their weight. [[Puritan]] commentators, hostile to animal baiting as they were to other sports and pastimes (like play-going), attributed the accident to God's displeasure. The Beargarden closed for a time, but reopened a few months later.

The English monarchy had had an official "bearward," an officer in charge of its "bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs," at least from the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. In 1573 a Ralph Bowes was appointed [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s "Master of Her Majesty's Game at Paris Garden." ( Elizabeth herself, like other royals and aristocrats of her era, was a passionate fan of animal baiting.) In 1604, [[Philip Henslowe]] (who had a financial interest in bear-baiting at least from 1594) and his son-in-law [[Edward Alleyn]] purchased the royal office of the Mastership for £450, and maintained the practice of animal baiting along with their other business of theatre production. Henslowe bought out Alleyn's share in 1611, for £580 (though Alleyn re-acquired his share upon Henslowe's 1616 death). In 1613, Henslowe and new partner Jacob Meade tore down the Beargarden, and in 1614 replaced it with the [[Hope Theatre]]. The Hope was equipped as a dual-purpose venue, hosting both stage plays and animal sports. Gradually, though, fewer plays were staged there, and the Hope was generally called the Beargarden after its primary use. [[Samuel Pepys]], in an entry in his famous Diary, describes a visit he and his wife paid to the Hope/Beargarden on August 14, 1666. (He called the spectacle "a rude and nasty pleasure.")&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectacle==
Surviving descriptions of the entertainment offered at the Beargarden have an extraordinary ring to a modern ear and sensibility. The crowds were amused at the whipping of the old blind bear "Harry Hunks" until the blood ran down his shoulders. (At least some bears &amp;mdash; perhaps the fiercest, longest-enduring ones &amp;mdash; were given names: "George Stone," "Ned Whiting," and the most famous, "Sackerson.")&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; There are extant descriptions of horses with apes tied to their backs set upon by dogs. An early account, from the visiting [[House of Lara|Duke of Najera]] in 1544, mentions

:"...a pony with an ape fastened on its back, and to see the animal kicking among the dogs, with the screams of the ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony, is very laughable."&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the original Spanish; Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pepys describes a bull tossing a dog into a spectators' box. Others mention the bulls tossing dogs into the air and then catching the falling dogs on their horns again. On a few rare occasions (in 1604 and 1605, and in 1609 and 1610), lions were baited.

The shows at the Beargarden had surprising aspects; according to contemporary accounts, music and fireworks were used, and special effects were employed. German tourist Lupold von Wedel was at the Beargarden on August 23, 1584; he left a description that cites the usual and expected baiting of bulls and bears, and a horse chased by the dogs, plus people dancing, and a man who threw white bread to the crowd (they "scrambled for it"). And then,

:"Right over the middle of the place a rose was fixed, this rose being set on fire by a rocket: suddenly lots of apples and pears fell out of it down upon the people standing below. Whilst the people were scrambling for the apples, some rockets were made to fall down upon them out of the rose, which caused a great fright but amused the spectators. After this, rockets and other fireworks came flying out of all corners, and that was the end...."&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the original German; Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last recorded instance of animal baiting at the Hope/Beargarden occurred on April 12, 1682, when "a fine but vicious horse was advertised to be baited to death for the amusement of the Moroccan ambassador...and for as many as would pay to see it."&lt;ref&gt;Wheatley, Vol. 2, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; The horse reportedly had killed several men and other horses. It survived and beat off the dogs; to please the clamoring crowd, the horse was stabbed to death with a sword.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, by contrast, the term "Bear Garden" is employed by a retailer of [[teddy bear]]s and stuffed animals. However, the Bear Pit is not entirely forgotten: Alleyn bought the manor of Dulwich in 1605 and in the course of establishing his tenure, implemented a requirement of Sir Francis Bacon's Star Chamber to establish a charitable school "for 12 poor children of the parish of Camberwell" - who appear in practice to have often been the players of the female parts at the Globe. Their own sub-company, named the Bear Pit, continued in the original School, which passed through the Dulwich College Lower School in the 1850s to Alleyn's School in 1887, and remains active to this day, run without any parental or scholastic support, regularly producing household names in the theatre. The intention of theatre as a medium for the young was further promoted by the secondment of the School's Head of English, Michael Croft, in the late 1950s to establish the National Youth Theatre. Although many members were from the School, their outreach achieved the target of opening the theatre to many of less advantaged backgrounds, and a worldwide movement resulted.

The '''Treasury of the [[Boeotians]]''' was dedicated in the late [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] within the sanctuary of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bommelaer, J.-F., Laroche, D., Guide de Delphes. Le site, Sites et Monuments 7, Paris 1991, 128&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified due to some epigraphic material.

==Description==
Towards the southwestern end of the Sacred Way in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi are located the foundations of a treasury which is identified to that dedicated by the Boeotians. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] does not mention this particular building, thus it is possible that it has been destroyed by his time.  The architectural parts that are still extant indicate that it was a Doric building made of limestone on which inscriptions in the Boeotian writing style of the Late Archaic period have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Partida, E., The Treasures at Delphi, an Architectural Study, Jonsered 2000, 192-198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.

(ed.), Επετηρίς Εταιρείας Βοιωτικών Μελετών, 3, Αθήνα 2000, 536-564.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these inscriptions, the building is dated to ca 525 B.C.

'''Buṅga Dyaḥ Jātrā''' ({{lang-new|बुंग द्यः जात्रा}}) is a chariot procession honoring the Buddhist deity of compassion [[Avalokiteśvara]] held in [[Patan, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Nepal]]. It is one of the greatest religious events in the city and the longest chariot festival celebrated in the country. 

Buṅga Dyaḥ is also known as ''Raktalokitesvara Karunamaya'' and [[Matsyendranath|Rāto Machhindranāth]] and is revered as the giver of rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=John Kerr |date=1973 |title=Rato Masyendranath of Patan and Bungamati |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=l5wiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rato+Masyendranath+of+Patan+and+Bungamati&amp;dq=Rato+Masyendranath+of+Patan+and+Bungamati&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dNtHU9r2EOvxiAedzYDYCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA |publisher=Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies |page=81|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aioiyama.net/lrc/papers/cbhnm-ppr-14.htm |title= Karunamaya Jatra in Newar Buddhist Culture |last= Vajracharya |first= Munindraratna |date=1998 |website= Aioiyama|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Rato Machhendranath means Red Machhendranath in a reference to the color of the deity's image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shrestha |first=Binu |title=Pulling Chariot To Invoke Monsoon God |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=66639&amp;cat_id=10 |newspaper=The Rising Nepal |location=Kathmandu |accessdate=15 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017043137/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=66639&amp;cat_id=10 |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chariot festival is held according to the lunar calendar, so the date is changeable. It begins on the 4th day of the bright fortnight of [[Bachhala (month)|Bachhalā]], the seventh month in the lunar [[Nepal Sambat]] calendar.

==Chariot procession==
The chariot procession was instituted to celebrate the arrival of Bunga Dyah in Nepal and the end of a devastating drought. It was started when Narendra Deva was the king (640-683 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Daniel |date=1877 |title=History of Nepal |pages=147-149 |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=AiU50pM_z6MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+nepal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sPRcU8iIAciUiAfc34DYDg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Asian Educational Services |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Preparations for the festival begin with the construction of a 60-foot tall chariot at Pulchok at the western end of Lalitpur. When the chariot is complete, the image of Bunga Dyah from his temple is installed in it. Revellers then drag the chariot through the streets of Lalitpur on a tour that lasts a month. The chariot of Bunga Dyah is accompanied on the journey by a similar but smaller chariot of Chākuwā Dyah (चाकुवा द्यः). The deity is another [[Bodhisattva]] and is also known as Minnāth. 

The route of the chariot procession starts at Pulchok and passes through Gabahal, Mangal Bazar, Hakha, Sundhara, Chakrabahil, Lagankhel and ends at [[Jawalakhel]]. As per time-honored tradition, the chariot is pulled exclusively by women on the stretch between the localities of Iti and Thati. This part of the chariot procession is known as Yākah Misāyā Bhujyā (याकः मिसाया भुज्या).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Misa Shakti |url= http://esandhyanhipau.com/index.php |newspaper=Sandhya Times |location=Kathmandu |page=1|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parade finishes at the open ground of Jawalakhel which is situated at the western side of Lalitpur. There, the festivities conclude with the ceremony of Bhoto Jatra, the display of the bhoto, a traditional Nepalese vest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=John Kerr |date=1973 |title=Rato Masyendranath of Patan and Bungamati |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=l5wiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rato+Masyendranath+of+Patan+and+Bungamati&amp;dq=Rato+Masyendranath+of+Patan+and+Bungamati&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dNtHU9r2EOvxiAedzYDYCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA |publisher=Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies |page=17|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Barha Barsa Jatra", that happens once in every 12 years, the chariot of the Machhindranath is constructed at Bungamati. The chariot is pulled all the way from Bungamati through Bhaisepati, Nakkhu, Bhanimandal, Jhamsikhel and to Pulchowk. The chariot is pulled from Jhamsikhel (near Ideal Model School) to Pulchowk at night. Then the chariot is pulled through the town at its normal route. After the Bhoto Jatra ceremony at Jawalakhel, the idol of Rato Machhindranath is taken back to Bungamati, where it spends the 6 months of the year.

== Bhoto Jātrā ==

[[File:Bhoto jatra.jpg|thumb|Showing the vest to the crowds on Bhoto Jatra]]

Bhoto Jatra, which literally means "vest festival", is the climax of the chariot procession of Bunga Dyah Jatra. After the two chariots arrive in Jawalakhel, astrologers choose an auspicious date to hold the Bhoto Jatra festival. On the appointed day in the presence of the head of state, a government official climbs on to the chariot and holds up a jewel-studded black vest from the four sides of the chariot so that all the people gathered around can have a look at it. 

The display is a re-enactment of an event that happened eons ago. According to legend, a [[Jyapu]] ([[Newar]] farmer) lost the vest which he had received as a gift from the serpent god Karkotaka Naga for doing him a favour. One day, the farmer had come to Jawalakhel to watch the chariot pulling festival where he saw someone wearing his missing garment. 

A quarrel developed over the vest, and since neither party could prove ownership, it was agreed that the undershirt would be kept with Bunga Dyah until the rightful owner comes to claim it with adequate proof. Since then, the vest has been shown to the public annually as a call to potential claimants to step forward. 

The living goddess [[Kumari (children)|Kumari]] of Patan also arrives in Jawalakhel to observe Bhoto Jatra. She watches the ceremony from a special rest house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=John Kerr |date=1980 |title=Karunamaya: The Cult of Avalokitesvara-Matsyendranath in the Valley of Nepal |url=https://books.google.com.np/books/about/Karunamaya.html?id=vyELAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |location=Kathmandu |publisher=Sahayogi Prakashan for Research Centre for Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribhuvan University |page=273 |accessdate=14 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The auspicious day when the Bhoto Jatra is held is determined by astrologers, so the date is changeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Bhoto Jatra marked amid much fanfare |url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2011/06/28/nation/bhoto-jatra-marked-amid-much-fanfare/223391.html |accessdate=11 April 2014 |newspaper=The Kathmandu Post |date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the vest showing will be held on 22 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Lord Machchhindranath Voto (vest) exhibition to be held on June 22 |url=http://epaper.gorkhapatraonline.com/the-rising-nepal-newspaper/book/1022-trn-may-23-2014/3-the-rising-nepal.html |newspaper=The Rising Nepal |location=Kathmandu |page=6 |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524050104/http://epaper.gorkhapatraonline.com/the-rising-nepal-newspaper/book/1022-trn-may-23-2014/3-the-rising-nepal.html |archivedate=24 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the festival, the chariot is dismantled and the parts are stored until it is time for the procession the next year. Rato Machhendranath is taken to a temple in the nearby village of [[Bungamati]], also known as the second home of the rain god. The deity spends the next six months in that temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Locke |first=John Kerr |date=1973 |title=Rato Masyendranath of Patan and Bungamati |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=l5wiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rato+Masyendranath+of+Patan+and+Bungamati&amp;dq=Rato+Masyendranath+of+Patan+and+Bungamati&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dNtHU9r2EOvxiAedzYDYCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA |publisher=Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies |page=17|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carroll Devol "Rock" Brett''' (August 1, 1923 – August 14, 2010) was a [[United States Air Force]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] who piloted aircraft during crises and wars from 1948 (the Berlin Crisis) through the Vietnam War (1960s). He served in Austria, Germany, Korea, Vietnam, the United Kingdom, Iran, and Turkey, before his final assignment as commander of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe in 1977.  After his retirement in 1978, he was a defense consultant for more than 20 years, retiring in 1998.

== Early life and education ==
Devol Brett was born in California in 1923 at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]], the son of U.S. Army Air Force General [[George Brett (general)|George Brett]]. He attended private high school, at [[Landon School]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], graduating in 1941.&lt;ref name="Alumni"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alumni Association Honors Buchanan, Brett |publisher=Landon School (landon.net) |date=December 8, 2008 |url=http://www.landon.net/page.cfm?p=363&amp;newsid=117 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003052946/http://www.landon.net/page.cfm?p=363&amp;newsid=117 |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1945 he graduated from the [[U.S. Military Academy]] at West Point, N.Y., where he was given the nickname "Rock" for his toughness.&lt;ref name="WP-Obit"/&gt;

In 1966 he earned a master's degree in international policy from [[George Washington University]].&lt;ref name="WP-Obit"/&gt;

== Military career ==
Upon graduation, Brett was commissioned a pilot in the Army Air Corps.  He first assignment after training, in 1946, was in [[Horsching, Austria]]; in 1947 he was assigned to the 86th Fighter Wing at [[Munich, Germany]].  In the early days of the [[Berlin Airlift]] in 1948, he flew [[C-47]] cargo planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-astore/remembering-generosity-an_b_781416.html |work=Huffington Post |author=William Astore |date= November 10, 2010|title=Remembering Generosity and Commitment this Veterans Day}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eagle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/2003/brett_2003.asp |publisher=U.S. Air Force Air University |title=Eagle Biography: Devol "Rock" Brett |accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Korean War]], Brett flew more than 100 combat missions, piloting [[P-51D Mustang]]s &lt;ref name="WP-Obit"/&gt; out of the [[18th Wing|18th Fighter Wing]]. He sometimes led as many as 36 planes on a mission, each typically carrying two 500 pound bombs, six rockets, plus machine gun ammunition.  His plane had the nickname "Noherohere" painted on it; his wife has asked him to "be good, but don't be a hero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Korean Air War |author=Robert F. Dorr and Warren Thompson |page=93 |publisher=Zenith Imprint |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvyEpFNGIbcC&amp;dq=devol+brett&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in April 1957, Brett commanded the 355th Fighter Day Squadron, out of [[Myrtle Beach Air Force Base]], which consisted of 17 [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100 Super Sabre]] jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Star-News |date=March 30, 1958 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=al1gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tXENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5646,4629632&amp;dq=devol+brett&amp;hl=en |title=Squadron Heads for Maneuvers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that position, he was featured in a 1958 [[Time magazine]] article in which an editor went weightless during dozens of short climbs and dives in Brett's F100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Time magazine |title=Medicine: How to Go Weightless |date=June 9, 1958 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868509-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unit made four major deployments to Europe, including the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]], where his squadron was part of the first [[Tactical Air Command#Composite Air Strike Force|Composite Air Strike Force]], and the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]]. In 2003 he was honored by The Air Command and Staff College Gathering of Eagles Foundation, which designated him an "Eagle"; the Foundation specifically noted his actions in the Lebanon Crisis: &lt;blockquote&gt;On 14 July 1958, Rock Brett led his F-100D/F squadron in Operation DOUBLE TROUBLE, a top secret mission to deploy the first full Composite Air Strike Force from the US to Turkey in support of Lebanon invoking the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] following the 14 July coup d'etat in Iraq. This mission was also the first operational day/night transatlantic air-refueling mission by fighters. Brett's squadron was in place in less than 20 hours after notification. His leadership helped resolve the crisis and pave the way for today's critical Air Expeditionary Force deployments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/2003/brett_2003.asp|title=Eagle Biography: Devol "Rock" Brett |accessdate=2011-06-08|publisher=The Air Command and Staff College Gathering of Eagles Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Vietnam War]], Brett flew more than 100 missions in a [[F-4C]] jet fighter.  In 1967, he was shot down over North Vietnam by anti-aircraft fire. He broke his nose and cheekbone while ejecting from his aircraft, and was picked up by a search and rescue helicopter team after several hours in the water. The other member of his crew, a radar operator, did not survive.&lt;ref name="Career"/&gt;

From 1973 to 1975, Brett was the senior U.S. military officer in [[Iran]], as chief of the U.S. Military Mission with the Iranian armed forces and the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to that country. He was followed in that position by Major General [[Richard Secord]].

In 1978, Brett retired from the Air Force. His final position, which he had assumed in 1977, was as commander of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, headquartered in [[Naples|Naples, Italy]] (part of [[Allied Forces Southern Europe]]) and (jointly) commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe's [[Sixteenth Air Force]], based at [[Torrejon Air Base]], Spain.&lt;ref name="WP-Obit"/&gt;

== Military consultant ==
After retiring from the Air Force, Brett became a private military consultant for the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). He specialized in conventional and nuclear tactical systems with emphasis on the employment of air power.&lt;ref name="Alumni"/&gt; While at IDA, he also did studies on search and rescue and personnel recovery&lt;ref name="WP-Obit"/&gt; for the [[Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office]].&lt;ref name="Alumni"/&gt;  Among his work was a joint report in 1985, with retired General [[Bryce Poe]], for the Federal Construction Council, on quality control of Air Force construction programs.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Devol and Poe, Bryce, "Observations on United States Air Force Construction Programs, with an Emphasis on Quality Control", Federal Construction Council, August 20, 1985, cited in {{cite book|title=Quality control on federal construction projects |author=Federal Construction Council |year=1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWMrAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=devol+brett&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in 2009.&lt;ref name="WP-Obit"/&gt;

==Family==
In 1947, Brett married Hermine Mayerl of Austria.  Brett, stationed in Germany, announced the birth of their first son by flying his [[P-47]] over the village where his in-laws lived, a short flight from his air base, and dropping a canister with the message "It's a boy - George Howard Brett II."&lt;ref name="WP-Obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/22/AR2010092204770.html |work=Washington Post |date=September 22, 2010 |title=Obituary: Devol 'Rock' Brett, Air Force general, military consultant}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a second child, Karla.

The '''effects of genocide on youth''' include psychological and demographic effects that affect the transition into adulthood. These effects are also seen in future generations of youth.

Demographic effects involve the transfer of children during genocides. In cases of transfer, children are moved  or displaced from their homes into boarding schools, adoptive families, or to new countries with or without their families. There are significant shifts in populations in the countries that experience these genocides. Often, children are then stripped of their cultural identity and assimilated into the culture that they have been placed into.

Unresolved trauma of genocide affects future generations of youth.&lt;ref name="Brave Heart"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Brave Heart|first1 = Maria Y.H.|last2 = DeBruyn|first2 = Lemyra|title = The American Indian: Holocaust: Healing Historical Unresolved Grief|url = http://www.dhs.state.mn.us/main/groups/children/documents/pub/dhs16_180048.pdf|website = MN Department of Human Services|publisher = MCWTS|ref = The American Indian Holocaut|pages = 1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergenerational effects help explain the background of these children and analyze how these experiences shape their futures. Effects include the atmosphere of the household they grew up in, pressures to succeed or act in specific ways, and how they view the world in which they live.

The passing down of narratives and stories are what form present day perceptions of the past.&lt;ref name="Azarian-Ceccato"/&gt; Narratives are what form future generations' ideas of the people who were either victimized or carried out the genocide. As youth of future generations process the stories they hear they create their own perception of it and begin to identify with a specific group in the story. Youth of future generations begin to form their identity through the narratives they hear as they begin to relate to it and see how the genocide affects them. As stories are passed down, children also begin to understand what their parents or grandparents went through. They use narratives as explanation of why their parents talk about it in the way they do or do not talk about it all.&lt;ref name=Munyas/&gt;

Psychological effects of genocide are also relevant in youth. Youth who experience an extreme trauma at an early age are often incapable of fully understanding the event that took place. As this generation of children transition into adulthood, they sort out the event and recognize the psychological effects of the genocide. It is typical for these young survivors to experience symptoms of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) as well as other psychological disorders.

Transitioning out of youth and into adulthood is an important development marker in the lives of all people. Youth who transition into adulthood during a genocide have a different experience than those who do not transition during a genocide. Some youth transition earlier as means of survival. Others are unable to fully transition, remaining in a youth state longer.

[[Native Americans in the United States]] were subject to military and land-taking campaigns by U.S. government policies. Disease reduced 95 percent the American Indian population between 1492 and 1900, the worst demographic collapse in human history.

=== Youth in boarding schools ===
{{See also|American Indian boarding schools}}

Youth were a primary target for many state projects.  From 1824 until the 1970s, approximately 100 boarding schools were operated by the United States federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = American Indian Boarding Schools Haunt Many|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16516865|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Native families volunteered and were forced to send their children to attend [[Indian Boarding School]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. it has been claimed that this state intention was to keep youth from learning indigenous culture: one boarding school founder described boarding schools as a way to "Kill the Indian, Save the Man."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Children at these sites experienced [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], and [[emotional abuse]]. However, oral histories also document that youth had good experiences of friendships, skills learned, and sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Native Words Native Warriors|url = http://americanindian.si.edu/education/codetalkers/html/chapter3.html|website = americanindian.si.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As adults, they often struggled to raise their own children when returning to Indian cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="Brave Heart" /&gt;

=== Intergenerational effects ===
Brave Heart and DeBruyn, psychologists treating American Indian youth, compare psychological trauma caused by massacres, land allotment, and boarding schools to the trauma experienced by Holocaust survivor descendants.&lt;ref name="Brave Heart" /&gt;  Adults who experienced boarding schools as children seek treatment to be able to adequately bond with their children.  American Indian groups have created treatment processes such as the Takini Network: Lakota Holocaust Survivors' Association to treat youth and adults through cultural competence, participation in traditional ceremonies, and grief management.&lt;ref name="Brave Heart" /&gt;

==Armenian genocide, Turkey==
The [[Armenian genocide]] began in 1915 when the Turkish government planned to wipe out Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire. About 2 million Armenians were killed and many more were removed from the country by force. The Turkish government [[Armenian genocide denial|does not acknowledge]] the events of the Armenian genocide as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenian Genocide|url=http://www.history.com/topics/armenian-genocide|website=History.com|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic effects===
The biggest demographic shift is the number of children that were internally displaced within the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the Armenian genocide, at least 60,000 youth were transferred to many different locations. Children were taken from their homes and transferred to poorly supplied camps where they would be sold. Some children were sold to central Anatolia to wealthy households for education and assimilation into the Turkish culture. Other children were sold to Muslim villagers who would then receive a stipend each month for raising them. In these instances, the displaced children had typically better lives than what they would have had with Armenian parents. Not all went to these types of homes. Some youth were sold for circumstances of exploitation and unpaid hard labor. Other youth were sent to homes in which they experienced physical and sexual abuse. Some young people were placed in homes of the people who were responsible for their parents' deaths. No matter what type of home they were sent to, the transfer of children involved the stripping of their culture identity. Their Armenian culture was erased by being raised in non-Armenian households; the Turkish government was carrying out a cultural genocide.&lt;ref name=Watenpaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watenpaugh|first1=Keith David|title="Are There Any Children for Sale?": Genocide and the Transfer of Armenian Children (1915–1922)|journal=Journal of Human Rights|date=July 2013|volume=12|issue=3|pages=283–295|doi=10.1080/14754835.2013.812410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergenerational effects===
Narratives of the stories of the genocide are passed down from generation to generation in order for the story to continue to live on. It allowed the children of future generations to find their sense of ethnic identity through it. There are many different aspects of life in which children begin to form their identity, and in the [[Armenian culture]], an emphasis is placed on the children to identify with the Armenian culture. Though the events of the Armenian genocide are historical facts, the personal stories from witnesses are used as a cultural artifact in the lives of Armenian children. They grow up with this strong sense of belonging to this culture due to these stories of suffering and use them as a uniting force.&lt;ref name="Azarian-Ceccato"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azarian-Ceccato|first1=Natasha|title=Reverberations of the Armenian Genocide: Narrative's intergenerational transmission and the task of not forgetting|journal=Narrative Inquiry|date=2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=106–123|doi=10.1075/ni.20.1.06aza}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenians are united in this ethnic community, known as the [[Armenian diaspora]]. Whether they are Russian or Armenian-Americans, they are part of the Armenian diaspora.&lt;ref name=Ziemer/&gt; The desire for future generations to actively be part of this Armenian diaspora stems from the primary generation and their experiences with the cultural genocide.&lt;ref name=Watenpaugh/&gt;

Future generations of genocide survivors recognize the shift in their geographical location due to the genocide. Future generations of Armenian-Americans have been told and retold the stories of how their ancestors came to America, and they recognize that if it had not been for the Armenian genocide, they might not be where they are today. They see the effect of the genocide in that they might still be in Armenia.&lt;ref name="Azarian-Ceccato"/&gt; Future generations of children that are born in Russia recognize that their geographical location within Russia was effected by the genocide. They feel at home in places such as Krasnodar, Russia because that is where their families have migrated to after the genocide. Although the future generations of Armenian genocide survivors have migrated all over the globe and made their homes in these places, their ancestors have instilled a love for Armenia, the historic homeland.&lt;ref name=Ziemer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziemer|first1=Ulrike|title=Narratives of Translocation, Dislocation and Location: Armenian Youth Cultural Identities in Southern Russia|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|date=May 2009|volume=61|issue=3|pages=409–433|doi=10.1080/09668130902753283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambodian genocide, Cambodia==

The [[Cambodian genocide]] began in 1975 when [[Pol Pot]], a [[Khmer Rouge]] leader, attempted to build a Communist peasant farming society. About 1.5 million Cambodians died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pol Pot|url=http://www.history.com/topics/pol-pot|website=History.com|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic effects===
Many Cambodian youth were taken to Canada in the 1980s. Most came through private sponsorship programs or through the Canadian federal government as refugees. Many of these sponsorship programs were Christian organizations through the "Master Agreement" made with the Canadian government. Primarily, families became refugees in Montreal and Toronto. Other small groups of refugees went to Ottawa, Hamilton, London, and Vancouver. Most refugees were of the lowest economic class in Cambodia, and they had less education. An emphasis was placed on getting the children refugees caught up academically with their peers of the same age by sending them to school. [[Cambodian Canadian]]s preferred to stay in bigger cities such as Toronto because it allowed the children to attend school together. In these areas where the Cambodian population was higher, racism in schools against Cambodian refugees was less evident. Though they were placed in Canada, there was still a stress to maintain Khmer culture. Many parents continued to speak Khmer to their children, keeping the language alive. Khmer décor was hung in homes and Khmer traditions were carried out within the homes as a way to raise the children in Khmer culture.&lt;ref name=McLellan/&gt;

===Intergenerational effects===
Many second and third generation youth of survivors of the Cambodian genocide recognize the stories they are told as their primary source of information. The stories they hear discuss the Khmer Rouge in a negative way. Survivor stories include talk about harsh living and working conditions in which they were separated from their families, starved, tortured, and even killed. Other households avoid the subject all together. Some survivors do not want to relive the old traumas so they keep silent. Other survivors cannot make sense of it and do not want to be subject to the questions of youth that they cannot answer.&lt;ref name=Munyas/&gt;

Many youth in the generations following the genocide experience broken home life. They live in homes controlled by parents with PTSD. The youth experience their parents' hyper arousal, intrusive recollection, traumatic amnesia, and being easily frightened.&lt;ref name=Munyas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chung&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chung|first1=Margaret|title=Intergenerational Effects of Genocidal Disaster among Cambodian Youth|url=http://www.naswnyc.org/?339|website=National Association of Social Workers, New York City Chapter|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the parents do not have PTSD, they still often elicit behaviors of emotional unavailability, over protection, and poor parenting on their children. Some children of survivors experience violence in their home such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect. Children in the following generations who have been raised in violent homes because of their parents' experiences have often elicited violent behaviors. School shootings, stabbings, and knifings have become more common among Cambodians following the genocide.&lt;ref name=Chung/&gt; Some youth believe that it is because of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian genocide that they suffer from economic hardships.&lt;ref name=Munyas/&gt;

In schools following the events of the Cambodian genocide, youth received mixed interpretations of the events of the genocide. Information about the time period in which these events occurred, known as the [[Democratic Kampuchea]], was severely limited or even taken out of textbooks. Children previously participated in Hate Day, a day in which they were taught to hate Pol Pot and disapprove of the Khmer Rouge. Now, the day has become known as the Day of Remembrance in which they remember those who lost their lives during this time.&lt;ref name=Munyas/&gt;

It was not just the following generations of the survivors that were affected by the genocide, but the youth of the Khmer Rouge as well. Most youth with parents who were members of the Khmer Rouge do not hear of the events from their parents, but rather find information from museums, neighbors, and friends. Once they find out the cruelty that their parents and grandparents exhibited, they often feel embarrassed and do not want to identify themselves as children of the Khmer Rouge. Many Khmer Rouge members are ashamed and fear ostracism from their peers.&lt;ref name=Munyas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Münyas|first1=Burcu|title=Genocide in the minds of Cambodian youth: transmitting (hi)stories of genocide to second and third generations in Cambodia|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=September 2008|volume=10|issue=3|pages=413–439|doi=10.1080/14623520802305768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological effects===
Cambodian youth who had been a part of the Cambodian genocide experienced high levels of violence early on in their lives. Many youth survivors have shown symptoms of PTSD. The amount of Cambodian genocide survivors with PTSD is five times higher than the average in the United States. Many survivors also experience panic disorder.&lt;ref name=Hinton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinton|first1=Devon E.|last2=Rasmussen|first2=Andrew|last3=Nou|first3=Leakhena|last4=Pollack|first4=Mark H.|last5=Good|first5=Mary-Jo|title=Anger, PTSD, and the nuclear family: A study of Cambodian refugees|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=November 2009|volume=69|issue=9|pages=1387–1394|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.08.018|pmc=2763362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are children who survived the Cambodian genocide that may not have experienced the genocide directly, yet they still experienced psychological effects of the genocide through their parents. Parents often elicited anger towards their children following the Cambodian genocide. This anger was frequent and the episodes met the criteria for a panic-attack. When this anger was elicited within the home, trauma recall among the parent and the child was often triggered, resulting in catastrophic cognitions.&lt;ref name=Hinton/&gt;

Groups of Cambodian refugees often fled to highly populated areas in the country in which they fled to. Within these countries, they often resided in poorer areas of the city, which were considered high violence areas. Youth who experienced high violence in Cambodia and then moved to high violence areas in other countries are at greater risk for developing PTSD.&lt;ref name=Berthold&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berthold|first1=S. Megan|title=The effects of exposure to community violence on Khmer refugee adolescents|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|date=July 1999|volume=12|issue=3|pages=455–471|doi=10.1023/A:1024715003442|pmid=10467555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to adulthood===
Military agrarianism was stressed under the Khmer Rouge, meaning young people were expected to be peasants and soldiers as part of the war effort. Prior to this time of war, youth was defined as a time free from responsibilities, typically ages seven to twenty-one. At the end of this time, youth would transition into adulthood via getting a job, having a family, and gaining responsibility. As youth became a part of the war effort, this transition was delayed. Youth were not able to transition into adulthood until almost age thirty. Instead of gaining more responsibility, youth stayed in a time of which they were disciplined, controlled, and homogenized by military leaders.&lt;ref name=Raffin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raffin|first1=Anne|title=YOUTH MOBILIZATION AND IDEOLOGY|journal=Critical Asian Studies|date=September 2012|volume=44|issue=3|pages=391–418|doi=10.1080/14672715.2012.711977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some child victims of the genocide who were able to escape the Khmer Rouge and flee to other countries were able to stay on track with their transition into adulthood. Many children were put in schools right away in order to keep them on the same academic level as their peers. Parents encouraged children to finish school, find work, and pursue family life in the same manner as their peers.&lt;ref name=McLellan&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLellan|first1=Janet|title=Cambodian refugees in Ontario : resettlement, religion, and identity|date=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-9962-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holocaust, Germany==

[[File:Buchenwald Children 19753.jpg|thumb|209x209px|Youth survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camps during the Holocaust. The youth that survived this camp were primarily young Jewish males.]]
The [[Holocaust]] began in 1933 prior to [[World War II]] in Germany when the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] under Adolf Hitler's rule attempted to wipe out the "inferior" people of the country. This primarily included people of the Jewish culture, but also included Gypsies, the disabled, some Slavic people, Jehovah's Witnesses, and homosexuals. By the end of the Holocaust in 1945, more than 6 million Jewish people had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|title=Introduction to the Holocaust|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005143|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 6 million that had been killed, 1.5 million were children between ages zero and eighteen. By killing off many Jewish children, the Nazi regime hoped to exterminate the core and root of the Jewish culture.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Joanna|title=Holocaust Youth and Creativity|date=1999|publisher=Educational Resources Information Center|pages=1–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic effects===
Following the Holocaust, survivors did not know where to go. Young survivors had grown up inside the concentration camps or Jewish [[ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe]]. It was near impossible for them to return to their hometowns because of the hatred against Jews. Many youth and other survivors migrated west to other European territories that were under the rule of the [[Allies of World War II]] where they were housed in refugee housing. Many survivors found home in Palestine, legally or illegally. The State of Israel was also established in May 1948 due to the mass displacement of refugees. Quota restrictions on immigration to the United States were also loosened, allowing many Holocaust survivors to immigrate to the United States where they were provided with US immigration visas for displaced persons under the [[Displaced Persons Act]]. Other places that Jewish refugees fled to were Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, South America, and South Africa.&lt;ref name=USHMM&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aftermath of the Holocaust|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005129|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=10 November 2015|location=Washington, DC|date=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergenerational effects===
Survivors of the Holocaust lived through very traumatic experiences, and their children and grandchildren felt the repercussions of this trauma. Generations following the Holocaust learned to have a distrust of the world. They were taught that the world and the people in it were inherently bad and could not be trusted, producing an ever-present fear of danger. Parents gave youth a terrifying worldview by failing to provide an effective framework of security and stability.&lt;ref name=Braga&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braga|first1=Luciana L|last2=Mello|first2=Marcelo F|last3=Fiks|first3=José P|title=Transgenerational transmission of trauma and resilience: a qualitative study with Brazilian offspring of Holocaust survivors|journal=BMC Psychiatry|date=2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=134|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-12-134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents viewed the world as inherently bad, and they often inflicted overprotectiveness on their children. Children of survivors of the Holocaust grew up with many restrictions to their daily lives as parents took on controlling roles in order to protect their children from the outside world.&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barel|first1=Efrat|last2=Van IJzendoorn|first2=Marinus H.|last3=Sagi-Schwartz|first3=Abraham|last4=Bakermans-Kranenburg|first4=Marian J.|title=Surviving the Holocaust: A meta-analysis of the long-term sequelae of a genocide|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2010|volume=136|issue=5|pages=677–698|doi=10.1037/a0020339|pmid=20804233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kellermann&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellermann|first1=Natan P.F.|title=THE LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS AND TREATMENT OF HOLOCAUST TRAUMA|journal=Journal of Loss and Trauma|date=7 January 2011|volume=6|issue=3|pages=197–218|doi=10.1080/108114401753201660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors of the Holocaust received little to no education while in the concentration camps.They lost all opportunity to advance academically. Children of survivors feel the repercussions of the Holocaust by the parents' constant pressure for them to achieve academically.&lt;ref name= Braga/&gt; The role of the child within the family was to provide hope for the future, creating a sense of over involvement of the parents in the children's lives. Children viewed their parents as living vicariously through them; the parents were stripped of a childhood experience and must experience it through their own children.&lt;ref name= Kellermann/&gt; Due to the lack of education, survivors sometimes lacked communication skills. The communication skills they passed on to their children could be affected. An inability to communicate feelings was impressed on children when they were never taught the proper way to do so. The communication that occurred within the home also reflected the knowledge of the Holocaust events that were passed down to further generations. Some parents who survived the Holocaust were very vocal about the events, providing accurate stories to their children to allow the survivor to present the traumatic experience without becoming distant from it. Other parents did not directly recount their traumatic experiences to their children, rather young people became aware of the experiences through hearing the conversations their parents had with others. Some parents did not talk about it at all; they did not want to remember it, were afraid of remembering it, and ashamed of remembering it because of how traumatic the experiences were.&lt;ref name=Braga/&gt;

Second and third generations of Holocaust survivors have also inherited PTSD symptoms. Because their parents or grandparents have developed such severe PTSD, youth in the following generations have a predisposition to developing PTSD.&lt;ref name= Braga/&gt;&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn"/&gt; This predisposition could have been due to the way they were raised. Second and third generations of survivors could also experience subsequent childhood traumas inflicted from their parents or grandparents. Depression in parent survivors is very prevalent, and children of these survivors are more vulnerable to developing depression as well. Behavior disorders were also more prevalent in children of survivors of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name= Braga/&gt;

===Psychological effects===
Youth that grew up as victims of the Holocaust also experienced many psychological effects. One effect was that of learned helplessness. They grew up believing that they were inferior to everyone else, creating a victim mindset. They also had inherent feelings of abandonment, loneliness, and a sense of being unwanted. Being separated from their parents, separated from everyone they knew, they grew up thinking that everyone left them. Being constantly moved around they were not able to make concrete relationships and became lonely. Youth were raised in concentration camps where if they were not valuable they would be exterminated; proving themselves was used as a survival tactic. The feeling of needing to prove themselves carried over in every day life even as the war ended and they were no longer victims of the Holocaust. As another means of survival, children often had to alter their identities. They rid themselves of Jewish names and tendencies in order to survive.&lt;ref name= Kellermann/&gt; During the Holocaust they grew up believing that they should be ashamed of who they were and their identity.&lt;ref name= Clark/&gt; When the war ended, they struggled with returning to their Jewish life. Youth questioned who they were and struggled with finding their identity.&lt;ref name= Kellermann/&gt;

Many young people that experienced the Holocaust became suicidal. They lost the desire to exist or felt a deep disgust at the idea of living.  Germans questioned why Jews in the ghettos did not commit mass suicide because of how hard the Germans had made life for the Jews. Some youth survivors used the Nazi domination to fuel their desire to live and desire to fight back.&lt;ref name= Clark/&gt;

===Transition to adulthood===
Youth who experienced the Holocaust at an early age were consequently stripped of their childhood in that they were prevented from having a normal childhood. They were forced to transition into adulthood much more quickly than those who were not victims of this genocide. As children, they had to be adults because it was dangerous to be a child. Children were often targeted groups of people to be exterminated during the Holocaust due to the fact that they could not help the Nazi regime. Young people had to prove themselves beneficial in order to survive, which for them meant becoming adults early on in age. Children survivors have grown up and created an alter ego child who desires to live the childish life that they missed out on due to the Holocaust.&lt;ref name= Kellermann/&gt;

Some youth transitioned into adulthood in that they became very future oriented and determined to plan for the future. They planned on how they would continue on life after the Holocaust. Their goal was to live in a manner much like how they had lived before the genocide began. They also talked about achieving more than their parents ever had. Some youth talked about travel and studying abroad, becoming well versed in other languages and cultures. Youth were forced to focus on the future and plan for it rather than dwell in the youth years and childish lifestyle.&lt;ref name= Clark/&gt;

The '''''Festival Puccini''''' ('''Puccini Festival''') is an annual summer [[opera]] festival held in July and August to present the operas of the famous Italian [[composer]] [[Giacomo Puccini]].

The Festival is located in [[Torre del Lago]], Italy, a town located between [[Lago di Massaciuccoli]] and the Tyrrhenian Sea, {{convert|4|km|mi}} from the beaches of [[Viareggio]] on the Tuscan Riviera and {{convert|18|km|mi}} from [[Pisa]] and [[Lucca]], Puccini's birthplace.

In presenting four or five performances of up to four operatic productions each season, the Festival attracts about forty thousand spectators to its open-air theatre, the ''Teatro dei Quattromila'' (so named for its seating capacity, although 3,200 seats were actually installed), located very close to the "Villa Puccini," the house which the composer had built in 1900 and in which he lived and worked on his major operas until pollution from the lake forced him to settle in [[Viareggio]] in 1921. Along with other members of his family who died later, Puccini is buried in a small chapel inside the Villa, in a room transformed into a [[mausoleum]] after his death.

The Puccini Festival was started in 1930 following what is believed to have been Puccini's comment to friend [[Giovacchino Forzano]], one of his [[librettist]]s, in 1924 just before he left for the clinic in [[Brussels]] for his throat operation: "I always come out here and take a boat to go and shoot snipes … but once I would like to come here and listen to one of my operas in the open air." The composer was thought to be expressing the hope that his operas would be performed in the extraordinary natural stage offered by the Massaciuccoli Lake.  However, this was disputed by his granddaughter, [[Simonetta Puccini]].&lt;ref&gt;Simonetta Puccini: "There is no written document testifying to (the wish to have his music performed at the house).  Such a suggestion is unthinkable because Puccini had chosen Torre del Lago as a refuge and place of repose for peace and tranquillity he could enjoy at the time", ''Giacomo Puccini in Torre del Lago'', p. ??.  The author then quotes a letter of November 1899 in which, regarding  the house, he states: "Don't pester me, leave me alone and in peace"&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, on 24 August 1930, together with [[Pietro Mascagni]], who had been fellow student of Puccini's, Forzano produced the first performances of a Puccini opera on the lake shore, in front of the Maestro's house.  In a provisional theatre, the ''Carro di Tespi Lirico'' with its stage built on piles stuck in the lake, a travelling opera company performed ''[[La bohème]]'' directed by Forzano and conducted by Mascagni.  The same company came back in 1931 when [[Beniamino Gigli]] and [[Adelaide Saraceni]] performed in ''La bohème'', while Rosetta Pampanini and Angelo Michetti performed ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. This was the beginning of what was to become a major opera festival.

However, in the years before 1949, due to the political and financial climate, there was only one presentation—in 1937—and that was a concert.  Returning in 1949 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Puccini's death, the Festival re-opened with ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' and continued into the 1950s with many of the composer's most well known works.

==Festival expansion since the 1990s==
Not until 1966, when the Festival site was moved to reclaimed land just north of and near to the small lake harbour, did the Puccini Festival became an annual summer event.  With its small villages on the opposite shore, whose flickering lights at night provide unforgettable natural scenery to complement the performances taking place on the stage, the location proved a success, although the theatre's ultra modern design and size have sometimes been drawbacks.

After the creation of the ''Puccini Festival Foundation'' in 1990, achieved in order to put the event on a more established financial footing, plans were put in place to create a new open-air theatre with up-to-date facilities and acoustics. The town authorities of Viareggio purchased {{convert|270000|sqft|m2}} of land to create the ''Parco della Musica'' (Music Park) and on it constructed the ''Teatro al Aperto'' (the Outdoor Theatre) now seating 3,200.  In addition, other facilities for rehearsals and workshops were built, along with a 600-seat covered studio theatre. The ''Teatro al Aperto'' was built to take advantage of the view across Massaciuccoli Lake in the background.

===Recent production history===
In over seventy years of the Festival, the stage of Torre del Lago has hosted the most famous and acclaimed names of world opera.  Among them was [[Tito Gobbi]], who also made his début as director in ''[[Tosca]]''; [[Mario del Monaco]], who chose the Festival as his farewell to the stage in ''[[Il Tabarro]]'', and many others who began or ended extraordinary careers.

In 2000, 70th anniversary of Forzano and Mascagni's initiative, the 46th Puccini Festival presented  two major new productions, ''Madama Butterfly'' and ''Tosca''.  In addition, the program included Puccini's first opera, ''[[Le Villi]]'', presented in concert, with performances by [[Katia Ricciarelli]] and [[Josè Cura]].  In 2004 the Puccini Festival celebrated its 50th anniversary by a season featuring two great events: one was a new production of ''Madama Butterfly'' celebrating the centenary of its première in [[Brescia]] on 28 May 1904. It was conducted by [[Plácido Domingo]] with [[Daniela Dessì]] and [[Fabio Armiliato]] in the leading roles. The second was a special evening dedicated to Puccini's heroines, presenting the most beloved arias from the Maestro's favourite characters, with Plácido Domingo narrating as Puccini.

The 2006 season was unique in that a production of  ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' was presented rather later in the traditional season with follow-up performances in [[Monaco]] in October.  Many productions originating at the festival have gone on to appear in opera houses throughout the world.

[[File:Primo piano rossetti.jpg|thumb|427x427px]]
'''Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe Rossetti''' (28 February 1783 &amp;ndash; 24 April 1854) was an Italian nobleman, poet, constitutionalist, scholar, and founder of the secret society [[Carbonari]] who emigrated to England. He was a member of the Italian noble and [[Boyar]] princely [[Rossetti]] family.

Rossetti was born in [[Vasto]] in the [[Two Sicilies|Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]; the original family of his ancestors was [[della Gherardesca]]. Since many members of the [[della Gherardesca]] family had red hair, they adopted the nickname "Rossetti" approximately four generations before Gabriele's birth.&lt;ref name="Rossetti"&gt;Rossetti,Gabriele and William Michael Rossetti. ''Gabriele Rossetti: An Autobiography''. Sands (1901)p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a [[Roman Catholic]]. Rossetti's support for [[Italian nationalism|Italian revolutionary nationalism]] forced him into political [[exile]] in 1821.

==Early career and exile==
Rossetti's first edition of poems was printed in 1807 by Giovanni Avalloni, who offered to have Rossetti's poems published after hearing him recite a few passages. Throughout his early career, Rossetti published poems that were "patriotic" and supported the "popular movement" in Sicily which resulted in him receiving a grant from [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]] in 1820. When the king revoked the [[constitution]] in 1821, many supporters of the constitution were persecuted, but Rossetti instead, was forced into exile in [[Malta]] for three years before a British admiral of the Royal Navy sent Rossetti to London in 1824. He held the post of Professor of Italian at [[King's College London]] from 1831, as well as teaching Italian at [[King's College School]], until failing eyesight led to his retirement in 1847.&lt;ref name="Rossetti2"&gt;Rossettie, Dante Gabriel. William Michael Rossetti, Mark Twain, Clara Clemens. ''The Poetical Works of Dante Gabriel Rosseti''. Ellis and Elvey, (1893)p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vasto piazza Rossetti.jpg|thumb|349x349px]]

Rossetti's published works include [[literary criticism]], [[Romantic poetry]] such as his long poem ''Il veggente in solitudine'' of 1846, and his ''Autobiography''.  He is thought to be the basis of the character Pesca in [[Wilkie Collins]]' 1860 novel ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]''.

He also wrote commentaries on [[Dante Alighieri]] in which he attempted to show evidence of mysterious ancient conspiracies in his works.&lt;ref&gt;The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Seventh Edition, Volume 2; M.H. Abrams, et al, eds; New York, London: Norton, 2000 - pg 1583&lt;/ref&gt;

He married [[Frances Polidori]], daughter of another Italian exile [[Gaetano Polidori]], and they had four children, all distinguished writers or artists:

[[File:Hip Hop Honors 2016 logo.jpeg|thumb|Logo of the 2016 Hip Hop Honors]]
'''The Hip Hop Honors''' is an annual event that airs on [[VH1]]. The [[television special]] honors [[old-school hip-hop|old school]] and [[golden age hip hop]] [[rappers]] and contributors for their long-term influence and importance in the history of [[hip hop culture]]. It features live performances by most of the honorees along with [[new school hip hop|new school]] artists who have been influenced by them in tribute. The show is taped at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

Common attendees include [[Russell Simmons]], [[Rick Rubin]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Chuck D]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Common (rapper)]], [[KRS-One]], [[Flavor Flav]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Ice-T]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Kanye West]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Rev Run]], [[Sean Combs]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], and many more.

'''Ivan Mikhailovich Chisov'''  ({{lang-ru|Иван Михайлович Чисов}}; 1916–1986) was a [[Soviet Airforce|Soviet Air Force]] lieutenant who survived a fall of approximately 7,000 meters (23,000 feet). Some references give the spelling of his last name as Chissov ({{lang-ru|Чиссов}}).

==Biography==
Lieutenant Chisov was a navigator on a [[Soviet Airforce|Soviet Air Force]] [[Ilyushin Il-4]] bomber. In January 1942, [[Luftwaffe]] fighters attacked his bomber, forcing him to bail out. [[Nikolai Zhugan]], a crewman on Chisov's flight, later said that Chisov leapt from the plane at an altitude of approximately 7,000 meters (23,000 feet), though other references list Chisov's fall at 6,700 meters (Zhugan himself waited until the plane was at about 500 meters before also bailing out).

With the air battle still raging around him, Chisov intentionally did not open his parachute, since he feared that he would be an easy target for an angry German pilot while he was dangling from his parachute harness. He planned to drop below the level of the battle, and open his chute, when he was out of sight of the fighters. Due to the thin atmosphere at that altitude, however, he lost consciousness and was unable to pull the rip cord.

Chisov struck the edge of a snowy ravine at an estimated speed of somewhere between {{convert|190|and|240|km/h|abbr=on}}, then slid, rolled, and plowed his way to the bottom. The aerial battle had been seen by cavalry commander General [[Pavel Alexeyevich Belov]]. When Chisov was seen falling to the ground, cavalrymen rushed to the site, and were surprised to find Chisov alive, still wearing his unopened parachute. Chisov regained consciousness a short time later.

Chisov suffered severe injuries, including spinal injuries and a broken pelvis. He was operated on by surgeon Y. Gudynsky, and for a month his condition was considered critical. Despite his injuries, he was able to fly again three months later.&lt;ref&gt;"Aviation's most wanted: the top 10 book of winged wonders, lucky landings, and other aerial oddities" By Steven A. Ruffin, Darek Johnson, Published by Brassey's, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He requested to continue flying combat missions, but was instead sent to become a navigational trainer.

Chisov flew over 70 combat missions during the course of his career.

After the war, he graduated from the Military-Political Academy. On his departure from the reserve, he became a propagandist for the Central House of the Soviet Army.

{{nihongo|'''Lavender Town'''|シオンタウン|Shion Taun|Shion Town|lead=yes}} is a fictional village in the [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and  ''Blue'']] [[video games]]. Stylized as a [[haunted location]], Lavender Town is home to a large [[Japanese funeral|Japanese-style graveyard]]. The [[video game music|background music]] of Lavender Town is renowned for adding to the town's eerie atmosphere, and gave rise to the Lavender Town Syndrome [[creepypasta]], which suggests that over a hundred Japanese children committed suicide after listening to the track.

==Background==
Lavender Town is a very small village that can be visited in ''Pokémon Red'', ''Green'', ''Blue'', ''[[Pokémon Yellow|Yellow]]'', [[Pokémon Silver and Gold|''Gold'', ''Silver'']], ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]'', and the remakes thereof. It is home to the "Pokémon Tower", a Japanese-style graveyard filled with hundreds of tombstones for deceased [[List of Pokémon|Pokémon]]. Hence, the village is suggested to be a haunted location, and the [[player character]] can come across [[Pokémon type|ghost-type Pokémon]] here. The Pokémon Tower was replaced by the "Kanto [[Radio tower|Radio Tower]]" in ''Pokémon Silver'' and ''Gold''. Lavender Town is also home to the "Name Rater", which allows players to change the nickname of their Pokémon, and a [[care home]] for abandoned Pokémon.&lt;ref name=NintendoBlast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2012/02/stage-select-lavender-town.html |publisher=''Nintendo Blast'' |title=Stage Select: Lavender Town (Pokémon) |last=Neves |first=Ravael |date=2012-02-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420143813/http://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2012/02/stage-select-lavender-town.html |archivedate=2017-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pokémon Tower makes an appearance in the first season of the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime series]], when its main characters search for ghost-type Pokémon for a difficult gym battle. Lavender Town also appears in the ''[[Pokémon Adventures]]'' and ''[[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]]'' manga series.&lt;ref name=NintendoBlast /&gt;

==Music and the Lavender Town Syndrome==
The [[Video game music|background music]] of Lavender Town has garnered much interest due to some listeners finding it unsettling. Listing it as the second-most scary video game track in 2012, Brittany Vincent of ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' stated that Lavender Town's "deceptively calm ... tune ranks highly on most gamers' lists of terrifying childhood memories." Lavender Town's music, composed by [[Junichi Masuda]], combines sharp [[chiptune]] sounds with "a cavalcade of jarring chords" to create an eerie atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3155633/the-10-scariest-video-game-music-tracks/ |publisher=''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' |title=The 10 Scariest Video Game Music Tracks |author=MolotovCupcake |date=2012-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420143733/http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3155633/the-10-scariest-video-game-music-tracks/ |archivedate=2017-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Hathaway of ''[[Gawker]]'' stated that leaving the music on loop may cause a "vague sense of dread".&lt;ref name=Gawker /&gt;

According to a [[creepypasta]] story that was uploaded anonymously on [[Pastebin]] in 2010, the music of Lavender Town compelled the [[suicide]] of over 100 Japanese children in the spring of 1996. Others allegedly suffered [[nosebleed]]s, [[headache]]s, or became irrationally angry. According to this urban legend, high pitch binaural beats harmed the brains of children in a way adults were immune to. This fabricated illness was dubbed "Lavender Town Syndrome" and the original story went [[viral phenomenon|viral]] after being spread on general interest websites such as [[4chan]]. Various people have added details to make the story more convincing over time, such as [[Photo manipulation|Photoshopping]] images of ghosts into [[spectrogram]] outputs of the Lavender Town music.&lt;ref name=Gawker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackbag.gawker.com/lavender-town-the-bizarre-pokemon-child-suicide-conspi-1690396450 |publisher=''[[Gawker]]'' |title=Lavender Town: The Bizarre Pokémon Child-Suicide Conspiracy Theory |last=Hathaway |first=Jay |date=2015-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021042210/http://blackbag.gawker.com/lavender-town-the-bizarre-pokemon-child-suicide-conspi-1690396450 |archivedate=2016-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Hill of ''[[Kill Screen]]'' stated that the appeal of the Lavender Town Syndrome legend "comes from corrupting such an innocent symbol of childhood," and drew comparisons with "[[Dennō Senshi Porygon]]", an episode of the ''Pokémon'' anime series that gave hundreds of Japanese children seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/the-lingering-appeal-of-pokemons-greatest-ghost-story/ |publisher=''[[Kill Screen]]'' |title=The Lingering Appeal of Pokémon's Greatest Ghost Story |last=Hill |first=Mark |date=2016-02-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314190606/https://killscreen.com/articles/the-lingering-appeal-of-pokemons-greatest-ghost-story/ |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/pokemons-creepy-lavender-town-myth-explained-1651851621 |publisher=''[[Kotaku]]'' |title=''Pokémon''{{'}}s Creepy Lavender Town Myth, Explained |last=Hernandez |first=Patricia |date=2015-10-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225040425/http://kotaku.com/pokemons-creepy-lavender-town-myth-explained-1651851621 |archivedate=2017-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fan theory==
The player character can battle [[List of Pokémon characters#Rivals|their rival]], Blue, in the Pokémon Tower. Fans of the series have noted that Blue's [[Raticate]], a Pokémon he uses for every battle up to that point, does not appear in this fight or subsequent confrontations. This lead fans to speculate that Blue's Pokémon had died in a previous battle and that Blue came to the Pokémon Tower to bury and mourn his Raticate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/10/12/pokemon-fan-theories/#LtoSNg3zvGqA |publisher=''[[Mashable]]'' |title=The 10 Most Bizarre Pokémon Fan Theories |last=Roncero-Menendez |first=Sara |date=2013-10-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420142939/http://mashable.com/2013/10/12/pokemon-fan-theories/ |archivedate=2017-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Eurogamer]]'' described Lavender Town as a "standout location" in the original ''Pokémon'' games, as it is one of the few locations in the franchise that deals with the fact that the "cute and cuddly" Pokémon could actually die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-10-31-just-in-time-for-halloween-heres-lavender-town-in-pokemon-lets-go|work=[[Eurogamer]]|title=Just in time for Halloween, here's Lavender Town in Pokémon Let's Go|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lemuralia''' or '''Lemuria''' was a feast in the [[Religion in ancient Rome|religion of ancient Rome]] during which the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] performed [[rite]]s to [[exorcism|exorcise]] the malevolent and fearful ghosts of the dead from their homes.  The unwholesome spectres of the restless dead, the [[Lemures|''lemures'' or ''larvae'']]&lt;ref&gt;"they do not occur in epitaphs or higher poetry," George Thaniel noted (in "Lemures and Larvae" ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''94'''.2 [Summer 1973, pp. 182-187] p 182) remarking "The ordinary appellation for the dead in late Republican and early Imperial times was ''[[Manes]]'' or ''Di Manes'', although frequent use was also made of such terms as ''umbrae'', ''immagines'', ''species'' and others." He notes the first appearance of ''lemures'' in [[Horace]], ''Epistles'' ii.2.209.&lt;/ref&gt; were propitiated with offerings of [[bean]]s. On those days, the [[Vestal Virgin|Vestals]] would prepare sacred ''[[mola salsa]]'', a salted flour cake, from the first ears of [[wheat]] of the season.
{{Roman myth (minor)}}

== Observance ==
In the [[Julian calendar]] the three days of the feast were 9, 11, and 13 May. The [[Founding myth|origin myth]] of this ancient festival, according to [[Ovid]], who derives ''Lemuria'' from a supposed ''Remuria''&lt;ref&gt;Modern linguists dismiss this connection but find the etymology of ''lemures'' obscure.&lt;/ref&gt; was that it had been instituted by [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] to appease the spirit of [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] (Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', V.421ff; [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyrius]]). Ovid notes that at this festival it was the custom to appease or expel the evil spirits by walking [[barefoot]] and throwing black beans over the shoulder at night. It was the head of the household who was responsible for getting up at midnight and walking around the house with bare feet throwing out black beans and repeating the incantation, "I send these; with these beans I redeem me and mine" (''Haec ego mitto; his redimo meque meosque fabis .'') nine times. The household would then clash bronze pots while repeating, "Ghosts of my fathers and ancestors, be gone!"&lt;ref&gt;''Manes exite paterni!'' is the formula given by Ovid (''Fasti'' V.443); scholars argue over how accurate Ovid was in this instance.&lt;/ref&gt; nine times.  

Because of this annual [[exorcism]] of the noxious spirits of the dead, the whole month of May was rendered unlucky for marriages, whence the proverb ''Mense Maio malae nubent'' ("They wed ill who wed in May").

== Legacy ==
According to some cultural historians,&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Days of the Dead" in Christian Roy, ed. ''Traditional festivals: a multicultural encyclopedia'', 2005, vol. 2: ''s.v.'' "All Saints' Day and Halloween": "...yet May 13 had also happened to be the last day of the Roman Lemuria for lost souls"; Richard P. Taylor, ''Death and the Afterlife: a cultural encyclopedia'' 200, p. 163: "Pope Boniface IV (608-615) replaced Lemuria with "All Saints' Day" on 13 May."&lt;/ref&gt; this ancient custom was [[Christianization|Christianized]] when either in 609 or 610, [[Pope Boniface IV]] consecrated the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] at Rome to the Blessed Virgin and ''all the martyrs''; the feast of that ''dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres'' has been celebrated at Rome ever since and started the feast of [[All Saints' Day]].&lt;ref&gt;An attempt to connect the ''cultus'' of All Saints' and All Souls' Day with the Roman [[Parentalia]], observed however in  February, is sometimes made: e.g. Gordon J. Laing, ''Survivals of Roman Religion'' (Boston 1931) p. 84: "...the thirteenth of May, which was one of the days of the Roman festival of the dead, the Lemuria. Whether there is any connection between these dates or not, the rites of All Saints' Day are a survival not of the Lemuria but of the Parentalia."&lt;/ref&gt; However, others see a link to the 13 May date in [[Saint Ephrem]]'s celebration of All Saints on that day in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alban Butler|Butler's Lives of Saints]], Volume 4, Nov. 1, citing in turn [https://books.google.com/books?id=4EIYAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=carmina+nisibena&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ugPgTMnmGMSp8Aatv5SzDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ephraem Syrus, ''Carmina Nisibena'', ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16913">{{about|the purported secret committee called 'Majestic 12'}}
In [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy theories]], '''Majestic 12''' (or '''MJ-12''') is the [[code name]] of an alleged secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, formed in 1947 by an [[executive order]] by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] to facilitate recovery and investigation of [[Flying saucer|alien spacecraft]]. The concept originated in a series of supposedly leaked secret government documents first circulated by [[List of ufologists|ufologists]] in 1984. Upon examination, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) declared the documents to be "completely bogus", and many ufologists consider them to be an elaborate [[hoax]].&lt;ref name="Donovan2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=Barna William|title=Conspiracy Films: A Tour of Dark Places in the American Conscious|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkhqU1IXHAC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=17 September 2014|date=2011-07-20|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786486151|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FBI_bogus/&gt; Majestic 12 remains popular among some UFO conspiracy theorists and the concept has appeared in popular culture including television, film and literature.

==History and analysis==
The concept of "Majestic Twelve" emerged during a period in the 1980s when ufologists believed there had been a [[cover-up]] of the [[Roswell UFO incident]] and speculated some secretive upper tier of the United States government was responsible.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2008"&gt;{{citation|author=Robert Alan Goldberg|title=Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8e5YELGGFAC&amp;pg=PA189|date=1 October 2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-13294-6|pages=189–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their suppositions appeared to be confirmed in 1984 when ufologist Jaime Shandera received an envelope containing film which, when developed, showed images of eight pages of documents that appeared to be briefing papers describing "Operation Majestic Twelve".&lt;ref name="Goldberg2008" /&gt; The documents purported to reveal a secret committee of twelve, supposedly authorized by United States President Harry S. Truman in 1952, and explain how the crash of an alien spacecraft at Roswell in 1947 had been concealed, how the recovered alien technology could be exploited, and how the United States should engage with extraterrestrial life in the future.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight2003" /&gt;

Shandera and his ufologist colleagues [[Stanton T. Friedman]] and [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|Bill Moore]] say they later received a series of anonymous messages that led them to find what has been called the "Cutler/Twining memo" in 1985 while searching declassified files in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. Purporting to be written by President Eisenhower's assistant Robert Cutler to General [[Nathan Farragut Twining|Nathan F. Twining]] and containing a reference to Majestic 12, the memo is widely held to be a forgery, likely planted as part of a hoax.&lt;ref name="Frazier"&gt;{{citation|author=Kendrick Frazier|title=The Hundredth Monkey: And Other Paradigms of the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ1v3bggyr8C&amp;pg=PA338|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-401-1|pages=338–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Robert Goldberg wrote that the ufologists came to believe the story despite the documents being "obviously planted to bolster the legitimacy of the briefing papers".&lt;ref name="Goldberg2008" /&gt;

Claiming to be connected to the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations, a man named Richard Doty told filmmaker [[Linda Moulton Howe]] that the MJ-12 story was true, and showed Howe unspecified documents purporting to prove the existence of small, grey humanoid aliens originating from the [[Zeta Reticuli]] star system. Doty reportedly promised to supply Howe with film footage of UFOs and an interview with an alien being, although no footage ever materialized.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2008" /&gt;

Soon, distrust and suspicion led to disagreements within the ufology community over the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents, and Moore was accused of taking part in an elaborate hoax, while other ufologists and debunkers such as [[Philip J. Klass]] were accused of being "disinformation agents".&lt;ref name="Knight2003"&gt;{{citation|author=Peter Knight|title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&amp;pg=PA490|date=1 January 2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-812-9|pages=490–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klass's investigation of the MJ-12 documents found that Robert Cutler was actually out of the country on the date he supposedly wrote the "Cutler/Twining memo", and that the Truman signature was "a pasted-on photocopy of a genuine signature —including accidental scratch marks — from a memo that Truman wrote to [[Vannevar Bush]] on October 1, 1947". Klass dismissed theories that the documents were part of a disinformation campaign as "ridiculous", saying they contained numerous flaws that could never fool Soviet or Chinese intelligence. Other discrepancies noted by Klass included the use of a distinctive date format that matched one used in Moore's personal letters, and a conversation reported by Brad Sparks in which Moore confided that he was contemplating creating and releasing some hoax Top Secret documents in hopes that such bogus documents would encourage former military and intelligence officials who knew about the government's (alleged) UFO coverup to break their oaths of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klass|first1=Philip|title=The New Bogus Majestic-12 Documents|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/new_bogus_majestic-12_documents|website=CSI|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI began its own investigation of the supposed "secret" documents and quickly formed doubts as to their authenticity. The [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] stated that no such committee had ever been authorized or formed, and that the documents were "bogus". The FBI subsequently declared the MJ-12 documents to be "completely bogus".&lt;ref name=FBI_bogus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vault.fbi.gov/Majestic%2012/Majestic%2012%20Part%201%20of%201/at_download/file |title= FBI – Majestic 12 Part 1 of 1 |work=An FBI archive containing details of "Majestic 12" |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1996, a document called the MJ-12 "Special Operations Manual" circulated among ufologists. It is also widely considered to be a fake and "a continuation of the MJ-12 myth".&lt;ref name="Denzler2001"&gt;{{citation|author=Brenda Denzler|title=The Lure of the Edge: Scientific Passions, Religious Beliefs, and the Pursuit of UFOs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnQU2Q65lWsC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93027-8|pages=190–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ufologists Linda Moulton Howe and [[Stanton T. Friedman]] believe the MJ12 Documents are authentic. Friedman examined the documents and has argued that the United States government has conspired to cover up knowledge of a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2008" /&gt;

According to journalist [[Howard Blum]] the name "Majestic 12" had been prefigured in the UFO community when [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|Bill Moore]] asked ''[[National Enquirer]]'' reporter Bob Pratt in 1982 to collaborate on a novel called ''MAJIK-12''. Because of this, Blum writes, Pratt had always been inclined to think the Majestic 12 documents a hoax.&lt;ref name="Blum1991"&gt;{{citation|author=Howard Blum|title=Out there: the government's secret quest for extraterrestrials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYTvAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1991|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-66260-8|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skeptical movement|Scientific skeptic]] author [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] investigated the history of the subject, and reported his findings in the 2016 Skeptoid podcast episode "The Secret History of Majestic 12". He concluded that, rather than a hoax perpetrated by the UFO community, it is likely the papers were actually part of a [[disinformation]] campaign of the US government meant to deflect attention from secret Air Force projects.&lt;ref name = Dunning/&gt; Referring to the MJ-12 documents, Dunning states:

{{Quote|text=They were classic disinformation, false documents created to play a role in real national security. They were designed and written for specific [[Confidence trick#mark|marks]] who did with them exactly what they were meant to. They took advantage of well-meaning patriots who wanted enhanced national security, and who, by being easy to fool, ended up providing exactly that.&lt;ref name = Dunning&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4528|number=528|title=The Secret History of Majestic 12|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In popular culture ==
* The 1997 [[Roleplaying Game]] ''[[Delta Green]]'', a modern-day sourcebook for [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]], has MAJESTIC-12 as a major rival and enemy of the eponymous organization. Similar to Delta Green, they are a government conspiracy dealing with the unnatural and the [[Cthulhu Mythos|Mythos]], formed mostly by [[CIA]], [[NSA]] and [[National Reconnaissance Office|NRO]] agents. In ''Delta Green'' MAJESTIC was founded after the Roswell incident and soon made frequent contact with the greys, which deliver them technology. Secretly the greys are actually vessel bodies created by the [[Mi-Go]] and used to hide their true form to humans and to perform secret experiments on humanity. MAJESTIC-12 made a deal with the US government, and in exchange of power and with the help of the grey technology, MAJESTIC delivers "The Report", containing extensive intelligence on every enemy military asset in the world, such as [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|Soviet nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1997 |title=Delta Green|publisher=[[Pagan Publishing]] |isbn=1-887797-08-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2016 standalone game, MAJESTIC-12 loses their power after a series of successful Delta Green operations against the [[Mi-Go]] makes the greys end contact with MAJESTIC. The organization is subsequently destroyed by Delta Green and by 2002 after the [[September 11 attacks]], is absorbed by a now official Delta Green into "The Program", [[NSA]] and other contractors of the [[Military–industrial complex]] such as the fictional Marsh Industries.&lt;ref name="Ivey Detwiller Glancy Hite 2018 p.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3078">The '''Marda Loop Justice Film Festival (MLJFF)''', a program of the Marda Loop Justice Film Festival Society, is a [[Canada|Canadian]] film festival that takes place annually in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. Held each November, the festival showcases justice-related [[Documentary film|documentaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/movies/film-features/justice-marda-loop/|title=Justice in Marda Loop|last=Francis|first=Kyle|date=2007-11-15|work=FFWD|accessdate=2009-01-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103035002/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/movies/film-features/justice-marda-loop/|archivedate=2008-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to documentary screenings, the MLJFF hosts a ‘[[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] Village’ – a gathering place where non-profit organizations can discuss with festival attendees how to advance positive change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justicefilmfestival.ca/ngo.php/loc%7Cmardaloop|title=NGO Village|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Marda Loop Justice Film Festival began in Calgary in 2006 under the direction of an informal group of volunteers. To create a lasting foundation for the festival, The Marda Loop Justice Film Festival Society was officially registered on September 14, 2007.

Over 30,000 individuals have attended the Marda Loop Justice Film Festival since its inception in 2006, and in 2015, the festival had over 4500 attendees averaging nearly 230 attendees per screening. All films are recent documentaries focusing on social justice issues which are both broad and relevant. Following a screening of the documentary this group arranges for an expert in the subject matter or issue to lead a time of question and answer. In addition, an NGO (Non Government Organization) Village is organized to facilitate social engagement and action by the viewers of these films. A November festival screens between 21 and 24 films. The justREEL series screens a single film in January, March, May and September. In 2016, the documentaries presented were chosen from a submission pool of more than 1000 filmmakers from over 100 countries. 

Because of its success, the MLJFF has helped form satellite festivals across Canada. These satellite festivals occur in Fort MacLoed AB; Red Deer, AB; and Sarnia, ON.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/screen/film-features/a-social-conscience-at-the-movies-8422/|title=A social conscience at the movies|last=Wilt|first=James|date=2011-11-17|work=FFWD|accessdate=2012-11-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120062533/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/screen/film-features/a-social-conscience-at-the-movies-8422/|archivedate=2011-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mata Hari''''' is a musical with a book by [[Jerome Coopersmith]], lyrics by [[Martin Charnin]] and music by Edward Thomas. The [[exotic dancer]] [[Mata Hari]] was accused of spying for the Germans during World War I and was executed by a French firing squad, but her guilt is still being debated.&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, Pat (2007). ''Femme Fatale: Love, Lies, and the Unknown Life of Mata Hari''. New York: HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt; The musical is centered on her affair with a French intelligence officer who plays a major role in her arrest and execution and later regrets it. A parallel sequence of events follows a young French soldier who fights in the trenches, illustrating what war is really about. The musical was perceived as an anti-war piece at a time when the US war in Vietnam was sinking in popularity.

The show's premiere production was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] and produced in 1967 by [[David Merrick]] at National Theatre in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marisa-mell.blogspot.com.au/search/label/Mata%20Hari ''Mata Hari''], Marisa Mell blog, accessed 15 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The production lost at least $500,000, and Merrick decided not to bring the show to Broadway.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{Cite news|title = MATA HARI' GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE; Merrick Show That Failed Is Due Off Broadway|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CEEDB1530E034BC4C53DFB6678383679EDE|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1968-10-04|access-date = 2016-01-29|issn = 0362-4331|first = Sam|last = Zolotow}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, after Merrick withdrew his support of the musical, the authors brought a more modest version of it to New York's off-Broadway Theatre DeLys (now the [[Lucille Lortel Theater]]) under the title "''Ballad For a Firing Squad"''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; In 1996, York Theatre in New York revived the 1968 version under the original title ''Mata Hari''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = York Theatre Version of Mata Hari (Thomas/Charnin, 1967) {{!}} Ovrtur|url = http://www.ovrtur.com/show/120276/version/79874891|website = www.ovrtur.com|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cast recording of that production was released in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Mata Hari|url = https://www.amazon.com/Mata-Hari-Martin-Charnin/dp/B00005LOPM|publisher = Original Cast Record|date = 2000-01-01|accessdate = 2016-01-29|last = Martin Charnin|last2 = Edward Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Congress passed legislation in late June 2008 to provide Mexico with US$1.6 billion for the [[Mérida Initiative]] to provide Mexico with law enforcement training and equipment, as well as technical advice to strengthen the national justice systems.

== Background ==
{{See also|Timeline of the Mexican Drug War}}
Due to its location, Mexico has long been used as a staging and transshipment point for narcotics and contraband between Latin America and U.S. markets. Mexican bootleggers supplied alcohol to the United States gangsters throughout the duration of the [[Prohibition in the United States]],&lt;ref name="Vulliamy 2010" /&gt; and the onset of the [[illegal drug trade]] with the U.S. began when the prohibition came to an end in 1933.&lt;ref name="Vulliamy 2010" /&gt; Towards the end of the 1960s, Mexican narcotic smugglers started to smuggle drugs on a major scale.&lt;ref name="Vulliamy 2010" /&gt;

During the 1970s and early 1980s, [[Colombia]]'s [[Pablo Escobar]] was the main exporter of [[cocaine]] and dealt with organized criminal networks all over the world. [[Griselda Blanco#Miami drug war|When enforcement efforts intensified in South Florida]] and the Caribbean, the Colombian organizations formed partnerships with the Mexico-based traffickers to transport cocaine by land through Mexico into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DEA History |publisher=US DEA |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/history_part2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823025801/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/history/history_part2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-08-23 |accessdate=2008-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was easily accomplished because Mexico had long been a major source of [[heroin]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and drug traffickers from Mexico had already established an infrastructure that stood ready to serve the Colombia-based traffickers. By the mid-1980s, the organizations from Mexico were well-established and reliable transporters of Colombian cocaine. At first, the Mexican gangs were paid in cash for their transportation services, but in the late 1980s, the Mexican transport organizations and the Colombian drug traffickers settled on a payment-in-product arrangement.&lt;ref name="Stratfor Intelligence"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico, U.S., Italy: The Cocaine Connection |date=September 18, 2008 |publisher=Stratfor Intelligence |url=http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20080918_mexico_u_s_italy_cocaine_connection |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122003922/http://stratfor.com/analysis/20080918_mexico_u_s_italy_cocaine_connection |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transporters from Mexico usually were given 35% to 50% of each cocaine shipment. This arrangement meant that organizations from Mexico became involved in the distribution, as well as the transportation of cocaine, and became formidable traffickers in their own right. In recent years, the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] and the [[Gulf Cartel]] have taken over trafficking cocaine from Colombia to the worldwide markets.&lt;ref name="Stratfor Intelligence" /&gt;

The balance of power between the various Mexican cartels continually shifts as new organizations emerge and older ones weaken and collapse. A disruption in the system, such as the arrests or deaths of cartel leaders, generates bloodshed as rivals move in to exploit the power vacuum.&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite news |first=Fred |last=Burton |title=Mexico: The Price of Peace in the Cartel Wars |date=May 2, 2007 |publisher=Stratfor Global Intelligence |url=http://www.stratfor.com/mexico_price_peace_cartel_wars |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership vacuums are sometimes created by law enforcement successes against a particular cartel, so cartels often will attempt to pit law enforcement against one another, either by bribing Mexican officials to take action against a rival or by leaking intelligence about a rival's operations to the Mexican or U.S. government's, [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].&lt;ref name=Burton /&gt;

While many factors have contributed to the escalating violence, security analysts in Mexico City trace the origins of the rising scourge to the unraveling of a longtime implicit arrangement between narcotics traffickers and governments controlled by the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (IRP), which began to lose its grip on political power in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jana |last=Bussey |title=Drug lords rose to power when Mexicans ousted old government |date=September 15, 2008 |agency=McClatchy Newspapers|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting between rival drug cartels began in earnest after the 1989 arrest of [[Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo]], who ran the cocaine business in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1867842.stm |title=Analysis: Mexico's drug wars continue |date=2002-03-12 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a lull in the fighting during the late 1990s but the violence has steadily worsened since 2000.

=== Presidents ===
The [[centrist]] [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] party ruled Mexico for around 70 years until 2000. During this time, drug cartels expanded their power and corruption, and anti-drug operations focused mainly on destroying marijuana and opium crops in mountainous regions. There were no large-scale high-profile military operations against their core structures in urban areas until the [[2000 Mexican election]], when the right-wing [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] party gained the presidency and started a crackdown on cartels in their own turf.

==== Presidency of Vicente Fox ====
[[File:Mexican Army.jpg|thumb|Mexican soldiers training in August 2010]]
It is estimated that about 110 people died in Nuevo Laredo between January and August 2005 as a result of the fighting between the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4144686.stm |title=Gang wars plague Mexican drugs hub |date=2005-08-14 |publisher=BBC News |first=Claire |last=Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, there was another surge in violence in the state of [[Michoacán]] as the [[La Familia Michoacana]] drug cartel established itself.

==== Presidency of Felipe Calderón ====
On December 11, 2006, the newly elected [[Mexican President|President]] [[Felipe Calderón]] dispatched 6,500 [[Mexican Army]] soldiers to Michoacán, his home state, to end drug violence there. This action is regarded as the first major retaliation made against the cartel violence, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the Mexican Drug War between the government and the drug cartels.&lt;ref name="iht.com"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/11/america/LA_GEN_Mexico_Drug_Violence.php | title = Mexican government sends 6,500 to state scarred by drug violence | date = December 11, 2002 |work=International Herald Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, Calderón continued to escalate his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now about 45,000 troops involved along with state and federal police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Jorge Ramos  |author2=Ricardo Gómez  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Urge sanear sistema de justicia: gobierno | date=November 27, 2008 | url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/164031.html | work =El Universal | accessdate =March 1, 2009 | language =Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto ====

In 2012, newly elected president Enrique Peña Nieto emphasized that he did not support the involvement of armed American agents in Mexico, being only interested in allowing the US to continue with their military training of Mexican forces in counter-insurgency tactics.&lt;ref&gt;http://latino.foxnews.com/2012/07/06/mexico-pena-nieto-will-use-us-help-in-drug-war&lt;/ref&gt; Peña stated that he planed to deescalate the conflict, focusing in lowering criminal violence rates, as opposed to the previous policy of a attacking drug-trafficking organizations by arresting or killing the most-wanted drug lords and intercepting their drug shipments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/69hOifSrP?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/2811-what-mexicos-elections-mean-for-crime-policy-part-i&lt;/ref&gt;

However in the first 14 months of his administration, between December 2012 and January 2014, 23,640 people died in the conflict.&lt;ref name="zetatijuana.com" /&gt; 

In 2013 Mexico saw the rise of the controversial [[Grupos de Autodefensa Comunitaria]] (self-defendese groups) in southern Mexico, para-military groups led by land-owners, ranchers and other rural businessmen that took up arms against the criminal groups that wanted to impose dominance in their towns, entering a new phase in the Mexiacan war on drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Heineman, Matthew. Cartel Land. Netflix video. Directed by Matthew Heineman. 2015. A&amp;E Indie Films&lt;/ref&gt; However this strategy, allegedly proposed by General Óscar Naranjo (Peña's security advisor from Colombia),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.co/colombia/mexico-pide-expulsion-del-general-oscar-naranjo-por-apoyo-autodefensas-149029&lt;/ref&gt; crumbled when autodefenzas started to have internal organization struggles and dissagremts with the goverment, being finally infiltrated by criminal elements, that deprived the goverment forces the hability to distinguish between armed-civilian convoys and drug-cartel convoys, forcing Peña's administration to distance from them.&lt;ref&gt;Kryt, Jeremy. "Meet the Warlord of the Viagras, Mexico's Hardest Cartel Yet". The Daily Beast, 3, Dec. 2017. https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-the-warlord-of-the-viagras-mexicos-hardest-cartel-yet&lt;/ref&gt;

Peña's handling of the 2014 Iguala mass murder of activist students by hand of corrupt government oficials coluded with a drug cartel and the 2015 escape of drug lord "El Chapo" Guzmán from the Altiplano maximum security prison sparked international criticism.&lt;ref&gt;http://msnlatino.telemundo.com/informacion_y_noticias/Noticias_Telemundo/article/2014-10/iguala_y_los_43_estudiantes_desaparecidos_la_mas_grave_crisis_del_gobierno_mexicano&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/world/americas/mexico-joaquin-guzman-loera-el-chapo-prison-escape.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&lt;/ref&gt;

A great part of Peña Nieto's strategy consisted in making the Mexican [[Secretariat of the Interior (Mexico)|Interior Ministry]] the solely responsible for public security and the creation of a national militray level police force called the [[gendarmerie]]. In December 2017, the [[:es:Ley de Seguridad Interior|Law of Internal Security]] was passed by legislation but was met with criticism, especially from the [[CNDH|National Human Rights Commission]], accusing it gave the President a [[wikt:carte blanche|blank check]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/AristeguiOnline/status/936399552122380292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://aristeguinoticias.com/3011/mexico/mas-poder-al-presidente-y-a-las-fuerzas-armadas-las-entranas-de-la-ley-de-seguridad-interior/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thewire.in/206138/mexican-national-human-rights-commission-likely-take-legal-action-security-law/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mexico-Human-Rights-Watchdog-to-Challenge-Security-Law-in-Court-20171222-0023.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/mexicos-president-signs-internal-security-law-before-court-review-2017-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Presidency of Andrés Manuel López Obrador ====
[[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] (AMLO), the President from the [[National Regeneration Movement]] party, took office on December 1, 2018. One of his campaign promises was a controversial "strategy for peace", that is to give amnesty to all Mexicans involved in drug production and trafficking as a way to stop the drug trade and the resulting turf violence.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/03/mexico-candidate-amnesty-drug-dealers/570533002/ Amnesty for drug dealers? This Mexico presidential candidate is pushing for forgiveness]. David Agren, ''USA Today''. 3 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His proposed amnesty is still ill-defined.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt; His aides explained that the plan was not to pardon real criminals, like drug cartel members, but to prevent other people from following that path, especially low-income and young people that may end up in jail for drug possession.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elsoldelcentro.com.mx/mexico/politica/coordinadores-de-amlo-aclaran-amnistia-no-sera-para-capos-del-narcotrafico-1641285.html&lt;/ref&gt; President-elect points out that the past approaches failed because they were based on misunderstanding the core problem. According to him, the underlying issue is Mexico's great social disparities which previous governments' economic policies did not reduce. He promised not to use arms to suppress the people and announced to free political prisoners. His approach is to pay more attention to the victims of violent crime and wants to revisit two previously taken strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Restart needed|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/mexicos-next-president-has-promised-new-policy-security-and-drugs-related-crime|author=Virginia Mercado|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=20 November 2018 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 Mexican cartels have used the dense, isolated portions of U.S. federal and state parks and forests to grow marijuana under the canopy of thick trees. Billions of dollars’ worth of marijuana has been produced annually on US soil. “In 2006, federal and state authorities seized over 550,000 marijuana plants worth an estimated 1 billion dollars in Kentucky’s remote Appalachian counties” Cartels profited from marijuana growing operations from Arkansas to Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Longmire, Sylvia.

==== Use ====
The prevalence of illicit drug use in Mexico is still low compared to the United States;&lt;ref name=NIH /&gt; however, with the increased role of Mexico in the trafficking and production of [[Recreational drug use|illicit drugs]], the availability of drugs has slowly increased locally since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10826080500411478 |issn=1082-6084 |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=707–727 |last=Brouwer |first=Kimberly C |author2=Patricia Case |author3=Rebeca Ramos |author4=Carlos Magis-Rodríguez |author5=Jesus Bucardo |author6=Thomas L Patterson |author7=[[Steffanie A.

As the United States of America is the world's largest consumer of cocaine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2086.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of other illegal drugs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-leads-the-world-in-illegal-drug-use/|title=U.S. Leads the World in Illegal Drug Use |publisher=CBS News |date=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; their demand is what motivates the drug business, and the main goal of Mexican cartels is to introduce narcotics into the US.

The export rate of cocaine to the U.S. has decreased following stricter border control measures in response to the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=NIH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://drugabuse.com/library/cocaine-history-and-statistics/ Cocaine History and Statistics]. Erik MacLaren, PhD, ''Drug Abuse.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led to a surplus of cocaine which has resulted in local Mexican dealers attempting to offload extra narcotics along trafficking routes, especially in border areas popular among low income North American tourists.

Drug shipments are often delayed in Mexican border towns before delivery to the US, which has forced drug traffickers to increase prices to account for transportation costs of products across international borders, making it a more profitable business for the drug lords, and has likely contributed to the increased rates of local drug consumption.&lt;ref name=NIH /&gt;

With increased cocaine use, there has been a parallel rise in demand for drug user treatment in Mexico.&lt;ref name=NIH /&gt;

=== Poverty ===
{{Main|Poverty in Mexico}}
One of the main factors driving the Mexican Drug War is the willingness of mainly lower-class people to earn easy money joining criminal organizations, and the failure of the government to provide the legal means for the creation of well paid jobs. From 2004 to 2008 the portion of the population who received less than half of the median income rose from 17% to 21% and the proportion of population living in extreme or moderate poverty rose from 35 to 46% (52 million persons) between 2006 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/violence-and-crime-in-mexico-at-the-crossroads-of-misgovernance-poverty-and-inequality |title=Violence and crime in Mexico at the crossroads of misgovernance, poverty and inequality |publisher=World Bank blog |accessdate=2014-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020160702/http://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/violence-and-crime-in-mexico-at-the-crossroads-of-misgovernance-poverty-and-inequality |archive-date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/8/49363879.pdfwork=oecd.org|title=Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=13 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626122849/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/8/49363879.pdfwork%3Doecd.org|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.coneval.gob.mx/Informes/Evaluaci%C3%B3n%202011/Informe%20de%20Evaluaci%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Pol%C3%ADtica%20de%20Desarrollo%20Social%202011/Informe_de_evaluacion_de_politica_social_2011.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021025820/http://web.coneval.gob.mx/Informes/Evaluaci%C3%B3n%202011/Informe%20de%20Evaluaci%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Pol%C3%ADtica%20de%20Desarrollo%20Social%202011/Informe_de_evaluacion_de_politica_social_2011.pdf|date=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[OECD]] countries, Mexico has the second highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/soc_glance-2011-en/06/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=/content/chapter/soc_glance-2011-16-en&amp;containerItemId=/content/serial/19991290&amp;accessItemIds=/content/book/soc_glance-2011-en&amp;mimeType=text/html|title=OECD iLibrary: Statistics / Society at a Glance / 2011 / Income inequality&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=oecd-ilibrary.org|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36%. OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average.&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt;

In 2012 it was estimated that Mexican cartels employed over 450,000 people directly and a further 3.2 million people's livelihoods depended on various parts of the drug trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Paramilitarism and State -Terrorism in Mexico as a Case Study of Shrinking Functions of the Neoliberal State|last=Chew Sanchez|first=Martha|date=2014 |journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cities such as Ciudad Juárez, up to 60% of the economy depended on illegitimate money making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Murder City: Ciudad Juárez and the Global Economy's New Killing Fields|last=Bowden|first=C|publisher=First Nation Books.|year=2011 |isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ineffective educational system ===
Illiteracy and lack of education have been present in Mexico for much of its history. In 1940, 58% of all Mexicans over the age of six were illiterate; in 1960, 38% were illiterate.&lt;ref name="alba"&gt;Francisco Alba, ''The Population of Mexico: Trends, Issues, and Policies'' (New Brunswick: Transaction Books, 1982), 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960 national census found that as to all Mexicans over the age of five, 43.7% had not completed one year of school, 50.7% had completed six years or less of school, and only the remaining 5.6% had continued their education beyond six years of school.&lt;ref name="alba" /&gt;

More recently, researchers from the [[World Economic Forum]] have noted that despite Mexico's relatively high investment of 5.3% of its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in education as of 2009 (31st out of 134 economies), the nation's primary education system is ranked 116th, thereby suggesting "that the problem is not how much but rather how resources are invested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ricardo Hausmann|author2=Emilio Lozoya Austin|author3=Irene Mia|last-author-amp=yes|title=The Mexico Competitiveness Report 2009|url=http://www.weforum.org/pdf/Mexico/MCR_2009.pdf|year=2009|publisher=World Economic Forum|page=15|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301104318/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/Mexico/MCR_2009.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WEF further explained: "The powerful teachers union, the [[Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación|National Union of Education Workers]] (SNTE), the largest labor union in Latin America, has been in large part responsible for blocking reforms that would increase the quality of spending and help ensure equal access to education. Poor teacher performance and learning outcomes are associated with the SNTE-dominated, centralized [[collective bargaining]] for many work rules[.]" The result of the high levels of poverty, lack of well paid jobs, government corruption, and the systemic failure of Mexico's schools has been the appearance of ''los ninis'', an underclass of several million dropouts who ''[[NEET|ni trabajan ni estudian]]'' (neither work nor study), of whom many ended up as combatants on behalf of the cartels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longmire|first=Sylvia|title=Cartel: The Coming Invasion of Mexico's Drug Wars|year=2011|publisher=Macmillan|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, teachers unions argue that they oppose being tested and graded on their students' performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.mx/mexico/politica/maestros-mexicanos-mantienen-sus-protestas-contra-la-promulgada-reforma-educativa,713708246f701410VgnCLD2000000dc6eb0aRCRD.html|title=Maestros mexicanos mantienen sus protestas contra la promulgada reforma educativa|work=Terra}}&lt;/ref&gt; with universally standard exams that do not take into account the socio-economic differences between middle class urban schools and under-equipped poor rural schools, which has an important effect on the students performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimacnoticias.com.mx/node/64285|title=Reforma educativa pega a maestras rurales – Cimac Noticias|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2015/08/29/politica/014n1pol|title=La Jornada: No es capricho el rechazo a la reforma educativa, afirman docentes y directores|author=DEMOS, Desarrollo de Medios, S.A. de C.V.|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|date=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/video_fotos/2013/11/131127_galeria_escuelas_rurales_mexico_aa|title=En fotos: la pobreza de las escuelas rurales en México|work=BBC Mundo|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/opinion/22-07-2015/37149|title=Calidad educativa en las comunidades rurales de México|author=Luis Felipe Lomelí|work=SinEmbargo OPINIÓN|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, teachers argue that the legislations are ambiguous, only focus on the teachers, without touching the [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Education Ministry]], and will allow more abuses and more political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinembargo.mx/12-06-2013/647323|title=EDUCACIÓN, ENTRE REFORMA AMBIGUA Y UN SNTE DÉBIL|author=María Elena Ramos|work=SinEmbargo MX|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sopitas.com/325408-4-datos-macabros-del-primer-mapa-salarial-de-maestros-en-mexico/|title=4 datos macabros del primer mapa salarial de maestros en México|work=Sopitas.com|accessdate=23 April 2016|date=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2013/05/25/politica/009n2pol|title=La Jornada: Revira la CNTE: la explicación a la propuesta, ambigua y contradictoria|author=DEMOS, Desarrollo de Medios, S.A. de C.V.|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|date=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pueblaonline.com.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8889&amp;catid=91&amp;Itemid=94|title=Los negocios en el sector educativo en Puebla|first=Alejajalisco no |last=Rosas|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://redie.uabc.mx/redie/article/view/310/663|title=La corrupción en sistemas educativos: una revisión de prácticas, causas, efectos y recomendaciones – Cárdenas Denham – Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa|journal=Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa|volume=14|issue=2|accessdate=23 April 2016|date=November 2012|last1=Denham|first1=Sergio Cárdenas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mexican cartels ==
{{further information|List of Mexico's 37 most-wanted drug lords}}
=== Origin ===
The birth of most Mexican drug cartels is traced to former Mexican Judicial Federal Police agent [[Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo]] ("The Godfather"), who founded the [[Guadalajara Cartel]] in 1980 and controlled most of the [[illegal drug trade]] in Mexico and the trafficking corridors across the Mexico–U.S. border along with [[Juan García Ábrego]] throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |authors=Tim Padgett and Elaine Shannon |title=The Border Monsters |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000094,00.html |work=Time |accessdate=2010-02-08 |date=2001-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started off by smuggling [[marijuana]] and [[opium]] into the U.S., and was the first Mexican drug chief to link up with [[Colombia]]'s [[cocaine]] [[Drug cartel|cartels]] in the 1980s. Through his connections, Félix Gallardo became the person at the forefront of the [[Medellín Cartel]], which was run by [[Pablo Escobar]].&lt;ref name="Last Narco"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beith |first1=Malcolm |title=The Last Narco |publisher=Grove Press |year=2010 |location=New York |pages=40–55 |isbn=978-0-8021-1952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was easily accomplished because Félix Gallardo had already established a marijuana trafficking infrastructure that stood ready to serve the Colombia-based cocaine traffickers.

There were no cartels at that time in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Last Narco" /&gt;{{rp|41}} Félix Gallardo was the lord of Mexican drug smugglers.&lt;ref name="Last Narco" /&gt; He oversaw all operations; there was just him, his cronies, and the politicians who sold him protection.&lt;ref name="Last Narco" /&gt; However, the Guadalajara Cartel suffered a major blow in 1985 when the group's co-founder [[Rafael Caro Quintero]] was captured, and later convicted, for the murder of [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent [[Enrique Camarena Salazar|Enrique Camarena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Hector |last=Tobar |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-13/news/mn-117_1_mexican-drug-lord |title=Drug Lord Convicted in Camarena's 1985 Murder : Narcotics: He draws a prison term of 40 years.

According to [[Peter Dale Scott]], the [[Guadalajara Cartel]] prospered largely because it enjoyed the protection of the [[Dirección Federal de Seguridad]] (DFS), under its chief [[Miguel Nazar Haro]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[[Peter Dale Scott]] (2000), [http://www.variant.org.uk/pdfs/issue11/Variant11.pdf "Washington and the politics of drugs"], ''Variant'', 2(11)&lt;/ref&gt;

Félix Gallardo "The Godfather" was arrested on April 8, 1989.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news | first=Larry| last=Rohter| title=In Mexico, Drug Roots Run Deep | date=1989-04-16 | publisher= | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/world/in-mexico-drug-roots-run-deep.html?pagewanted=1 | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2010-02-08 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then decided to divide up the trade he controlled as it would be more efficient and less likely to be brought down in one law enforcement swoop.&lt;ref name="Last Narco" /&gt;{{rp|47}} In a way, he was privatizing the Mexican drug business while sending it back underground, to be run by bosses who were less well known or not yet known by the DEA. Gallardo sent his lawyer to convene the nation's top drug traffickers at a house in the resort of Acapulco where he designated the ''plazas'' or territories.&lt;ref name="Last Narco" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/how-mexicos-traffickers-became-violent/ How Mexico’s Underworld Became Violent]. Patrick Corcoran, ''InSight Crime''. 31 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tijuana route would go to his nephews the [[Tijuana Cartel|Arellano Felix brothers]]. The [[Juárez Cartel|Ciudad Juárez route]] would go to the [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes|Carrillo Fuentes family]]. [[Miguel Caro Quintero]] would run the [[Sonora Cartel|Sonora corridor]]. Meanwhile, [[Joaquín Guzmán Loera]] and [[Ismael Zambada García]] would take over Pacific coast operations, becoming the [[Sinaloa Cartel]]. Guzmán and Zambada brought veteran [[Héctor Luis Palma Salazar]] back into the fold.  The control of the [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]] corridor—then becoming the [[Gulf Cartel]]—would be left undisturbed to its founder [[Juan García Ábrego]], who was not a party to the 1989 pact.&lt;ref&gt;"Police Reform in Mexico: Informal Politics and the Challenge of Institutional Change".

Félix Gallardo still planned to oversee national operations, as he maintained important connections, but he would no longer control all details of the business.&lt;ref name="Last Narco" /&gt;  When he was transferred to a high-security prison in 1993, he lost any remaining control over the other drug lords.&lt;ref&gt;"The Politics of Drug Violence: Criminals, Cops and Politicians in Colombia and Mexico".

=== Major cartels ===
{{Main|Drug cartel#Mexico}}

==== Los Zetas ====
{{Main|Los Zetas}}
In 1999, Gulf Cartel's leader, [[Osiel Cárdenas Guillén]], hired a group of 37 corrupt former elite military soldiers to work for him. These former Airmobile Special Forces Group ([[Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales|GAFE]]), and Amphibian Group of Special Forces (GANFE) soldiers became known as [[Los Zetas]] and began operating as a private army for the Gulf Cartel. During the early 2000s the Zetas were instrumental in the Gulf Cartel's domination of the drug trade in much of Mexico.

After the 2007 arrest and extradition of Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the Zetas seized the opportunity to strike out on their own. Under the leadership of [[Heriberto Lazcano]], the Zetas, numbering about 300, gradually set up their own independent drug, arms and human-trafficking networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2011/327768/6/dos-carteles-dominan-la-guerra-de-las-drogas-en-mexico.htm |title=Dos carteles dominan la guerra de las drogas en México :: El Informador |publisher=Informador.com.mx |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2012-05-27|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Los Zetas made a deal with ex-Sinaloa cartel commanders, the [[Beltrán-Leyva Cartel|Beltrán-Leyva brothers]] and since then, became rivals of their former employer/partner, the Gulf Cartel.&lt;ref name="MexiData"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Hannah (March 29, 2011).

In early 2010 the Zetas made public their split from the Gulf Cartel and began a bloody war with [[Gulf Cartel]] over control of northeast Mexico's drug trade routes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; This war has resulted in the deaths of thousands of cartel members and suspected members. Furthermore, due to alliance structures, the Gulf Cartel-Los Zetas conflict drew in other cartels, namely the Sinaloa Cartel which fought the Zetas in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;

The Zetas are notorious for targeting civilians, including the mass murder of 72 migrants in the [[2010 San Fernando massacre|San Fernando massacre]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;

The Zetas involved themselves in more than drug trafficking and have also been connected to [[human trafficking]], pipeline trafficked oil theft, extortion, and trading unlicensed CDs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; Their criminal network is said to reach far from Mexico including into Central America, the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;

On 15 July 2013, the [[Mexican Navy]] arrested the top Zeta boss [[Miguel Treviño Morales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/16/leader-mexico-zetas-drug-cartel-captured-us-federal-officials-say/|title=Leader of Mexico's Zetas cartel captured in city near Texas border|publisher=Fox News|date=2013-07-16|accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sinaloa Cartel ====
{{Main|Sinaloa Cartel}}

The [[Sinaloa Cartel]] began to contest the Gulf Cartel's domination of the coveted southwest Texas corridor following the arrest of Gulf Cartel leader [[Osiel Cárdenas]] in March 2003. The "Federation" was the result of a 2006 accord between several groups located in the Pacific state of [[Sinaloa]].

The [[Sinaloa Cartel]] fought the [[Juárez Cartel]] in a long and bloody battle for control over drug trafficking routes in and around the northern city of [[Ciudad Juárez]].

==== Gulf Cartel ====
{{Main|Gulf Cartel}}
[[File:Militaresmexicanos-Matamoros.JPG|thumb|Mexican Army raids a Gulf Cartel's house at [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]] in 2012]]
The [[Gulf Cartel]] (Cartel del Golfo), based in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], has been one of Mexico's two dominant cartels in recent years. In the late 1990s, it hired a private mercenary army (an enforcer group now called [[Los Zetas]]), which in 2006 stepped up as a partner but, in February 2010, their partnership was dissolved and both groups engaged in widespread violence across several border cities of [[Tamaulipas]] state,&lt;ref name="MexiData" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zetas-Golfo"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jaime |last=Hernández |title=EU: alarma guerra 'Zetas'-El Golfo |date=March 4, 2010 |work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |url =http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/176052.html |location=Mexico City |accessdate=2010-03-04 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; turning several border towns into "ghost towns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversaltv.com.mx/detalle17558.html Video: Narco deja pueblos fantasma en Tamaulipas] (March 4, 2010). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720234222/http://www.eluniversaltv.com.mx/detalle17558.html |date=July 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gulf Cartel (CDG) was strong at the beginning of 2011, holding off several Zetas incursions into its territory. However, as the year progressed, internal divisions led to intra-cartel battles in Matamoros and Reynosa, Tamaulipas state. The infighting resulted in several arrests and deaths in Mexico and in the United States. The CDG has since broken apart, and it appears that one faction, known as Los Metros, has overpowered its rival Los Rojos faction and is now asserting its control over CDG operations.&lt;ref name="stratfor.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/polarization-and-sustained-violence-mexicos-cartel-war |title=Geopolitical intelligence, economic, political, and military strategic forecasting |publisher=Stratfor |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2012-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311024250/http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/polarization-and-sustained-violence-mexicos-cartel-war |archivedate=2012-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The infighting has weakened the CDG, but the group seems to have maintained control of its primary plazas, or smuggling corridors, into the United States.&lt;ref name="stratfor.com" /&gt; The Mexican federal government has made notable successes in capturing the leadership of the Gulf Cartel. [[Osiel Cárdenas Guillén]], his brothers [[Antonio Cárdenas Guillén]], [[Mario Cárdenas Guillén]], and [[Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez]] have all been captured and incarcerated during [[Felipe Calderón]]'s administration.

==== La Familia Cartel ====
{{Main|La Familia Michoacana}}
La Familia Michoacana was a major Mexican drug cartel based in [[Michoacán]] between at least 2006 and 2011. It was formerly allied to the [[Gulf Cartel]] and [[Los Zetas]], but split off and became an independent organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7960198.stm |title=Mexico offers $2m for drug lords |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-24 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009–10, a counter-narcotics offensive by Mexican and U.S. government agencies produced the arrest of at least 345 suspected La Familia members in the U.S., and the incorrectly presumed death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/09/world/americas/mexico-drug-lord-nazario-moreno-killed/index.html?hpt=hp_t4 |publisher=CNN |title=Mexican cartel leader Nazario "El Chayo" Moreno reported dead – again |date=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one of the cartel's founders, [[Nazario Moreno González]], on December 9, 2010.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; The cartel then divided into the [[Knights Templar Cartel]] and a [[José de Jesús Méndez Vargas]]-led faction, which kept the name La Familia. Following the cartel's fragmentation in late 2010 and early 2011, the La Familia Cartel under Méndez Vargas fought the Knights Templar Cartel but on June 21, 2011 Méndez Vargas was arrested by Mexican authorities&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; and in mid-2011 the attorney general in Mexico (PGR) stated that La Familia Cartel had been "exterminated",&lt;ref name="Aug 2011"&gt;{{cite news |first=Aurora |last=Vega |title=Surgen cuatro grupos del narco en 2011; El Chapo es el capo más poderoso |date=7 August 2011 |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;id_nota=759098 |work=Excelsior |accessdate=2011-08-07 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving only the splinter group, the [[Knights Templar Cartel]].&lt;ref name="Raid"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico police raid 'La Familia drug cartel', killing 11 |date=28 May 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13586444 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kelly |last=Heffernan-Tabor |title=Mexican Authorities Arrest 46 Suspected Drug Gang Members |date=29 May 2011 |url=http://www.digtriad.com/news/article/177210/175/Mexican-Authorities-Arrest-46-Suspected-Drug-Gang-Members |publisher=WFMY News 2 |accessdate=2011-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602155511/http://www.digtriad.com/news/article/177210/175/Mexican-Authorities-Arrest-46-Suspected-Drug-Gang-Members |archivedate=2 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, La Familia forged an alliance with the Gulf Cartel against Los Zetas and [[Beltrán-Leyva Cartel]].&lt;ref name="MexiData"/&gt;

==== Tijuana Cartel ====

Due to infighting, arrests and the deaths of some of its top members, the Tijuana Cartel is a fraction of what it was in the 1990s and early 2000s, when it was considered one of the most potent and violent criminal organizations in Mexico by the police. After the arrest or assassination of various members of the Arellano Félix clan, the cartel is currently headed by [[Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano]], a nephew of the Arellano Félix brothers.

==== Knights Templar ====
{{Main|Knights Templar Cartel}}
The Knights Templar drug cartel (Spanish: ''Caballeros Templarios'') was created in Michoacán in March 2011 after the death of the charismatic leader of [[La Familia Michoacana]] cartel, [[Nazario Moreno González]].&lt;ref name=Tunics&gt;{{cite news |first=Miguel García |last=Tinoco |title=Criminales del Medievo; hallan túnicas de Caballeros Templarios |date=20 July 2011 |url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;id_nota=754520&amp;photo=12 |work=El Universal |accessdate=2011-07-20 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cartel is headed by [[Enrique Plancarte Solís]] and [[Servando Gómez Martínez]] who formed the Knights Templar due to differences with [[José de Jesús Méndez Vargas]], who had assumed leadership of [[La Familia Michoacana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexican cartel renames itself 'Knights Templar'|url=http://www.themonitor.com/articles/cartel-47932-mexican-drug.html|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Monitor (Texas)|The Monitor]]|date=11 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912061620/http://www.themonitor.com/articles/cartel-47932-mexican-drug.html|archivedate=12 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the emergence of the Knights Templar, sizable battles flared up during the spring and summer months between the Knights Templar and La Familia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; The organization has grown from a splinter group to a dominant force over La Familia, and at the end of 2011, following the arrest of José de Jesús "El Chango" Méndez Vargas, leader of La Familia, the cartel appeared to have taken over the bulk of La Familia's operations in Mexico and the U.S.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; In 2011 the Knights Templar appeared to have aligned with the Sinaloa Federation in an effort to root out the remnants of La Familia and to prevent Los Zetas from gaining a more substantial foothold in the [[Michoacán]] region of central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grillo |first=Ioan |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2079430,00.html |title=Mexico Drug War: Knights Templar Gang Usurps La Familia |work=Time |date=2011-06-23 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/new-cartel-announces-take-over-from-familia-michoacana|title=New Cartel Announces Takeover from Familia Michoacana|date=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Propaganda in the Mexican Drug War}}
Cartels have been engaged in religious [[propaganda]] and [[psychological operations]] to influence their rivals and those within their area of influence. They use banners or "narcomantas" to threaten their rivals. Some cartels hand out pamphlets and leaflets to conduct public relation campaigns. Many cartels have been able to control the information environment by threatening journalists, bloggers, and others who speak out against them. They have elaborate recruitment strategies targeting young adults to join their cartel groups. They have successfully branded the word "narco", and the word has become part of Mexican culture. There is music, television shows, literature, beverages, food, and architecture that all have been branded "narco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico Security Memo: Mitigating the Threat of Affiliate Groups|url=http://www.stratfor.com/sample/analysis/mexico-security-memo-mitigating-threat-affiliate-groups|accessdate=10 April 2012|publisher=Stratfor|date=8 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414131932/http://www.stratfor.com/sample/analysis/mexico-security-memo-mitigating-threat-affiliate-groups|archivedate=14 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paramilitaries ==
Paramilitary groups work alongside cartels to provide protection. This protection began with a focus on maintaining the drug trade; however, paramilitary groups now secure other valuable industries such as oil and mining. It has been suggested that the rise in paramilitary groups coincides with a loss of security within the government. These paramilitary groups came about in a number of ways. First,  waves of elite armed forces and government security experts have left the government to join the side of the cartels, responding to large bribes and an opportunity for wealth they may not have received in government positions. One such paramilitary group, the [[Los Zetas|Zetas]], employed military personnel to create one of the largest groups in Mexico. Some of the elite armed forces members who join paramilitaries are trained in the [[School of the Americas]]. These paramilitaries have sprung out of deregulation of the Mexican army, which has been slowly replaced by private security firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Paramilitarism and State-Terrorism in Mexico as a Case  Study of Shrinking Functions of the Neoliberal State|last=Chew Sánchez|first=M.

Branching out of just protecting drug cartels, paramilitary groups have entered many other financially profitable industries, such as oil, gas, kidnapping, and counterfeiting electronics. There has been a complete and total loss of control by the government and the only response has been to increase army presence, notably an army whose officials are often on the drug cartels payroll. The United States has stepped in to offer support in the “War on Drugs” through funding, training and military support, and transforming the Mexican judicial system to parallel the American system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Paramilitarism and State – Terrorism in Mexico as a Case Study of Shrinking Functions of the Neoliberal State|last=Chew Sánchez|first=Martha|date=2011|journal=Perspectives on Global Development &amp; Technology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gun origins ====
{{See also|Project Gunrunner|ATF gunwalking scandal}}
Some researchers have asserted that most weapons and arms trafficked into Mexico come from gun dealers in the United States. There is also strong evidence for this conclusion, indicating that many of the traceable weapons come from the failed American government Operation "[[ATF gunwalking scandal|Fast and Furious]]", and there is a geographic coincidence between the supposed American origin of the firearms and the places where these weapons are seized: Mainly in the northern Mexican states &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/sociedad/trafico-de-armas-problema-complejo-y-multifactorial-sedena.html|title=Tráfico de armas, problema complejo y multifactorial: Sedena|website=Elfinanciero.com.mx|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most grenades and rocket-launchers are smuggled through [[Guatemala]]n borders from [[Central America]].&lt;ref name="heavy weapons" /&gt; However some grenades are also smuggled from the US to Mexico &lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt; or stolen from the Mexican military.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] officials have stated that the statistic is misleading: out of approximately 30,000 weapons seized in drug cases in Mexico in 2004–2008, 7,200 appeared to be of U.S. origin, approximately 4,000 were found in ATF manufacturer and importer records, and 87 percent of those—3,480—originated in the United States.&lt;ref name="gao.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09709.pdf |title=Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security |date=June 2009 |work=Report to Congressional Requesters: Firearms Trafficking: U.S. Efforts to Combat Arms Trafficking to Mexico Face Planning and Coordination Challenges |publisher=United States Government Accountability Office |page=77 |id=GAO-09-709 |format=PDF |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StratFor"&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Stewart |title=Mexico's Gun Supply and the 90 Percent Myth |date=February 10, 2011 |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110209-mexicos-gun-supply-and-90-percent-myth |publisher=Stratfor Global Intelligence |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to control smuggling of firearms, the U.S. government is assisting Mexico with technology, equipment and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Colby |last=Goodman |first2=Michel |last2=Marco |title=U.S. Firearms Trafficking to Mexico: New Data and Insights Illuminate Key Trends and Challenges |journal=Working Paper Series on U.S.-Mexico Security Cooperation |date=September 2010 |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/news/docs/U.S.%20Firearms%20Trafficking%20to%20Mexico-%20Goodman%20Final.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426102836/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/news/docs/U.S.%20Firearms%20Trafficking%20to%20Mexico-%20Goodman%20Final.pdf |archivedate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Project Gunrunner]] was one such efforts between the U.S. and Mexico to collaborate in tracing Mexican guns which were manufactured in or imported legally to the U.S.&lt;ref name="OIG page 1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=U.S. Office of the Inspector General (OIG) – Evaluation and Inspections Division |title=Review by the Office Inspector General (OIG) of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF) implementation of Project Gunrunner |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |place=United States of America |page=1 |date=November 2010 |url=http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/ATF/e1101.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, it was falsely reported that ninety percent of arms either captured in Mexico or interdicted were from the United States. The U.S. [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and others have dispelled these claims, pointing that the Mexican sample submitted for ATF tracing is the fraction of weapons seized that appear to have been made in the U.S. or imported into the U.S.&lt;ref name="gao.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StratFor" /&gt;

In 2015, Official reports of the U.S. government and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and explosives (ATF) revealed that over the last years, Mexican cartels improved their firearm power, and that 70% of their weapons come from the U.S. Many of those guns were manufactured in Romania and Bulgaria, and then imported into the U.S. The Mexican cartels acquire those firearms mainly in the southern states of Texas, Arizona and California. After the United States, the top five countries of origin of firearms seized from Mexico were Spain, China, Italy, Germany and Romania. These five countries represent 17% of firearms smuggled into Mexico &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mexican drug cartels reinforce their fire power|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/english/2016/01/24/mexican-drug-cartels-reinforce-their-fire-power|website=El Universal|access-date=2016-01-25|date=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Project Gunrunner ====
{{Main|Project Gunrunner|ATF gunwalking scandal}}
[[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] [[Project Gunrunner]] has stated that the official objective is to stop the sale and export of guns from the United States into Mexico in order to deny Mexican drug cartels the firearms considered "tools of the trade".&lt;ref name="Gunrunner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Gunrunner |date=2011-02-17 |publisher=BATFE |url=http://www.atf.gov/firearms/programs/project-gunrunner/ |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220033714/http://www.atf.gov/firearms/programs/project-gunrunner/ |archivedate=February 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2011, it brought about a scandal when the project was accused of accomplishing the opposite by ATF permitting and facilitating "[[straw purchase]]" firearm sales to traffickers, and allowing the guns to "walk" and be transported to Mexico.

One notable incident was the "Black Swan operation" where [[Joaquín Guzmán]] Loera was finally captured. The ATF confirmed that one of the weapons the Mexican Navy seized from Guzmán's gunmen was one of the many weapons that were "lost" during the Project Gunrunner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/policia/arma_Chapo-Rapido_y_Furioso-Chapo_arma_Rapido_Furioso-armas_rapido_furioso_0_701929899.html|title=Arma en guarida de 'El Chapo' sí es de Rápido y Furioso: EU|website=Milenio|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many weapons from Project Gunrunner were found in a secret compartment from the "safe house" of José Antonio Marrufo "El Jaguar", one of Guzmán's most sanguinary lieutenants. He is accused of many killings in Ciudad Juárez, including the notorious massacre of 18 patients of the reahabilitation center "El Aliviane". It is believed that Marrufo armed his gunmen with weapons purchased in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/entrada-de-opinion/columna/hector-de-mauleon/nacion/2016/05/10/el-chapo-queria-ciudad-juarez|title='El Chapo' quería Ciudad Juárez|website=El Universal|access-date=2016-05-17|date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
{{Main|Operation Michoacán}}

=== Operation Michoacán ===
[[File:Fuerza del Estado Michoacán.jpg|thumb|Mexican soldiers during a confrontation in [[Michoacán]] in August 2007]]
Although violence between drug cartels had been occurring long before the war began, the government held a generally passive stance regarding cartel violence in the 1990s and early 2000s. That changed on December 11, 2006, when newly elected [[Mexican President|President]] [[Felipe Calderón]] sent 6,500 federal troops to the state of [[Michoacán]] to end drug violence there ([[Operation Michoacán]]). This action is regarded as the first major operation against organized crime, and became the starting point of the war between the government and the drug cartels.&lt;ref name=war&gt;{{cite news |first=Ioan |last=Grillo |title=Mexico cracks down on violence |date=December 11, 2006 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/295578_mexico12.html |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|agency=Associated Press |accessdate=November 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calderón escalated his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now about 45,000 troops involved in addition to state and federal police forces. In 2010 Calderón said that the cartels seek "to replace the government" and "are trying to impose a monopoly by force of arms, and are even trying to impose their own laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexican cartels move beyond drugs, seek domination |date=August 4, 2010 |publisher=MSNBC News |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38565051/ns/world_news-americas/ |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armada-de-mexico-300x350.jpg|thumb|Mexican Marines during an operation against a drug cartel at [[Xalapa, Veracruz]]]]
As of 2011, Mexico's military captured 11,544 people who were believed to have been involved with the cartels and organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 De Diciembre De 2011 – Lomas De Sotelo, D.F. |url=http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/sala-de-prensa/comunicados-de-prensa/8123-4-de-diciembre-de-2011-lomas-de-sotelo-df |publisher=SEDENA Mexican National Defense Department |accessdate=22 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316230701/http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/sala-de-prensa/comunicados-de-prensa/8123-4-de-diciembre-de-2011-lomas-de-sotelo-df |archivedate=March 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year prior, 28,000 individuals were arrested on drug-related charges. The decrease in eradication and drug seizures, as shown in statistics calculated by federal authorities, poorly reflects Calderón's security agenda. Since the war began, over forty thousand people have been killed as a result of cartel violence. During Calderón's presidential term, the murder rate of Mexico has increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corcoran |first=Patrick |title=Release of Mexico Murder Stats Reveals Shifting Landscape |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/1744-release-of-mexico-government-info-reveals-shifting-landscape |publisher=InSight |accessdate=22 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321054227/http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/1744-release-of-mexico-government-info-reveals-shifting-landscape |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |date=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Calderón set out to end the violent warfare between rival cartel leaders, critics argue that he inadvertently made the problem worse. The methods that Calderón adopted involved confronting the cartels directly. These aggressive methods have resulted in public killings and torture from both the cartels and the country's own government forces, which aids in perpetuating the fear and apprehension that the citizens of Mexico have regarding the war on drugs and its negative stigma. As cartel leaders are being removed from their positions, either in the form of arrest or death, power struggles for leadership in the cartels have become more intense, resulting in enhanced violence within the cartels themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Roger|title=The Mexican Drug War (2006–Present)|url=http://www.historyguy.com/mexico_drug_war.htm|publisher=The History Guy|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calderón's forces concentrate on taking down cartel members that have a high ranking in the cartel in an attempt to take down the whole organization. The resulting struggle to fill the recently vacated position is one that threatens the existence of many lives in the cartel. Typically, many junior-level cartel members then fight amongst one another, creating more and more chaos. The drug cartels are more aggressive and forceful now than they were in the past and at this point, the cartels hold much of the power in Mexico. Calderón relies heavily on the military to defend and fight against cartel activity. Calderón's military forces have yet to yield significant results in dealing with the violent cartels due in part to the fact that many of the law enforcement officials working for the Mexican government are suspected of being corrupt. There is suspicion that cartels have corrupted and infiltrated the military at a high level, influencing many generals and officers. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission has received nearly 5,800 complaints regarding military abuse since the beginning of the drug war in 2006. Additionally, the National Human Rights Commission has completed nearly 90 in-depth reports since 2007, addressing the many human rights violations towards civilians that have occurred while the military officers were actively participating in law enforcement activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Report 2012: Mexico |url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/mexico|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=22 May 2012|date=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence in May 2012 in which nearly 50 bodies were found on a local highway between the Mexico–United States border and Monterrey has led to the arrests of 4 high-ranking Mexican military officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkinson|first=Tracy|title=Dozens of Bodies, Many Mutilated, Dumped in Mexico.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/13/world/la-fg-mexico-bodies-20120514|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These officials were suspected of being on the cartel payrolls and alerting the cartels in advance of military action against them. Such actions demonstrate that Calderón's significant military offensive will continue to reveal mixed results until the military itself is rid of the corrupting influences of the cartels whom they supposedly aim to persecute.{{POV statement|date=December 2012}}

In April 2008, General Sergio Aponte, the man in charge of the anti-drug campaign in the state of [[Baja California]], made a number of allegations of corruption against the police forces in the region. Among his allegations, Aponte stated that he believed Baja California's anti-kidnapping squad was actually a kidnapping team working in conjunction with organized crime, and that bribed police units were being used as bodyguards for drug traffickers.&lt;ref name=Aponte&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2008/04/mexican-general.html |title=Mexican general makes explosive accusations |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 23, 2008 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These accusations sent shock waves through state government. Many of the more than 50 accused officials quit or fled. The progress against drug cartels in Mexico has been hindered by bribery, intimidation, and corruption; four months later the General was relieved of his command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/09/world/fg-general9 |title=Anti-drug general ousted |date=August 9, 2008 |first=Richard |last=Marosi |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2008, a major battle took place between members of the Tijuana and Sinaloa cartels in the city of [[Tijuana]], Baja California, that left 17 people dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2639514820080427 |title=Seventeen killed in Mexico drug battle |date=2008-04-26 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, President Calderón called in an additional 5,000 Mexican Army troops to [[Ciudad Juárez]]. The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] has also said that it is considering using state [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] troops to help the [[United States Border Patrol|U.S. Border Patrol]] counter the threat of drug violence in Mexico from spilling over the border into the US. The governors of [[Arizona]] and [[Texas]] have encouraged the federal government to use additional National Guard troops from their states to help those already there supporting state law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="BBC News – Americas – March-12-09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7941043.stm |title=US plans to combat Mexico drugs |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Drug Intelligence Center]], Mexican cartels are the predominant smugglers and wholesale distributors of South American cocaine and Mexico-produced [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[methamphetamine]] and [[heroin]]. Mexico's cartels have existed for some time, but have become increasingly powerful in recent years with the demise of the [[Medellín Cartel|Medellín]] and [[Cali Cartel|Cali]] cartels in Colombia. The Mexican cartels are expanding their control over the distribution of these drugs in areas controlled by Colombian and Dominican criminal groups, and it is now believed they control most of the illegal drugs coming into the U.S.&lt;ref name="rightside"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Webster |title=Mexican Drug Cartels Forming Alliances with American Street Gangs |date=June 15, 2008|url=http://www.rightsidenews.com/200806161201/homeland-security/mexican-drug-cartels-forming-alliances-with-american-street-gangs.html |work=The Right Side News |accessdate=2010-03-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731101537/http://www.rightsidenews.com/200806161201/homeland-security/mexican-drug-cartels-forming-alliances-with-american-street-gangs.html |archivedate=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer constrained to being mere intermediaries for Colombian producers, Mexican cartels are now powerful organized-crime syndicates that dominate the drug trade in the Americas.

Mexican cartels control large swaths of Mexican territory and dozens of municipalities, and they exercise increasing influence in Mexican electoral politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/10/10/25/1025starr_edit.html The United States is undermining its own security] Statesman.com, October 25, 2008 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartels are waging violent turf battles over control of key smuggling corridors from [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] to San Diego. Mexican cartels employ [[hitmen]] and groups of enforcers, known as ''sicarios''.

Casualty numbers have escalated significantly over time. According to a [[Stratfor]] report, the number of drug-related deaths in 2006 and 2007 (2,119 and 2,275) more than doubled to 5,207 in 2008. The number further increased substantially over the next two years, from 6,598 in 2009 to over 11,000 in 2010.

On 7 October 2012, the Mexican Navy responded to a civilian complaint reporting the presence of armed gunmen in [[Sabinas, Coahuila]]. Upon the navy's arrival, the gunmen threw grenades at the patrol from a moving vehicle, triggering a shootout that left Lazcano and another gunman dead and one marine slightly wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zetas boss Heriberto Lazcano's death confirmed |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/zetas-boss-heriberto-lazcano-death-confirmed |accessdate=9 October 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 October 2012 |location=Mexico City |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BISnP0Ut?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/09/zetas-boss-heriberto-lazcano-death-confirmed |archivedate=9 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was found to contain a grenade launcher, 12 grenades, possibly a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and two rifles, according to the navy.&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico says Zetas cartel boss killed |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/10/201210942716300668.html |accessdate=10 October 2012 |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=9 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BITdsZ2y?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/10/201210942716300668.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy managed to confirm his death through fingerprint verification and photographs of his corpse before handing the body to the local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grant |first=Will |title=Mexico: Body of Zetas drug cartel leader Lazcano stolen |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19880968 |accessdate=9 October 2012 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=9 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BISrnsw9?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19880968 |archivedate=10 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lazcano is the most powerful cartel leader to be killed since the start of Mexico's Drug War in 2006, according to [[Reuters]].&lt;ref name=reutersmost&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaynor |first=Tim |title=Mexico says kills top Zetas drug lord but body snatched |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/us-mexico-drugs-idUSBRE8980ZD20121009 |accessdate=9 October 2012 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=9 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BIY1gqPO?url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/us-mexico-drugs-idUSBRE8980ZD20121009 |archivedate=10 October 2012 |deadurl=no |location=Mexico City |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This death came just hours after the navy arrested a high-ranking Zeta member in [[Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]], Salvador Alfonso Martínez Escobedo.

The apparent death of Lazcano may benefit three parties: the Mexican Navy, who scored a significant blow to organized crime with the death of Lazcano; [[Miguel Treviño Morales]], who rose as the "uncontested" leader of Los Zetas; and [[Joaquín Guzmán Loera|Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán]], the leader of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] and the main rival of Los Zetas. ''El Chapo'' is perhaps the biggest winner of the three, since his primary goal is to take over the smuggling routes in [[Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]], the headquarters of Treviño Morales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kreider |first=Randy |title=Death of Zetas Leader Confirmed, But Body Now Missing |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/death-zetas-leader-confirmed-body-now-missing/story?id=17436386#.UHSYDvnwKFc |accessdate=9 October 2012 |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |date=9 October 2012 |author2=Schone, Mark |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010043715/http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/death-zetas-leader-confirmed-body-now-missing/story?id=17436386 |archivedate=10 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the body hadn't been stolen, it would also be a symbolic victory for [[Felipe Calderón]], who can say that his administration took down one of the founders and top leaders of Los Zetas and consequently boost the morale of the Mexican military.&lt;ref name=longmire12&gt;{{cite news |last=Longmire |first=Sylvia |title=Mexican Navy Believes It Killed Ruthless Gang Kingpin |url=http://borderviolenceanalysis.typepad.com/mexicos_drug_war/2012/10/mexican-navy-believes-it-killed-ruthless-gang-kingpin.html |accessdate=9 October 2012 |newspaper=Mexico's drug war |date=9 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BIYNsR1s?url=http://borderviolenceanalysis.typepad.com/mexicos_drug_war/2012/10/mexican-navy-believes-it-killed-ruthless-gang-kingpin.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts say that Lazcano's death does not signify the end of Los Zetas. As seen in other instances when top cartel leaders are taken out, fragmenting within the organizations occur, causing short-term violence. Los Zetas have a line of succession when leaders are arrested or killed, but the problem is that most of these replacements are younger, less-experienced members who are likely to resort to violence to maintain their reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Washington Valdez |first=Diana |title=Chapo" Guzmán emerges as the big winner after Zetas leader's death |url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_21732202/chapo-guzman-emerges-big-winner-after-zetass-leader?source=most_viewed |accessdate=10 October 2012 |newspaper=[[El Paso Times]] |date=10 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BIrThNue?url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_21732202/chapo-guzman-emerges-big-winner-after-zetass-leader?source=most_viewed |archivedate=10 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torres Félix, one of the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel was killed in a gunbattle with the Mexican Army in the community of Oso Viejo in [[Culiacán]], [[Sinaloa]] early in the morning on 13 October 2012.

President [[Felipe Calderón|Calderón]]'s government is currently fighting the traffickers, especially in his home state of Michoacán, but also including operations in the states of [[Jalisco]] and Guerrero, and in 2009 drug-related violence increased considerably in [[Sonora]].

By January 2007, these various operations had extended to the states of Guerrero as well as the so-called "[[Golden Triangle States]]" of Chihuahua, [[Durango]], and Sinaloa. In the following February the states of [[Nuevo León]] and [[Tamaulipas]] were included as well.

Seizures and arrests have jumped since Calderón took office in December 2006, and Mexico has extradited more than 100 people wanted in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

On July 10, 2008, the Mexican government announced plans to nearly double the size of its [[Federal Preventive Police|Federal Police]] force to reduce the role of the military in combating drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/10/AR2008071002800.html |title=Mexico Plan Adds Police To Take On Drug Cartels |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2008-07-11|accessdate=2011-03-28 |first=Manuel |last=Roig-Franzia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, known as the [[Comprehensive Strategy Against Drug Trafficking]], also involves purging local police forces of corrupt officers.

On July 16, 2008, the Mexican Navy intercepted a 10-meter long [[narco-submarine]] travelling about 200 kilometers off the southwest of [[Oaxaca]]; in a raid, [[Fuerzas Especiales|Special Forces]] rappelled from a helicopter onto the deck of the submarine and arrested four smugglers before they could [[scuttling|scuttle]] their vessel. The vessel was found to be loaded with 5.8 tons of cocaine and was towed to [[Huatulco]], Oaxaca, by a Mexican Navy patrol boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semar.gob.mx/sitio/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=813&amp;Itemid=288 |title=Secretaría de Marina – Noticias 18 de julio del 2008 |publisher=Semar.gob.mx |date=2010-07-27 |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716120154/http://www.semar.gob.mx/sitio/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=813&amp;Itemid=288 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=ccfedb0f-bd89-453c-bfe4-8f10b5c221c5 |title=Reuters -Mexico captures submarine loaded with drugs |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107155916/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=ccfedb0f-bd89-453c-bfe4-8f10b5c221c5 |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vivirlatino.com/2008/07/17/the-narco-submarine.php |title=The Narco Submarine |publisher=Vivirlatino.com |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2013-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302005501/http://vivirlatino.com/2008/07/17/the-narco-submarine.php |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7515056.stm |title=Mexican navy seizes cocaine sub |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080719/sub_drugs_080719/20080719?hub=SciTech |title=Drug cartels using submarines to smuggle cocaine |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2008-07-19 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One escalation in this conflict is the traffickers' use of new means to claim their territory and spread fear.

=== Government corruption ===
Mexican cartels advance their operations, in part, by corrupting or intimidating law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name="Aponte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ColleenCook" /&gt; Mexican municipal, state, and federal government officials, along with the police forces, often work together with the cartels in an organized network of corruption.&lt;ref name="Vulliamy 2010" /&gt; A ''Pax Mafioso'', is a specific example of corruption which guarantees a politician votes and a following in exchange for turning a 'blind eye' towards a particular cartel.&lt;ref name="Vulliamy 2010" /&gt;

The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) reports that although the central government of Mexico has made concerted efforts to reduce corruption in recent years, it remains a serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jacqui |last=Goddard |title=Interpol agent passed information to Beltrán-Leyva cartel in Mexico |date=October 28, 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5026787.ece |work=The Times |accessdate=2008-11-02 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marc |last=Lacey |title=In Mexico, Sorting Out Good Guys From Bad |date=November 1, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/world/americas/02mexico.html?ref=americas |work=New York Times |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some agents of the [[Federal Investigations Agency]] (AFI) are believed to work as enforcers for various cartels, and the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General]] (PGR) reported in December 2005 that nearly 1,500 of AFI's 7,000 agents were under investigation for suspected criminal activity and 457 were facing charges.&lt;ref name="ColleenCook" /&gt;
[[File:Esparragoza-Moreno.jpeg|thumb|150px|[[Juan José Esparragoza Moreno|El Azul]] is a Sinaloa Cartel drug lord. He is a former [[Dirección Federal de Seguridad]] (DFS) agent.]]

In recent years, the federal government conducted purges and prosecution of police forces in Nuevo Laredo, Michoacán, Baja California and Mexico City.&lt;ref name="ColleenCook" /&gt; The anti-cartel operations begun by President Calderón in December 2006 includes ballistic checks of police weapons in places where there is concern that police are also working for the cartels. In June 2007, President Calderón purged 284 federal police commanders from all 31 states and the Federal District.&lt;ref name="ColleenCook" /&gt;

Under the 'Cleanup Operation' performed in 2008, several agents and high-ranking officials have been arrested and charged with selling information or protection to drug cartels;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Guy |last=Lawson |title=The Making of a Narco State |date=March 4, 2009 |work=Rolling Stone |url=http://guylawson.com/pdf/rollingstone/NarcoState.pdf |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010180856/http://guylawson.com/pdf/rollingstone/NarcoState.pdf |archivedate=October 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://videos.eluniversal.com.mx/n_videos/showVideo.php?id=10261 Video-report on high-profile arrests.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129054138/http://videos.eluniversal.com.mx/n_videos/showVideo.php?id=10261 |date=2009-01-29 }} January 15, 2009.

In May 2010 an [[NPR]] report collected allegations from dozens of sources, including US and Mexican media, Mexican police officials, politicians, academics, and others, that Sinaloa Cartel had infiltrated and corrupted the Mexican federal government and the Mexican military by bribery and other means. According to a report by the U.S. Army Intelligence section in Leavenworth, over a 6-year period, of the 250,000 soldiers in the Mexican Army, 150,000 deserted and went into the drug industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uprisingradio.org/home/2010/04/26/murder-city-ciudad-juarez-and-the-global-economys-new-killing-fields/#sthash.1iJYKkcP.dpuf|title=Charles Bowden on the Mexican drug war|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 [[NPR]] report also stated that Sinaloa was colluding with the government to destroy other cartels and protect itself and its leader, 'Chapo'. Mexican officials denied any corruption in the government's treatment of drug cartels.&lt;ref name="burnett1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="burnett2" /&gt; Cartels had previously been reported as difficult to prosecute "because members of the cartels have infiltrated and corrupted the law enforcement organizations that are supposed to prosecute them, such as the Office of the Attorney General."&lt;ref name="Zamora Jimenez2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zamora Jimenez|first1=Arturo|year=2003 |title=Criminal justice and the law in Mexico |journal=Crime, Law and Social Change|volume=40|issue=1|pages=33–36|issn=09254994|doi=10.1023/A:1024981601093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on human rights ===
[[File:Detenciones Michoacán.jpg|thumb|right|Mexican soldiers detain cartel suspects in Michoacán, 2007]]
The drug control policies Mexico has adopted to prevent drug trafficking and to eliminate the power of the drug cartels have adversely affected the human rights situation in the country. These policies have given the responsibilities for civilian drug control to the military, which has the power to not only carry out anti-drug and public security operations but also enact policy. According to the [[United States Department of State]], the police and the military in Mexico were accused of committing serious human rights violations as they carried out government efforts to combat drug cartels.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, "Mexico," Country Reports on Human rights Practices-2002, 31 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups are especially vulnerable to human rights abuses collateral to drug law enforcement. Specifically in northern border states that have seen elevated levels of drug-related violence, human rights violations of injection drug users (IDUs) and sex workers by law enforcement personnel include physical and sexual violence, extortion, and targeting for accessing or possession of injection equipment or practicing sex work, although these activities are legal. &lt;ref name="BeletskyMartinez2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beletsky |first1=L |last2=Martinez |first2=G |last3=Gaines |first3=T |last4=Nguyen |first4=L |last5=Lozada |first5=R |last6=Rangel |first6=G |last7=Vera |first7=A |last8=McCauley |first8=HL |last9=Sorensen |first9=A |last10=Strathdee |first10=SA |title=Mexico's northern border conflict: collateral damage to health and human rights of vulnerable groups. |journal=Rev Panam Salud Publica |date=May 2012 |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=403–10 |doi=|pmid=22767041|pmc=3660986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PolliniLozada2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollini|first1=Robin A.|last2=Lozada|first2=Remedios|last3=Gallardo|first3=Manuel|last4=Rosen|first4=Perth|last5=Vera|first5=Alicia|last6=Macias|first6=Armando|last7=Palinkas|first7=Lawrence A.|last8=Strathdee|first8=Steffanie A.|title=Barriers to Pharmacy-Based Syringe Purchase Among Injection Drug Users in Tijuana, Mexico: A Mixed Methods Study|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=19 March 2010|volume=14|issue=3|year=2010|pages=679–687|issn=1090-7165|doi=10.1007/s10461-010-9674-3|pmid=20300820 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865643 |accessdate=3 August 2018|pmc=2865643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PolliniBrouwer2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollini|first1=Robin A.|last2=Brouwer|first2=Kimberly C.|last3=Lozada|first3=Remedios M.|last4=Ramos|first4=Rebeca|last5=Cruz|first5=Michelle F.|last6=Magis-Rodriguez|first6=Carlos|last7=Case|first7=Patricia|last8=Burris|first8=Scott|last9=Pu|first9=Minya|last10=Frost|first10=Simon D.

Immense power in the executive branch and corruption in the legislative and judiciary branches also contribute to the worsening of Mexico's human rights situation, leading to such problems as police forces violating basic human rights through torture and threats, the autonomy of the military and its consequences and the ineffectiveness of the judiciary in upholding and preserving basic human rights. Some of the forms of human rights violations in recent years presented by human rights organizations include illegal arrests, secret and prolonged detention, torture, rape, extrajudicial execution, and fabrication of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Larie Freeman, ''Troubling Patterns: The Mexican Military and the War on Drugs'' (Washington, D.C.: Latin America Working Group, September 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, Military Injustice: Mexico's Failure to Punish Army Abuses (New York: Human Rights Watch, December 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, "Peasants in Rural Mexico Claim Army Brutality," 17 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug policy fails to target high-level traffickers. In the 1970s, as part of the international [[Operation Condor]], the Mexican government deployed 10,000 soldiers and police to a poverty-stricken region in northern Mexico plagued by drug production and leftist insurgency. Hundreds of peasants were arrested, tortured, and jailed, but no major drug traffickers were captured.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Astorga, Drug Trafficking in Mexico: A First General Assessment, Management of Social Transformations (MOST) Discussion Paper 36 (Paris:UNESCO,1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of internal federal agencies that are often unregulated and unaccountable also contributes to the occurrence of human rights violations.{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} The [[Federal Investigations Agency]] (Agencia Federal de Investigación-AFI) of Mexico had been involved with numerous human rights violation cases involving torture and corruption. In one case, detainee Guillermo Velez Mendoza died while in the custody of AFI agents. The AFI agent implicated in his death was arrested but he escaped after being released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Mexico, Recomendación 12/2002 a la Procuraduria General de la Republica sobre el caso del homicidio del señor Guillermo Velez Mendoza (Mexico City: National Human Rights Commission, 14 May 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Javier Sicilia 12.jpg|thumb|[[2011 Mexican protests]] against cartel violence and government [[Political corruption|disregard]]]]
Similarly, nearly all AFI agents evaded punishment and arrest due to the corrupt executive and judiciary system and the supremacy of these agencies.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Attorney General's Office reported in December 2005 that one-fifth of its officers were under investigation for criminal activity, and that nearly 1,500 of AFI's 7,000 agents were under investigation for suspected criminal activity and 457 were facing charges.&lt;ref name="ColleenCook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Crime-torn Mexican 'FBI' Investigates 1,500 Agents," Reuters, December 4, 2005; Tim Gaynor and Monica Medel, "Drug Gangs Corrupt Mexico's Elite 'FBI,'" Reuters, December 6, 2005; and, Laurie Freeman, State of Siege: Drug-Related Violence and Corruption in Mexico, Washington Office on Latin America, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The AFI was finally declared a failure and was disbanded in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/168545.html |title=Surge la Policía Federal Ministerial (May 30, 2009) |publisher=Eluniversal.com.mx |date=2009-05-30 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic prejudices have also emerged in the drug war, and poor and helpless indigenous communities have been targeted by the police, military, drug traffickers and the justice system. According to the [[National Human Rights Commission (Mexico)]] (Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos-CNDH), nearly one-third of the indigenous prisoners in Mexico in 2001 were in prison for federal crimes, which are mostly drug-related.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Mexico, Estadisticas judiciales en Materia Penal, Cuaderno No. 10 (Mexico City: Instituto nacional de Estadistica, Geografia, e Informatica, 2003), Chart 2.6.2, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major concern is the lack of implementation of the [[Leahy Law]] in U.S. and the consequences of that in worsening the human rights situation in Mexico. Under this U.S. law, no member or unit of a foreign security force that is credibly alleged to have committed a human rights violation may receive U.S. security training. It is alleged{{by whom|date=January 2012}} that the U.S., by training the military and police force in Mexico, is in violation of the Leahy Law. In this case, the U.S. embassy officials in Mexico in charge of human rights and drug control programs are blamed with aiding and abetting these violations. In December 1997, a group of heavily armed Mexican special forces soldiers kidnapped twenty young men in Ocotlan, Jalisco, brutally torturing them and killing one. Six of the implicated officers had received U.S. training as part of the [[Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales]] (GAFE) training program.&lt;ref&gt;''La Jornada'', "Admite el Pentagono que Adiestro a 6 Militares Mexicanos Violadores de Derechos Humanos," 28 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of "spillover" along the US-bound drug trafficking routes and more stringent border enforcement, Mexico's northern border states have seen increased levels of drug consumption and abuse, including elevated rates of drug injection 10 to 15 times the national average.&lt;ref name="BeletskyMartinez2012" /&gt;

=== Murders of politicians ===
{{Main|List of politicians killed in the Mexican Drug War}}
Since the start of the Mexican Drug War in 2006, the drug trafficking organizations have slaughtered their rivals, killed policemen, and now increasingly targeted politicians – especially local leaders.&lt;ref name=mayorstarget&gt;{{cite news|last=Beaubien|first=Jason|title=Mayors Are New Targets In Mexico's Deadly Drug War |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130491241|accessdate=16 June 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the places where these politicians have been killed are areas plagued by drug-related violence.&lt;ref name=mayorstarget /&gt; Part of the strategy used by the criminal groups behind the killings of local figures is the weakening of the [[local governments]].&lt;ref name=mayorstarget /&gt; For example, [[María Santos Gorrostieta Salazar]], the former mayor of a town in western Mexico, who had survived three earlier assassination attempts and the murder of her husband, was abducted and beaten to death in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKittrick|first=David|title=Doctor Maria Santos Gorrostieta: Politician murdered for her fight against drug cartels|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/doctor-maria-santos-gorrostieta-politician-murdered-for-her-fight-against-drug-cartels-8360441.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=28 November 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CX2afE7x?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/doctor-maria-santos-gorrostieta-politician-murdered-for-her-fight-against-drug-cartels-8360441.html|archivedate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme violence puts politicians at the mercy of the mafias, thus allowing the cartels to take control of the fundamental government structures and expand their criminal agendas.&lt;ref name=mayorstarget /&gt;

In addition, because mayors usually appoint local [[Chief of police|police chiefs]], they are seen by the cartels as key assets in their criminal activities to control the police forces in their areas of influence.&lt;ref name=local&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsey |first=Geoffrey |title=3rd Mexican Mayor Killed in 2 Weeks as Cartels Increasingly Target Politicians |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/component/k2/item/432-third-mexican-mayor-killed-in-two-weeks-as-cartels-increasingly-target-politicians |accessdate=16 June 2012 |newspaper=InSight Crime |date=14 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118075429/http://insightcrime.org/component/k2/item/432-third-mexican-mayor-killed-in-two-weeks-as-cartels-increasingly-target-politicians |archivedate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartels also seek to control the local governments to win government contracts and concessions; these "public works" help them ingrain themselves in the community and gain the loyalty and respect of the communities in which they operate.&lt;ref name=local /&gt; Politicians are usually targeted for three reasons: (1) Political figures who are honest pose a direct threat to organized crime, and are consequently killed by the cartels; (2) Politicians make arrangements to protect a certain cartel and are killed by a rival cartel; and (3) a cartel simply kills politicians to heat up the turf of the rival cartel that operates in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Killing Escalates Mexico Drug War|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703964104575334942693439322|accessdate=16 June 2012 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=29 June 2010|first1=David|last1=Luhnow|first2=Nicholas|last2=Casey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Massacres and exploitation of migrants ===
{{See also|2010 San Fernando massacre|2011 San Fernando massacre|Allende, Coahuila}}
The cartels engage in kidnapping, ransom, murder, robbery, and extortion of migrants traveling from Central America through Mexico on their way to ''El Norte'' (the United States and Canada). Sometimes the cartels force the migrants to join their organization and work for them. [[Mass grave]]s have been also discovered in Mexico containing bodies of migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tracy |last=Wilkinson |title=Body count from mass graves in Mexico rises to 145 |date=April 15, 2011 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/15/world/la-fg-mexico-bodies-20110416 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 177 bodies were discovered in a mass grave in Tamaulipas, the same area where the bodies of 72 migrants were discovered in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/02/world/americas/mexico-drug-war-fast-facts/|title=Mexico Drug War Fast Facts |date=2 September 2013|publisher=CNN|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case in San Fernando, Mexico, most of the dead had "died of blunt force trauma to the head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Miroff |author2=William Booth |title=Mass graves in Mexico reveal new levels of savagery |date=24 April 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/mass-graves-in-mexico-reveal-new-levels-of-savagery/2011/04/23/AFPoasbE_story.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cartels have also infiltrated the Mexican government's immigration agencies, and attacked and threatened immigration officers.&lt;ref name=pressly&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0132p7v/Crossing_Continents_Murder_migration_and_Mexico/ Crossing Continents: Murder, migration and Mexico], Linda Pressly BBC, August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The National Human Rights Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos, CNDH) said that 11,000 migrants had been kidnapped in 6 months in 2010 by drug cartels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12549484 More than 11,000 migrants abducted in Mexico], BBC, 23 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human trafficking ===
{{See also|Human trafficking in Mexico}}
There are documented links between the drug cartels and [[human trafficking]] for forced labor, forced prostitution, and rape. A wife of a narco described a system in which young girls became prostitutes and then were forced to work in drug factories.&lt;ref name="lcacho"&gt;{{cite news|last=Saner |first=Emine |title=Mexican journalist Lydia Cacho: 'I don't scare easily' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/01/lydia-cacho-mexican-journalist-interview?newsfeed=true |accessdate=12 September 2012 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=31 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911113526/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/01/lydia-cacho-mexican-journalist-interview?newsfeed=true |archivedate=11 September 2012 |deadurl=no |location=London |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 2011, [[Los Zetas]] reportedly began to move into the prostitution business (including the prostitution of children) after previously being only 'suppliers' of women to already existing networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connor |first=Anne-Marie |title=Mexican cartels move into human trafficking |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/mexican-cartels-move-into-human-trafficking/2011/07/22/gIQArmPVcI_story.html |accessdate=12 September 2012 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=27 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ac7c6WNy?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/mexican-cartels-move-into-human-trafficking/2011/07/22/gIQArmPVcI_story.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. State Department says that the practice of [[forced labor]] in Mexico is larger in extent than [[forced prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2010 |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=12 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ac7lGeoL?url=http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142760.htm |archivedate=12 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican journalists like [[Lydia Cacho]] have been threatened, beaten, raped, and forced into exile for reporting on these facts.&lt;ref name=lcacho /&gt;

== Effects internationally ==

=== Europe ===
Improved cooperation of Mexico with the U.S. led to the recent arrests of 755 Sinaloa cartel suspects in U.S. cities and towns, but the U.S. market is being eclipsed by booming demand for cocaine in Europe, where users now pay twice the going U.S. rate.&lt;ref name=progress /&gt; U.S. Attorney General announced September 17, 2008 that an international drug interdiction operation, Project Reckoning, involving law enforcement in the United States, Italy, Canada, Mexico and [[Guatemala]] had netted more than 500 organized crime members involved in the cocaine trade. The announcement highlighted the Italian-Mexican cocaine connection.&lt;ref name="Stratfor Intelligence" /&gt;

In December 2011 the government of Spain remarked that Mexican cartels have multiplied their operations in that country, becoming the main entry point of cocaine into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ana |last=Anabitarte |title=Crece en España mafia mexicana |date=30 December 2010 |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/36105.html |work=El Universal |accessdate=2010-12-30 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 it was reported that Mexican drug cartels had joined forces with the [[Sicilian Mafia]], when Italian officials unearthed information that [[Palermo]]’s black market, along with other Italian ports, was being used by Mexico's drug cartels as a conduit to bring drugs to the European market, in which they had been trafficking drugs, particularly cocaine, throughout the Atlantic Ocean for over 10 years to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/06/21/mexico-drug-cartels-supply-italian-mafia-with-cocaine-for-europe/|title=Mexican Drug Cartels Join Forces with Italian Mafia to Supply Cocaine to Europe|publisher=Fox News Latino|date=June 21, 2012|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guatemala ===
The Mexican Army crackdown has driven some cartels to seek a safer location for their operations across the border in [[Guatemala]], attracted by corruption, weak policing and its position on the overland smuggling route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUKN18280587 |title=Mexican drug gang menace spreads in Guatemala |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=2009-02-18|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miglierini&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Miglierini |title=Guatemala police chief arrested over 'cocaine link' |date=2 March 2010 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8546590.stm |accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smugglers pick up drugs from small planes that land at private airstrips hidden in the Guatemalan jungle.

Calderón proposes a ban on cash purchases of real estate and of certain luxury goods that cost more than 100,000 pesos (about US$8,104.) His package would also require more businesses to report large transactions, such as real estate, jewelry and purchases of [[armor plating]].&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; In June 2010, Calderón "announced strict limits on the amount in U.S. dollars that can be deposited or exchanged in banks",&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; but the proposed restrictions to financial institutions are facing tough opposition in the Mexican legislature.&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt;

=== Drug demand ===
[[RAND]] studies released in the mid-1990s found that using drug user treatment to reduce drug consumption in the United States is seven times more cost effective than law enforcement efforts alone, and it could potentially cut consumption by a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Miller |title=A Regional Strategy for Drug Wars in the Americas |date=April 7, 2009 |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/ideas/2009/04/040709.html |publisher=Center for American Progress |accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In FY2011, the Obama Administration requests approximately $5.6 billion to support demand reduction. This includes a 13% increase for prevention and almost a 4% increase for treatment. The overall FY 2011 counter-drug request for supply reduction and domestic law enforcement is $15.5 billion with $521.1 million in new funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2009/04/03/5987/a-regional-strategy-for-drug-wars-in-the-americas/ |title=A Regional Strategy for Drug Wars in the Americas |accessdate=2014-12-14 |date=March 2010 |publisher=Center for American Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nag Nag Nag''' was an influential [[London]] club night at [[Simon Hobart]]'s Ghetto nightclub. Founded by DJ, promoter and musician [[Jonny Slut]] in 2002, it ran for six years. The night is commonly associated with the ambisexual post-[[electroclash]] scene.

==History==
[[The Independent]] described the night as a "legendary electro midweeker" famous for its blend of subcultures and musical styles.[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/vitalic-nag-nag-nag-london-521084.html] It was held every Wednesday night from 2002 to 2008. In 2003, [[The Independent]] wrote that "it's the sort of place where students mix with celebs, where you wait your turn behind [[Kate Moss]] for the make-up mirror, and where the presence of [[Boy George]], checking out Pink Grease last week, didn't even merit a double take."[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/the-twin-electrolush-electric-ballroom-londonbrsquarepusher-hms-president-london-589699.html]

Popular among London's celebrities, stars such as Kate Moss, [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Björk]], [[Keith Flint]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Zoë Ball]] and regular Boy George were documented partying there [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-94544534.html], and acts such as [[Ellen Allien]], [[Vitalic]], [[Miss Kittin]] and [[My Toys Like Me]] performed.&lt;ref name="metro.co.uk"&gt;http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/article.html?in_article_id=201965&amp;in_page_id=253 Metro&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonny Slut told ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2005 that "one reason I started the night was that music was becoming more interesting again. It might not entertain 4,000 people at Ministry of Sound, but it certainly entertains my crowd. Anyone who thinks club culture is dead should come and see my queue on Wednesday nights." &lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article507220.ece Times Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's name is derived from the song "Nag Nag Nag" by 1970s industrial band [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]].&lt;ref name="Kellman" /&gt; The track is included on a double CD compilation of music that was played at the club, compiled by Jonny Slut, released in 2003.&lt;ref name="Kellman"&gt;Kellman, Andy "[http://www.allmusic.com/album/nag-nag-nag-compiled-by-jonny-slut-mw0000696490 ''Nag Nag Nag: Compiled by Jonny Slut'' Review]", [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved 22 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Nag Nag Nag closed in May 2008.&lt;ref name="metro.co.uk"/&gt;

==NagNagNag Records and Atomizer==
Jonny Slut and another of the club's DJs, Fil OK, released music on their own label called NagNagNag under the name Atomizer. Their debut single was co-produced by [[The KLF]]'s [[Jimmy Cauty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4421">In [[ancient Rome]], the '''Parentalia''' ({{IPA-la|pa.renˈtaː.li.a}}) or '''''dies parentales''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈdi.eːs pa.renˈtaː.les}}, "ancestral days") was a nine-day [[Roman festival|festival]] held in honor of family ancestors, beginning on 13 February.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 50; Stefan Weinstock, ''Divus Julius'' (Oxford, 1971), pp. 291-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Parentalia was a holiday on the [[Roman calendar|Roman religious calendar]], its observances were mainly domestic and familial.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the family to the Roman state, however, was expressed by public ceremonies on the opening day, the [[Roman_calendar#Months|Ides]] of February, when a [[Vestal Virgin|Vestal]] conducted a rite for the collective ''di parentes'' of Rome at the tomb of [[Tarpeia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 306 (1899 [[Internet Archive]] [https://archive.org/stream/romanfestivalsof00fowluoft edition available].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Ovid]] describes sacred offerings (''sacrificia'') of flower-garlands, wheat, salt, wine-soaked bread and violets to the "shades of the dead" (''[[Manes]]'' or ''Di manes'') at family tombs, which were located outside Rome's sacred boundary ''([[pomerium]])''. These observances were meant to strengthen the mutual obligations and protective ties between the living and the dead, and were a lawful duty of the ''[[paterfamilias]]'' (head of the family).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'', 2.537-539. Ibid 2.534 for ''manes''; [[William Warde Fowler|W. Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman festivals of the period of the Republic'', p. 306, cites [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]]' ''di manes'' as a placatory euphemism: some Manes were to be feared.&lt;/ref&gt; Parentalia concluded on 21 February in the midnight rites of [[Feralia]], when the ''paterfamilias'' addressed the malevolent, destructive aspects of his Manes.

Feralia was a placation and exorcism: Ovid thought it a more rustic, primitive and ancient affair than the Parentalia itself. It appears to have functioned as a cleansing ritual for [[Caristia]] on the following day, when the family held an informal banquet to celebrate the amity between themselves and their benevolent ancestral dead (''[[Lares]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'', 2.677. Fowler, ''Roman Festivals,'' p. 309, has ritualistically clothed statues of the ''[[Lares]]'' at this "sacred meal."&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on collective cult for the Manes and early ''di parentes'' implies their afterlife as vague and lacking individuation. In later cult they are vested with personal qualities, and in [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], they acquire divine ''[[numen]]'' and become ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divi]]'', divine entities.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, ''The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire'', vol 1, 1991, 1, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  

From Parentalia to Caristia all temples were closed, marriages were forbidden, and "magistrates appeared without their insignia," an indication that no official business was conducted. [[William Warde Fowler]] describes the Parentalia as "practically a yearly renewal of the rite of burial".&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals might also commemorated on their birthday ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]])''. Some would be commemorated throughout the year on marked days of the month, such as the [[Kalends]], [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] or [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]], when lamps might be lit at the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;J.M.C. Toynbee, ''Death and Burial in the Roman World'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971, 1996), pp.61–64.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]] on 9, 11 and 13 May was aimed at appeasing "kinless and hungry" spirits of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, "Death and Burial in the Roman World,'' p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:05--Pong-Su1.jpg|thumb|The ''Pong Su'' hit by a 2,000lb [[laser-guided bomb]] dropped from a [[General Dynamics F-111C]].]] 
The '''''Pong Su'' incident''' began on 16 April 2003 when [[heroin]] was smuggled from the ''Pong Su'', a [[North Korea]]n cargo ship, onto an [[Australia]]n beach. Australian [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|military]] [[Tactical assault group|special forces]] subsequently boarded the ''Pong Su'' in Australian [[territorial waters]] four days later. The ship was suspected of being involved in smuggling almost {{convert|125|kg|lb}} of heroin into Australia with an estimated street value of [[Australian dollar|A$]]160&amp;nbsp;million.

The ''Pong Su'' (봉수호) &lt;!-- this text "「鋒秀」號 " was cut and brought here from a lower section of the article.  Is this the ship's name?  --&gt;was a 349-foot (106 m), 3,743-tonne North Korean-owned ocean freighter registered in [[Tuvalu]], a [[flag of convenience]]. Three men arrested on shore were convicted of importing heroin; a fourth man from the ship who landed the heroin and was arrested on shore pleaded guilty; the crew were all acquitted and deported; and after being confiscated the ship was destroyed in 2006.

==History==

===Heroin trafficking===
''Operation Sorbet'' was an Australian police international trafficking operation that had been conducting surveillance on two persons who had entered Australia in March 2003 from China and a third person on 9 April from China on tourist visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Struck|first1=Doug|title=Heroin Trail Leads to North Korea|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/05/12/heroin-trail-leads-to-north-korea/017fa657-ce96-4eae-b44e-16f9376816ff |accessdate=18 January 2017|work=Washington Post|date=12 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of the 15 April 2003, [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP) conducted surveillance on two persons who rendezvoused with the ''Pong Su'' close to shore at Boggaley Creek near the seaside town of [[Wye River, Victoria|Wye River]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and followed them to a nearby hotel. The next morning, the two suspects were apprehended with two packages containing {{convert|50|kg|lbs}} of pure heroin after leaving the hotel. A third suspect was also arrested later that day in nearby [[Geelong]].

The following day, in a search of the beach at Boggaley Creek, police discovered the body of a man of East Asian appearance covered by seaweed close to a [[dinghy]] who had been part of a two man landing party from the ''Pong Su''. The deceased man has never been identified. The dinghy had suffered fuel problems in the surf and had capsized landing the heroin and drowning one of the crew. [[Victoria Police]] apprehended the second man from the landing party in the immediate area the same day. He had been unable to get back to his boat and simply remained in the area where the drugs came ashore the night before. The AFP stated that they had been working on Operation Sorbet for several months including with international peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Record heroin haul found|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172700855.html|accessdate=18 January 2017|work=The Age| date=17 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further {{convert|75|kg|lbs}} of heroin in three packages was later discovered buried near Wye River in May 2003 after subsequent searches following coordinates from a seized GPS device. An additional, {{convert|25|kg|lbs}} package of heroin had been lost during the landing.

===Interception===
On the morning of the 17 April, a [[Tasmania Police]] patrol vessel directed the ''Pong Su'' to head for [[Melbourne]] after it had travelled east entering the [[Bass Strait]]. In the afternoon, the ''Pong Su'' advised that it would head for [[Sydney]] and was directed to head for [[Eden, New South Wales|Eden]]. [[New South Wales Police Force|New South Wales Police]] patrol vessels became involved. In the morning of the 18 April, the ''Pong Su'' changed direction to the east away from Australia towards [[international waters]] at speed with a police vessel having to terminate the pursuit due to rough weather. in the evening, Navy warship [[HMAS Stuart (FFH 153)|HMAS ''Stuart'']] began tracking the ''Pong Su''. In the morning of the 20 April, after a four-day chase, ''Stuart'' intercepted the ''Pong Su'' {{convert|35|nmi|km mi}} south east of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] with the ''Pong Su'' complying with most directions. [[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Army Special Operations]] [[Tactical Assault Group]] (TAG) operators boarded by simultaneously [[Fast-roping|fast roping]] onto the deck from a [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|Seahawk]] helicopter and from climbing the side onto the deck from three [[rigid hull inflatable boat]]s (RHIBs) with the crew compliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Horse Trader Seized - Drug smuggler gripped by Terror|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_News-May-8-2003.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2017|work=Navy News - the official newspaper of the Royal Australian Navy|issue=46 (7)|date=8 May 2003|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Logue| first=Jason |url= http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1073/topstories/story01.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707181134/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1073/topstories/story01.htm|title=Tartan TAG|newspaper=Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper|edition=1073|date=8 May 2003 |publisher =Department of Defence|location=Canberra|archivedate=7 July 2013|accessdate=25 September 2015|issn=0729-5685}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech| title= Joint Media Conference - Navy, Customs, AFP, NSW Police - Seizure of a ship allegedly at the centre of Victoria's biggest heroin bust (Transcript)|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=2644|website=Department of Defence|ref=MECC 30420/03| archiveurl= http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/20150625102819/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=2644|archivedate=25 June 2015| date=21 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pong Su'' was secured and brought into port in [[Sydney]]. Searches of the ship by Australian authorities revealed it had been modified for long voyages and was carrying enough fuel and provisions to travel around the world without needing to enter a port.

Some 30 men were arrested and detained. It was alleged that the North Korean government was involved in the manufacture and trade of the drugs. The North Korean government stated the ship was a "civilian trading ship" and the ship's owner had no knowledge of the [[illegal drugs trade|illegal cargo]].

===Drug charges===
The three men arrested on shore pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin. They were sentenced to between 22 and 24 years imprisonment. They were apparently not of North Korean origin (but from Malaysia and Singapore) and not part of the ship's crew.&lt;ref name="R v Teng"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|33|2005|litigants=R v Kiam Fah Teng |date=21 February 2005 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R v Lam"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|98|2005|litigants=R v Yau Kim Lam |date=15 June 2005 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R v Tan"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|177|2005|litigants=R v Wee Quay Tan |date=8 May 2006 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth man from the landing party, who was a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of heroin.&lt;ref name="R v Wong"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|126|2006|litigants=R v Ta Song Wong |date=6 April 2006 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain and crew of the ''Pong Su'' were charged with [[narcotics]] trafficking. Most significantly, an official of the governing [[Korean Workers' Party]] was found on board, linking the drug shipment to [[Kim Jong-il]]'s government. According to Australian media reports, he had served as senior [[envoy (title)|envoy]] in North Korea's embassy in China. The [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Australian Foreign Minister]] [[Alexander Downer]] called in the North Korean Ambassador to lodge a formal protest.

Drug charges were laid against the ship's entire crew. 27 crew members were discharged on 5 March 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a magistrate on the basis that there was insufficient evidence for them to stand trial. While awaiting deportation, the crew were held in [[Baxter Detention Centre]]; during which time they were questioned by federal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Four senior crew members were kept in Australia to face a jury trial:
* Choe Dong-song (최동성), 61, the ship's political secretary
* Song Man-seon (송만선), 65, the ship's captain
* Lee Man-jin (이만진), 51, the first officer
* Lee Ju-cheon (이주천), 51, the chief engineer
All four crew members pleaded not guilty at the beginning of their trial in August 2005.

The prosecution case against the four North Korean officers was that they would not have allowed their ship to be stopped in the position it was if they were not aware that the real purpose of their voyage was to smuggle the heroin. The prosecution did not allege any official involvement of the North Korean government, only the officers on board the ship.

On 2 March 2004, the [[United States Department of State]] released a report using the incident to link Kim Jong-il's government to drugs trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3524857.stm |work=BBC News |title=N Korea 'trafficking drugs' |date=2 March 2004 |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=15 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquittal===
On 5 March 2006, a [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] jury found the ship's four officers not guilty on all charges. They were subsequently deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drug ship officers set free |date=6 March 2006 |publisher=News.com.au |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18360926-421,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215105940/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18360926-421,00.html |archivedate=15 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate of the ''Pong Su''===
After capture the ship was brought to [[Sydney Harbour]] where it was originally moored at [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island naval base]]. From there it was taken to Snails Bay and moored for over two years, where it was reportedly costing over $2,500 a day for maintenance and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/07/1099781247876.html |title=That pong in the bay is from a ship under a cloud |first=Ben |last=Hills |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=7 November 2004 |accessdate=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was taken to Chowder Bay in early 2006 while authorities decided what to do with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/private-sydney/2006/02/03/1138958908974.html |title=Stink ahoy over Pong Su |work =The Sydney Morning Herald |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities eventually decided to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship. On 23 March 2006, in a joint [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and [[Royal Australian Navy]] military exercise, the ''Pong Su'' was sunk by two [[GBU-10 Paveway II]] [[laser-guided bomb]]s dropped from RAAF [[General Dynamics F-111C]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=AAP |title=Korean freighter ''Pong Su'' to be scuttled |date=21 March 2006 |accessdate=16 April 2007 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Korean-freighter-Pong-Su-to-be-scuttled/2006/03/21/1142703349975.html |work =The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Drug freighter meets spectacular end |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=23 March 2006 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/drug-freighter-meets-spectacular-end/2006/03/23/1143083893144.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberate destruction of the freighter was said to deliver a strong message to international drug smuggling rings that the [[Australian Federal Police]] and [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] would take all measures necessary to stop illegal drug importation.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Before the ship was scuttled, its radio was removed and donated to a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/tv/collectors/segments/s2546161.htm |title=Collectors: Radio Museum (17/04/2009) |work=Collectors |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=27 May 2009 |format=Video |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429104228/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/collectors/segments/s2546161.htm |archivedate=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prismatic World Tour''' was the third [[concert tour]] by American singer-songwriter [[Katy Perry]], in support of her fourth studio album, ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013). The tour began on May 7, 2014, in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] at the [[Odyssey Arena]], concluding on October 18, 2015, in [[Alajuela]], [[Costa Rica]] at [[Parque Viva]] after six legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qcostarica.com/katy-perry-in-costa-rica/|title=Katy Perry In Costa Rica|work=QCostaRica|date=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prismatic World Tour grossed more than $204.3 million from 149 shows with a total attendance of 1,984,503 between 2014 and 2015 and it is Perry's most successful tour to date.&lt;ref name="Pollstar Top 100 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pollstar Year End Top 100 Worldwide Tours|url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/charts2014/2014YearEndTop100WorldwideTours.pdf|publisher=Pollstar|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pollstar Top 100 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/charts2015/2015YearEndTop100WorldwideTours.pdf |title=Pollstar Top 100 Worldwide Tours 2015 |publisher=[[Pollstar]] |accessdate=January 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry first teased the tour during her "We Can Survive" event at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] on October 23, 2013, where she encouraged fans to see her on her 2014 tour, stating that it would be "magical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5770379/katy-perry-hosts-famous-friends-previews-next-tour-at-hollywood|title=Katy Perry Hosts Famous Friends, Previews Next Tour at Hollywood Bowl: Live Review|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 24, 2013|first=Justino|last=Aguila}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that "The tour is going to be fantastic. I always try to take it to the next level. I think people will realize what the tour is going to be like when they listen to the music." She also emphasized that she would be "very close" to the audience during the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/11/05/katy-perry-2014-roar-tour-video-exclusive/|title=Katy Perry says her 2014 tour for 'Roar' will be 'less cartoony'&amp;nbsp;— EXCLUSIVE VIDEO|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 5, 2013|first=Kyle|last=Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2013 MTV Europe Music Awards]], Perry said the show would be "less cartoony" than the [[California Dreams Tour]] and would be a "feast for your eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717195/katy-perry-tour-ema.jhtml|title=Katy Perry's Tour Will Be A 'Feast For Your Eyes'.....

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I'm going to bring all the bells and whistles like it was last time but it won't be so highly narrated. I just want a little bit more room to express myself... I'm just really excited. I just did a big tour meeting yesterday and saw the graphic drawing of the stage and it's unlike anything I've seen for any other artist and it's unlike anything I've ever done. It's different, it's fresh, it's clean and it's actually in the middle of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/katy-perry/news/prismatic-tour-expectations-teaser/|title=Katy Perry Promises 'Prismatic' Tour Will Be 'Unlike Anything" She's Ever Done&amp;nbsp;— Audio|work=Capital FM|date=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the Asian Leg of the tour, Perry adorned several new costumes. For the "Prismatic" Act, she wore a metallic, purple cat inspired leotard. The outfit contained metallic, purple thigh high hell boots, a leotard complete with a cat face, with glowing eyes, and little multi-color triangles around the leotard that lit up, similar to her previous outfit. For the "Acoustic" set, Perry now wears a sparkly green dress, that has sunflowers over the breasts, and on other parts of the dress. The wig she adorns is also more vibrant in color, and less pastel. For her shows in China, during the "Throwback" and "Hyper Neon" act, Perry wore a pastel splatter paint inspired mini dress, which was a dress to look as if it had been splattered with paint. After her shows and China, Perry debuted (on tour) a new outfit to replace the splatter paint dress during the same act. This outfit consisted of a leather pink striped crop top bra, which had yellow shoulder pads sticking off of it. She wore leather pink striped cufflets and a pink, yellow and orange striped mini dress, created to look as if it was over lapping on itself – she wore this outfit when performing at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend.

==Concert synopsis==
{{double image|left|PWT Prudential Center 4.jpg|200|PWT Prudential Center 14.jpg|200|During the performance of "[[Part of Me (Katy Perry song)|Part of Me]]", Perry was dressed in a mirrored-leather skirt with matching crop top with neon-clad dancers dressed in a similar way ''(Left)''. while in the performance of "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]", Perry rose from the stage emerging on a golden horse carried below by her dancers ''(Right)''.}}
The show begins with neon-clad dancers emerging on stage. An area of the stage moves to form a pyramid, from which Perry emerges to perform "[[Roar (song)|Roar]]", wearing a mirrored leather skirt and crop top with neon lights woven into the seams. Towards the end of the song, she and the dancers [[Skipping rope|skip]] using light-up ropes while the entire arena goes dark. "[[Part of Me (Katy Perry song)|Part of Me]]" is the next track to be performed, where she and her dancers sprint down a 15 meter long treadmill. Following Part of Me, a [[dubstep]] version of "[[Wide Awake (Katy Perry song)|Wide Awake]]", during which a triangular section of the stage rises and rotates in the air. She then performs "This Moment", which features multi colored lasers projected across the stage. This Moment shortly transforms into "Love Me" afterwards, followed by Perry exiting the stage.. After a video interlude displaying Perry's face created out of stars and planets in space, she appears on stage atop a mechanical horse. During this section of the tour, she wears an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]-themed outfit, completed with a hand-embroidered leotard, a hand-embellished collar and an ornate purple and gold skirt. Perry performs "[[Dark Horse (Katy Perry song)|Dark Horse]]", before moving on to "[[E.T. (song)|E.T.]]". A large diamond-shaped structure descends from the ceiling to lift the singer in the air. "Legendary Lovers" is then performed, followed by "[[I Kissed a Girl]]", which features dancers dressed as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubenesque]] [[mummy|mummies]] with large breasts and buttocks. They follow Perry around the stage and after she exits, the mummies proceed with their own dance while guitarists are lifted into the air, with sparks shooting from their guitars.

A video interlude shows a cat being transported from the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] to "Kittywood". Perry emerges on top of a large ball of wool wearing a catsuit, accompanied by her dancers wearing similar cat costumes. A [[jazz]] version of "[[Hot n Cold]]" is then performed, before Perry begins to perform "International Smile"; the song is intermingled with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]". The dancers enact a short scene in which the cats chase a mouse. Perry re-enters, wearing a butterfly-themed dress and cape and performs multiple songs [[Acoustic music|acoustically]], including "[[By the Grace of God (song)|By the Grace of God]]", a [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] of "[[The One That Got Away (Katy Perry song)|The One That Got Away]]" and "[[Thinking of You (Katy Perry song)|Thinking of You]]", and "[[Unconditionally]]".

At the beginning of this section, there is a "Megamix Dance Party", performed by the dancers and backing singers, which is a mix of a selection of songs. Perry arrives on stage wearing a top, skirt, and leggings featuring [[smiley|smiling faces]] and [[peace symbols]]. She performs "[[Walking on Air (Katy Perry song)|Walking on Air]]", where she is lifted above the stage and flies from on end to the other. Following this, she changes into a [[yin and yang|yin-yang]] dress to sing "It Takes Two". While performing the song, she is lifted off the ground while the bottom half of her dress is inflated and covers the lift, to give the apprentice of her being very tall. To close this section of the tour, a mash-up of "This Is How We Do" and "[[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]]" is performed as Perry and her dancers ride an inflatable car on stage. A video interlude is played, which shows Perry as a mental patient in a triangular [[padded cell]], before paint splashes from all areas of the room. She appears on stage wearing a bra and skirt decorated with palm leaves to perform "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]". "[[California Gurls]]" is then performed with blackout lights and dancers move letters that eventually recreate the [[Hollywood Sign]]. Perry exits the stage before re-emerging to sing "[[Birthday (Katy Perry song)|Birthday]]", wearing a one-piece outfit named the "Birthday Suit", decorated with balloons over her breasts, and other birthday themed items. During the performance, Perry brings a member of the audience whose birthday is near the show's date on stage, and they sit on a throne on top of a rotating birthday cake, which emerges from the stage. She soon is trapped into a seat with multiple balloons attached to it and flies around the entire audience as balloons and confetti descend from above. Soon after, she exits the stage once more after thanking everyone for attending and introducing her band members.

For the encore, an interlude called "Prism-Vision" is played, where the audience are encouraged to wear special rainbow-star diffraction glasses picked up before the show to magnify the visual effects of the performance. Perry enters the stage wearing a firework-themed dress to perform "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]". During the song's climax, multiple fireworks explode on stage before Perry ends the show, exiting through the pyramid from which she entered the stage at the beginning.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-06-26/entertainment/bal-katy-perry-concert-review-washington-verizon-center_1_katy-perry-things-katy-merdquo/2|title=Katy Perry brings 'Prismatic' spectacle to Verizon Center|first=Ellie|last=Kahn|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/06/25/katy-perry-concert-at-verizon-center-raises-more-questions-than-answers-and-thats-okay/|title=Katy Perry concert at Verizon Center raises more questions than answers, and that's okay|first=Emily|last=Yahr|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 25, 2014|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

'''Ronald Arthur Biggs''' (8 August 1929 – 18 December 2013) was one of the men who planned and carried out the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery of 1963]]. He subsequently became notorious for his escape from prison in 1965, living as a fugitive for 36 years, and for his various [[publicity stunt]]s while in exile. In 2001, he returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. Biggs was released from prison on [[Compassionate release|compassionate grounds]] in August 2009&lt;ref name=BBC8188479/&gt; and died in a nursing home in December 2013.

==Early life==
Biggs was born in [[Stockwell]], [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]], London, on 8 August 1929.&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt; As a child during the [[Second World War]], he was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to [[Flitwick]], Bedfordshire, and then [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref name=BBCObit/&gt;

==Career==
In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]]. He was [[dishonorably discharged]] for [[desertion]] two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. During his incarceration in [[HMP Wandsworth]], he met [[Bruce Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=BBCObit/&gt;

After his third prison sentence, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a [[carpenter]]. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in [[Swanage]],&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt; the daughter of a primary school headmaster.&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt; They had three sons together.&lt;ref name=BBCObit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10209584|title=Obituary: Ronnie Biggs|publisher=BBC News|date=18 December 2013|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt;

==Great Train Robbery==
{{main article|Great Train Robbery (1963)}}
Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family,&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt; happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as "Stan Agate", or because of his age, "Old Pete" or "Pop". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. He was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QI Series G - Greats|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/7/10/|website=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid.&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCObit/&gt;

On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt; The gang then stopped the [[Travelling Post Office|mail train]] from [[Glasgow]] to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday.&lt;ref name=ronnie&gt;Camber, Rebecca, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1214894/Ronnie-Biggs-making-escape-care-home.html Ronnie Biggs, making his escape from the care home...] September 2009, ''Daily Mail''.

Retrieved March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line [[diesel-electric locomotive]] because he had only driven [[shunting (rail)|shunting]] locomotives on the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The day crime gang stopped a train and shocked the world|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/day-crime-gang-stopped-train-shocked-world/story-19620002-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230132136/http://www.nottinghampost.com/day-crime-gang-stopped-train-shocked-world/story-19620002-detail/story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2014|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=Nottingham Post|date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, [[Jack Mills]], was [[Club (weapon)|coshed]] with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point.&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt; Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Patrick H.|title=Dead Legends File – Ronnie Biggs the Great Train Robbery Rogue, Checks Out at Last|url=http://www.allthingscrimeblog.com/2014/01/04/dead-legends-file-ronnie-biggs-the-great-train-robbery-rogue-checks-out-at-last/|website=All Things Crime|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants [[£]]2.6&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to £49 million in 2017); Biggs's share was £147,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|147000|1963|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).&lt;ref name="RB147"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/100cb9c6-67bc-11e3-8ada-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2nr6vPQtm | title=Ronnie Biggs, train robber, 1929–2013 | work=Financial Times | date=18 December 2013 | accessdate=19 December 2013 | author=Chapman, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt;

After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there,&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt; Biggs's fingerprints were found on a [[ketchup]] bottle by [[Metropolitan Police]] investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang.&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt; In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt;

==Escape and abscondment==
Biggs served 15 months before escaping from [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth Prison]] on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a [[rope ladder]] and dropping onto a waiting removal van.&lt;ref name=ronnie/&gt;&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3548190.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Profile: Ronnie Biggs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fled to [[Brussels]] by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing [[plastic surgery]].&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt;&lt;ref name=biggs/&gt; During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent.&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt; Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal [[abortion]] in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt;

===Australia===
In 1966, Biggs fled to [[Sydney]], where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name=biggs/&gt; By the time Biggs and his family arrived in 1966, they had spent all but £7,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|7000|1966|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) of his £147,000 share of the train robbery proceeds: £40,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|40000|1966|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) on plastic surgery in [[Paris]]; £55,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|55000|1966|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; and the rest on legal fees and expenses.&lt;ref name=OddManOut/&gt;&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt;

In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that [[Interpol]] suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to [[Melbourne]], where he rented a house in the suburb of [[Blackburn North, Victoria|Blackburn North]] while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster East]]. Biggs had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the [[Nine Network|Channel 9]] TV studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a [[Reuters]] correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the 6 o'clock news at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the [[Port of Melbourne]], using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in [[Panama]] and within two weeks Biggs had flown to [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=biggs/&gt;

Following disclosure of Biggs' fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to a divorce in 1974, which was completed in 1976.&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt; Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 to an Australian media group&lt;ref name=DMail2119938/&gt; to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil.&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs/&gt; Charmian later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons—who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil— live anonymously. In 2012 Charmian acted as a consultant on the five-part [[ITV Studios]] docu-drama ''[[Mrs Biggs]]''—in which she was played by actor [[Sheridan Smith]]—which recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil.&lt;ref name=RTMrsBiggs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-09-05/the-first-mrs-biggs-id-do-it-all-again|title=The first Mrs Biggs: "I'd do it all again"|work=[[Radio Times]]|author=Claire Webb|date=5 September 2012|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DMail2119938&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2119938/Biggs-frame-How-wife-finds-crime-DOES-pay-.html|title=Biggs is in the frame again|author=Chris Hastings|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=25 March 2012|accessdate=19 December 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rio de Janeiro===
In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]] did not have an [[extradition]] treaty with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash&lt;ref name=Nicky&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/news/Biggs-family-vow-fight/article-1130691-detail/article.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090809213553/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/news/Biggs-family-vow-fight/article-1130691-detail/article.html | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 9 August 2009 | title= Biggs family vow to fight on | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mrs Biggs]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, ''[[Daily Express]]'' reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in [[Rio de Janeiro]]; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. [[Scotland Yard]] detective [[Jack Slipper]] arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.&lt;ref name=extradite1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/18206.stm UK asks for extradition of Ronnie Biggs] 30 October 1997, BBC. Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American [[double bass]] player), Jaime Shields, and Aureo de Souza to record ''Mailbag Blues'', a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatmusic.com/info/productinfo.php?productid=280 |title=WhatMusic.com official site |publisher=WhatMusic.com |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1977 Biggs attended a cocktail party on board the [[Royal Navy]] frigate {{HMS|Danae|F47}}, which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested.&lt;ref name=Nicky/&gt; Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known felon meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10:00 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hu0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=ronnie+biggs#v=onepage&amp;q=ronnie%20biggs&amp;f=false |title=Prisoner in Paradise |publisher=World Weekly News |date=8 August 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer [[Stanley Matthews]], whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. "We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at [[the Valley (London)|The Valley]]."&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;Matthews, Stanley. ''The Way It Was: My Autobiography'', Headline, 2000 ({{ISBN|0747271089}})&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, "Ronnie Biggs" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.

Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for ''[[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]'', [[Julien Temple]]'s film about the [[Sex Pistols]]. The basic tracks for "[[No One Is Innocent (song)|No One is Innocent]]" (a.k.a. "The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)"/"Cosh The Driver") and "[[Belsen Was a Gas]]" were recorded with guitarist [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] and drummer [[Paul Cook]] at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with [[overdub]]s added in an English studio at a later date. "No One is Innocent" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader [[Martin Bormann]] playing bass with the group.

In March 1981, Biggs was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off [[Barbados]], and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Hiscock |title=Loophole may let Biggs off hook |newspaper=The Sun |location=London |date=9 April 1981 |page=2 |quote= A legal loophole that could let train robber Ronnie Biggs off the hook does exist, a judge was told yesterday.

The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a [[Plausible deniability|deniable operation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/kidnap-ronnie-biggs |title=Kidnap Ronnie Biggs- Documentary|date=9 February 2006|publisher=[[Channel 4]] |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITN reporter [[Desmond Hamill]] paid to accompany Biggs on the private [[Learjet]] returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10028668/Desmond-Hamill.html ''Daily Telegraph'' Obituary]. Retrieved 3 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film ''[[Prisoner of Rio]]'' (1988), which was co-written by Biggs. In the film Biggs was played by [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]].

Biggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the successful children's programme and music band [[Turma do Balão Mágico]], bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again.

In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs "[[Police on My Back (song)|Police on My Back]]" and "[[Carnival in Rio (Punk Was)|Carnival in Rio]]" by German punk band [[Die Toten Hosen]]. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album ''Bajo Otra Bandera'' by [[Argentina|Argentinian]] punk band [[Pilsen (band)|Pilsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-724-2003-05-04.html |language=Spanish |title=Mi papá es un punk |publisher=pagina12 |date=4 May 2006 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unkilo.blogspot.com/2009/03/pil-trafa-y-ronald-biggs-i-solo-para.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427084111/http://unkilo.blogspot.com/2009/03/pil-trafa-y-ronald-biggs-i-solo-para.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 April 2009 |title=Pil Trafa y Ronald Biggs |language=Spanish |publisher=BlogSpot.com |date=7 March 2009 |accessdate=2 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition.&lt;ref name=extradite1/&gt; English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-43178/Ronnie-Biggs--From-train-robber-fugitive.html|title=Ronnie Biggs - From train robber to fugitive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulschambers.com/case-experience-of-nigel-sangster-qc|title=Fraud &amp; financial Regulation QC - Leeds QC - Fraud QC Leeds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to the United Kingdom==
In 2001 Biggs announced to ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.

===Imprisonment===
Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a [[private jet]] was paid for by ''The Sun'' newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses {{According to whom|date=August 2017}}in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.&lt;ref name=biggs/&gt;

His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was available in Brazil and he had friends who would have contributed to such expenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=66752|title=Statement from Michael Biggs =PR Newswire|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that it was his desire to "walk into a [[Margate]] pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of [[bitter (beer)|bitter]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/pictures/image/0,8543,-10704180185,00.html|title=2001: Biggs wants to return|work=The Sun | location=London | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Mills, son of train driver [[Jack Mills]], was unforgiving: "I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Kim Sengupta [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/after-36-years-on-the-run-biggs-is-back-where-he-belongs-shy-in-jail-684106.html "After 36 years on the run, Biggs is back where he belongs: in jail",] ''The Independent'', 8 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause ([[Leukemia|leukaemia]]) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1310271.stm |title=Flashback: The Great Train Robbery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12419390|title=Biggs in hospital 'after stroke'|date=10 February 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of [[HM Prison Belmarsh|HMP Belmarsh]] for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich]] in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/17/ukcrime.simonhattenstone | title=My beloved dad, the train robber | work=The Guardian | date=17 January 2004 | accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4137312.stm|title=Release appeal as Biggs has MRSA|date=4 July 2007|publisher=BBC News  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2005, the [[Home Secretary]] [[Charles Clarke]] declined his appeal stating that his illness was not [[terminal illness|terminal]].

On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to [[Norwich (HM Prison)|Norwich Prison]] on compassionate grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6269312.stm|title=Biggs moved from Belmarsh prison|date=4 July 2007|publisher=BBC News  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: "I am an old man and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. [[Jack Straw|Straw]] decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/ronnie-biggs-pleads-let-me-out-so-i-can-die-with-my-family-767408.html|title=Ronnie Biggs pleads: Let me out so I can die with my family |date=30 December 2007|author=Jonathan Owen|author2=Sadie Gray|work=[[Independent on Sunday]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August 2009 and would die a "free man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/134965/Ronnies-out.html?postingId=135703|title= Train robber Biggs to be free in August|publisher=News of the World|date= 18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July 2009.

On 23 April the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6154459.ece|title= Ronnie Biggs recommended for early release|work=The Times |location=London|date= 23 April 2009  | first1=Richard | last1=Ford | first2=Adam | last2=Fresco | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July Jack Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'.&lt;ref name=BBC8188479&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8188479.stm|title=Train robber Biggs wins freedom |date=6 August 2009|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 2009, Biggs was readmitted to [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]] with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier with a chest infection and a fractured hip but returned to prison on 17 July 2009. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: "It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/8172555.stm Train Robber Biggs has Pneumonia] BBC. 28 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2009, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given "permission" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the [[National Offender Management Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/8176874.stm Biggs to Challenge Parole Refusal] BBC Online 30 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/world/europe/08robber.html?_r=1|title=Britain's Great Train Robber Freed |last=Burns|first=John|date=7 August 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Following his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home.&lt;ref name="Bingham"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6011192/Train-robber-Ronnie-Biggs-set-to-move-to-nursing-home-within-days.html |title=Train robber Ronnie Biggs set to move to nursing home within days |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 August 2009 |last=Bingham |first=John |accessdate=21 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815090310/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6011192/Train-robber-Ronnie-Biggs-set-to-move-to-nursing-home-within-days.html |archivedate=15 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, "This man is going to die, there is going to be no [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill."&lt;ref name="Bingham"/&gt; However, Biggs himself stated, "I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic."&lt;ref name="Bingham"/&gt;

On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at [[Barnet Hospital]]. His son Michael stated, "he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/10190104.stm Biggs Admitted to Hospital after complaining of a chest pain], [[BBC News]], 29 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, it was claimed by the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/08/01/great-train-robber-ronnie-biggs-is-given-a-lifetime-achievement-award-for-crime-115875-22454707/ Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs is given a lifetime achievement award for CRIME ], ''[[Mirror]]'', 1 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet Hospital with another suspected stroke.

On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, ''[[Mrs Biggs]]'', to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by [[Sheridan Smith]] and Biggs by [[Daniel Mays]]. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for ''Mrs Biggs''.&lt;ref&gt;Page 18/19 of the ITV press pack&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2012-09-04/the-two-mrs-biggs/ The two Mrs Biggs].

In March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2296402/Bruce-Reynolds-funeral-Ronnie-Biggs-flicks-V-sign-funeral-Great-Train-Robber.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Two fingers to you all: Frail and wheelchair-bound, Ronnie Biggs, 83, makes a feeble gesture of defiance at the funeral of one of his train robber pals | first=Paul | last=Harris | date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, ''The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013'' was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.

[[File:Royal academy summer exhibition varnishing day 2015 room scene.jpg|thumb|View of one of the main rooms, June 2015]]
The '''Summer Exhibition''' is an open [[art exhibition]] held annually by the [[Royal Academy]] in [[Burlington House]], [[Piccadilly]] in [[central London]], [[England]], during the months of June, July, and August. The exhibition includes [[paintings]], prints, drawings, [[sculpture]], [[architecture|architectural designs and models]], and is the largest and most popular open exhibition in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="telegraph2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/8552485/The-Royal-Academy-of-Arts-Summer-Exhibition-2011.html| title=The Royal Academy of Arts Summer Exhibition 2011 | work=Culture, [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | accessdate=4 July 2011 | location=UK | date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frith A Private View.jpg|thumb|''[[A Private View at the Royal Academy, 1881]]'' by [[William Powell Frith]], depicting [[Oscar Wilde]] and other Victorian worthies at a [[private view]] of the 1881 exhibition]]

When the Royal Academy was founded in 1768 one of its key objectives was to establish an annual exhibition, open to all artists of merit, which could be visited by the public. The first Summer Exhibition took place in 1769; it has been held every year since without exception.&lt;ref name="telegraph2011" /&gt;

==Selection process==
Today, around 1,000 works are selected each year from as many as 10,000 entries representing some 5,000 artists.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Any artist (living, known or unknown) may submit up to two works at a fee of £25 per piece for selection by The Summer Exhibition Selection and Hanging Committee.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Due to the significant increase in the volume of entries over recent years, the number of entries per artist was reduced to 2 (from 3) and the fee was increased £18 per piece. The committee is formed from the Council of Academicians (the governing body of the RA) and is traditionally chaired by the President of the Royal Academy.  In addition to those works selected by the committee, all 80 Academicians are entitled to have six of their own pieces in the exhibition.

For the 2006 exhibition, the academy received a statue and a plinth from David Hensel. By mistake, the two parts were judged independently, with the result that the statue was rejected and the plinth put on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1521330/Artist-laughs-his-head-off-at-the-RA.html | title=Artist laughs his head off at the RA | author=Sally Pook | date=2006-06-15 | publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
[[File:Royal academy summer exhibition varnishing day 2015 arrival at St James's edited.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Participants in the RA Summer Exhibition 2015 at St. James, Piccadilly, on Varnishing Day]]
The RA Summer Exhibition usually opens to the public in early June, preceded by a series of [[private view]]ings. The main event is called "Varnishing Day", the day that, according to popular legend, artists would come to add a final coat of [[varnish]] to their paintings (compare: ''[[vernissage]]''). Traditionally, artists walk in procession from Burlington House to [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]], where a service is held. At the opening reception the [[shortlist]]s for various prizes are announced.

Some years have particular themes. The 2005 exhibition theme was "[[Printmaking]] and the multiple". In 2006, the theme was "From Life." In 2008, the theme was "Man Made". The theme for 2010 was "Raw".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/summer-exhibition/ Summer Exhibition 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808114045/http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/summer-exhibition |date=8 August 2008 }}, Royal Academy of Arts, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the selection committee agreed to have no specific theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} 

Almost all exhibited works are for sale; the Academy receives 30% of the purchase price. In 2003, this amounted to a sum of some £2,000,000 for the institution, which receives no financial support from the state or crown.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Flight Lieutenant]] '''Sydney Hastings Dowse''' [[Military Cross|MC]] (21 November 1918 – 10 April 2008) was a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot who became a [[prisoner of war]] and survived [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|The Great Escape]] during the Second World War.

==Early life and RAFVR==
Born in [[Hammersmith]], Sydney was educated at [[Hurstpierpoint College]]. In July 1937, he joined the recently formed [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] and learnt to fly at weekends. 
At the outbreak of war in September 1939, he was called up for regular service and completed his pilot training. He was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] on 21 October 1940, with seniority from 9 August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/34989/supplements/6497 London Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined [[No. 608 Squadron RAF|No 608 Squadron]] attached to [[Coastal Command]] flying [[Avro Anson]]s on anti-submarine and convoy escort operations. At the end of 1940, he volunteered to join No 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU) flying [[Spitfire]]s.

He was [[mentioned in despatches]] on 11 June 1942&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35586/pages/2521 London Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 21 October 1942, with seniority from 9 August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35773/supplements/4811 London Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowse was shot down on 15 August 1941 while on a reconnaissance mission to photograph the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} at Brest.&lt;ref&gt;''RAF Coastal Command Losses'' by Ross McNeill&lt;/ref&gt; He was wounded in the leg and quickly captured by the Germans, becoming a [[prisoner of war]].

==Prisoner of war==

===Early escape attempts===

His first escape attempt came on 1 December 1941, when he was recovering from the leg wound sustained when he was shot down. He escaped from a hospital at Stadtroda in Thuringia. However, Dowse was recaptured three days later attempting to cross the Dutch-German border.&lt;ref name="Gaz4107"&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37687/supplements/4107 London Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;

His next attempt was from [[Stalag IX-C]] at [[Bad Sulza]] on 21 January 1942. He exchanged identities with a Canadian POW and joined a work party. He managed to slip away unnoticed when outside the camp. After travelling some distance by train to Werwitz, he continued on foot, through deep snow, towards the German-Belgian frontier where he was re-captured five days later, suffering from extreme exhaustion and exposure.&lt;ref name="Gaz4107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wire and Worse'' by [[Charles Rollings]] page 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a brief period in hospital, he was transferred to [[Oflag VI-B]] at Warburg.

At Warburg, he participated in the excavation of an escape tunnel, which was completed on 18 April 1942. He, and 34 others (including the legless air ace, [[Douglas Bader]], and Dowse's later escaping partner, [[Stanislaw Krol]]), prepared to escape. However, as the tunnel broke surface, it became clear that it was slightly too short, and the exit hole had emerged directly in the patrol path of a German sentry. Six RAF officers managed to escape, but, due to the proximity of the sentry, no one else, including Dowse, was able to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Wire and Worse'' by Charles Rollings page 212&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalag Luft III===
In May 1942, Dowse was transferred to [[Stalag Luft III]] at [[Żagań|Sagan]] with a batch of other RAF officers.

Dowse's next escape attempt happened on 30 November 1942, when he and [[Flight Lieutenant|Flt Lt]] [[Stanislaw Krol|Stanisław 'Danny' Krol]] cut through the wire into the camp's central compound and crawled across that compound using blankets as camouflage. They were in the process of cutting the perimeter wire to get out when they were arrested and sentenced to 14 days' solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;''AIR40/2645 Official Camp History – SL3(East)'' page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowse, who spoke some German, befriended a German corporal who worked alongside Dowse in the camp′s censor office. From this contact, Dowse was able to gain useful information and documents which aided the camp escape organisation. He was able to 'borrow' a genuine gate pass, which was copied by the camp's forgery department, and a copy was used on the [[delousing break]] mass escape in June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Escape from Stalag Luft III'' by Tim Carroll page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this same contact, Dowse was able to gain information about the German secret rocket establishment at [[Peenemünde]]. This information was passed on to British intelligence via secret codes written into POWs' letters home.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith page 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowse also learnt that the [[Gestapo]] had liquidation plans for [[Roger Bushell]] if he were caught escaping again. Dowse warned Bushell, who chose to ignore the warning.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith page 169&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Great Escape===
During his time in the North Compound at Stalag Luft III, Dowse became involved with the construction of the three tunnels intended for a mass escape, masterminded by [[Roger Bushell]], [[Harry Day]] and Canadian Wally Floody, who was instrumental in the tunnel′s design and construction. One tunnel, codenamed 'Harry' which Dowse had helped build, was completed in early 1944.
  
On 24 March 1944, he took part in [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|The Great Escape]] through tunnel 'Harry', escaping with [[Flight Lieutenant|Flt Lt]] [[Stanislaw Krol|Stanisław 'Danny' Krol]]. Dowse had drawn escape number 21, and was disguised as a Danish foreign worker, equipped with the appropriate (forged) documents and clothing provided by his 'contact'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Escape from Stalag Luft III'' by Tim Carroll page 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowse and Krol travelled mainly by foot towards the Polish border, but were recaptured just inside Germany on 6 April 1944. They were amongst the last escapers to be re-captured. Taken to the local [[Gestapo]] headquarters, they were interrogated, before being separated.&lt;ref&gt;''AIR40/2645 Official Camp History – SL3(North)'' page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowse was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. [[Stanislaw Krol|Stanisław 'Danny' Krol]] was among the 50 recaptured officers to be executed.

===Sachsenhausen concentration camp===
At Sachsenhausen, Dowse found himself with three fellow survivors of the 'Great Escape': ([[Harry Day]], [[Johnnie Dodge]] and [[Bertram James]]). They were placed in Sonderlager A (Special Camp A) within the main camp. Here were housed a handful of other 'political' prisoners, including [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agent [[Peter Churchill]], two Russian generals, various other Russians, Poles, Italians and four British soldiers of Irish origin.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith page 193&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they were joined by [[British Commandos|British Commando]] [[Jack Churchill]].

Dowse and James almost immediately began another tunnel, which was kept secret from all non-British personnel. This was completed and used on the night of 23 September 1944, when Dowse, James, Day, Dodge and Jack Churchill escaped.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith page 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Escape'' by [[Paul Brickhill]] page 236&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; '' Moonless Night'' by [[Bertrand James]] &lt;/ref&gt;

Dowse paired up with Day and they travelled by train into Berlin. However, they were recaptured the next day when hiding in a bombed out house in the Berlin suburb of Mahlsdorf.&lt;ref&gt;''Wings Day'' by Sydney Smith page 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Placed in the death cells back at Sachsenhausen, all the escapers who had been re-captured were spared execution mainly thanks to Day's efforts under interrogation.

In April 1945, after spending several months in solitary confinement Dowse, together with other prominent prisoners (Prominenten), was [[Transport of concentration camp inmates to Tyrol|transferred to the Tyrol]] via concentration camps at [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenburg]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]].

He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his services as a [[POW]]. This award was published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 16 August 1946.&lt;ref name="Gaz4107"/&gt;

==Later life==
Dowse served as an [[equerry]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. For a number of years in the 1950s, at the time of the communist insurgency, he worked in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] as a rubber plantation manager in the [[Penang]] Settlement.&lt;ref name="Tel1584"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/1584759/Sydney-Dowse.html Obituary] in the ''Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he also worked, possibly unwittingly, for a short time as a representative for [[Bernie Cornfeld]]'s insurance fraud, "The Dover Plan", as well as other unsuccessful and/or dubious ventures. He lived mainly on his heroic stories from the war, which were a ''laissez passer'' in post-war society.

He married three times, for the most part to women of some fortune, but was single at the time of his death. (He married Florence Marion Byers, daughter of wealthy businessman and Liberal, C. Charles Byers, then ran off, in 1968, with "Wings" Day's wife, to his former superior officer's eternal chagrin.){{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In retirement, Dowse divided his time between elegant homes in Chelsea and Monte Carlo.

He returned to [[Stalag Luft III]] in March 1994 and March 2004 to mark the anniversaries of the Great Escape, and to commemorate his friends who did not survive.&lt;ref name="Tel1584"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3515042.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Grand Theatre''' is a historic [[theatre]] located in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]], Canada and is currently one of that city's major performing arts venues. It has been the home of the [[Kingston Symphony]] since 1964. The main theatre seats 776 people, and has a proscenium stage and an orchestra pit. The building also houses a smaller [[black box theatre]], The Baby Grand, which seats 105 people.

==History==

Built in 1901–02 on the site of the former Martin's Opera House (built 1879 and destroyed by fire on 6 December 1898), The Grand Theatre was originally known as the Grand Opera House. The theatre's gala performance was on 14 January 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T43ZAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=the+grand+theatre+kingston&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ykIoVPnFFqaJjAKohYDwBg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20grand%20theatre%20kingston&amp;f=false|title=Mapping Canada's Music: Selected Writings of Helmutt Kallmann|editor1-last=Beckwith|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Elliott |editor2-first= Robin|section=Grand Theatre, Kingston|author=Patricia Beharriell|page=117|publisher=[[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1905–36 the theatre was owned and operated by impresario [[Ambrose J. Small]]. Notable performers to appear at the theatre during its early years included [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Al Jolson]], and [[Nellie Melba]]. In 1936 the theatre was sold by Small to Famous Players who decided to shut the theatre down and turn the building into a cinema venue. After two years of restoration, the theatre reopened as a movie house on 20 May 1938, and operated in that capacity until the theatre closed again in 1961.

Were it not for a group of concerned citizens forming the [[Kingston Arts Council]], the Grand Theatre would have been demolished in the early 1960s. The Kingston Arts Council successfully campaigned and advocated against demolition and for the theatre to be restored as a civic theatre that would serve as the home of the [[Kingston Symphony]] and as a venue for both local and touring groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artskingston.ca/history.cfm|title=Kingston Arts Council: About Us|author=Kingston Arts Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work accordingly began in 1964 and the newly named The Grand Theatre opened its doors on 20 May 1966 with a performance of [[Dora Mavor Moore]]'s musical revue ''[[Spring Thaw]]''. In 1978 a series of ongoing renovations began which established new lounges, higher quality backstage facilities, and The Baby Grand was co-founded by Sarah Garton Stanley and Eric Kaskens in 1985 (and was renovated and reopened in November 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/grand-theatre-emc/|title=Grand Theatre|author=Patricia Beharriel|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos''''' is a [[1937]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon directed by [[Frank Tashlin]].

==Plot==
The cartoon starts with an owl named "[[Alexander Woollcott|Owl Kott]]" (satirizing Woolcott's ''Town Crier'' radio program) giving an introduction to the festivities. This is followed by a [[Ben Bernie]] caricature called "Ben Birdie", feuding with "Walter Finchell". The same spoof was used in the cartoon ''[[The Coo-Coo Nut Grove]]'' (1936). [[Walter Winchell]] had a well-publicized feud with Bernie at the time, which, like [[Jack Benny]]'s "feud" with [[Fred Allen]], was faked for publicity purposes &amp;ndash; Bernie and Winchell were actually good friends.

Next is "Milton Squirrel" ([[Milton Berle]], emcee of ''Gillette Community Sing'') introducing "Wendell Howl" ([[Wendell Hall]]) and an audience trying to figure out which page to go to in their songbooks, which results in Wendell getting pelted by the audience's songbooks. Then, "Billy Goat and "Ernie Bear" (Billy Jones and Ernie Hare) and everyone else sings a song with the lyrics:

:The Woods are full of cuckoos,
:Cuckoos, cuckoos,
:The Woods are full of cuckoos
:and my heart is full of love.

During the song, a fox (a caricature of Fred Allen) called "Mr. Allen" is told that he's singing "Swanee River" instead of the actual song. Then the song is sung by "Eddie Gander" ([[Eddie Cantor]]), "Sophie Turkey" ([[Sophie Tucker]]), "W.C. Fieldmouse" ([[W. C. Fields]]), "Dick Fowl" ([[Dick Powell]]), "Fats Swallow" ([[Fats Waller]]), "Deanna Terrapin" ([[Deanna Durbin]]), "Irvin S. Frog" ([[Irvin S. Cobb]]), "Fred McFurry" ([[Fred MacMurray]]), "Bing Crowsby" ([[Bing Crosby]]), "Al Goatson" ([[Al Jolson]]), "Ruby Squealer" ([[Ruby Keeler]], Jolson's wife at the time), and "Lanny Hoss" ([[Lanny Ross]]). Then "Grace Moose" ([[Grace Moore]]) and "Lily Swans" ([[Lily Pons]]) sing notes, each note higher than the other. Comedian and jazz singer [[Martha Raye]] (caricatured here as a mule named "Moutha Bray") makes an appearance in a scatting jazz take.  More caricatures appear, including movie critic and gossip columnist "Louella Possums" ([[Louella Parsons]]), Raven McQuandry (Haven McQuarrie, emcee of ''Do You Want To Be An Actor?''), Joe Penguin ([[Joe Penner]]), Tizzie Fish ("Tizzie Lish", a character on [[Al Pearce]]'s radio show), Jack Bunny (Jack Benny), [[Mary Livingstone]], and [[Andy Devine]] (a regular on Benny's radio program). Finally Owl Kott finishes the cartoon by bidding the audience goodnight, and saying "All is well, all is well..."

==Availability==
*LaserDisc - ''[[The Golden Age of Looney Tunes]], Volume 4, Side 5
*DVD - ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3]]'', Disc 2

==Notes==
*This cartoon is notable for being a parody/send-up of several different radio programs of the era, particularly the then-popular "community sing" programs. Author and critic [[Alexander Woollcott]] is parodied as ''Owl Kott'' in the cartoon, a parody that Tashlin would revisit in another ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon, "[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]", which was released in 1938.

The '''Theater St. Gallen''' is a [[performing arts center]] for opera, musical, ballet, and theatre in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]], and considered to be the oldest professional [[theatre]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=TSG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatersg.ch/wDeutsch/theater/unser_haus/geschichte.asp?navid=110 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411044410/http://www.theatersg.ch/wDeutsch/theater/unser_haus/geschichte.asp?navid=110 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 11, 2009 |title=Unser Haus |author=Theater St. Gallen|language=German |accessdate=April 12, 2009}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It is a Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babs.admin.ch/de/aufgabenbabs/kgs/inventar/a-objekte.html |title=Kantonsliste A-Objekte |year=2009 |work=KGS Inventar |publisher=Federal Office of Civil Protection |language=German |accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the monks [[Tutilo]] and [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker]] already inspired briefly lay theatre in St. Gallen during the Middle Ages, theatre did not flourish for a long time because of moral concerns. In the early 19th century interest in theatre was reawakened. After the first performance on October 14, 1801 in modest surroundings, a "Theater Stock Company" was founded in 1805 to support a local professional theatre group. When they needed a larger place for their performances, the architect [[Johann Christoph Kunkler]] built a theater into which the group moved in 1857. This "Kunkler-Bau" remained the home of the formerly called ''Stadttheater St. Gallen'' for 111 years until 1968.&lt;ref name=TSG/&gt; The building was then demolished. 
[[File:St Gallen Theater Treppe.jpg|left|thumb|The staircase]]

The current building was designed by the Swiss architect [[Claude Paillard]] and inaugurated with Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]]'' on March 15, 1968.&lt;ref name=TSG/&gt; The building houses two stages, the larger one allows 742 persons and the studio 100 persons to attend.

With the construction of the new building, the stock company was replaced by a consortium with participation of the town of St. Gallen and its canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaterschweiz.ch/index.php?id=245| title=Theatre in Switzerland |author=Theaterschweiz |language=German |accessdate=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding communities thereafter joined in the venture. The "Genossenschaft Konzert und Theater St. Gallen" ("Cooperative for concert and theatre of St. Gallen") is since 2000 the supporting organization for the orchestre and theatre of St. Gallen. The "Sinfonieorchester St. Gallen" therefore provides orchestral support for operas and musicals. 

Each year about 20 new productions are introduced. Among them, in 2009, the theater featured the world premiere of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (musical)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', a musical by [[Frank Wildhorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagblatt.ch/aktuell/kultur/kultur/Im-Musical-Himmel;art624,1267733|title=Im Musical-Himmel|publisher=St. Galler Tagblatt|date=February 24, 2009|language=German|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/126412.html Borchert to Star in World Premiere of Wildhorn's Count of Monte Cristo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425033936/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/126412.html |date=2009-04-25 }}, playbill.com, February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre's 390 annual performances are seen by about 140,000 attendees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">'''Troyl''' is a colloquial [[Cornwall|Cornish]] word meaning a barn-dance or [[céilidh]], a social evening of dance, music and song.

== Etymology ==

[[Edward Lluyd]] (1660?-1709) knew the Cornish verb ''troillia'' - to twist, twirl, whirl, spin round.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lluyd, ''Archaeologica Britannica'' (Oxford, 1707)&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Veale of Pentire, [[Newquay]]  used the noun ''troil'' in the 1880s to describe a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] [[céilidh]] in [[Newquay]].&lt;ref&gt;Davey, M. ''Hengan'' (Dyllansow Truran, 1983) 51-53 &amp; 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Morton Nance]] collected the noun ''troyl'' in the 1920s. He classified the word as a 'Cornish dialect survival', and knew the similar Welsh noun which has the same [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] root. "Troyll" appeared in [[Robert Morton Nance]]'s 1938 [[Cornish language|Cornish]] English dictionary with the meanings - circuit, spiral, spin, turn and lathe.&lt;ref&gt;Nance, R. Morton (1990) ''A New Cornish Dictionary''. Redruth&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Cornish Dance Revival of the 1980s the noun ''Troyl'' has been consistently used to denote a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] [[céilidh]].&lt;ref&gt;Davey, A. et al. (1992) ''Corollyn''. Truro&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th century troyls ==

Speaking of social life associated with the fish cellars in [[Newquay]] in the late 19th century, Edward Veale related that 'A dance or ‘troil ... always terminated the [[pilchard]] season. This was a feast for those connected with the cellars, each cellar having its own troil. After the feast, which was given in the loft, games and dancing followed. These were kept up until the small hours of the morning, the music being provided by a fiddler.’ Such Troils were also noted by Sarah Teague Husband and Edgar Rees, writing of 19th century Newquay.&lt;ref&gt;S. Teague Husband, ''Old Newquay'' (F. E. Williams, Newquay, 1923) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar A. Rees, ''A Fisherwomen's Festival'', Old Cornwall, Vol.3 (April 1937 - October 1942 ), p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Veale also remembered seeing the step dance, Lattapuch, in the Unity Fish Cellars, Newquay in the 1880s, and dancing the Lancers.&lt;ref&gt;M. Davey, ''Hengan'' (Dyllansow Truran, 1983) 51-53 &amp; 57&lt;/ref&gt; It seems clear that social dancing, step dancing - sometimes competitive, music and song were involved. Such events occurred on the completion of a particularly successful catch and at the end of the pilchard season.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. O'Connor. ''Ilow Kernow 3'' (Wadebridge, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Troyls of the Cornish Dance Revival ==

Since 1980 Troyls have been staged with increasing frequency since the collection of a core repertoire of dances by Merv and Alison Davey, and the writing of numbers of modern folk dances in Cornish style by enthusiasts from several [[Cornish dance]] groups. The core repertoire has now been published in a book/tape/videotape package, and other DVDs and books are progressively becoming available.&lt;ref&gt;A. Davey, et al., ''Corollyn'' (Truro, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical Troyl has a mixture of social (public dances), usually "called" to assist the less experienced. Most will be set dances, but as karoles were once found in Cornwall, and processional dances (furrys) survive to this day, so various rondes and farandoles are also danced. Between such items there will often be demonstration dances, [[Music of Cornwall|music]], song, step-dancing, or storytelling (droll telling).

[[File:Uppsala Conflict Data Program Office at Uppsala University, Sweden..JPG|thumb|The UCDP is located at [[Uppsala University|Uppsala University's]] Department of Peace and Conflict Research (at left) in Gamla Torget.]]
The '''Uppsala Conflict Data Program''' ('''UCDP''') is a data collection project on organized [[violence]] housed at [[Uppsala University]] in [[Sweden]] that has been collecting information on [[armed conflict]] since 1946&lt;ref name="pcr"/&gt; and making it publicly available through its annual report, ''States in Armed Conflict.'' Beginning in Since 2004, the constantly-updated UCDP is also publicly available.&lt;ref name="pcr" /&gt; The UCDP collects both [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative data]] on organized violence (e.g., fatality statistics, [[Georeferencing|georeferenced]] event data, and armed actor and conflict descriptions) that is used by [[social science]] researchers, [[journalist]]s, and [[Politician|policymakers]].

==Background==
The UCDP began recording information on ongoing violent conflicts in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="pcr"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erik Melander |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/program_overview/ |title=UCDP Program Overview |accessdate=January 22, 2017 |publisher=[[Department of Peace and Conflict Research]], [[University of Upsala]] |date=nd |location=[[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206111450/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/program_overview/ |archive-date=February 6, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became clear that more systematic and global data on armed conflicts was necessary for conducting research in the expanding academic discipline of [[peace and conflict studies]].

Initially, the program collected data only on so-called "armed conflicts", defined as fighting exceeding 25 battle-related deaths between two actors of which at least one was a [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/definition_of_armed_conflict/#i |title=UCDP definition of armed conflict |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162625/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/definition_of_armed_conflict#i |archive-date=2013-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the data gathering grew, and the program also began collecting data on "non-state conflicts" (where neither party was a state) and "one-sided violence" (where an organized group attacked unarmed [[civilian]]s).

The UCDP's data is published annually in such publications as the ''[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|SIPRI Yearbook]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2012 |title=and the |publisher=Sipri.org |date=2012-06-04 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]''. The UCDP also makes its data publicly available through its website and previously in its publication, ''States in Armed Conflict''.

==Organization==
The UCDP is located at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research of Uppsala University in Sweden. The program is led by Associate Professor Kristine Eck, and employs approximately 10-15 research assistants and researchers. A number of scholars and Ph.D. candidates are also attached to the program and tasked with carrying out research for the collection of conflict data. In addition to collecting data, the program disseminates knowledge on trends and dynamics of armed conflict to the public via lectures at academic and government forums.

===Cooperation===
The UCDP works closely with both the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] (PRIO) and the [[Human Security Report Project]], based within the School for International Studies at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. The UCDP collaborates with PRIO to create its datasets and provides the Human Security Research Project with data for its annual publication, the ''[[Human Security Report 2005|Human Security Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/2012/overview.aspx |title=Overview - Human Security Report 2012 |publisher=Hsrgroup.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCDP's data is published annually in collaboration with the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) and appears in the ''SIPRI Yearbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2012 |title=SIPRI Yearbook 2012 — www.sipri.org |publisher=Sipri.org |date=2012-06-04 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Hundreds of scholars have used the UCDP's data for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/Publications_using_UCDP_data/ |title=Publications using UCDP data - Uppsala universitet |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617161647/http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/Publications_using_UCDP_data |archive-date=2013-06-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCDP couples data collection with research on conflict resolution and the dynamics of conflicts.&lt;ref name="pcr" /&gt; Much of the research done by UCDP staff is published in the UCDP's ''States in Armed Conflict'' annual report, the annual ''SIPRI Yearbook'', and the ''Journal of Peace Research''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/publications/ |title=Publications - Uppsala universitet |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Database==

The Armed Conflict Dataset is a joint project between the UCDP and PRIO that records armed conflicts from 1946–2016 that result in a minimum of 25 battle-related deaths and in which at least one actor is the government of a state. Data is collected by keying specific search words in the [[Factiva|Factiva Database]], an online resource containing over 10,000 different newspapers, newswires, and other sources, as well as published books, case studies, and journals (''[[Africa Research Bulletin]]'', ''[[Africa Confidential]]'', [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] publications). The dataset is updated annually, with Version 17.1-2017 being the most recent.

Every armed conflict is classified as a dyad in the dataset and assigned an ID number. A dyad consists of two conflicting primary parties. Dyads can last multiple years and are coded for intensity level ("minor" for those with less than 1,000 deaths; "major" for those with more than 1,000 deaths), region ([[Americas]], [[Asia]], [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]]), incompatibility (government, territory, government and territory), and type (extrasystemic, interstate, internal, internationalized internal). The start date, end date, year, and location of conflict are also provided as well as the precision of the start and end date.

===Publications===
UCDP data has been published in the ''SIPRI Yearbook'' since 1988. Since 1993, a list of all armed conflicts also appears in the ''Journal of Peace Research''. Data on non-state conflicts appears in the ''Human Security Report'' from 2004. The UCDP has also releases (annually) its own report, ''States in Armed Conflict''. UCDP data is also frequently used by journalists, government agencies, and other organizations to produce overviews of peace and conflict in the world. One prominent index that uses UCDP data is the [[Global Peace Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi/home.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704165325/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi/home.php |date=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset==
A battle-related death is one that is caused by combat between conflicting parties over a contested incompatibility. These deaths can be caused by traditional battlefield fighting, [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla activities]], [[urban warfare]], and any kind of [[bombardment]] of military units, cities, and villages. Guerrilla activities include [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run attacks]] and [[ambush]]es, and examples of urban warfare include [[bomb]]s, [[explosion]]s, and [[assassination]]s. Targets of attacks are generally military, state institutions, and state representatives. However, civilians are [[collateral damage]], and both military and [[Civilian casualties|civilian deaths]] are accounted for in the dataset.

UCDP has three ways of estimating battle-related deaths: best estimate, low estimate, and high estimate. The best estimate is the aggregate of the most reliable numbers for all battle-related incidents during a year. The low estimate is the aggregate of low estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year, and the high estimate is the aggregate of high estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year. These estimates are found in both conflict-year based datasets and dyad-year based datasets. The averages of deaths in the most recent of each kind of dataset are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Conflict-year dataset || bdBest || bdLow || bdHigh
|-
| Average || 918 || 868 || 1,287
|-
| Dyad-year dataset || bdBest || bdLow || bdHigh
|-
| Average || 705 || 666 || 979
|}

UCDP gathers and updates data on a yearly basis. They have datasets available from 1989 to 2016. Every event lists the date of the event, reporting source, primary source, actors involved, place of event, what happened, and the estimates of fatalities. The staff reads all the reports, and the information is entered manually. Furthermore, the aggregate results are compared to figures in official documents, special reports, and news media.

UCDP uses both printed and electronic public sources for gathering information. The main source is the Factiva Database that is composed of over 10,000 newspapers, newswires, and other sources from around the globe. UCDP uses at least one major newswire ([[Reuters]], [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]], [[EFE]]) and [[BBC Monitoring]]. Additional sources include news agencies, newly published books, case studies, journals like ''Africa Research Bulletin'', research reports, documents of international and multinational organizations, publications by NGOs such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], and documents of fighting parties. Sources are judged according to the context in which they are published, and reports are traced back to the primary source to establish reliability.

==UCDP's definitions of organized violence==
The program divides armed conflict into three categories: "state-based conflict", "non-state conflict", and "one-sided violence".

'''State-based conflict''' refers to what most people intuitively perceive as "war"; fighting either between two states, or between a state and a rebel group that challenges it. The UCDP defines an armed state-based conflict as: "An armed conflict is a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#i |title=UCDP definition of armed conflict |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's definition differs somewhat from other data collection programs, such as the [[Correlates of War]] Project, which only counts conflicts where at least 1,000 deaths have been recorded during one calendar year. In UCDP, data such an armed conflict is labelled as having the intensity level of "war", whilst armed conflicts that reap between 25 and 999 battle-related deaths are seen as having the intensity of a "minor" armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#i |title=Definition of intensity levels |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-state conflicts''' are those conflicts in which none of the warring parties is a state. Examples of non-state conflicts include the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–07)|Fatah–Hamas conflict of 2006 and 2007]], [[Ethnic conflict|inter-ethnic group conflicts]] such as the [[Lou Nuer]]–[[Murle people|Murle]] conflict of 2009–2012, and inter-[[Drug cartel|cartel]] violence in the [[Mexican Drug War]].

'''One-sided violence''' is defined as: "The use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 256 |url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#o |title=UCDP definition of one-sided violence |publisher=Pcr.uu.se |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include actions by the governments of [[Sudan]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Syria]] against civilians, as well as actions of non-state organizations such as [[Los Zetas]], Al-Qaeda, and the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] against civilians.

* Note: Fatality figures may be substantially lower than other stated estimates as UCDP data does not include fatalities from disease and/or war-time epidemics, or combine casualty figures between different types of armed conflicts. Additionally the figures in the tables represent the UCDP's "best estimate" figures and not its "high estimate" figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/search.php#__utma=1.2093341673.1361462813.1361717506.1362395396.7&amp;__utmb=1.4.10.1362395396&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1362395396.7.4.utmcsr=ucdp.uu.se%7cutmccn=(referral)%7cutmcmd=referral%7cutmcct=/gpdatabase/search.php&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=175407906 |title=Database - Uppsala Conflict Data Program |publisher=UCDP |date= |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Edward S. Herman|Edward Herman]], Professor Emeritus of Finance at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], and his colleague David Peterson, who together co-authored ''The Politics of Genocide'', have accused the UCDP of using "politicized [...] methodologies" in an effort to "minimize U.S.- and Western-led warmaking and killing." Exemplifying these assertions, they compare the classification{{by whom|date=July 2013}} of US involvement in [[Guatemala]] and the perception of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward S Herman and David Peterson

==UCDP on the internet==
The UCDP's homepage is located at &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;http://www.ucdp.uu.se&lt;/span&gt;. The UCDP also has an on-line database of organised violence, accessible at &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt; http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/search.php&lt;/span&gt;. The database provides free information on state-based and non-state conflicts, as well as one-sided violence. It also includes descriptive information on causes and histories of conflicts and one-sided violence and brief descriptions of rebel groups, governments, and related items.

=== UCDP for iPhone and Android ===
As of July 2010, the UCDP Conflict Database is available as an [[iPhone]] application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/uppsala-conflict-database/id380077089?mt=8 |title=Uppsala Conflict Database för iPhone, iPod touch och iPad i iTunes App Store |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2012-11-19 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.uppsala.ucdp&amp;feature=search_result&amp;hl=en |title=Uppsala Conflict Database - Android Apps on Google Play |publisher=Play.google.com |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23527">'''Venezia Giulia Police Force''' was a police corps formed after [[World War II]] by the [[Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories|Allied Military Government]] in Zone A of [[Venezia Giulia]].  Operating in the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] after 1947, it was active until 1961. From 1945 to 1954 it was directed by Col. [[Gerald Richardson (police colonel)|Gerald Richardson]], a former [[Scotland Yard]] officer.

== Background ==

The Yugoslav 4th Army and the Slovenian 9th Corps entered Trieste on May 1, 1945.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; The 2nd Division (New Zealand) arrived on the next day and forced the surrender of the 2,000 German Army troops holding out in Trieste, who warily had refused to capitulate to partisan troops, fearing they would be executed by them. An uneasy truce developed between New Zealand and Yugoslav troops. On June 12, 1945 the Yugoslav forces were driven out by the British Army; American and British took over the administration of the Territory, creating the Allied Military Government&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; on the western part of the Julian March or Venezia-Giulia. On June 30, 1945 the AMG of Venetia-Giulia with an executive order signed by, US Army Colonel Nelson W. Monfort, dissolved all the existing Police Forces in the City of Trieste and other parts of Venezia Giulia, including the Popular Defense Corps or Difesa Popolare, created by the Yugoslavs during their forty-day occupation of the city, from May 1 to June 12, 1945.
The allied Forces then  had to create a new Civil Police Force to maintain law and order in the territory, and to work alongside their Military Police Forces, to deal with the local civilian matters. The newly created Corps was named Venezia-Giulia Police Force&lt;ref name=Lisiani/&gt; (V.G.P.F); Civil Police was an unconventional name given to the Force, to distinguish them from the Military Police Forces, British and US, which were also operating in the Venezia Giulia, A zone, at the end of WW2. They were also known with the moniker "Cerini" or "Wax Matches", because of the uniform they worn. In fact the contrast between the huge white helmet and the dark blue British Uniform, reminded to the population, the shape of a Wax Match. 
 
== Organization ==

The Venezia Giulia Police Force was created in September 1945, after the training school opened in August 1945 had trained and graduated men who had passed a medical test and had their political records scrutinized. It was organized into 7 divisions:&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt; Administrative and Personnel, Uniformed Police Criminal Investigation, Transportation, Training, Quartermaster (supply) and Prison Service. Divisions had subdivisions or sections, covering every branch of service:
* Division 1: Administrative, Personnel, Finance, Medical, and Press Office;
* Division 2: Uniformed Police, Mounted Section, Forest, Female Police service created in 1947;
* Division 3: Cabinet, License, Criminal Investigation Department;
* Division 4:Transport, Communication, and Traffic;
* Division 5: Quartermaster, Procurement Office;
* Division 6:Training and Police Band;
* Division 7: Divisional Headquarter including the Coroneo Jail, The Jesuits and Tigor Street Jails. The last two were in use until 1952.

Training Facilities and Police School Academy as well as Police band, with 60 members, were located at the Beleno Barracks, in Trieste in Street  Pasquale Revoltella number 29-35.&lt;ref name=Cox/&gt; In addition there were Fishery Patrol, Motor Boat Patrol, Railway Police Service and Female Police. Although Fishery Police was part of the V.G.P.F., they did not share the same civilian status, they were Military, and wore different uniforms. Fishery Police were given the tasks that nowadays are commonly carried  out by the Coast Guard such as Territorial Waters and Fishing boats protection. The Fishery Police Patrol, who was also in charge of the Port area security, and was established in August 1945 after few British Officers had entered gun-in-hand into the Trieste Port Authority Offices, who were still held by the Yugoslavs, kicking them literally out. The Female section of the V.G.P.F. was created in 1947, and it was real innovation compared to the old Italian concept of policing. Their tasks were more or less those assigned to the other units, including investigating vice crimes and prostitution. But the ground where they operated with success, was the Social Working. It was the first time that, this professional discipline, that seeks to facilitate the welfare of communities, individuals, families, and groups, was implemented in Italy. There are no records that Female Police Officers were molested, mistreated or that their job was neglected. There is no doubt that the Female Section of the V.G.P.F. was the forerunner for the future introduction of Women into the Italian Police Forces. Female Officers were issued the same uniforms of their male colleagues, but they were not allowed to carry firearms during night shifts.

The newly formed Police Force also had a chaplain Service, and a Trade Union. The Roman Catholic Mons. Mario Novach &lt;ref name=Subani/&gt;&lt;ref name=Diocese/&gt; served as Corps Chaplain from 1948 until its dissolution in 1961, as most of the Corps member were Roman Catholic and Willy Marcocci&lt;ref name=Subani/&gt; was the union secretary.

Transport service, or Truck pool, whose trucks were provided by the military authorities, also included the communication and Road Police Unit. The communication section was in charge of all type of communications, radio, teletype and telephones including the management of the emergency number phone number, 223. The radio center was located into the Local Government House in Piazza/Square Unita' d'Italia. Road Police Unit was responsible for patrolling the roads. In addition to their general road policing duties, they assisted with various operations aimed at improving road safety by promoting campaign for the Road-safety aimed to reduce the rate of road collision in Trieste, and were also in charge to draft reports in case of vehicle collisions.

The Police Force had its own gazette, ''Il Eco della Polizia'' ("The Echo of the Police") whose last issue was on October 25, 1954.&lt;ref name=Subani/&gt;

The V.G.P.F was also involved in the recovering of the corpses from the Foibes, deep karst sinkhole, and the V.G.P.F Criminal Investigation Division was in charge of the investigation. The "Corpse Recovering Squad" was part of the forensic section and was led by the Inspectors Umberto De Giorgi and Oronzo Rizzo. The long report  drafted by Inspector De Giorgi, pertaining the operation of the corpses recovering from foibes, is available online, in Italian language.&lt;ref name=decifebbraio/&gt; During the November 1951 Polesine flooding, when two thirds of the Polesine Italian geographical region was flooded, the V.G.P.F organized a relief party commanded by Superintendent May, a former Metropolitan Police Superintendent, with more than 150 men equipped with: 11 heavy trucks, 10 motorcycle, 11 jeeps, a mobile radio station, 5 light trucks, a water supply truck, an ambulance and a searching-light truck.

== Commissioner ==

The Police Commissioner was the British Army Colonel CMG, OBE, Gerald Richardson.&lt;ref name=Richardson/&gt; A  Scotland yard Officer, from Nottingham, he had his first experience as Police Officer, when himself and other members of a local rowing club decided to volunteer, for the Special Constabulary in Nottingham, when a general strike broke out. The strike lasted 9 days, from  May 3, 1926 to May 13, 1926. At the end of the strike, he had realized that Law enforcement would have been his future career. He applied for the London Metropolitan Police where, after having passing the tests, he was admitted in 1927, and entered in the Police Training School at the Peel House in Westminster. After the graduation he spent 12 months on the beat, and then requested the assignment to the Criminal Investigation department; in August 1929 he was appointed Detective Constable. On July 13, 1943 he was Commissioned into the British Army. He would spend the rest of the war as law enforcement officer in the territories occupied by the British Forces. From London he was initially sent to Tangier, and after the landing in Italy he was in Sicily and Naples where for 18 months, he was Chief Public Safety Officer. At the end of the war he was serving in Northern Italy. It was during a period of rest on lake Maggiore, that an urgent telephone call summoned him, to report immediately, to the 8th Army HQ, where he received a new assignment as Director of the Public Safety of the City of Trieste. His task was not an easy one since there was no existing police force in the city. Among the reasons which had made the allied to take the direct rule of the area was that of, avoiding future confrontation between Italy and Yugoslavia who were still struggling for the possession of the border regions and the Port of Trieste. The port was a strategic hub to supply the allied forces in the occupied Austria. Colonel Gerald Richardson, has been described as a worthy gentleman always well dressed, and with the typical English trait. He tried to infuse the esprit de corps, and to create a cohesion into the newly formed unit. When creating the V.G.P.F, He abolished disciplinary code in use in the Royal Carabineer Corps, judging it too harsh and vicious, encouraged the development of, the new force traditions, personal responsibilities, and the concept of impartiality. Police Force personnel welfare was one of his priorities; he made sure that they all received an adequate salary, appropriate lodging, family allowances, and sickness benefits. However, when a regrettable incident occurred at a village outside Trieste, where a political demonstration had later developed into a riot, was taking place, and three demonstrators were shot dead, three Police Officers and an Inspector were charged with manslaughter, and had to appear before an Allied Military Court presided by British and American judges.  As soon as he took up office, one of his first decision was to disband the Difesa Popolare, or Popular Defense, the uniformed People's Police Force the Communists had built up. He soon noticed that, they were keeping no-record of what they were doing as well as for the arrestees, and when asked about it, were not able to produce any record at all; that their prisons were full, and most of the times, the interviewed prisoners could not give an account regarding their arrest. In addition all the evidences he collected, suggested that the Difesa Popolare, was financing itself with a protection racket system and looting. The uniform they wore were done by a local clothing manufacturer who had been doing the same job for the Germans. They wore red stars, and red scarfs around the neck and their chest were trimmed with hand grenades. Col. Gerald Richardson also find out that, their courts had no professional judges and that at the best, the trials were presided by some zealous young Law student, which in most of the cases, had forgotten everything he had studied. All these facts were intolerable for him and for the Allied authorities, and therefore two weeks after he took office the Difesa Popolare was officially disbanded. When they asked for a Victory parade, to be held on Sunday morning, their request was granted. The Difesa Popolare marched thru the street of Trieste, for the last time, and reached the Rossetti barracks. When the last one of them had filed into the barracks, the heavy doors were dragged shut behind them. From the opening windows, and roof British troops covered them with rifles, and machine guns; they had to surrender their own arms. They were told that they could go everywhere they liked, women as well as men. Those who wanted to go to Yugoslavia had to form a line on the left, assuming that the others on the right would have stayed, and were escorted to the frontier. British Personnel quickly went to the Difesa Popolare Posts and seized their weapon. However some of them were also given the chance of joining the V.G.P.F., although Richardson's preference was for the former Royal Carabineers and Questura personnel whom he judged a better training material. His office was located at Foro Ulpiano, inside the Trieste Court House, and also included the Deputy Chief of Police, the Legal Advisor and Disciplinary Officer. In March 1955, Col. Richardson became the Commissaire, Chef de la Sureté, Police Générale, in the International zone of Tangier.

== Jurisdiction ==

The Morgan Line &lt;ref name=Cox/&gt; ceased to exist on  September 15, 1947, when the Treaty of Peace with Italy came into effect. The Treaty established the border between Italy and Yugoslavia in the northern sections of the contended territory, as well as the border between Yugoslavia and the Free Territory of Trieste established as new independent, sovereign State under a provisional regime of Government and under the direct responsibility of the United Nations Security Council in its southern part. The Jurisdiction of the Free Territory of Trieste, after Gorizia and Pola zones had been returned to Italy and ceded Yugoslavia respectively, was divided into 5 Zones: City of Trieste, Duino, Opicina, Muggia and Port and Railway. Zones were divided into Districts open 24/7, and Border Posts. Every zone was patrolled on foot and with Emergency car. A system of public emergency calls was started, and the emergency number 223, was available, to request help or assistance by the local population.

== Uniforms and weapons ==

The V.G.P.F  personnel was initially issued a mixture of British, American and Italian equipment and weaponry. The 13th British Army Corps insignia, an Antelope, was adopted as the Corps Insignia.  However parade and Police Uniform were under a great British influx, resulting in an undeniable, London Metropolitan Police style.&lt;ref name=Rosignoli/&gt; Military training was according to that of the British Army, as well as the drill instruction. The British Army's salute, with the right hand palm facing forwards with the fingers almost touching the cap or beret, was adopted. The corps was equipped with Winchester Carbine mod. 1 and 2, Automatic Colt Pistol cal. 45, Smyth and Wesson revolvers. Commissioned Officers and sergeants were issued Italian Beretta Pistol model 1934. Only night time shifts carried firearms, while during the day no weapons was carried by the personnel on duty. The V.G.P.F  identification cards were all bilingual.

== Ranks ==

Senior Commissioned Officers had a rank tier as follow: Superintendent Assistant, Superintendent and Chief Superintendent. These positions were exclusively held by British and American personnel. Junior Ranks from Deputy Superintendent (Major), Chief Inspector (Captain), Inspector (1st LT), Deputy Inspector (2nd LT), Sergeants (Warrant Officers) of first, second and third class, Corporal and Guard, were open to locals.

== Strength ==

The Venezia-Giulia Police Force in October 1945 had an initial strength of 2,482 Commissioned Officers and enlisted. At its peak, in 1949, had a strength of 6,097 men and women, decreasing to 4,296 in 1952, and in 1954, when the provisional civil administration of zone A of the FTT was eventually handed over to Italy had a total 4,366 men and women. The V.G.P.F. personnel was created following the Venezia-Giulia ethnic criteria enlisting Italians, Slovenians and Croats. In addition a small group of former Germans and Austrians P.O.W were also allow to enlist.

== The Trieste riots ==

On November 3, 1953, on the anniversary of the first annexation of Trieste to Italy in 1918, which is also the feast commemorating the Patron Saint of Trieste, Saint Giusto, the city mayor, Giovanni Bartoli, ignoring a ban of Maj. Gen. Sir Thomas John Willoughby Winterton displayed the Italian National flag on the City hall. As he hoisted the flag some British Officers quickly removed and confiscated the flag. The day after, some local citizens coming back from the celebration held at the Redipuglia Italian World War I memorial, improvised a demonstration in support of the Italian rule of the city. The V.G.P.F. was activated to suppress the unauthorized demonstration, and confiscate the flags waved by the demonstrators. This provoked heavy fights which soon spread out throughout the city. On November 5, 1953 the students called a strike and started a demonstration in Sant'Antonio Square, in front of the local church. As a Civil Police car passed by, the students stoned the vehicle. A British member of the V.G.P.F., Mr. Edwards, got off the car and confronted the demonstrators, was greeted with a hail stones, insulted and beaten. The V.G.P.F. Riot squad arrived on the spot,to support the Superintended of C.I.D, Villanti and his men, who had witnessed the scene of Mr. Edwards stoning and went to rescue him. The crowd was soon dispersed with truncheons and with the help of a water truck. Some of the students who had find refuge into the church were chased and seriously beaten. During the afternoon the City Bishop Mons Antonio Santin decided to re-consecrate the church, according to the Roman Catholic tradition, as violent acts have been committed inside.  Thousands of citizens rallied up for the rite, and as the Police cars showed up the trouble soon begun. Apparently a British Officer member of the V.G.P.F, fired warning shots, as well as, some Police Officers did. As a result, two persons, Piero Addobbati and Antonio Zavadil were killed and several were injured. On November 6, 1953 a large crowd marched towards the Government house on Piazza/Square, Unità d'Italia were the AMG had its seat. In the meantime cars and other Police facilities in the city were destroyed and burned. The Police cordoning the Government house opened fire killing, Francesco Paglia, Leonardo Manzi, Saverio Montano and Erminio Bassa. In the three days of rioting six persons were killed and 162 injured, including 79 policemen.	In his memories, Col. Richardson gave this account of the shooting at Piazza Unità d'Italia, in front of the Government house, …"Mr Williams was told to go to Piazza Unità d'Italia at the Government house, with a Riot Squad. When there he ordered his men to remain into the vehicles. He went, alone, to remonstrate with the crowd, and in Italian, he appealed to them, but his attempt was unsuccessful. As he went back to his men, several stone struck him, and at that point, since the situation was quickly deteriorating, he gave orders to his men, to unsling carbines and prepare to face the crowd. He led a charge against the mob, meanwhile the Police was under a heavy stone volley. After he had run ahead few yards, he heard shots being fired behind him, but he had given no order to fire.. He immediately turned back and shouted in Italian " Enough, enough! Stop firing!!!""…

The victims of the riots were: Francesco Paglia (Trieste, 1929), student at the local University, and former bersagliere of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana; Leonardo "Nardino" Manzi (Fiume now Rijeka, 1938), student, a Fiume refugee; Saverio Montano (Bari, 1903), former partisan; Erminio Bassa (Trieste, 1902), Dockworker; Antonio Zavadil (Trieste, 1889), Dockworker; Pietro Addobbati (Zara now Zadar, 1938), student, a Dalmatian region refugee.

=== Aftermath ===

[[Clement Attlee]], at the time leader of the opposition, (by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Anthony Eden, whether he could make any statement regarding the disturbances in Trieste. Police reports indicated that disorders were deliberately provoked and at least partly organized from outside Zone A, by people defined as "Irresponsible elements" who had evidently planned to exploit certain national Italian anniversaries in order to provoke incidents in Trieste. The demonstrations seemed to be aimed at causing a breakdown of law and order and the disruption of the local security forces. Italian sources however labeled the action as a, deliberate repression put into being by the Anglo-American Allied Military Government Authorities, to suppress the Italian sentiment of the local population, and obstruct the process of reunion of Trieste with the motherland. Her Majesty's Government took a grave view of these events, and sincerely deplored the loss of life, the injuries suffered and the destruction of property in Trieste. However the sole responsibility for these tragic results was given to those extremist elements who deliberately provoked and organized these disorders. In note exchanging the British government made its views quite clear to the Italian Government and urged that they should do all in their power to curb those elements who have been responsible for provoking the disturbances in Trieste and the subsequent anti-allied demonstrations in Italy.

== Assignment of provisional civil Administration of Trieste to Italy ==

Approximately at 10:00 hrs of October 26, 1954 the Venezia-Giulia Police Force Commissioner, Col. Gerald Richardson, handed over responsibilities to Lt. Col. Diamante the acting Chief Public Safety Officer nominated by the Italian authorities. The V.G.P.F. was placed under the authority of the Italian State Police Force, at the time a paramilitary branch of the Italian Security Forces, and renamed, "Gruppo Polizia Civile" or "Civil Police Group", retaining its uniforms and ranks. This was an unusual status, because the V.G. Police Force was conceived as a Civil Police Force, while Italy had a long tradition, still enduring, of National Police Forces with a Military Status. Deputy Supervisor, Santo Del Piccolo was appointed as Commanding Officer of the "Civil Police Group". The Force, continued to operate as semi-distinct branch of Service of the Italian State Police Force, until law number 1600 was passed on December 22, 1960. The law came into effect on July 18, 1961, definitively dissolving the V.G. Police Force. Its personnel was given the choice to join the Italian State Police Force, acquiring a Military status, join the City of Trieste Municipal Force, or entering into the state administration. Some of the V.G.P.F. Personnel, mostly those with English skills, took the chance offered by the Allied, to emigrate under a special program, in USA, Canada, Australia or United Kingdom.

{{War in Darfur}}

The '''War in Darfur''' is a major armed conflict in the [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]] that began in February 2003 when the [[Sudan Liberation Movement/Army|Sudan Liberation Movement]] (SLM) and the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) rebel groups began fighting the [[government of Sudan]], which they accused of oppressing Darfur's non-[[Arab]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3496731.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Sudan's Darfur conflict |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/SD_DAR.htm |title=Reuters AlertNet – Darfur conflict |publisher=Alertnet.org |accessdate=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government responded to attacks by carrying out a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] against Darfur's non-Arabs. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the indictment of Sudan's president, [[Omar al-Bashir]], for [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]] by the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prosecutor v.

One side of the conflict is mainly composed of Sudanese military and police and the [[Janjaweed]], a Sudanese [[militia]] group whose members are mostly recruited among [[Arabization|Arabized]] indigenous Africans and a small number of [[Bedouin]] of the northern [[Rizeigat]]; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur remained uninvolved.&lt;ref name="guardian2004"&gt;{{Cite news|author= de Waal, Alex |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/25/internationalaidanddevelopment.voluntarysector |title=Darfur's Deep Grievances Defy All Hopes for An Easy Solution|work=The Observer|date= 25 July 2004|accessdate=13 January 2011 |authorlink= Alex de Waal |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The other side is made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim [[Fur people|Fur]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], and [[Masalit people|Masalit]] ethnic groups. The [[African Union]] and the [[United Nations]] also have a joint [[List of United Nations peacekeeping missions|peacekeeping mission]] in the region, named [[UNAMID]]. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supported the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it provided financial assistance and weapons and coordinated joint attacks, many against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rights Group Says Sudan's Government Aided Militias|url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/SudanRightsGroupSaysSudanAidesMilitas20July2004.htm|date=20 July 2004|work=Washington Post|accessdate=14 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060104021437/http://www.genocidewatch.org/SudanRightsGroupSaysSudanAidesMilitas20July2004.htm |archivedate = 4 January 2006}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2008/s2259102.htm |title=Darfur – Meet the Janjaweed |accessdate=16 July 2008 |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=3 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCDP"&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] [http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=145&amp;regionSelect=1-Northern_Africa# Conflict Encyclopedia, Sudan, one-sided conflict, Janjaweed – civilians]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322121309/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=145&amp;regionSelect=1-Northern_Africa |date=22 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of [[#Mortality figures|the number of human casualties]] range up to several hundred thousand dead, from either combat or starvation and disease.

The Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks and could see semi-autonomy much like [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8533097.stm |title=Will peace return to Darfur? |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, talks were disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the Tolu agreement.

==Origins of the conflict==
{{Main article|History of Darfur}}
Darfur, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for "the home of the [[Fur (people)|Fur]]", was not a traditional part of the states organized along the upper [[Nile]] valley but instead organized as an independent [[sultan]]ate in the 14th century. Owing to the migration of the [[Banu Hilal]] tribe in the 11th century CE, the peoples of the Nile valley became heavily [[Arabization|Arabicized]] while the hinterlands remained closer to native Sudanese cultures. It was first annexed to the [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egyptian]] Sudan in 1875 and then surrendered by its governor [[Slatin Pasha]] to the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdia]] in 1883. Following the [[British Egypt|Anglo-Egyptian]] victory in the [[Mahdist War]], [[Sultanate of Darfur|Sultan]] [[Ali Dinar]] was reinstated as a [[British Empire|British]] client before being deposed by a [[Anglo-Egyptian Darfur Expedition|1916 expedition]] after he made overtures in favor of [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] amid the [[World War I|First World War]]. Subsequently, Darfur remained a province of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] and the independent [[Republic of the Sudan]].

There are several different explanations for the origins of the present conflict. One explanation involves the [[Territorial dispute|land disputes]] between semi-[[nomad]]ic livestock herders and those who practice sedentary agriculture.&lt;ref name="Genocide Debate 2005 pp. 123-133"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60434/scott-straus/darfur-and-the-genocide-debate |title=Darfur and the Genocide Debate |first=Scott |last=Straus |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume= 84 |issue= 1 |date=January–February 2005 |pages=123–133 |doi=10.2307/20034212}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water conflict|Water access]] has also been identified as a major source of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/09/water.climatechange|title=Water becomes the new oil as world runs dry|author=Richard Wachman|date=8 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Darfur crisis is also related to a second conflict. In southern Sudan, civil war has raged for decades between the northern, Arab-dominated government and Christian and animist black southerners. Yet another origin is conflict between the Islamist, Khartoum-based national government and two [[List of active rebel groups|rebel groups]] based in Darfur: the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straus|first=Scott|title=Darfur and the Genocide Debate|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=January–February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of apartheid===
In early 1991, non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab [[apartheid]] campaign, segregating Arabs and non-Arabs.&lt;ref name="Johnson2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Hilde F. |last=Johnson|title=Waging Peace in Sudan: The Inside Story of the Negotiations that Ended Africa's Longest Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhlarBGyoQQC|year=2011|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-453-6 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudanese Arabs, who controlled the government, were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan's non-Arab citizens. The government was accused of "deftly manipulat(ing) Arab solidarity" to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref name="Lasaga"&gt;Vukoni Lupa Lasaga, "The slow, violent death of apartheid in Sudan," 19 September 2006, Norwegian Council for Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American University]] economist [[George Ayittey]] accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens.&lt;ref&gt;George Ayittey, Africa and China, [[The Economist]], 19 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ayittey, "In Sudan... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid."&lt;ref&gt;"How the Multilateral Institutions Compounded Africa's Economic Crisis", George B.N.

==Timeline==

===Beginning===
Flint and de Waal marked the onset of the genocide on 26 February 2003, when a group calling itself the [[Darfur Liberation Front]] (DLF) publicly claimed credit for an attack on [[Golo, Sudan|Golo]], the headquarters of [[Jebel Marra]] District. Prior to this attack, however, conflict had broken out, as rebels attacked police stations, army outposts and military convoys and the government engaged in a massive air and land assault on the rebel stronghold in the [[Marrah Mountains]]. The rebels' first military action was a successful attack on an army garrison on 25 February 2002. The government had been aware of a unified rebel movement since an attack on the Golo police station in June 2002. Flint and [[Alex de Waal|de Waal]] date the beginning of the rebellion to 21 July 2001, when a group of [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] and [[Fur people|Fur]] met in [[Abu Gamra]] and swore oaths on the [[Qur'an]] to work together to defend against government-sponsored attacks on their villages.{{sfn|Flint|de Waal|2005|p=76-77}} Nearly all of Darfur's residents are Muslim, including the [[Janjaweed]], as well as government leaders in [[Khartoum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/sudan/com_inq_darfur.pdf#search=%22un%20report%20darfur%20genocide%22 |title=Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General (PDF)|publisher= United Nations |page=129 |date=25 January 2005 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2003, the rebels seized the garrison town of Tine along the [[Chad]]ian border, seizing large quantities of supplies and arms. Despite a threat by President [[Omar al-Bashir]] to "unleash" the army, the military had little in reserve. The army was already deployed in both the south, where the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] was drawing to an end, and the east, where [[Eastern Front (Sudan)|rebels]] sponsored by [[Eritrea]] were threatening a newly constructed pipeline from the central oilfields to [[Port Sudan]]. The rebel [[Guerilla warfare|guerilla tactic]] of hit-and-run raids proved almost impossible for the army, untrained in desert operations, to counter. However, its aerial bombardment of rebel positions on the mountain was devastating.{{sfn|Flint|de Waal|2005|p=99}}

[[File:Darfur report - Page 4 Image 2.jpg|thumb|160px|Arab [[Janjaweed]] tribes have been a major player in the conflict.]] 
At 5:30&amp;nbsp;am on 25 April 2003, The Darfur genocide arose when the Sudan Liberation Movement and the JEM, which is the largest rebel group in Darfur, entered Al-Fashir, the capital city of North Darfur and attacked the sleeping garrison. In the next four hours, four [[Antonov]] bombers and helicopter gunships (according to the government; seven according to the rebels) were destroyed on the ground, 75 soldiers, pilots and technicians were killed and 32 were captured, including the commander of the air base, a [[Major General]]. The success of the raid was unprecedented in Sudan; in the twenty years of the war in the south, the rebel [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) had never before carried out such an operation.{{sfn|Flint|de Waal|2005|p=99–100}}

The al-Fashir raid was a turning point, both militarily and psychologically. The armed forces had been humiliated by the raid, placing the government in a difficult strategic situation. The incompetent armed forces needed to be retrained and redeployed amid concerns about the loyalty of the many Darfurian non-commissioned officers and soldiers. Responsibility for prosecuting the war was given to Sudanese military intelligence. Nevertheless, in the middle months of 2003, rebels won 34 of 38 engagements. In May, the SLA destroyed a battalion at [[Kutum]], killing 500 and taking 300 prisoners; in mid-July, 250 were killed in a second attack on Tine. The SLA began to infiltrate farther east, threatening to extend the war into [[Kordofan]].

Given that the army was consistently losing, the war effort switched to emphasize three elements: military intelligence, the air force and the [[Janjaweed]]. The latter were armed [[Baggara]] herders whom the government had used to suppress a [[Masalit people|Masalit]] uprising from 1986 to 1999. The Janjaweed became the center of the new [[counter-insurgency]] strategy. Though the government consistently denied supporting them, military resources were poured into Darfur and the Janjaweed were outfitted as a paramilitary force, complete with communication equipment and some artillery. The military planners were aware of the probable consequences of such a strategy: similar methods undertaken in the [[Nuba Mountains]] and around the southern oil fields during the 1990s had resulted in massive human rights violations and [[forced displacement]]s.{{sfn|Flint|de Waal|2005|pp=60, 101–103}}

===2004–2005===
In 2004, Chad brokered negotiations in [[N'Djamena]], leading to the [[April 8 Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement]] between the Sudanese government, the JEM, and the SLA. One group that did not participate in the April cease-fire talks or agreement, the [[National Movement for Reform and Development]], split from the JEM in April. Janjaweed and rebel attacks continued despite the ceasefire, and the [[African Union]] (AU) formed a [[Ceasefire Commission]] (CFC) to monitor its observance.

[[File:Refugee camp Chad.jpg|thumb|Darfur refugee camp in Chad, 2005]]
In August, the African Union sent 150 [[Rwanda]]n troops to protect the ceasefire monitors. However, it soon became apparent that 150 troops would not be enough, and they were subsequently joined by 150 [[Nigeria]]n troops.

On 18 September the [[United Nations Security Council]] issued [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564|Resolution 1564]] declaring that the Sudan government had not met its commitments and expressing concern at helicopter attacks and assaults by the Janjaweed. It welcomed the intention of the African Union to enhance its monitoring mission and urged all member states to support such efforts.

During April 2005, after the Sudan government signed a ceasefire agreement with [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] which led to the end of the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], the [[African Union Mission in Sudan]] (AMIS) force was increased by 600 troops and 80 military observers. In July, the force was increased by about 3,300 (with a budget of 220 million dollars). In April 2005, AMIS was increased to about 7,000.

The scale of the crisis led to warnings of an imminent disaster, with [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] warning about the risk of genocide. The scale of the Janjaweed campaign led to comparisons with the [[Rwandan Genocide]], a parallel denied by the Sudanese government. Independent observers noted that the tactics, which included dismemberment and killing of noncombatants, including young children and infants, were more akin to the [[ethnic cleansing]] used in the [[Yugoslav wars]] and warned that the region's remoteness meant that hundreds of thousands of people were effectively cut off from aid. The Brussels-based [[International Crisis Group]] had reported in May 2004 that over 350,000 people could potentially die as a result of [[starvation]] and disease.&lt;ref name="Dozens killed"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3741875.stm 'Dozens killed' in Sudan attack] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201025316/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3741875.stm |date=1 December 2005 }} (BBC) 24 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Some warned that the humanitarian situation could deteriorate to levels seen in 2003 and 2004, when UN officials called Darfur the world's worst humanitarian crisis.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;

In late 2006, Darfur Arabs started their own rebel group, the Popular Forces Troops, and announced on 6 December that they had repulsed an assault by the Sudanese army at Kas-Zallingi the previous day. They were the latest of numerous Darfur Arab groups to oppose the government since 2003, some of which had signed political accords with rebel movements.

The same period saw an example of a tribe-based split within the Arab forces, when relations between the farming [[Terjem]] and nomadic, camel-herding [[Mahria]] tribes became tense. Terjem leaders accused the Mahria of kidnapping a Terjem boy, while Mahria leaders said the Terjem had been stealing their animals. Ali Mahamoud Mohammed, the wali, or governor, of South Darfur, said the fighting began in December when the Mahria drove their camels south in a seasonal migration, trampling through Terjem territory near the [[Bulbul River]]. Fighting resumed in July 2007.&lt;ref name="jg9307"&gt;Gettleman, Jeffrey, "[https://archive.is/20140324162509/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/world/africa/03darfur.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Chaos in Darfur on rise as Arabs fight with Arabs] ", news article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 September 2007, pp 1, A7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioner's statement maintained that "contrary to the government’s claim, it appears that the Sudanese Armed Forces launched a deliberate and unprovoked attack on civilians and their property in Sirba," and that this also involved "extensive and wanton destruction and looting of civilian property".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article18893 "Army attack against Darfur civilians was unprovoked – UN"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423121429/http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article18893 |date=23 April 2016 }}, ''[[Sudan Tribune]]'', 25 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months through August, Arab tribes that had worked together in the Janjaweed militia began falling out among themselves, and further splintered.

* Revolutionary Democratic Forces Front, led by Salah Abu Surrah
* United Revolutionary Force Front, led by Alhadi Agabeldour
* Sudan Liberation Movement–G19, led by Khamees Abdullah
* Sudan Federal Democratic Alliance, led by Ahmed Ibrahim Diraige

The following groups did not attend:
* [[Justice and Equality Movement]], led by Khalil Ibrahim; they object to the presence of rebel groups they say had no constituency and no place at the table.
* Sudan Liberation Movement (Abdel Wahed), led by Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur; the group has few forces, but its leader is highly respected; refused to attend until a force was deployed to stem the Darfur violence.
* Sudan Liberation Movement–Unity, originally led by Abdallah Yehya, includes many other prominent figures (Sherif Harir, Abu Bakr Kadu, Ahmed Kubur); the group with the largest number of rebel fighters; object for the same reason as JEM.
* Ahmed Abdel Shafi, a notable rebel enjoying strong support from the [[Fur tribe]].

Faced with a boycott from the most important rebel factions, the talks were rebranded as an "advanced consultation phase", with official talks likely to start in November or December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7066792.stm |work=BBC News | title=Struggle to salvage Darfur talks | date=29 October 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudanese troops backed by tanks, artillery, and helicopter gunships were immediately deployed to Omdurman, and fighting raged for several hours. After seizing the strategic military airbase at Wadi-Sayedna, the Sudanese soldiers eventually defeated the rebels.

By late afternoon, Sudanese TV claimed that the rebels had been "completely repulsed", while showing live images of burnt vehicles and corpses on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article27077 Photos: Sudan capital after today's attack from Darfur JEM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416090457/http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article27077 |date=16 April 2016 }}, ''Sudan Tribune'' 10 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The government imposed a curfew in Khartoum from 5&amp;nbsp;pm to 6&amp;nbsp;am, while aid agencies told their workers in the capital to stay indoors.

Some 93 soldiers and 13 policemen were killed along with 30 civilians in the attack on Khartoum and Omdurman. Sudanese forces confirmed that they found the bodies of 90 rebels and had spotted dozens more strewn outside the city limits. While Sudanese authorities claimed that up to 400 rebels could have been killed, the rebels stated that they lost 45 fighters dead or wounded. Sudanese authorities also claimed to have destroyed 40 rebel vehicles and captured 17.

[[Martin Luther Agwai|General Martin Agwai]], head of the joint African Union-United Nations mission in Darfur, said the war was over in the region, although low-level disputes remained. There was still "Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level.

In December 2010, representatives of the [[Liberation and Justice Movement]], an umbrella organisation of ten rebel groups formed in February 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/EXCLUSIVE-Darfur-new-rebel-group,34301|title=Darfur new rebel group announces formation of its structure|publisher=sudantribune.com|date=3 March 2010|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; started a fresh round of talks with the Sudanese Government in [[Doha]].

In January 2011, the leader of the Liberation and Justice Movement, Dr. Tijani Sese, stated that the movement had accepted the core proposals of the Darfur peace document as proposed by the mediators in Doha. The proposals included a $300,000,000 compensation package for victims of atrocities in Darfur and special courts to conduct trials of persons accused of human rights violations. Proposals for a new Darfur Regional Authority were included. This authority would have an executive council of 18 ministers and would remain in place for five years. The current three Darfur states and state governments would continue to exist during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/doha-darfur-peace-proposals-accepted-by-ljm-rebel-coalition|title=DOHA: Darfur peace proposals accepted by LJM rebel coalition|work=Radiodabanga.org|date=4 January 2011|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1609145.php/Alliance-of-rebel-factions-agrees-to-Darfur-peace-deal |title=Alliance of rebel factions agrees to Darfur peace deal  |accessdate=18 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227031152/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1609145.php/Alliance-of-rebel-factions-agrees-to-Darfur-peace-deal |archivedate=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, the Sudanese Government rejected the idea of a single region headed by a vice-president from the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shrig.org.sd/news-archive/darfur-news/2744-office-of-vp-must-meet-national-standards-says-el-haj-adam.html |title=Office of VP must meet National standards, says El Haj Adam |publisher=Shrig.org.sd |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127093212/http://www.shrig.org.sd/news-archive/darfur-news/2744-office-of-vp-must-meet-national-standards-says-el-haj-adam.html |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, the LJM and JEM leaders issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to the Doha negotiations and intention to attend the Doha forum on 5 February. The Sudanese government postponed decision to attend the forum due to beliefs that an internal peace process without the involvement of rebel groups might be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Kinzer |url=http://www.sudanjem.com/2011/01/end-human-rights-imperialism-now/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716161530/http://www.sudanjem.com/2011/01/end-human-rights-imperialism-now/ |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=End human rights imperialism now |publisher=Sudanjem.com |date=24 January 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in February, the Sudanese Government agreed to return to Doha with a view to complete a new peace agreement by the end of that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.190.28.213/node/9451 |title=Radiodabanga.org |publisher=195.190.28.213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February, both LJM and JEM announced that they had rejected the peace document proposed by the mediators in Doha. The main sticking points were the issues of a Darfuri vice-president and compensation for victims. The Sudanese government did not comment on the peace document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.190.28.213/node/9880 |title=Radiodabanga.org |publisher=195.190.28.213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March, it was announced that two more states would be established in Darfur: [[Central Darfur]] around [[Zalingei]] and Eastern Darfur around [[Ed Daein]]. The rebel groups protested and stated that this was a bid to further divide Darfur's influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7270CL20110308?sp=true | work=Reuters | title=Darfur to be cut into smaller states; rebel protest | date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advising both the LJM and JEM during the Doha peace negotiations was the [[Public International Law &amp; Policy Group]] (PILPG). Led by Dr. [[Paul Williams (professor)|Paul Williams]] and Matthew T. Simpson, PILPG's team provided legal support.

In June, a new [[Darfur Peace Agreement (2011)]] was proposed by the Doha mediators. This agreement was to supersede the [[Darfur Peace Agreement#Abuja Agreement (2006)|Abuja Agreement]] of 2005 and when signed, would halt preparations for a Darfur status referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/under-peace-deal-sudan-would-halt-prep-for-darfur-referendum |title=Under peace deal, Sudan would halt prep for Darfur Referendum |publisher=Radio Dabanga }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed document included provisions for a Darfuri Vice-President and an administrative structure that included three [[States of Sudan|states]] and a strategic regional authority, the [[Darfur Regional Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/IMG/pdf/DPA-_Doha_draft.pdf|title=Draft Darfur Peace Document (DDPD)|publisher=sudantribune.com|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was signed by the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement on 14 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudan-and-LJM-rebels-sign-a-Darfur,39539|title=Sudan and LJM rebels sign a Darfur peace agreement in Doha|newspaper=Sudan Tribune|date=15 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114095907/http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudan-and-LJM-rebels-sign-a-Darfur,39539|archivedate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A donors conference in Doha pledged US$3.6 billion to help rebuild Darfur. The conference was criticised in the region that the Sudan Liberation Army (Minni Minnawi) rebels had taken. According to the group's Hussein Minnawi, Ashma village and another town were close to the [[South Darfur]] capital of [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/04/201348154046637836.html |title=Rebels inch closer to South Darfur capital – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April, following weeks of fighting, a coalition that included SLA and JEM said that they had taken [[Um Rawaba]] in North Kordofan, outside Darfur, and that they were headed for Khartoum to topple the president. The head of an SLA faction, Abdel Wahid Mohammed al-Nur, called it "a significant shift in the war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/04/2013427143845319920.html |title=Sudan city stormed by Darfur rebels – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 300,000 were displaced by violence from January through May.&lt;ref name=rages /&gt;

In North Darfur, the [[Rezeigat]] tribe and the Beni Hussein group signed a peace deal during July after an eruption of violence between the two groups killed hundreds. Later in July, the [[Misseriya]] and Salamat Arab tribes announced a ceasefire after battles killed over 200 people. The UN security counsel also announced a review of its UNAMID mission.&lt;ref name=rages /&gt;

During the first week of August, the [[Maalia]] claimed the Rezeigat had killed five members of their tribe in the southeastern region of Adila. They responded by seizing 400 Rizeigat cattle on 6 August. Community leaders intervened to prevent escalation. When the Maalia failed to return the cattle, violence broke out on 10 August.&lt;ref name=SudanTribune&gt;{{cite news|title=More than 100 killed in tribal conflict in South Darfur|date=12 August 2013|work=Sudan Tribune|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article47620|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rezeigat attacked and reportedly destroyed a Maaliya compound.&lt;ref name=rages /&gt; In the battle, 77 Maaliya and 36 Rezeigat were killed, and another 200 people were injured.&lt;ref name=SudanTribune /&gt; Both sides said Land Cruiser vehicles were used in the battle.

On 19 March, peacekeepers said they had received recent reports of villages that were attacked and burned after the UN expressed concern over the increasing number of internally displaced persons. UNAMID said that the attacks were in Hashaba, about 100 kilometers north-west of the city [[Al-Fashir]], the state capital of [[North Darfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Villages attacked in Sudan's Darfur: UNAMID|date=19 March 2014|publisher=The Daily Star|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Mar-19/250730-villages-attacked-in-sudans-darfur-unamid.ashx#axzz2uAA4pFGD|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, local media reported that 200 women and girls had been raped by Sudanese soldiers in [[Tabit (town)|Tabit]]. Sudan denied it and did not permit the UN (who said their first inquiry was inconclusive "in part due to the heavy presence of military and police") to make another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/04/us-sudan-darfur-un-rape-idUSKCN0JI2FW20141204|title=Sudan says no rapes in Darfur village, U.N. wants further inquiry|work=[[Reuters]]|date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) released in February said 221 were raped by government soldiers in "a mass rape that could constitute crimes against humanity".

Most of the town's population are Fur people. It had been controlled by rebel forces previously but HRW found no evidence that the rebel fighters were in or close to the village when it was attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/11/mass-rape-darfur-sudan-human-rights-watch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211182532/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/11/mass-rape-darfur-sudan-human-rights-watch|archivedate=2015-02-11|title='True hell' of mass rape in Darfur revealed in report on Sudan|work=[[theguardian.com]]|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3,300 villages were destroyed in 2014 in attacks on civilians according to the UN Panel of Experts. Government forces or those aligned with them were behind most attacks. There were more than 400,000 attacks during the first ten months of the year. The report said that it was "highly probable that civilian communities were targeted as a result of their actual or perceived affiliations with armed opposition groups" and that "such attacks were carried out with impunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/un-3-300-villages-destroyed-sudan-fighting-early-171904311.html?ref=gs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003200935/https://www.yahoo.com/news/un-3-300-villages-destroyed-sudan-fighting-early-171904311.html?ref=gs|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 October 2016|title=UN: 3,300 villages destroyed in Sudan fighting in 2014|work=[[Yahoo News]]|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Janjaweed participation==
[[File:Villages destroyed in the Darfur Sudan 2AUG2004.jpg|thumb|Destroyed villages (August 2004)]]
The well armed Janjaweed quickly gained an advantage over rebel factions. By the spring of 2004, several thousand people – mostly from the non-Arab population – had been killed and as many as a million more had been driven from their homes, causing a major humanitarian crisis. The crisis took on an international dimension when over 100,000 refugees poured into neighboring [[Chad]], pursued by militiamen who clashed with Chadian government forces along the border. More than 70 militiamen and 10 Chadian soldiers were killed in one gun battle in April. A United Nations observer team reported that non-Arab villages were singled out, while Arab villages were left untouched:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 23 Fur villages in the Shattaya Administrative Unit have been completely depopulated, looted and burnt to the ground (the team observed several such sites driving through the area for two days). Meanwhile, dotted alongside these charred locations are unharmed, populated and functioning Arab settlements. In some locations, the distance between a destroyed Fur village and an Arab village is less than 500 meters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/un-inter-agency-fact-finding-and-rapid-assessment-mission-kailek-town-south-darfur United Nations Inter-Agency Fact Finding and Rapid Assessment Mission: Kailek Town, South Darfur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003193154/http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/un-inter-agency-fact-finding-and-rapid-assessment-mission-kailek-town-south-darfur |date=3 October 2016 }}, United Nations Resident Coordinator, 25 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2011 study examined 1,000 interviews with black African participants who fled from 22 village clusters to various refugee camps in 2003 and 2004. The study found: 1) the frequency of hearing racial epithets during an attack was 70% higher when it was led by the Janjaweed alone compared to official police forces; it was 80% higher when the Janjaweed and the Sudanese Government attacked together; 2) the risk of displacement was nearly 110% higher during a joint attack compared to when the police or Janjaweed acted alone, and 85% higher when Janjaweed forces attacked alone compared to when the attack was only perpetrated by government forces; 3) attacks on food and water supplies made it 129% more likely for inhabitants to be displaced compared to attacks that involved house burnings or killings; 4) perpetrators knew and took "special advantage" of the susceptibility of Darfur residents to attacks focused on basic resources. This vulnerability came against the backdrop of increased regional desertification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/darfur-sources-genocide/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111220075901/http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/darfur-sources-genocide/|archivedate = 2011-12-20 |title = Displaced and Dispossessed of Darfur: Explaining Sources of Genocide |publisher = Journalist's Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] estimate that there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to [[starvation]]. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticized, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence.&lt;ref name="How many have died"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Russell|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4268733.stm|title=How many have died in Darfur?|publisher=BBC|date=16 February 2005|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent British Parliamentary Report estimated that over 300,000 people had died,&lt;ref name="death toll may be 300,000"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Madeline|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30582172.htm|title=Darfur death toll may be 300,000, say UK lawmakers|agency=Reuters|date=30 March 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050421141330/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30582172.htm|archivedate=21 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have estimated even more.

In March 2005, the UN's [[Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|Emergency Relief Coordinator]] [[Jan Egeland]] estimated that 10,000 were dying each month excluding deaths due to ethnic violence.&lt;ref name="death estimate soars"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4349063.stm|title=UN's Darfur death estimate soars|publisher=BBC|date=14 March 2005|access-date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 2.7 million people had at that time been displaced from their homes, mostly seeking refuge in camps in Darfur's major towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/178659/5-un-peacekeepers-killed-in-darfur-attacks/|title=GMA News, 5 UN Peacekeepers Killed in Darfur Attacks|publisher=Gmanews.tv|agency=Associated Press|date=12 June 2009|access-date=24 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207115131/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/178659/5-un-peacekeepers-killed-in-darfur-attacks|archivedate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hundred thousand had fled to neighboring Chad.

In May 2005, the [[Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters]] (CRED) of the School of Public Health of the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] in Brussels, Belgium published an analysis of mortality in Darfur. Their estimate stated that from September 2003 to January 2005, between 98,000 and 181,000 persons had died in Darfur, including 63,000 to 146,000 excess deaths.&lt;ref name="Darfur: Counting the Deaths: Mortality Estimates from Multiple Survey Data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedat.be/sites/default/files/ID%20214%20-%20Counting%20the%20death%20(2).pdf |title=Microsoft Word – Letters9 |format=PDF |access-date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Dr. Eric Reeves argued that total mortality from all violent causes, direct and indirect, at that point in the conflict, exceeded 500,000. His analysis took account of all previous mortality data and studies, including that by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster.&lt;ref&gt;http://sudanreeves.org/2010/08/07/quantifying-genocide-darfur-mortality-update-august-6-2010/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quantifying Genocide in Darfur"&gt;[http://www.sudanreeves.org/Article102.html Quantifying Genocide in Darfur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728071750/http://www.sudanreeves.org/Article102.html |date=28 July 2011 }} Dr. [[Eric Reeves]], 28 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN disclosed on 22 April 2008 that it might have underestimated the Darfur death toll by nearly 50%.&lt;ref name="bodycount"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.N.: 100,000 more dead in Darfur than reported|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/04/22/darfur.holmes/index.html?eref=rss_topstories|publisher=CNN|date=22 April 2008|access-date=22 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' published an op-ed stating that many of the published mortality rates have been misleading because they include a large number of people who had died of disease and malnutrition, as well as those who died from direct violence.&lt;ref name="The genocide in Darfur is not what it seems"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0819/p09s02-coop.html The Genocide in Darfur is not what it seems] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826150002/http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0819/p09s02-coop.html |date=26 August 2009 }} Dr. [[Marc Gustafson]], 19 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the [[Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters]] published an article in a special issue of ''[[The Lancet]]''. The article, entitled "Patterns of mortality rates in Darfur conflict", estimated with 95% confidence that the excess number of deaths is between 178,258 and 461,520 (with a mean of 298,271), with 80% of these due to disease.&lt;ref name = "thelancet1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2961967-X/abstract |title=Patterns of mortality rates in Darfur conflict |journal=[[The Lancet]] | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61967-X |volume=375 |pages=294–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bush-un-darfur.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] speaking to the [[UN General Assembly]] on the crisis in Darfur, September 21, 2004]] 
International attention to the Darfur genocide largely began with reports by [[Amnesty International]] in July 2003 and the [[International Crisis Group]] in December 2003. However, widespread media coverage did not start until the outgoing United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, [[Mukesh Kapila]], called Darfur the "world's greatest humanitarian crisis" in March 2004.&lt;ref name="Prunier1"&gt;Prunier, pp. 124–148&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition]], later under the umbrella of [[Genocide Intervention Network]], and the [[Save Darfur Coalition]] emerged and became particularly active in the areas of engaging the United States Congress and President on the issue and pushing for divestment, initially launched by [[Adam Sterling]] under the auspices of the Sudan Divestment Task Force.

===International Criminal Court===
In March 2005, the [[UN Security Council]] formally referred the situation in Darfur to the [[Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court]], taking into account the report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, authorized by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564]] of 2004, but without mentioning specific crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFwayback |date=20080625002301 |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/N0529273.darfureferral.eng.pdf |title=Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005) }} {{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/N0529273.darfureferral.eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122044650/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/N0529273.darfureferral.eng.pdf |archivedate=22 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two permanent members of the Security Council, the [[United States]] and [[China]], abstained from the vote on the referral resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050401230810/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8351.doc.htm Security Council Refers Situation in Darfur, Sudan, to Prosecutor of International Criminal Court], UN Press Release SC/8351, 31 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, the Judges of the [[International Criminal Court]] issued arrest warrants against the former Minister of State for the Interior, [[Ahmed Haroun]], and a Janjaweed leader, [[Ali Kushayb]], for [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-ST20080605-ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813022926/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-ST20080605-ENG.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }} [http://www.icc-cpi.int/ International Criminal Court]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223003009/http://www.icc-cpi.int/ |date=23 December 2016 }}, 5 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Sudan Government said that the ICC had no jurisdiction to try Sudanese citizens and that it would not surrender the two men.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6402363.stm Sudan defiant on Darfur suspects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072923/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6402363.stm |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[BBC]], 27 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2008, the Prosecutor filed ten charges of war crimes against Sudan's incumbent President [[Omar al-Bashir]], including three counts of [[genocide]], five of crimes against humanity and two of [[murder]]. The Prosecutor claimed that Mr. al-Bashir "masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part" three tribal groups in Darfur because of their [[ethnicity]]. Leaders from three Darfur tribes sued ICC prosecutor [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] for libel, defamation, and igniting hatred and tribalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2008-09/14/03.shtml |title=IslamOnline.net- News |publisher=Islamonline |date=14 September 2008 |accessdate=2 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919140604/http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2008-09/14/03.shtml |archivedate=19 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an arrest warrant was issued for the Sudanese president in March 2009, the Prosecutor appealed to add genocide charges. However, the Pre-Trial Chamber found that there was no reasonable ground to support the contention that he had a specific intent to commit genocide (''dolus specialis''), which is an intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a protected group. The definition adopted by the Pre-Trial Chamber is the definition of the [[Genocide Convention]], the [[Rome Statute]], and some [[ICTY]] cases. On 3 February 2010 the Appeals Chamber of the ICC found that the Pre-Trial Chamber had applied "an erroneous standard of proof when evaluating the evidence submitted by the Prosecutor" and that the Prosecutor's application for a warrant of arrest on the genocide charges should be sent back to the Pre-Trial Chamber to review based on the correct legal standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/6670DB89-C6FF-45D4-8936-FF3F228FD961.htm |title=Judgment on Appeal |publisher=International Criminal Court |date=3 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616090621/http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/6670DB89-C6FF-45D4-8936-FF3F228FD961.htm|archivedate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, al-Bashir was charged with three counts of genocide in Darfur by the [[International Criminal Court]] for orchestrating the Darfur genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/From-the-news-wires/2010/0712/Omar-al-Bashir-charged-by-Hague-for-orchestrating-Darfur-genocide |title=Omar al-Bashir charged by Hague for orchestrating Darfur genocide |publisher=CSMonitor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Bashir was the first incumbent [[head of state]] charged with crimes under the Rome Statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7500437.stm |title= Bashir move bold but problematic |accessdate=15 July 2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=14 July 2008 |first=Paul |last=Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the charges and said, "Whoever has visited Darfur, met officials and discovered their ethnicities and tribes ... will know that all of these things are lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL1417202620080714 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207191835/https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL1417202620080714 |archivedate=2008-12-07 |title=ICC prosecutor seeks arrest of Sudan's Bashir |accessdate=15 July 2008 |publisher=Reuters |date=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected that al-Bashir will not face trial in [[The Hague]] until he is apprehended in a nation which accepts ICC jurisdiction, as Sudan is not a party to the Rome Statute, which it signed but did not ratify.&lt;ref name="Guardian-2008-jul-14"&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Walker|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/14/sudan.warcrimes1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006184851/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/14/sudan.warcrimes1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews|archivedate=2008-10-06 |title=Darfur genocide charges for Sudanese president|accessdate=15 July 2008 |work=The Guardian |date=14 July 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at [[McGill University]] in Montreal and a former war crimes prosecutor, says although he may not go to trial, "He will effectively be in prison within the Sudan itself...Al-Bashir now is not going to be able to leave the Sudan without facing arrest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sudanese president charged with genocide |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/07/14/bashir-icc-charges.html |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=14 July 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prosecutor warned that authorities could arrest the President if he enters international airspace.

Since the warrant, he has visited Qatar and Egypt. The [[African Union]] also condemned the charges.

Some analysts think that the ICC indictment is counterproductive and harms the peace process. Only days after the ICC indictment, al-Bashir expelled 13 international aid organizations from Darfur and disbanded three domestic aid organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123655809808566323 |title=Darfur aid agencies leave after expulsion by Sudan |publisher=WSJ |date=9 March 2009 |first=Joe |last=Lauria}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the expulsions, conditions in the displaced camps deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/23/world/africa/23darfur.html |first1=Lyndsey |last1=Addario |first2=Lydia |last2=Polgreen |title=Aids groups expulsions, fear of more misery |newspaper=New York Times |date=22 March 2009}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/left-behind |first=Rebecca |last=Hamilton |title=Left behind: Why aid for Darfur's rape survivors has all but disappeared |publisher=TNR |date=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous ICC indictments, such as the arrest warrants of the LRA leadership in the ongoing war in northern Uganda, were also accused of harming peace processes by criminalizing one side of a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/90001/90780/91343/6460733.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310052533/http://en.people.cn/90001/90780/91343/6460733.html |archivedate=2016-03-10 |title=Not to meddle in Sudan's peace process – People's Daily Online |work=People's Daily |accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign support for the Sudanese government===
Al-Bashir sought the assistance of non-western countries after the West, led by America, imposed sanctions against him. He said, "From the first day, our policy was clear: To look eastward, toward China, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Korea and Japan, even if the Western influence upon some [of these] countries is strong. We believe that the Chinese expansion was natural because it filled the space left by Western governments, the United States, and international funding agencies. The success of the Sudanese experiment in dealing with China without political conditions or pressures encouraged other African countries to look toward China."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1916262-5,00.html|title=Omar al-Bashir Q&amp;A: 'In Any War, Mistakes Happen on the Ground'|date=14 August 2009|newspaper=TIME|author=Sam Dealey|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sarah Wykes]], a senior campaigner at [[Global Witness]], an NGO that campaigns for better natural resource governance, says: "Sudan has purchased about $100m in arms from China and has used these weapons against civilians in Darfur."&lt;ref name="wash-investchina" /&gt;

According to the report [http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/fileadmin/docs/working-papers/HSBA-WP32-Arms-Tracing.pdf Following the Thread: Arms and Ammunition Tracing in Sudan and South Sudan], released in May 2014 by the Swiss research group [[Small Arms Survey]], "Over the period 2001–12, Khartoum’s reports to UN Comtrade reveal significant fluctuation in annual conventional arms imports. The majority of the Sudanese government’s total self-reported imports of small arms and light weapons, their ammunition, and ‘conventional weapons’ over the period originated in [[China]] (58 per cent), followed by [[Iran]] (13 per cent), [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] (9 per cent), and [[Ukraine]] (8 per cent)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/fileadmin/docs/working-papers/HSBA-WP32-Arms-Tracing.pdf|title=Following the Thread: Arms and Ammunition Tracing in Sudan and South Sudan|last=Leff|first=Jonah|date=May 2014|work=|last2=LeBrun|first2=Emile|page=24|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that Chinese weapons were pervasive among most parties to the Sudanese conflicts, including the war in Darfur, but identified few if any weapons of Russian origin. (The section "Chinese weapons and ammunition" receives 20 pages in the report, whereas the only mention of Russian arms is to be found in the sentence "the majority of...mines [in South Sudan] have been of Chinese and Soviet/Russian origin.").

China and Russia denied they had broken UN sanctions. China has a close relationship with Sudan and increased its military co-operation with the government in early 2007. Because of Sudan's plentiful supply of oil, China considers good relations with Sudan to be a strategic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L08646701.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215011050/http://mobile.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L08646701.htm|archivedate=2007-12-15|title=China, Russia breach Darfur arms embargo: Amnesty|date=8 May 2007|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6632959.stm|title=China, Russia deny weapons breach|date=8 May 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-sudan9may09,1,3436998.story?track=rss|title=Amnesty International criticizes arms sales to Sudan|date=9 May 2007|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=25 May 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has direct commercial interests in Sudan's oil.

===Criticism of international response===
[[Gérard Prunier]], a scholar specializing in African conflicts, argued that the world's most powerful countries have limited themselves to expressing concern and demand for the United Nations to take action. The UN, lacking funding and military support of the wealthy countries, initially left the African Union to deploy a token force without a mandate to protect civilians.&lt;ref name="Prunier1" /&gt;

On 16 October 2006, [[Minority Rights Group International|Minority Rights Group]] (MRG) published a critical report, challenging that the UN and the [[great power]]s could have prevented the crisis and that few lessons appeared to have been drawn from the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. MRG's executive director, Mark Lattimer, stated that: "this level of crisis, the killings, rape and displacement could have been foreseen and avoided ... Darfur would just not be in this situation had the UN systems got its act together after Rwanda: their action was too little too late."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=136&amp;art_id=iol1160956523318B235 "UN could have averted Darfur crisis – MRG"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208120656/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=136&amp;art_id=iol1160956523318B235 |date=8 December 2008 }}, ''Independent Online'', 16 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 120 genocide survivors of [[The Holocaust]], and the [[Khmer Rouge period (1975–1979)|Cambodian]] and Rwandan Genocides, backed by six aid agencies, submitted an open letter to the European Union, calling on them to do more, proposing a UN peacekeeping force as "the only viable option."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6069600.stm "Darfur call by genocide survivors"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305142806/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6069600.stm |date=5 March 2016 }}, ''[[BBC]]'', 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
''[[Watchers of the Sky]]'', a 2014 documentary by [[Edet Belzberg]], interviews former journalist and [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] [[Samantha Power]] about the war in Darfur. Also featured is [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], former [[International Criminal Court|ICC]] [[jurist]] and lead prosecutor on the [[International Criminal Court investigation in Darfur|ICC investigation in Darfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 'Watchers of the Sky' and the Full Cruelty of Consciousness|url = http://www.popmatters.com/review/187147-watchers-of-the-sky-defining-genocide/|website = PopMatters|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Watchers of the Sky {{!}} Film Review {{!}} Slant Magazine|url = http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/watchers-of-the-sky|website = Slant Magazine|accessdate = 2015-11-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Webby Award''' is an [[List of prizes, medals and awards|award for excellence]] on the [[Internet]] presented annually by The [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]], a judging body composed of over two thousand industry experts and technology innovators. Categories include [[websites]]; advertising and media; online film and video; mobile sites and apps; and social.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Two winners are selected in each category, one by members of The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, and one by the public who cast their votes during Webby People’s Voice voting.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; Each winner presents a five-word acceptance speech, a trademark of the annual awards show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castillo|first1=Michelle|title=The Most Memorable 5-Word Webby Award Speeches Expressing gratitude in sound bites|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/most-memorable-5-word-webby-award-speeches-157864|publisher=AdWeek|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:WebbyAwards-2008-ChocolateRain.jpg|thumb|2008 Webby Awards, [[Chocolate Rain]].]]

The Webby Awards began in 1996, sponsored by the Academy of Web Design and [[Cool Site of the Day]]. The first Webby Awards were produced by Kay Dangaard at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel as a nod to  the first site of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Oscars). That first year, they were called "Webbie" Awards. The first "Site of the Year" winner was the pioneer webisodic serial [[The Spot]].

Today's Webby Awards were founded by [[Tiffany Shlain]] when she was hired by ''The Web Magazine'' to re-establish them. The event was held in San Francisco from 1996 to 2004 and quickly became known for their "5 word Acceptance Speeches". After the first year the awards became more successful than the magazine and IDG closed the publication. Shlain continued to run The Webby Awards with the help of Maya Draisin until 2004.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.webbyawards.com/about/history.php |title=Webby History |publisher=Webby Awards |date= |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/07/news/cl-48818 |title=From the Valley of the Geeks Comes the Digital Diva |first=Booth |last=Moore |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher = [[LA Times]] |accessdate = 2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]], which selects the winners of The Webby Awards, was established in 1998 by co-founders [[Tiffany Shlain]], Spencer Ante and Maya Draisin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=127350&amp;page=1 |title = hat Transcript: Internet Expert Tiffany Shlain  |first=James |last=F. |date=September 15, 2000 |publisher=[[NBC]] |accessdate = 2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Academy include [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]], [[Questlove]], Internet inventor [[Vint Cerf]], [[Instagram]]’s Head of Fashion Partnerships [[Eva Chen (editor)|Eva Chen]], comedian [[Jimmy Kimmel]], [[Twitter]] Founder [[Biz Stone]], [[Vice Media]] Co-Founder and CEO [[Shane Smith (journalist)|Shane Smith]], [[Tumblr]]’s [[David Karp]], Director of Harvard’s [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]] [[Susan P.

The Webby Awards is owned and operated by the Webby Media Group, a division of Recognition Media, which also owns and produces the Lovie Awards in Europe and Netted by the Webbys, a daily email publication launched in 2009. David-Michel Davies, CEO of Webby Media Group, current Executive Director of the Webby Awards and co-founder of Internet Week New York, was named Executive Director of the Webby Awards in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/business/media/10award.html |title = After Winning Advertising Awards, an Invitation to Pay for the Trophies  |first=Stephanie |last=Clifford |date=August 9, 2009 |publisher = NY Times |accessdate = 2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomination process ==

During the Call for Entries phase, each entry is rated by Associate Members of the International Academy of Digital Arts &amp; Sciences.

== Ceremony ==

Since 2005, The Webby Awards has been presented in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Webby Awards (April 5, 2005).

The Webbys are famous for limiting recipients to five-word speeches, which are often humorous, although some exceed the limit. In 2005 when accepting his Lifetime Achievement Award, former Vice President [[Al Gore]]'s speech was "Please don't [[Florida election recount|recount]] this vote." He was introduced by [[Vint Cerf]] who used the same format to state, "We all invented the Internet."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/arts/08webb.html

== Criticism ==

The Webbys have been criticized for their pay-to-enter and pay-to-attend policy (winners and nominees also have to pay to attend the award ceremony), and thus for not taking most websites into consideration before distributing their awards.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Chicago Tribune| date=May 14, 2008| &lt;!--url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/may/14/news/chi-hypertext-webbys-0514may14--&gt; url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-05-14/features/0805120221_1_webby-awards-digital-arts-awards-show| title=Critics pour vitriol on Webby Awards| first=Steve| last=Johnson| accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = What?

In response, Webby Awards executive director David-Michel Davies told the Wall Street Journal that entry fees “provide the best and most sustainable model for ensuring that our judging process remains consistent and rigorous and is not dependent on things like sponsorships that can fluctuate from year to year.”&lt;ref name="WSJ09"/&gt;

'''Wildcat Comic Con''' was a [[comic book]] [[convention (meeting)|convention]] held in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], at the [[Pennsylvania College of Technology]]. The conventions name came from the mascot of the Pennsylvania College of Technology.&lt;ref name="wsg020912"/&gt; Wildcat Comic Con placed extra value with educators and librarians and how comic books and graphic novels can be used in the educational fields.&lt;ref name="twg040112"/&gt;

==Programming==
Wildcat Comic Con typically featured an animation film festival, artist alley, author book-signings, author luncheons, cosplay competition, exhibitors, drawing sessions, fan presentations, LAN party, masquerade ball, portfolio reviews, professional presentations, Star Wars impersonators, vendors, video game contests and demonstrations, and workshops.&lt;ref name="wsg020912"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsg112811"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pw041012"/&gt;

== History ==
The convention was the first large scale Comic Con to be held in Central Pennsylvania and the first to be held by a college.&lt;ref name="wsg020912"/&gt; The idea for the convention came from John Weaver, a high school teacher. It was primarily organized by Lisette Ormsbee (director of the Madigan Library) and John Shableski (former comics distributor), neither of which had previous experience hosting an comic convention.&lt;ref name="pw041012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdt041212"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wnep041213"/&gt; The convention evolved from lectures hosted with the local high school to promote Penn College's video game program.&lt;ref name="pw041012"/&gt; Early in the planning of the convention, discussions were held about naming the convention Millionaire Comic-Con (the high schools mascots name), and holding it at [[Williamsport High School]].&lt;ref name="gnrwildcat12"/&gt; Several comic book nights "ComiXnite" were held during the fall at Penn College on Wednesday nights to build interest in the convention.&lt;ref name="gnrwildcat12"/&gt; In the first year the convention provided eighty hours of content.&lt;ref name="pw041012"/&gt; In 2014, the convention held post event programming that included game shows and gaming.&lt;ref name="wsg092514"/&gt;

The convention received financial support from the community in 2013 including a $9,000 grant from the Lycoming County Visitors Bureau (Lycoming County Travel and Tourism Initiative) and $2,250 from the [[Pennsylvania Army National Guard]] (Heroes 4 Higher group).&lt;ref name="pct092413"/&gt; The Lycoming County Visitors Bureau raised its funding from $5,000 in 2012. In 2013 the convention had 38 vendors, an increase from 10 in 2012.&lt;ref name="wsg092913"/&gt; The Lycoming County Visitors Bureau granted $10,000 to Wildcat Comic Con in 2014 for advertising.&lt;ref name="wsg031914"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">'''Women Makes Waves''' is a film festival based in [[Taiwan]] since 1993.&lt;ref name="wmw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmw.com.tw/en/about.php?It=11|title=歡迎光臨台灣 女性影像學會 〈女性電影,女性影展, woman film festival, women film festival, @ Taiwan〉|publisher=wmw.com.tw|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first and only women's film festival in the country.

It is the largest women's film festival in Asia, and predates the ''[[Taipei Film Festival]]'', which was founded in 1998. Since 2005, there is also an annual ''Asian Lesbian Film and Video Festival'' in Taipei,&lt;ref name="DanielsHo2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter W. Daniels|author2=Kong-Chong Ho|author3=Thomas A. Hutton|title=New Economic Spaces in Asian Cities: From Industrial Restructuring to the Cultural Turn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnCsbk_d5G8C&amp;pg=PA82|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-56773-2|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2014, the annual ''[[Taiwan International Queer Film Festival]] (TIQFF)'', the only LGBTQ film festival in Taiwan, which has screenings every autumn in Taipei and two other major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.travelgayasia.com/event/taiwan-international-queer-film-festival/|title=TIQFF 2016|work=Travel Gay Asia|date=2016|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Chinese Women's Cinema: Transnational Contexts'', edited by Lingzhen Wang, it is noted that the initial event at the Huo K'o Gallery in Taipei was called the ''Women's Visual Arts Festival''.&lt;ref name="Wang2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lingzhen Wang|title=Chinese Women's Cinema: Transnational Contexts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KS5FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT160|date=13 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52744-6|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the Taiwanese filmmaker [[Yu-shan Huang]], supported by Lee Yuan-chen and other members of the ''Women Awakening'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Wang2013"/&gt;

The film festival is organized by the [[Taiwan Women's Film Association]] (TFWA) which was established in 1998 with help from the Taiwan government and civic organisations, and was originally known as the Taipei Women's Film Association.&lt;ref name="Wang2013"/&gt;

In 2001, it became the first touring film festival in Taiwan with the aim of reducing the urban-rural divide in access to cinema.

The film festival has screened nearly one thousand international and Taiwanese films, specialising in films of a [[feminist]] perspective, moving beyond the mainstream outlook to focus on voices and issues that are often unheard, explored and delighted in. The organization is also involved in distribution of films and books; it works in education and video training. The members of TWFA are mainly filmmakers, artists and academics of film or gender studies. Highlights from the film festival have also gone on an international tour including to New York.&lt;ref name="taiwanembassy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwanembassy.org/US/NYC/ct.asp?xItem=518020&amp;ctNode=2942&amp;mp=62
