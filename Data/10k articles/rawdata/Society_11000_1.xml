The '''Aja''' are a group of people native to  south-western Benin and south-eastern Togo.&lt;ref name="Asiwaju1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asiwaju|first1=A. I.|title=The Aja-Speaking Peoples of Nigeria: A Note on Their Origins, Settlement and Cultural Adaptation up to 1945|journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute|volume=49|issue=1|year=1979|pages=15|issn=0001-9720|doi=10.2307/1159502}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to oral tradition, the Aja migrated to southern Benin in the 12th or 13th centuries from [[Tado]] on the [[Mono River]], and c. 1600, three brothers, Kokpon, Do-Aklin, and Te-Agdanlin, split the ruling of the region then occupied by the Aja amongst themselves: Kokpon took the capital city of [[Great Ardra]], reigning over the [[Allada]] kingdom; Do-Aklin founded [[Abomey]], which would become capital of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]]; and Te-Agdanlin founded Little Ardra, also known as Ajatche, later called [[Porto Novo]] (literally, "New Port") by Portuguese traders and the current capital city of Benin.

==History==
Those Aja living in Abomey mingled with the local tribe, thus creating a new people known as the [[Fon people|Fon]], or "Dahomey" ethnic group.  This group is now the largest in Benin. Another source claims the Aja were the rulers of [[Dahomey]] ([[Benin]]) until 1893, when the French conquered them. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  Currently, there are approximately 500,000 Ajas in an area straddling the border between Benin and [[Togo]], {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off|order=flip}} long and {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide.

The Aja speak a language known as [[Aja language (Niger-Congo)|Aja-Gbe]], or simply 'Aja'; only 1-5% are literate in their native tongue.  According to one source, ''voodoo'' originated with the Aja. There are three dialects: Tàgóbé (in Togo only), Dògóbè (in Benin only), and Hwègbè (in both countries). Many are trilingual, also speaking French and [[Fon language|Fongbe]], the lingua-franca of southern Benin, while Ewe is spoken as a second language by those Aja living in Togo and Ghana.

Due to severe land shortages in the densely populated Togolese-Beninois border region mentioned above, many Aja have migrated in recent years, seeking arable land for subsistence farming or work in urban centers.  There are a significant number of Aja living throughout the coastal region of Benin and Togo, southern Nigeria and Gabon.  The urban centers of Cotonou, Lome, Lagos and Libreville all have significant Aja migrant populations.

The Aja, Fon, Ewe, Ga-Adangbe accounted for most of the people carried to the Americas from the Bight of Benin, Togo and Ghana in the transatlantic slave trade prior to the late eighteenth century (when Yoruba people became the more common captives from the region).&lt;ref&gt;Paul E.

'''Naga Hills Sign Language''' was a [[village sign language]] of India. Early in the 20th century, a high incidence of deafness was observed among communities of the [[Naga hills]]. A sign language was used by both deaf and hearing members of the community. Ethnologist and political officer [[John Henry Hutton]] wrote:

{{cquote|"As one might expect ... of men without the art of writing, the language of signs has reached a high state of development... To judge how highly developed is this power of communicating by signs, etc., it is necessary only to experience a Naga interpreter's translation of a story or a request told to him in sign language by a dumb man. ... Indeed the writer has known a dumb man make a long and detailed complaint of an assault in which nothing was missing except proper names, and even these were eventually identified by means of the dumb man's description of his assailants' dress and personal appearance."&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6352">'''Antoine Prioré''' (or ''Priore'') (April 10, 1912 – May 9, 1983) was an Italian electric [[engineer]], most well known for inventing a controversial electromagnetic device that he claimed could cure [[cancer]]. Medical experts have dismissed his claims as [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;Camp, John. (1973). ''Magic, Myth and Medicine''. Priory Press Limited. p. 183 "Many other experienced scientists insist that Priore, who has no medical qualifications, is hoodwinking the medical profession as surely as did Elisha Perkins with his Metallic Tractors in the early nineteenth century."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brabyn 1971"&gt;Brabyn, Howard. (1971). ''An a Priori Case for Investigation''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. 20 May, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Prioré was born in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]. Prioré received training in [[electrical engineering]] and was a [[radar]] technician for the [[Italian Navy]]. (Perisse, 1984) He was a prisoner of the [[Nazi Germany|German Nazi]] occupation of [[Bordeaux]], France, until he was rescued by Louis Durand police captain and membre of the French Resistance in 1944. (Bird, 1984)

Priore worked for 25 years (between 1950 and 1975) in [[Bordeaux]], and built a series of [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] devices producing a strong magnetic field of 600 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (60 [[tesla (unit)|mT]]) or more for the purpose of treating cancer and disease.

His last device was funded by the French government with the help of one-time Prime Minister of France [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]]. Prioré also built a large device (M-600) for the purpose of treating people with [[cancer]]. (Graille, 1984)  Prioré reported to have treated a number of animals with cancer with his device, but it broke down before it could be applied to human patients. (Graille, 1984)  Prioré claimed to have cured a number of terminal cancer patients with his earlier devices. (Bird, 1984)  Prioré's research attracted the attention of the French media in 1965 who dubbed it "L'affaire Priore".

In 1965, one event exposed possible foul play in Prioré's experimental research involving "English mice."  Mice with experimental cancers sent to Prioré from the Chester Beatty Institute in England lead to controversy over his research.  After Prioré exposed the mice to radiation from his devices, they were sent back to the Institute.  Scientists from the Institute claimed the mice returned to them were not genuine because they rejected new cancer grafts. One scientist with the Institute, Pierette Chateaurenaud-Duprat, retorted the claim stating the mice showed signs of immunity to the cancers they were originally grafted with. (Graille, 1984)  Prioré's colleagues supported his research until his death in 1983.  Immunologist [[Raymond Pautrizel]] and [[Robert Courier]], former secretary of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], published a series of notes on Prioré's research in the proceedings of the French Academy. (Graille, 1984)  Pautrizel, an apologist, classified Prioré's methodology as immunological in nature, since animals inoculated with deadly doses of parasites were reportedly healed with Prioré radiation.  According to Bird (1984), a supporter, Priore's methodology was also characterized by boosting subjects' immune systems, allowing them to heal themselves of incurable diseases.

Antoine Prioré died on May 9, 1983 of a stroke. (Perisse, 1984)  Jean-Michel Graille, a French journalist, met with Raymond Pautrizel and wrote a book on the Priore affair, ''Dossier Priore''.

==Critical reception==

Prioré was accused of manipulating his scientific data by the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. French journalists also accused Prioré of not understanding his own technique for treating cancer and disease. Prioré never exposed his exact method, believing others would only steal it for themselves. Members of the French Academy of Sciences and media alike seriously questioned the legitimacy of Prioré's research, with many accusing him of fraud. (Graille, 1984)  

The U.S. Office of Naval Research evaluated Prioré's patents. The patents seemed deliberately made unclear, leaving little information to ascertain the mechanical and electromagnetic workings of Prioré's devices.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, J. B. (1978). ''A Biologically Active Combination of Modulated Magnetic and Microwave Fields: The Prioré Machine''. Office of Naval Research, London, Report R-5-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Pierre Aigrain]], the head of the General Delegation for Scientific and Technical Research (DGRST) has written that "the biological effects resulting from the radiation emitted by M Priore's apparatus have no connection with cancer... to speak of a therapeutic apparatus capable of helping the sick is pure romancing."&lt;ref name="Brabyn 1971"/&gt;

Prioré's education has also been called into question. For example, [[Solly Zuckerman, Baron Zuckerman|Solly Zuckerman]] has described Prioré as a "self-taught electrical technician."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, Solly. (1988). ''Monkeys, Men and Missiles''. HarperCollins Publishers. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basseri''' ({{lang-fa|باسری or باصری}}) are a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[nomad]]ic and [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] tribe of the [[Fars Province]] in [[Iran]]. They have formerly been part of the so-called [[Khamseh]] confederation which includes Persian- Turkic- and Arabic-speaking tribes. Their migratory area is around [[Shiraz]]. The "tent" is the basic unit of social organization among the Basseri. All tents have a recognized head that deals with the formal officers of the tribe, villagers, and other strangers. The Basseri economy stems mainly from sheep and goats. 
[[File:Basseri map in Iran.png|thumb|right|Basseries' map in [[Iran]]]]

==Origin==
Basseries are mostly [[Persian people|Persians]] .Their origin is the "Pasargadean" tribe.The Pasargadean tribe was the biggest tribe of [[Persia]] and the tribe who helped [[Cyrus The Great]] constitute the [[Achaemenid Empire]].They named "Karian" tribe in [[Sasanian Empire]] period.They were the relers of some parts of south Persia and the [[Karyan, Fars|Karyan]] city of [[Persia]] cause They helped [[Ardashir I]]  constitute the Sasanian empire.
	
After [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] They were under rule of [[Arabs|Arabic Tribes of South Persia]] ,who migrated to [[Persia]] after its conquest, till the constitute of [[Zand Dynasty]] by [[Karim Khan]].In [[Pahlavi Dynasty|Pahlavi Dynasty period]] They were settled by the government in 1930 and again started to decamp in 1941.After the Land Reformations of Iran ,they were settled in the cities and the villages of [[Fars Province]]; but after some years,They again started decamoing. after the [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]] because of the problems of being nomad including inaccessibility to modern facilities (hospitals,schools ,etc);successive droughts;destruction of the migration path ;etc they again went to cities and the villages of the province for living.&lt;ref&gt;Nomads of Persia:The Basseri tribe.Ehsan Yousefi.2014.Shiraz&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "Basseri" was originally "Wastaryoshan", the commoners of [[Sasanian Empire]] period.&lt;ref&gt;
These four are the three common "Indo-Euoropean" [[Trifunctional hypothesis|social tripartition]] common among ancient Iranian, Indian and Romans with one extra Iranian element (from Yashna xix/17). cf. Frye, p. 54.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why the Middle East Lagged Behind: The Case of Iran|page=72|author=Kāẓim ʻAlamdārī|publisher=University Press of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;a compound of "Wastary" word and "osh" suffix.The "W" phoneme in Wastary alterd to "B" and the "T" phoneme removed due to less energy consumption in talking.therefore the word Shifted to the Basseri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baserionline.ir/?p=106 The Basseri etymology (Persian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
Basseries are [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] but minorities of [[sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] are existed in tribe.They became Muslims after the Arabs invaded Iran almost 1400 years ago. They converted to [[Shi'a|Shi'ism]] following the [[Safavid]] invasion in the 16th century CE. Previously, Basseries were Zoroastrians like the majority of Persians, before the arrival of Islam to the region.
&lt;ref&gt;The Basseri tribe:from Tornas to Lahbaz.Gholamreza Tavakkoli.2000.Tehran&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Basseri seem not to be very familiar with Muslim beliefs, customs, and ceremonies.They do not respect to divisions and events of the Muslim year,Although villagers remind them continually. Basseries pay more attention to life cycle ceremonies than Islamic ceremonies like [[Ramadan]] and [[Moharram]] which are the most important for other Muslims.&lt;ref name="Basseri"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3458001469.html Basseri in encyclopedia of World Cultures]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
The Basseri speak a dialect of [[Persian language|Persian]] in a variety that has maintained some Old Persian words not found in [[modern Persian]]. The majority know only the Basseri dialect, but a few also speak [[Turkish language|Turkish]] or [[Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Nomads of Persia:The Basseri tribe.Ehsan Yousefi.2014.Shiraz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Basseri tribe:from Tornas to Lahbaz.Gholamreza Tavakkoli.2000.Tehran&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words in Basseri dialect are similar to English words.&lt;ref&gt;The Basseri tribe:from Tornas to Lahbaz.Gholamreza Tavakkoli.2000.Tehran&lt;/ref&gt;

== Region ==
[[File:Basseri-Harm.jpg|255px|right|thumb|Basseri summerland in [[Harm Rural District|Harm]], [[Larestan County|Larestan]] and also a view of Hirm Lake]]
The Basseri habitat was originally [[Fars Province|Fars district]]; but big Basseri Communities are also in [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan]], [[Razavi Khorasan Province|Razavi Khorasan]], [[Semnan Province|Semnan]] and [[Tehran Province|Tehran]].
===Migration===
The winter land of the Basseri is in [[Jahrom County|Jahrom]] and north of [[Larestan County]].They stay in [[Marvdasht County|Marvdasht]], [[Pasargad County|Pasargad]] ,and [[Eqlid County|Eqlid]] in summers.
==Tribe hierarchy==
The chief of the Basseri tribe rules through coercive authority. The main functions of the chief are: to allocate pastures and coordinate the migration of the tribes, settle disputes that are brought to him, and represent the tribe or any of its members in politically important dealings with sedentary authorities. Most matters of law are governed by custom and compromise in the Basseri tribe and is regulated by diffuse sanctions. However the chief will serve as a mediator for cases that can't be solved through tradition because of the matters of the case. The chief is not bound by precedent or custom in his decision, and his decision will be based on what he feels is "best for the tribe".{{sfn|Barth|2013}}

The Darbar consist of Basseri tribe members who are closest with the chief and always migrate with him. Within the Darbar there is a personal valet, master of the stores, a groom for the chief's riding horse, a scribe, and a hunting/drinking companion.

==Textile==
[[File:persian rug.jpg|185px|right|thumb|A rug by the Basseri the tribe]]
All packing tools and rugs are locally made, woven by the women.{{sfn|Barth|2013}} Women's clothes are largely sewn from bought material, while male clothing is bought finished.{{sfn|Barth|2013}}

Basseri tribe rugs (see also [[Shiraz rug]]) are asymmetrically knotted, brighter in colours, with more open space and smaller ornaments and figure with Orange as the specific color. The women of the tribe usually make the rugs.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental rugs: a complete guide - Charles W. Jacobsen, C. E. Tuttle Co. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clans==
The Basseri has two great sections called Waysi ({{lang-fa|ویسی}}) and Ali-mirzai ({{lang-fa|علی میرزایی}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baseri-a-pastoral-nomadic-tribe-of-fars-belonging-to-the-kamsa-confederacy Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt; Each section has several clans. Some of the clans are not originally from the Basseri, but are emigrants from other tribes or cities.

The '''Battle of Downing Street''' was a march of [[suffragette]]s to [[Downing Street]], London, on 22 November 1910. Organized by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]'s [[Women's Social and Political Union]], the march took place four days after [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]], a suffragette protest outside the [[House of Commons]] that saw the women violently attacked by police.{{sfn|Bartley|2002|p=125}}&lt;ref name=Times23Nov1910&gt;{{cite news |date=23 November 1910 |title=Suffragist Disturbances |newspaper=The Times |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking place in the context of the debate over the [[Conciliation Bills|Conciliation Bill 1910]] (giving a limited number of women the vote according to property and marital status), the march was a direct response to the statement by the Prime Minister [[H.&amp;nbsp;H. Asquith]] that: "The Government will, if they are still in power, give facilities in the next Parliament for effectively proceeding with a Bill which is framed so as to admit of free amendment", which suggested that the bill would have no chance of being passed.{{sfnm |1a1=Lee |1y=2008 |1p=342 |2a1=Rosen |2y=2013 |2pp=142–143}}

Emmeline and [[Christabel Pankhurst]] were at [[Caxton Hall]] when news arrived of Asquith's speech; Christabel announced to the audience that it was a declaration of war: "The promise for next parliament is an absurd mockery of a pledge. They have been talking of declarations of war. We also declare war from this moment." Emmeline told the crowd: "I am going to Downing Street. Come along, all of you."{{sfn|Purvis|2002|p=151}}

Around 200 women marched on Downing Street, smashing windows at the [[Colonial Office]] and [[Home Office]], and on Asquith's car;{{sfn|Rosen|2013|p=143}} 159 women and three men were arrested, including Emmeline and her sister, [[Mary Jane Clarke|Mary Clarke]]. Clarke was arrested for throwing a stone through the window at [[Canon Row Police Station]], where Emmeline was being held, after the police refused to let Clarke see her.{{sfn|Purvis|2002|pp=151–152}} About 20 women approached [[10 Downing Street]], the prime minister's residence, from the back and swarmed around [[Augustine Birrell]], the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]].{{sfn|Rosen|2013|p=143}} He was "pulled&amp;nbsp;... about and hustled", had his hat knocked off and was left with a twisted knee.{{sfn|Rosen|2013|pp=143–144}} Burrell did not prosecute those responsible, writing to the [[Home Secretary]], [[Winston Churchill]], on 21 February 1911: "Let the matter drop but keep your eye on the hags in question."{{sfn|Rosen|2013|pp=133, 143}}

[[File:BauhausType.jpg|thumb|Typography by [[Herbert Bayer]] above the entrance to the workshop block of the Bauhaus, Dessau, 2005]]

The '''Staatliches Bauhaus''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtaːtlɪçəs ˈbaʊˌhaʊs|lang|Staatliches Bauhaus.oga|listen}}), commonly known as the '''Bauhaus''', was a [[Germany|German]] [[art school]] operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught.&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, pp. 64-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bauhaus was founded by [[Walter Gropius]] in [[Weimar]]. The German term ''[[wikt:Bauhaus#German|Bauhaus]]''—literally "building house"—was understood as meaning "School of Building", but in spite of its name and the fact that its founder was an [[architect]], the Bauhaus did not have an [[architecture]] department during its first years of existence. Nonetheless, it was founded with the idea of creating a "total" work of art ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) in which all arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, [[Modern architecture|Modernist architecture]] and art, design and architectural education.&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=James Stevens Curl |editor=Pevsner, Nikolaus |others=Fleming, John; Honour, Hugh |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=1999 |type=Paperback |edition=5th |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=0-14-051323-X |pages=880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, [[industrial design]], and [[typography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bauhaus Movemen |url=http://www.bauhaus-movement.com/en/ |website=Rethinking the world Art and Technology – A new Unity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school existed in three German cities: [[Weimar]] from 1919 to 1925, [[Dessau]] from 1925 to 1932, and [[Berlin]] from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: [[Walter Gropius]] from 1919 to 1928, [[Hannes Meyer]] from 1928 to 1930, and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=...] |first=[contributors Rachel Barnes |title=The 20th-Century art book. |year=2001 |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0714835420 |edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school, and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it.

[[File:מוזיאון הבאוהאוס1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Bauhaus Museum, Tel Aviv]]]]
{{details|New Objectivity (architecture)}}
Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], the fall of the [[House of Hohenzollern|German monarchy]] and the abolition of censorship under the new, liberal [[Weimar Republic]] allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the [[Russian Revolution]], such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''The Coming of the Third Reich'', p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Just as important was the influence of the 19th century English designer [[William Morris]], who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function.&lt;ref&gt;''Funk and Wagnall's New Encyclopaedia'', Vol 5, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.

However, the most important influence on Bauhaus was [[modernism]], a cultural movement whose origins lay as early as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus—the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that [[mass production]] was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit—were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers' organization [[Deutscher Werkbund]] was formed in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]] to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany's economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).

[[File:Bauhaus Chemnitz hb.JPG|right|thumb|Bauhaus building in [[Chemnitz]]]]
The entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neues Bauen]]. Beginning in June 1907, [[Peter Behrens]]' pioneering [[industrial design]] work for the German electrical company [[AEG]] successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark [[AEG Turbine Factory]], and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] worked for him in this period.

The Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German [[zeitgeist]] had turned from emotional [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]] to the matter-of-fact [[New Objectivity]]. An entire group of working architects, including [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], turned away from fanciful experimentation, and turned toward rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise of a "minimal dwelling" written into the new [[Weimar Constitution]]. [[Ernst May]], Bruno Taut and [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]], among others, built large housing blocks in [[Frankfurt]] and Berlin. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the [[Weissenhof Estate]], films, and sometimes fierce public debate.

===Bauhaus and Vkhutemas===
{{Main article|Vkhutemas}}
The Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in [[Moscow]], has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;{{ru icon}} ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia; Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya'', [https://archive.is/20050503051137/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/304.htm ''Вхутемас'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a basic course in aesthetic principles, courses in [[color theory]], industrial design, and architecture.&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt; Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Paul (1999) ''The Challenge of the Avant-Garde''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]] {{ISBN|0-300-07762-9}}, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; but it was less publicised outside the [[Soviet Union]] and consequently, is less familiar in [[Western culture|the West]].&lt;ref name="Fry1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tony Fry |title=A New Design Philosophy: An Introduction to Defuturing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEc7UGv2xQEC |accessdate=15 May 2011 |date=October 1999 |publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=978-0-86840-753-1 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Colton, Timothy J. (1995) ''Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press {{ISBN|0-674-58749-9}}; p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, [[El Lissitzky]]'s book ''Russia: an Architecture for World Revolution'' published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects there.

==History of the Bauhaus==
===Weimar===
The school was founded by Walter Gropius in [[Weimar]] in 1919, as a merger of the [[Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School]] and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art. Its roots lay in the arts and crafts school founded by the [[William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in 1906, and directed by Belgian [[Art Nouveau]] architect [[Henry van de Velde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=James Stevens Curl |editor=Pevsner, Nikolaus |others=Fleming, John; Honour, Hugh |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=1999 |type=Paperback |edition=5th |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius, [[Hermann Obrist]] and [[August Endell]] as possible successors. In 1919, after delays caused by the destruction of [[World War I]] and a lengthy debate over who should head the institution and the socio-economic meanings of a reconciliation of the [[fine art]]s and the [[applied art]]s (an issue which remained a defining one throughout the school's existence), Gropius was made the director of a new institution integrating the two called the Bauhaus.&lt;ref name="Frampton 1992 124"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frampton |first=Kenneth |title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History |year=1992 |edition=3rd ed. rev. |publisher=Thames and Hudson, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-500-20257-5 |page=124 |chapter=The Bauhaus: Evolution of an Idea 1919–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled ''Exhibition of Unknown Architects'', Gropius proclaimed his goal as being "to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist." Gropius' [[neologism]] ''Bauhaus'' references both building and the Bauhütte, a [[premodern]] [[guild]] of stonemasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Whitford, Frank |title=The Bauhaus: Masters &amp; Students by Themselves |year=1992 |publisher=Conran Octopus |location=London |isbn=1-85029-415-1 |page=32 |quote=He invented the name 'Bauhaus' not only because it specifically referred to bauen ('building', 'construction')—but also because of its similarity to the word Bauhütte, the medieval guild of builders and stonemasons out of which Freemasonry sprang. The Bauhaus was to be a kind of modern Bauhütte, therefore, in which craftsmen would work on common projects together, the greatest of which would be buildings in which the arts and crafts would be combined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early intention was for the Bauhaus to be a combined architecture school, crafts school, and academy of the arts. Swiss painter [[Johannes Itten]], German-American painter [[Lyonel Feininger]], and German sculptor [[Gerhard Marcks]], along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1919. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor and designer [[Oskar Schlemmer]] who headed the theater workshop, and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]], joined in 1922 by Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter [[Theo van Doesburg]] to Weimar to promote ''[[De Stijl]]'' ("The Style"), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect [[El Lissitzky]].&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hal Foster |others=Rosalind Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, Benjamin Buchloh |title=Art Since 1900: Volume 1—1900 to 1944|year=2004 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-500-28534-9 |pages=185–189 |chapter=1923: The Bauhaus … holds its first public exhibition in Weimar, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Weimarbauhaus6.jpg|thumb|Foyer of the Bauhaus-University Weimar, with [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] staircase]]
From 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of [[Johannes Itten]], who taught the ''Vorkurs'' or "preliminary course" that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus.&lt;ref name="Frampton 1992 124" /&gt; Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of [[Franz Cižek]] and [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]]. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in [[Munich]], as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]]. The influence of German [[Expressionism]] favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of [[Der Blaue Reiter]] founding member [[Wassily Kandinsky]] to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1922. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer [[László Moholy-Nagy]], who rewrote the ''Vorkurs'' with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favored by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907, when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while [[Hermann Muthesius]] had begun implementing industrial prototypes.&lt;ref name="foster" /&gt;

Gropius was not necessarily against [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this "new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery", described "painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future." By 1923, however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture#Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics|Romanesque cathedrals]] and the craft-driven aesthetic of the "[[Völkisch movement]]", instead declaring "we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=1987 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-586694-4 |pages=309–316 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called ''Bauhaus'' and a series of books called "Bauhausbücher". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bauhaus, 1919–1933 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm |website=The MET |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bauhaus |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Bauhaus |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weimar was in the German state of [[Thuringia]], and the Bauhaus school received state support from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]]-controlled Thuringian state government. The school in Weimar experienced political pressure from conservative circles in Thuringian politics, increasingly so after 1923 as political tension rose. One condition placed on the Bauhaus in this new political environment was the exhibition of work undertaken at the school. This condition was met in 1923 with the Bauhaus' exhibition of the experimental [[Haus am Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackermann et al., Bauhaus (Cologne: Könemann, 1999), 406.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school's funding in half. The Bauhaus issued a press release on 26 December 1924, setting the closure of the school for the end of March 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Baumgartner and Josef Helfenstein [http://www.paulkleezentrum.ch/ww/en/pub/web_root/act/wissenschaftliches_archiv/werkphasen/am_bauhaus_in_weimar_1921_1924.cfm At the Bauhaus in Weimar, 1921–1924] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929012710/http://www.paulkleezentrum.ch/ww/en/pub/web_root/act/wissenschaftliches_archiv/werkphasen/am_bauhaus_in_weimar_1921_1924.cfm |date=29 September 2009}}, at Zentrum Paul Klee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Droste (2002) [1990] [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXB8rX5AsgUC ''Bauhaus, 1919–1933''] p.113&lt;/ref&gt; At this point it had already been looking for alternative sources of funding. After the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, a school of industrial design with teachers and staff less antagonistic to the conservative political regime remained in Weimar. This school was eventually known as the Technical University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and in 1996 changed its name to [[Bauhaus-University Weimar]].

===Dessau===
Gropius's design for the [[Dessau]] facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] lines of the [[Fagus Factory]] than the stripped down [[Neoclassical architecture#Regional trends|Neo-classical]] of the Werkbund pavilion or the ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' Sommerfeld House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=2000 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-586694-4 |page=120 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Dessau years, there was a remarkable change in direction for the school. According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect [[Mart Stam]] to run the newly founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam's friend and colleague in the ABC group, Hannes Meyer.

Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928,&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"/&gt; and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.

But Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program, and forced the resignations of [[Herbert Bayer]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn't want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard A. Etlin |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTYQuQ2g36MC |accessdate=15 May 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-22086-4 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dessau city council attempted to convince Gropius to return as head of the school, but Gropius instead suggested [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Mies was appointed in 1930, and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. He halted the school's manufacture of goods so that the school could focus on teaching, and appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant [[Lilly Reich]]. By 1931, the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]]  (Nazi Party) was becoming more influential in German politics. When it gained control of the Dessau city council, it moved to close the school.&lt;ref name="Mies"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Spaeth |title=Ludwig Mies van der Rohe |year=1985 |publisher=Rizzoli New York |isbn=0-8478-0563-8 |pages=87–93}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 June 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin===
In late 1932, Mies rented a derelict factory in Berlin (Birkbusch Street 49) to use as the new Bauhaus with his own money. The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the [[Gestapo]] closed down the Berlin school. Mies protested the decision, eventually speaking to the head of the Gestapo, who agreed to allow the school to re-open. However, shortly after receiving a letter permitting the opening of the Bauhaus, Mies and the other faculty agreed to voluntarily shut down the school {{when|date=July 2017}}.&lt;ref name="Mies"/&gt;

Although neither the Nazi Party nor [[Adolf Hitler]] had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like [[Wilhelm Frick]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] had already labeled the Bauhaus "un-German" and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, a number of communist students loyal to Meyer moved to the [[Soviet Union]] when he was fired in 1930.

Even before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its "[[degenerate art]]", and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish influences of "cosmopolitan modernism".&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"/&gt; Despite Gropius's protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933. Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the "New Bauhaus" of Chicago:&lt;ref&gt;Jardi, Enric (1991) ''Paul Klee''. Rizzoli Intl Pubns, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Mies decided to emigrate to the United States for the directorship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]) in Chicago and to seek building commissions.{{Ref label|fn_1|a|a}} The simple engineering-oriented functionalism of stripped-down modernism, however, did lead to some Bauhaus influences living on in [[Nazi Germany]]. When Hitler's chief engineer, [[Fritz Todt]], began opening the new [[autobahn]] (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were "bold examples of modernism"—among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'', 325&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural output==
The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bauhausmanifesto.com |title= Manifesto of the Staatliches Bauhaus |author=Gropius, Walter |date=April 1919 |work=BauhausManifesto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), he and his partner [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in [[Jena]], and the competition design for the [[Chicago Tribune Tower]], which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 [[Haus am Horn]], student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.

In the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed "Laubenganghäuser" (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer's approach was to research users' needs and scientifically develop the design solution.

[[Mies van der Rohe]] repudiated Meyer's politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius's "study of essentials", and Meyer's research into user requirements, Mies advocated a "spatial implementation of intellectual decisions", which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither Mies van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.

The popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]] and particularly [[Ernst May]], as the city architects of Berlin, [[Dresden]] and [[Frankfurt]] respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in [[Weimar Germany]]. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop [[Onkel Toms Hütte (Berlin U-Bahn)|Onkel Toms Hütte]], is still occupied.

==Impact==
[[File:Olivetti-schawinsky-bauhaus-typewriter.jpg|thumb|Typewriter ''Olivetti Studio 42'' designed by the Bauhaus-alumnus [[Xanti Schawinsky]] in 1936]]
The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, the United States, Canada and [[Israel]] in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by, the Nazi regime. Tel Aviv in 2004 was named to the list of [[world heritage]] sites by the UN due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3777385.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Unesco celebrates Tel Aviv |date=8 June 2004 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1096 |title=White City of Tel-Aviv -- the Modern Movement |first=UNESCO World Heritage |last=Centre |website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had some 4,000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 onwards.

In 1928, the Hungarian painter Alexander Bortnyik founded a school of design in [[Budapest]] called Miihely (also "Muhely"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Late Modern: The Visual Arts Since 1945'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1976, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Mugely"&lt;ref&gt;William Chapin Seitz, Marla Price, ''Art in the Age of Aquarius'', Smithsonian Inst Press, 1992, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;), which means "the studio".&lt;ref name="Gaston Diehl 1972, p. 12"&gt;Gaston Diehl, ''Vasarely'', New York: Crown, 1972, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the seventh floor of a house on Nagymezo Street,&lt;ref name="Gaston Diehl 1972, p. 12"/&gt; it was meant to be the Hungarian equivalent to the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, ''History of Abstract Painting'', Paris: Hazan, 1989, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The literature sometimes refers to it—in an oversimplified manner—as "the Budapest Bauhaus".&lt;ref&gt;See: William Chapin Seitz, Marla Price, ''Art in the Age of Aquarius'', Smithsonian Inst Press, 1992, p. 92; Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Late Modern: The Visual Arts Since 1945'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1976, p. 164; Jean Louis Ferrier, Yann Le Pichon, Art of our century: the story of western art, 1900 to the present 1990, London : Longman, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Bortnyik was a great admirer of [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and had met Walter Gropius in Weimar between 1923 and 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Guitemie Maldonaldo, "Une réception différée et relayée. L'Atelier d'art abstrait et le "modèle-Bauhaus", 1950–1953", in: Martin Schieder, Isabelle Ewig, ''In die Freiheit geworfen: Positionen zur deutsch-französischen Kunstgeschichte nach 1945'', Oldenbourg Verlag, 22 Nov 2006, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Moholy-Nagy himself taught at the Miihely. [[Victor Vasarely]], a pioneer of [[Op Art]], studied at this school before establishing in Paris in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Louis Ferrier, Yann Le Pichon, ''Art of Our Century: The Story of Western Art, 1900 to the Present'', 1990, London: Longman, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Gropius, [[Marcel Breuer]], and Moholy-Nagy re-assembled in Britain during the mid 1930s to live and work in the [[Isokon]] project before the war caught up with them. Gropius and Breuer went to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced The Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the [[Alan I W Frank House]] in Pittsburgh, among other projects. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as [[Philip Johnson]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Lawrence Halprin]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], among many others.

In the late 1930s, [[Mies van der Rohe]] re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential [[Philip Johnson]], and became one of the pre-eminent architects in the world. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the [[New Bauhaus]] school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist [[Walter Paepcke]]. This school became the [[Institute of Design IIT|Institute of Design]], part of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. Printmaker and painter [[Werner Drewes]] was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both [[Columbia University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. [[Herbert Bayer]], sponsored by Paepcke, moved to [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], Colorado in support of Paepcke's Aspen projects at the [[Aspen Institute]]. In 1953, [[Max Bill]], together with [[Inge Scholl|Inge Aicher-Scholl]] and [[Otl Aicher]], founded the [[Ulm School of Design]] (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung—HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of [[semiotics]] as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the "Ulm Model" concept continues to influence international design education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/|title=HfG-Archiv Ulm - The HfG Ulm|first=Ulmer Museum/HfG-Archiv|last=Ulm|website=www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus ''Vorkurs'' (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, H., Gropius, W., &amp; Gropius, I. (Eds.). (1975). ''Bauhaus 1919–1928''. London: Secker&amp; Warburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Itten 1963"&gt;Itten, J. (1963). ''Design and Form: The Basic Course at the Bauhaus and Later'' (Revised edition, 1975). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the ''Vorkurs'' and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that "A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, can design anything from a dress to a kitchen stove".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2013). "The Shillito Design School: Australia's link with the Bauhaus". ''The International Journal of Design in Society'', 6(3), 149–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of [[modern furniture]] design. The ubiquitous [[Cantilever chair]] and the [[Wassily Chair]] designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer [[Mart Stam]] over the rights to the cantilever chair patent. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, thus leading to the patent dispute.) The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.

The physical plant at Dessau survived [[World War II]] and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of ''Bauhausbühne'' ("Bauhaus Stage"). After [[German reunification]], a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/en/|title=Bauhaus Dessau|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.

Later evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of "… the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature…Home hygiene without home atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;Schjeldahl, Peter, "Bauhaus Rules," ''The New Yorker'', November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===The White City===
The [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]] ({{lang-he|העיר הלבנה}}, ''Ha-Ir HaLevana'') refers to a collection of over 4,000 Bauhaus or [[International style (architecture)|International style]] buildings built in [[Tel Aviv]] from the 1930s by [[German Jewish]] architects who emigrated to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] after the rise of the [[Nazis]]. Tel Aviv has the largest number of buildings in this style of any city in the world. In 2003, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) proclaimed Tel Aviv's ''White City'' a [[World Heritage Site|World Cultural Heritage site]], as "an outstanding example of new town planning and architecture in the early 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], [http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/718 ''Decision Text''], World Heritage Centre, retrieved 14 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2000, [[Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv]] is an organization dedicated to the ongoing documentation of the architectural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/965644.html "The Bauhaus Center"], ''Haaretz'', 18 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it hosted an exhibition on preservation of the architecture that showcased 25 buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Zandberg, [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/objects/pages/PrintArticle.jhtml?itemNo=350188 ''Exhibition on Preservation of Bauhaus in Tel Aviv''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605095415/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/objects/pages/PrintArticle.jhtml?itemNo=350188 |date=5 June 2011 }}, Haaretz, 15 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; To further the architectural culture in the city, a small [[Bauhaus Museum]] opened in Tel Aviv in 2008, designed by Israeli architect [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]].&lt;ref&gt;Esther Hecht, [http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/080421bauhaus.asp "Bauhaus Museum Opens in Tel Aviv's White City"], ''Architectural Record'', 21 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bachar, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/949759.html "Surroundings / Daniella Luxembourg's Bauhaus kiosk"], ''Haaretz'', 1 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boyash''' (or ''Bayash''; [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Băieşi'', [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Beás'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Bojáš'', [[Serbo-Croatian|South Slavic]]: ''Bojaši'') refers to a [[Romani people|Romani]] ethnic group living in [[Romania]], southern [[Hungary]], northeastern [[Croatia]], western [[Vojvodina]], [[Slovakia]], the [[Balkans]], but also in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/migrations/gyp/lud.html Ludari in USA]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative names are '''Rudari''' ('''Ludari'''), '''Lingurari''' and '''Zlătari'''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==History==
The Boyash are a branch/[[caste]] of the Roma who were forced to settle in the 14th century in the [[Apuseni Mountains]], located in [[Transylvania]], and work as [[slave]]s in [[mining]] (a regionalism for ''mine'' in Romanian: "baie," from Middle Age [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]). Due to their close proximity with the [[Romanians|Romanian]]-speaking people, they lost the use of the [[Romani language]], and started using the [[Romanian language]]. Some groups relearned Romani when they came in contact with other Romani-speaking Roma, after they later emigrated from Romania (for example, in [[Ecuador]]).

At the end of the 16th century the Boyash started migrating towards the south, in [[Wallachia]], and the east, in [[Moldavia]], where they were held as slaves together with other Romani groups (until the [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]] was abolished in 1855-56).

Another name for the Boyash, ''Rudari'', comes from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''ruda'' ("metal", "ore"). As the mines became inefficient, the Boyash people were forced to readjust by earning their living making [[wood]] [[food utensil|utensil]]s (''Lingurari'' means "[[spoon]]-makers" in Romanian; also cf. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''ruda'', [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''rúd'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''rudă'' meaning "staff, rod, pole, stick"). The nickname ''Kashtale'' ("wood-workers") was also given to them by the Romani-speaking Roma and it has remained in Romani as a more general word for a Rom who does not speak Romani.

After the point at which they began to make wood tools they scattered themselves in isolated communities. The consequence of this is that nowadays they speak a distinct archaic dialect of Romanian, with borrowings from other surrounding languages.

==Population==
After the liberation of the Roma from slavery (by the middle of the 19th century), many [[emigration|emigrated]] to other countries, especially [[Hungary]] and [[the Balkans]], but also as far as the [[Americas]], [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1993, about 14,000 of the 280,000 recorded Hungarian Roma were Boyash.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In [[Croatia]], the Boyash are settled in several small communities along the Hungarian border in the regions of [[Međimurje]], the Podravina, [[Slavonija]] and [[Baranja region|Baranja]] with an overflow of settlers living in the [[Apatin]] county of [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} 2005 saw the Boyash language of Croatia published in its own [[alphabet]] for the first time in the [[Catholic Catechism]], published by the HBK Glas Koncila in Zagreb.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  In 2007, the first Bible—a children's Bible—was published by OM EAST in Austria and facilitated by The Romani Bible Union.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Names in other languages===
In English, the commonly accepted name for the ethnic group is ''Boyash'', however in contemporary [[Bulgaria]] the terms ''Ludari'' and ''Rudari'' are in common use, while in [[Romania]] both terms are present in some form: ''Rudari'' and ''Băieşi''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

For the same ethnic group in [[Hungary]] and [[Croatia]] the terms ''Beyash'' and ''Bayash'' (Bajaši) are now officially used.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The ethnonym ''Banyash'' ("miner") in [[Serbia]] is known only among the group settled in [[Bačka]] region, living along the river [[Danube]], near the border with [[Croatia]] and [[Hungary]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} This term is only sporadically understood, and not used among some other [[Banyash]] groups in the [[Serbian Banat]] region, e.g. the village of [[Uljma]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

They are also known by many appellations based on trades; in addition to Rudari/Ludari ("miners", from Serbian and Bulgarian ''ruda'' "ore, metal") they are known as ''Kopanari'' ("cradle-makers", from Serbian and Bulgarian ''kopanja'' "wooden box"), ''Koritari'' ("trough-makers"), ''Lingurara'' ("spoon-makers", cf. Romanian ''lingură'' "spoon") and ''Ursari'' (cf. Romanian ''urs'' "bear") or ''Mechkara'' ("bear-trainers").{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Education==

Education in the [[Romanian language]] is available only for the Banyash living in [[Romania]]n villages in the Serbian [[Banat]], as well as in Hungary, in the ''beás'' subdialect of the Romanian language spoken by Boyash communities in (central and western) Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. a (.pdf) paper issued by the Hungarian ministry of education (as of May 25, 2006) containing the official schools curriculum for Boyash pupils, reading, writing and the type of tests and examinations in their language, which is based on the Romanian subdialects spoken in western [[Transylvania]] (esp. in [[Crişana]]) and [[Banat]], containing numerous borrowings from the Hungarian language; the script is an adaptation based on Hungarian and Romanian graphems :{{cite web|url=http://www.oh.gov.hu/letolt/okev/doc/erettsegi_2006/e_beas_06maj_fl.pdf |title=Beás nyelv emelt szintű írásbeli vizsga, 2006 |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317013907/http://www.oh.gov.hu/letolt/okev/doc/erettsegi_2006/e_beas_06maj_fl.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last few years there have been several attempts on behalf of local non-governmental organizations in East Bačka region to introduce optional classes in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} According to 2004 field research data, only two such projects are still going on there: optional classes in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in the village of [[Vajska]], and kindergarten in the local Ardeal dialect in [[Bački Monoštor]], attended by 20 pupils altogether.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

'''Caló''' ({{IPA-es|kaˈlo|lang}}; {{IPA-ca|kəˈlo|lang}}; {{IPA-gl|kaˈlɔ|lang}}; {{IPA-pt|kɐˈlɔ|lang}}) is a language spoken by the [[Romani people in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Romani people in Portugal|Portuguese]] Romani. It is a [[mixed language]] (referred to as a [[Para-Romani]] language in Romani linguistics) based on [[Iberian Romance languages|Romance grammar]], with an [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum]] of [[Romani language|Romani]] lexical items&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rmq Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; through [[language shift]] by the Romani community. It is often used as an [[argot]], a secret language for discreet communication amongst Iberian Romani. Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, and Spanish {{lang|rmq|caló}} are closely related varieties that share a common root.&lt;ref name=Adiego&gt;Adiego, I. ''Un vocabulario español-gitano del Marqués de Sentmenat (1697–1762)'' Ediciones Universitat de Barcelona (2002) {{ISBN|84-8338-333-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish caló, or Spanish Romani, was originally known as {{lang|es|zincaló}}. Portuguese {{lang|pt|caló}}, or Portuguese Romani, also goes by the term {{lang|pt|lusitano-romani}}; it used to be referred to as {{lang|pt|calão}}, but this word acquired the general sense of jargon or slang, often with a negative conotation (cf. {{lang|pt|baixo calão}}, 'obscene language', lit. low-level {{lang|pt|calão}}).

==Etymology==
{{lang|rmq|Calé}} is the [[endonym]] of the Romani people in Iberia, and {{lang|rmq|caló}} means "the language spoken by the {{lang|rmq|calé}}. However, the {{lang|rmq|calé}} are commonly known in Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking countries by the [[exonym]]s {{lang|pt|ciganos}} and {{lang|es|gitanos}}.

In {{lang|rmq|caló}} and other varieties of [[Romani language|Romani]], {{lang|rmq|kalo}} means "black or "absorbing all light",&lt;ref&gt; [https://glosbe.com/rom/en/kalo ''Glosbe'' 2013, Dictionary/Romany-English Dictionary/kalo] (23 September 2016). &lt;/ref&gt; hence closely resembling words for "black" and/or "dark" in [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] languages  (e.g. [[Sanskrit]] काल ''kāla'' "black", "of a dark colour"). Hence {{lang|rmq|caló}} and {{lang|rmq|calé}} may have originated as ancient exonyms. For instance, the name of the [[Domba]] people, from whom the Romani, Sinti and Kale people are now believed to have emerged,&lt;ref&gt; [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 N. Rai et al., 2012, "The Phylogeography of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup H1a1a-M82 Reveals the Likely Indian Origin of the European Romani Populations"] (23 September 2016). &lt;/ref&gt; also implies "dark-skinned" in some Indian languages.&lt;ref&gt; Isabel Fonseca, ''Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and their Journey'', Random House, p. 100. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature and dialect divisions==
Three main groupings of dialects are distinguished in what is technically Iberian {{lang|rmq|caló}} but most commonly referred to simply as (Spanish) {{lang|es|caló}} or Spanish Romani:
*Spanish caló ({{lang-es|caló español}})
*Catalan caló ({{lang-ca|caló català}})
*Occitan caló ({{lang-oc|caló occitan}})
*Portuguese caló ({{lang-pt|caló português}})

In modern Romani linguistics, all are jointly referred to as Iberian Romani (Spanish: {{lang|es|iberorromaní}} or {{lang|es|romaní ibérico}}).&lt;ref name=Adiego/&gt;

Notable phonological features of Iberian Caló are:&lt;ref name=Adiego/&gt;
* the loss of the distinction between aspirated {{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ tʃʰ/}}, unaspirated {{IPA|/p t k tʃ/}} and voiced {{IPA|/b d ɡ dʒ/}}.
* the merger of {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} – [[betacism]].
* [[affrication]] of {{IPA|/t d/}} to {{IPA|/tʃ dʒ/}} before the [[front vowel]]s {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e̞/}} cf. [[Brazilian Portuguese]] {{IPA|/ti/}}, {{IPA|/di/}} &gt; {{IPA|[tʃi ~ tɕi]}}, {{IPA|[dʒi ~ dʑi]}}.

==Loans==

===Spanish===
Many Caló terms have been borrowed in Spanish (especially as [[slang]]isms and [[colloquialism]]s), often through [[Flamenco|flamenco lyrics]] and [[criminal jargon]] ([[germanía]]).

Examples are {{lang|es|gachó/gachí}} ("man/woman", from ''[[gadji|gadjo/gadji]]''), {{lang|es|chaval}} ("boy", originally "son", also present in English as ''[[chav]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|es|[[Diccionario crítico etimológico de la lengua castellana]]}}, vol. II, p. 39. [[Joan Corominas]], Francke Verlag, Bern, 1954. {{ISBN|978-84-249-1361-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), {{lang|es|parné}} ("money"), {{lang|es|currelar}} or {{lang|es|currar}} ("to work"), {{lang|es|fetén}} ("excellent"), {{lang|es|pinreles}} ("feet"), {{lang|es|biruji}} ("cold"),  {{lang|es|churumbel}} ("baby"), {{lang|es|gilí}} ("silly, stupid"), {{lang|es|chachi}} ("outstanding, genuine"), {{lang|es|(un)debel}} or {{lang|es|debla}} ("god/goddess"), {{lang|es|mengue}} ("demond"), {{lang|es|chorar}} ("to steal"), also present in English slang as ''to chaw'', {{lang|es|molar}} ("to like"), {{lang|es|piltra}} ("bed"), {{lang|es|acais}} ("eyes"), {{lang|es|chola}} ("head"), {{lang|es|jeró}} ("face"), {{lang|es|napia}} ("nose"), {{lang|es|muí}} ("mouth"), {{lang|es|lache}} ("shame"), {{lang|es|pitingo}} ("vain"), {{lang|es|chungo}} ("bad, nasty, dodgy"), {{lang|es|guripa}} ("cheeky, soldier"), {{lang|es|ful}} ("fake"), {{lang|es|potra}} ("luck"), {{lang|es|paripé}} ("pretence"), {{lang|es|juncal}} ("slender, graceful"), {{lang|es|pure}} or {{lang|es|pureta}} ("old"), {{lang|es|sobar}} ("to sleep"), {{lang|es|quer}} or {{lang|es|queli}} ("house"), {{lang|es|garito}} ("house, gambling den"), {{lang|es|jalar}} ("to eat"), {{lang|es|cate}} ("hit"), {{lang|es|jiñar}} ("to defecate, to fear"), {{lang|es|diñar}} ("to give, to die"), {{lang|es|palmar}} ("to die, to snuff it"), {{lang|es|chinarse}} ("to get upset"), {{lang|es|apoquinar}} ("to pay"), {{lang|es|langui}} ("lame"), {{lang|es|chalado}} or {{lang|es|pirado}} ("crazy"), {{lang|es|pirarse}} ("to leave", "to make oneself scarce"), {{lang|es|changar}} ("to break"), {{lang|es|chivarse}} ("to denounce ''sb'', to squeal"), {{lang|es|chivato}} ("informer"), {{lang|es|hacerse el longuis}} ("to pretend to be absent-minded"), ''pringar'' ("to get ''sb'' mixed up, to overdo"), {{lang|es|chingar}} ("to have sexual relations, to bother"), {{lang|es|chinorri}} ("little"), {{lang|es|najar}} ("to flee"), {{lang|es|privar}} ("drink, to drink"), {{lang|es|mangar}} ("to steal"), {{lang|es|nanay}} ("no way, there isn't"), {{lang|es|chorizo}} ("thief"), {{lang|es|achantar}} ("to get intimidated"), {{lang|es|pispar}} ("to nick"), {{lang|es|birlar}} ("to nick"), {{lang|es|achanta la muí}} ("shut your mouth"), {{lang|es|canguelo}} or {{lang|es|cangueli}} ("fear"), {{lang|es|cañí}} ("Romani person"), {{lang|es|calé}} ("Romani person"), {{lang|es|caló}} ("language of the [[Romani people|Iberian Kale]]"), {{lang|es|calas}} ("money"), {{lang|es|curda}} ("drunkenness"), {{lang|es|payo}} ("non-Romani person"), {{lang|es|menda}} ("myself"), and {{lang|es|galochi}} ("heart").&lt;ref&gt;[http://oliba.uoc.edu/gitanos/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=118&amp;Itemid=273&amp;lang=ca Aportacions gitanes al castellà] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722022230/http://oliba.uoc.edu/gitanos/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=118&amp;Itemid=273&amp;lang=ca |date=2011-07-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words underwent a shift in meaning in the process: {{lang|es|camelar}} ([[etymology|etymologically]] related to [[Sanskrit]] ''[[kāma]]'', "love, desire") in [[colloquial]] Spanish has the meaning of "to woo, to seduce, to deceive by adulation" (but also "to love", "to want"; although this sense has fallen into disuse),&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=camelar camelar]'' in the ''[[Diccionario de la Real Academia]]'',&lt;/ref&gt; however in Caló it more closely matches the Spanish meanings of {{lang|es|querer}} ("to want" and "to love"). In addition {{lang|es|camelar}} and the noun {{lang|es|camelo}} can also mean either "lie" or "con".

Caló also appears to have influenced [[quinqui]], the language of another Iberian group of travellers who are not ethnically Romani.

===Catalan===
To a lesser extent than in Spanish, Caló terms have also been adapted into Catalan as [[slang]]isms and [[colloquialism]]s, most of which were taken adopted from Spanish slang.

Examples are {{lang|ca|halar}} ({{IPA-ca|həˈla|pron}} or {{IPA-ca|xəˈla|}}; "to eat"), {{lang|ca|xaval}} ("boy"), {{lang|ca|dinyar(-la)}} ("to die"), {{lang|ca|palmar(-la)}} ("to die"), {{lang|ca|cangueli}} ("fear"), {{lang|ca|paio}} ("non-Romani person"), {{lang|ca|caler}} ("money"), {{lang|ca|caló}} ("language of the [[Romani people|Iberian Kale]]"), {{lang|ca|cangrí}} ("prison"), {{lang|ca|pispar}} ("to nick"), {{lang|ca|birlar}} ("to nick"), {{lang|ca|xorar}} ("to steal"), {{lang|ca|mangar}} ("to steal"), {{lang|ca|molar}} ("to like"), {{lang|ca|pringar}} ("to get ''sb'' mixed up, to overdo"), {{lang|ca|pirar(-se)}} ("to leave, to make oneself scarce"), {{lang|ca|sobar}} ("to sleep"), {{lang|ca|privar}} ("drink, to drink"), {{lang|ca|xusma}} ("pleb"), {{lang|ca|laxe}} ("shame"), {{lang|ca|catipén}} ("stink"), {{lang|ca|xaxi}} ("outstanding, genuine"), {{lang|ca|xivar-se}} ("to denounce ''sb'', to squeal"), {{lang|ca|xivato}} ("informer"), {{lang|ca|xinar(-se)}} ("to get upset"), {{lang|ca|fer el llonguis}} (lit. "Do a long one" fig. "to pretend to be thick/slow") and {{lang|ca|potra}} ("luck").&lt;ref&gt;[http://oliba.uoc.edu/gitanos/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=120&amp;Itemid=275&amp;lang=ca Aportacions gitanes al català] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722022245/http://oliba.uoc.edu/gitanos/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=120&amp;Itemid=275&amp;lang=ca |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu3.cat/Edu3tv/Fitxa?p_id=23242 El català dels gitanos]. ''Caçadors de Paraules'' (TV3, edu3.cat).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===
As with Catalan, there is a smaller number of words of Caló origin and many of those are indirect loans, borrowed via Spanish.

Well-known examples generally understood by most or all speakers of Portuguese include {{lang|pt|gajo}} ({{IPA-pt|ˈgaʒu|pron}}, "man, dude", primarily in Portugal), chavalo ("lad, young boy") {{lang|pt|baque}} ({{IPA-pt|ˈbaki|}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈbakɨ|}}, generally "impact", but in this sense "sudden happiness"), {{lang|pt|ralar}} ({{IPA-pt|ʁɐˈla(ʁ)|}}, {{IPA-pt|ʁɐˈlaɾ|}}, "to work hard", lit. "to grate oneself"), {{lang|pt|ralar peito}} ({{IPA-pt|ʁɐˈla(ʁ) ˈpejtu|}}, {{IPA-pt|ʁɐˈlaɾ ˈpɐjtu|}}, "to scamper, to skip, to run", lit. "to grate one's chest"), {{lang|pt|bagunça}} ({{IPA-pt|bɐˈgũsɐ|}}, "mess"), {{lang|pt|boliche}} ({{IPA-pt|boˈliʃi|}}, {{IPA-pt|buˈliʃ(ɨ)|}}, "bowling"), {{lang|pt|dica}} ({{IPA-pt|ˈdʒikɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈdikɐ|}}, "tip, clue"), {{lang|pt|pechincha}} ({{IPA-pt|pɪˈʃĩʃɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|pɨˈʃĩʃɐ|}}, "bargain, haggled"), {{lang|pt|gamar}} ({{IPA-pt|gɐˈma(ʁ)|}}, {{IPA-pt|gɐˈmaɾ|}}, "to be charmed, to fall in love with, to be obsessed by"), {{lang|pt|ganiços}} ({{IPA-pt|gɐˈnisus|}}, {{IPA-pt|gɐˈnisuʃ|}}, "dice", more commonly {{lang|pt|dados}}; "[thin] fingers and/or toes", more commonly {{lang|pt|dedos}}), {{lang|pt|mancada}} ({{IPA-pt|mɐ̃ˈkadɐ|}}, {{IPA-pt|mɐ̃ˈkaðɐ|}}, "failure with a compromise", lit. limped/hobbled) and {{lang|pt|pileque}} ({{IPA-pt|piˈlɛki|}}, {{IPA-pt|piˈlɛk(ɨ)|}}, "drunkenness"), chulé ("bad smell of feet), chunga ("of bad quality"), pirar-se ("to leave"), pirado and chalado ("crazy"), chibar-se ("to denounce sb, to squeal"), chibo ("informer").&lt;ref&gt;[https://lordcesarvalentine.blogspot.com.br/2010/05/mundo-cigano.html Suplemento do léxico cigano]. Mundo Cigano.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language maintenance==
There is a growing awareness and appreciation for Caló: "...until the recent work by Luisa Rojo, in the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]], not even the linguistics community recognized the significance and problems of Caló and its world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibs.lgu.ac.uk/forum/luri.htm The Responsibility of Linguist and the Basque Case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120151324/http://ibs.lgu.ac.uk/forum/luri.htm |date=2005-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its world includes songs, poetry and flamenco.

As Iberian Romani proper is extinct and as Caló is endangered, some people are trying to [[Language revitalization|revitalise]] the language. The Spanish politician [[Juan de Dios Ramírez Heredia]] promotes [[Romanò-Kalò]], a variant of [[Romani language standardization|International Romani]], enriched by Caló words.&lt;ref name="CursoRamírez"&gt;[http://www.unionromani.org/notis/noti2006-12-29a.htm ''"Unión Romaní imparte el primer curso de romanò-kalò"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225539/http://www.unionromani.org/notis/noti2006-12-29a.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, Union Romani, 29 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; His goal is to reunify the Caló and Romani roots.

==Literature==
In 1838, the first edition of ''Embéo E Majaró Lucas'' translated by [[George Borrow]] was published and began to be distributed in [[Madrid]]. This was Borrow's translation of the [[Gospel of Luke]] into Caló.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgeborrow.org/literature/theGypsyLuke.html Embéo E Majaró Lucas] - further details are given in the page on the website of the [http://georgeborrow.org/ George Borrow Society].&lt;/ref&gt; A revision of this was printed in 1872.

{{Youth rights sidebar}}

The [[United Nations]] '''Convention on the Rights of the Child''' (commonly abbreviated as the '''CRC''' or '''UNCRC''') is a [[international human rights instruments|human rights treaty]] which sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children. The Convention defines a child as any human being under the age of eighteen, unless the [[age of majority]] is attained earlier under national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |url= http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx |publisher=Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations that ratify this convention are bound to it by [[international law]]. Compliance is monitored by the UN [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], which is composed of members from countries around the world. Once a year, the Committee submits a report to the Third Committee of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], which also hears a statement from the CRC Chair, and the Assembly adopts a Resolution on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name=CRIN/&gt;

Governments of countries that have ratified the Convention are required to report to, and appear before, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child periodically to be examined on their progress with regards to the advancement of the implementation of the Convention and the status of child rights in their country. Their reports and the committee's written views and concerns are available on the committee's website.

The UN General Assembly adopted the Convention and opened it for signature on 20 November 1989 (the 30th anniversary of its [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]]).&lt;ref name="UN_ARES4425"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-44-25 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=44 |resolution_number=25 |accessdate=22 August 2008|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|date=20 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came into force on 2 September 1990, after it was ratified by the required number of nations.

A third [[#Optional protocols|optional protocol]] relating to communication of complaints was adopted in December 2011 and opened for signature on 28 February 2012. It came into effect on 14 April 2014.&lt;ref name=Protocol3/&gt;

==Contents==
The Convention deals with the child-specific needs and rights. It requires that  the "nations that ratify this convention are bound to it by international law". Ratifying states must act in the [[best interests]] of the child. 
In all jurisdictions implementing the Convention requires compliance with [[child custody]] and guardianship laws as that every child has basic rights, including the [[right to life]], to their own name and identity, to be raised by their [[parent]]s within a family or cultural grouping, and to have a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with both parents, even if they are [[Legal separation|separated]].

The Convention obliges states to allow parents to exercise their parental responsibilities. The Convention also acknowledges that children have the right to express their opinions and to have those opinions heard and acted upon when appropriate, to be protected from abuse or [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and to have their [[privacy]] protected, and it requires that their lives not be subject to excessive interference.

The Convention also obliges signatory states to provide separate legal representation for a child in any judicial dispute concerning their care and asks that the child's viewpoint be heard in such cases.

The Convention forbids [[capital punishment]] for children. In its General Comment 8 (2006) the Committee on the Rights of the Child stated that there was an "obligation of all state parties to move quickly to prohibit and eliminate all corporal punishment and all other cruel or degrading forms of punishment of children".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/898586b1dc7b4043c1256a450044f331/6545c032cb57bff5c12571fc002e834d/$FILE/G0740771.pdf General Comment 8], Committee on the Rights of the Child.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 19 of the Convention states that state parties must "take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence",&lt;ref&gt;[[s:UN Convention on the Rights of the Child#Article 19|Article 19, Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;/ref&gt; but it makes no reference to [[corporal punishment]]. The Committee's interpretation of this section to encompass a prohibition on corporal punishment has been rejected by several state parties to the Convention, including Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Global standards and cultural relativism===
Global human rights standards were challenged at the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna (1993) when a number of governments (prominently China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Iran) raised serious objections to the idea of [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] human rights.&lt;ref name="White 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Ben|title=DEFINING THE INTOLERABLE: Child work, global standards and cultural relativism|journal=Childhood|date=1999|volume=6|issue=1|pages=133–144|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are unresolved tensions between "universalistic" and "relativistic" approaches in the establishment of standards and strategies designed to prevent or overcome the abuse of children's capacity to work.&lt;ref name="White 1999"/&gt;

==States party and signatories==
Currently 196 countries are parties to the treaty (some with stated reservations or interpretations).

=== Azerbaijan ===
Azerbaijan ratified Convention on the Rights of the Child on 21 July 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/azerbaijan/media_13351.html|title=UNICEF Azerbaijan - Media centre - UNICEF Azerbaijan launched special edition of State of the World's Children to mark the 20th Anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the Parliament|website=www.unicef.org|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bettercarenetwork.org/sites/default/files/The%20Child%20Protection%20System%20in%20Azerbaijan%20-%20A%20Situation%20Analysis.pdf|title=The Child Protection System in Azerbaijan: Situation Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.az/en/content/112|title=Rights of children|last=FS|website=www.mfa.gov.az|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a significant number of laws, decrees and resolutions were approved in Azerbaijan by the President and the Cabinet of Ministers focusing on the development of the child welfare system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this regard, the Convention №182 on "Elimination of the worst forms of child labour" and Recommendation №190 of the International Labour Organization and the Hague Convention on International adoption of children were ratified by Milli Majlis in 2004.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a concern over the administration of juvenile justice in Azerbaijan, mostly regarding compliance with articles 37, 39 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as other relevant standards such as the Beijing Rules, the Riyadh Guidelines and the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, international organizations assisted Azerbaijan to improve the situation in the field of juvenile justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/273391?download=true|title=Protection of children rights in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Juvenile offenders have been added to the Presidential pardons on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Azerbaijan has built cooperation with many international organizations, in particular with UNICEF in the field of child protection. In 1993, UNICEF began its activity in Azerbaijan. In 2005, Azerbaijan and UNICEF signed a 5-year country program. The country program for 2005-2009 was implemented in the field of child protection, children's health and nutrition, children's education and youth health, their development and participation. In addition, UNICEF supports Azerbaijan in developing juvenile justice system, establishing alternative care system and raising awareness among youth about HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Act specifically refers to  Canada's different commitments under the Convention. The convention was influential in the [[administrative Law]] decision of ''[[Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)]]''.

===Ireland===
Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 30 September 1990 and ratified it, without reservation, on 28 September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensrights.ie/convention.php Children's Rights Alliance website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127035646/http://www.childrensrights.ie/convention.php |date=27 January 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms expressed in the 1998 review by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva, the Irish government established the office of Ombudsman for Children and drew up a national children's strategy. In 2006, following concerns expressed by the committee that the wording of the Irish Constitution does not allow the State to intervene in cases of abuse other than in very exceptional cases, the Irish government undertook to amend the constitution to make a more explicit commitment to children's rights.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Carl (28 September 2006). "UN to seek changes in Constitution in support of children". ''Irish Times'' (Dublin).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
Israel ratified the Convention in 1991. In 2010, UNICEF criticized Israel for its failure to create a government-appointed commission on children's rights or to adopt a national children's rights strategy or program in order to implement various Israeli laws addressing children's rights. The report criticizes Israel for holding that the Convention does not apply in the West Bank and for defining as Palestinians under the age of 16 in the occupied territories as children, even though Israeli law defines a child as being under 18, in line with the Convention. A contemporaneous report by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] found that Israel's investment in children is below the international average and the actual investment had fallen between 1995 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Or Kashti (21 November 2010).

It also criticized Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza on southern Israel which traumatized Israeli children, calling on all parties to protect children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12818&amp;LangID=E  Children suffering devastating and lasting impact of Gaza crisis, says UN Committee on the Rights of the Child], [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], 22 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand ratified the Convention on 6 April 1993 with reservations concerning the right to distinguish between persons according to the nature of their authority to be in New Zealand, the need for legislative action on economic exploitation—which it argued was adequately protected by existing law, and the provisions for the separation of juvenile offenders from adult offenders.&lt;ref name="treaties.un.org"&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en United Nations Treaty Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211151110/https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?src=treaty&amp;mtdsg_no=iv-11&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |date=11 February 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand]] dismissed the suggestion that the Minister for Immigration and his department were at liberty to ignore the convention, arguing that this would imply that the country's adherence was "at least partly window-dressing".&lt;ref&gt;''Tavita v Minister of Immigration'', 17 December 1993 [1994] 2 NZLR 257 at 265, cited in Ferdinandusse, Ward N., ''Direct Application of International Criminal Law in National Courts'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 161. {{ISBN|978-90-6704-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, New Zealand passed the [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]], which removed the defence of "reasonable force" for the purpose of correction. In its third and final vote, Parliament voted 113 to eight in favour of the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/timeline-anti-smacking-legislation-2936192 |title=Timeline: Anti-smacking legislation |publisher=TVNZ |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia ratified the Convention in 1996, with a reservation "with respect to all such articles as are in conflict with the provisions of Islamic law"&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt; which is the national law. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, which reviewed Saudi Arabia's treatment of children under the Convention in January 2005, strongly condemned the government for its practice of imposing the death penalty on juveniles, calling it "a serious violation of the fundamental rights". The committee said it was "deeply alarmed" over the discretionary power judges hold to treat juveniles as adults: In its 2004 report the Saudi Arabian government had stated that it "never imposes capital punishment on persons ... below the age of 18". The government delegation later acknowledged that a judge could impose the death penalty whenever he decided that the convicted person had reached his or her majority, regardless of the person's actual age at the time of the crime or at the time of the scheduled execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/29/saudia12546.htm ''Saudi Arabia: Follow U.N.

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom ratified the Convention on 16 December 1991, with several declarations and reservations,&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Nick, ''Child Welfare: Major Themes in Health and Social Welfare'', Taylor and Francis, 2004, p. 175; Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-415-31257-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made its first report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in January 1995. Concerns raised by the Committee included the growth in child poverty and inequality, the extent of violence towards children, the use of custody for young offenders, the low age of criminal responsibility, and the lack of opportunities for children and young people to express views.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Martin, ''The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Social Work'', Blackwell, 2000, p. 354. {{ISBN|978-0-631-21451-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 report of the Committee expressed similar concerns, including the welfare of children in custody, unequal treatment of asylum seekers, and the negative impact of poverty on children's rights. In September 2008, the UK government decided to withdraw its reservations and agree to the Convention in these respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7624450.stm |title=UK to sign UN children convention |accessdate=19 September 2008 |work=BBC News |date=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Easton, Mark (19 September 2008).

The Minister for Children, Young People and Families commented that while fewer parents are using smacking as a form of discipline, the majority said they would not support a ban.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Beverley, Minister for Children, Young People and Families, [http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2008_0224 "Article defending the Government's position on smacking"], press release, 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In evidence to the Parliamentary [[Joint Committee on Human Rights]], the Committee was criticised by the Family Education Trust for "adopting radical interpretations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in its pursuit of an agenda".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200203/jtselect/jtrights/96/96a04.htm Evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights], UK Parliament, 12 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Committee's report recommended that "the time has come for the Government to act upon the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child concerning the corporal punishment of children and the incompatibility of the defence of reasonable chastisement with its obligations under the Convention."&lt;ref&gt;House of Lords and House of Commons Joint Committee on Human Rights, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200203/jtselect/jtrights/117/117.pdf The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child], Tenth Report of Session 2002–03, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government responded that "the use of physical punishment is a matter for individual parents to decide".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200506/jtselect/jtrights/104/104.pdf "Government Responses to Reports from the Committee"], Session 2005-06, paras. 82, 85, 86: HL 104, HC 850.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child}}
The United States government played an active role in the drafting of the Convention and signed it on 16 February 1995, but has not ratified it. It has been claimed that American opposition to the Convention stems primarily from political and religious conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Smolin, David M. [http://www.law.emory.edu/cms/site/fileadmin/journals/eilr/v20n1/SmolinCROP.pdf "Overcoming Religious Objections to the Convention on the Rights of the Child"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Emory International Law Review'', vol.20, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[The Heritage Foundation]] sees "a civil society in which moral authority is exercised by religious congregations, family, and other private associations is fundamental to the American order".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/WorldwideFreedom/bg1965.cfm "Human Rights and Social Issues at the U.N.: A Guide for U.S. Policymakers"], ''Heritage Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Home School Legal Defense Association]] (HSLDA) argues that the CRC threatens [[homeschooling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hslda.org/docs/hshb/89/hshb8902.asp|title=HSLDA.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States had permitted the execution and [[life imprisonment]] of juvenile offenders, in contravention of the Article 37 of the Convention.&lt;ref name=untreaty/&gt; In 2005, a [[Roper v. Simmons|Supreme Court decision]] declared [[juvenile execution]]s to be unconstitutional as "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]";&lt;ref&gt;US Supreme Court: ''[[Roper v.

State laws regarding the practice of [[closed adoption]] may also require overhaul in light of the Convention's position that children have a right to identity from birth.

During his 2008 campaign for President, Senator [[Barack Obama]] described the failure to ratify the Convention as "embarrassing" and promised to review the issue&lt;ref&gt;[http://debate.waldenu.edu/video/question-12/#content Walden University Presidential Youth Debate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211012036/http://debate.waldenu.edu/video/question-12/ |date=11 December 2008 }}, October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=18874&amp;flag=news;|title=Child Rights Information Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he never did. No [[President of the United States]] has submitted the treaty to the [[United States Senate]] requesting its advice and consent to ratification since the US signed it in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Podgers, "The Last Holdout," ABA Journal at 84 (March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has ratified two of the [[#Optional protocols|optional protocols]] to the Convention,&lt;ref name=Protocol1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Protocol2/&gt; the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.

==Optional protocols==
Two optional protocols were adopted by the UN General Assembly. The first, the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] requires parties to ensure that children under the age of 18 are not recruited compulsorily into their armed forces, and calls on governments to do everything feasible to ensure that members of their armed forces who are under 18 years do not take part in hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yun|first1=Seira|title=Breaking Imaginary Barriers: Obligations of Armed Non-State Actors Under General Human Rights Law – The Case of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|journal=Journal of International Humanitarian Legal Studies|date=2014|volume=5|issue=1-2|pages=213–257|ssrn=2556825|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protocol entered into force on 12 July 2002.&lt;ref name=Protocol1&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection: [http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict]. Retrieved on 20 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of {{date}}, 167 states are party to the protocol and another 14 states have signed but not ratified it.&lt;ref name=Protocol1/&gt;

The second, the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]], requires parties to prohibit the sale of children, [[Prostitution of children|child prostitution]] and [[child pornography]]. It entered into force on 18 January 2002.&lt;ref name=Protocol2&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection: [http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11-c&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography]. Retrieved on 20 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of {{date}}, 173 states are party to the protocol and another 9 states have signed but not ratified it.&lt;ref name=Protocol2 /&gt;

A third, the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a Communications Procedure]], which would allow children or their representatives to file individual complaints for violation of the rights of children, was adopted in December 2011&lt;ref name=Protocol3Announce&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40802&amp;Cr=children&amp;Cr1=|title=UN rights chief welcomes new measure to stop violence against children|date=20 December 2011|work=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened for signature on 28 February 2012.

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Israel.svg|150 px]]}}
There is evidence that [[corruption]] is a legitimate problem in Israeli politics and many investigations have taken place into allegations of [[influence peddling]] and [[bribery]].&lt;ref name="ny1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/opinion/does-israel-really-have-a-corruption-problem.html?_r=0|title=Does Israel Really Have a Corruption Problem?|author=Shmuel Rosner|publisher=New York Times|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hz1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/ag-resumes-police-probes-of-politicians-1.20640|title=AG Resumes Police Probes of Politicians|author=Baruch Kra|publisher=Haaretz|date=30 January 2003|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 32nd place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref name="tp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX 2017|last=|first=|date=25 January 2017|website=|publisher=Transparency International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tp2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/country/ISR|title=Israel - Transparency International|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128202215/https://www.transparency.org/country/ISR|archivedate=28 January 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|accessdate=2 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] has also been questioned by Minister [[Gilad Erdan]]'s investigators under suspicion of corruption, due to the acceptance of expensive gifts such as fine champagne and cigars.&lt;ref name="ny2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-corruption-investigation.html|title=Benjamin Netanyahu Is Questioned a Second Time on Corruption Suspicions|author=Isabel Kershner|publisher=New York Times|date=5 January 2017|accessdate=2 April 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302175941/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/world/middleeast/netanyahu-corruption-investigation.html|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, corruption does not appear to be institutionalised and businesses can largely operate and invest in Israel without interference from corrupt officials.&lt;ref name="correport1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/israel|title=Israel Corruption Report|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|date=August 2016|accessdate=2 April 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914234113/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/israel|archivedate=14 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2017}} The [[judiciary]] is considered by businesses to be at a low risk of corruption; however, the [[Corruption#Government.2Fpublic_sector|public services sector]] is reported to have a moderate risk of corruption, with business leaders reporting the payment of bribes in exchange for access to public utilities, with an ineffective [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] government being considered by some to be the source of the problem.&lt;ref name="correport1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15933">The '''decline effect''' may occur when scientific claims receive decreasing support over time. The term was first described by parapsychologist [[Joseph Banks Rhine]] in the 1930s to describe the disappearing of [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP) of psychic experiments conducted by Rhine over the course of study or time. In its more general term, Cronbach, in his review article of science "Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology" referred to the phenomenon as "generalizations decay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0076829| title = Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology| journal = American Psychologist| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 116–127| year = 1975| last1 = Cronbach | first1 = L. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was once again used in a 2010 article by [[Jonah Lehrer]] published in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Lehrer"&gt;{{Cite web | author = Jonah_Lehrer | title = The Truth Wears Off | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer | publisher = The New Yorker | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

In his article, Lehrer gives several examples where the decline effect is allegedly showing. In the first example, the development of second generation anti-psychotic drugs, reveals that the first tests had demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the subjects' psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt; However, after repeating tests this effect declined and in the end it was not possible to document that these drugs had any better effect than the first generation anti-psychotics.

A well-known example of the decline effect can be seen in early experiments conducted by Professor [[Jonathan Schooler]] examining the effects of verbalization on non-verbal cognition. In an initial series of studies Schooler found evidence that verbal rehearsal of previously seen faces or colors markedly impaired subsequent recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is referred to as ''[[verbal overshadowing]]''. Although verbal overshadowing effects have been repeatedly observed by Schooler, as well as other researchers, they have also proven to be somewhat challenging to replicate.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chin |first=J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal overshadowing effects in a variety of domains were initially easy to find, but then became increasingly difficult to replicate indicating a decline effect in the phenomenon. Schooler has now become one of the more prominent researchers examining the decline effect. He has argued that addressing the decline effect may require a major revision to the scientific process whereby scientists log their protocols before conducting their research and then, regardless of outcome, report their findings in an open access repository (such as Brain Nosek's "Project Implicit").&lt;ref&gt;http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/&lt;/ref&gt; Schooler is currently working with the Fetzer Foundation to organize a major meeting of scientists from various disciplines to consider alternative accounts of the decline effect and approaches for rigorously addressing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/1047840X.2012.705246| title = Modernizing Science: Comments on Nosek and Bar-Anan (2012)| journal = Psychological Inquiry| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 281–284| year = 2012| last1 = Mooneyham | first1 = B.

In 1991, Danish zoologist Anders Møller discovered a connection between symmetry and sexual preference of female birds in nature. This sparked a huge interest in the topic and a lot of follow-up research was published. In three years following the original discovery, 90% of studies confirmed Møller's hypothesis. However, the same outcome was published in just four out of eight research papers in 1995, and only a third in next three years.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2"&gt;{{Cite news | author = Jonah Lehrer | title = The Mysterious Decline Effect | url = https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/12/the-mysterious-decline-effect | publisher = Wired | date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==

One of the explanations of the effect is [[regression to the mean|regression toward the mean]] (this is a statistical phenomenon happening when a variable is extreme on the first experiments and by later experiments tend to regress towards average), although this does not explain why sequential results decline in a linear fashion, rather than fluctuating about the true mean as would be expected.&lt;ref name=schooler/&gt;

Another reason may be the [[publication bias]]: scientists and scientific journals prefer to publish positive results of experiments and tests over null results, especially with new ideas.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;  As a result, the journals may refuse to publish papers that do not prove that the idea works. Later, when an idea is accepted, journals may refuse to publish papers that support it.

In the debate that followed the original article, Lehrer answered some of the questions by claiming that scientific observations might be shaped by one's expectations and desires, sometimes even unconsciously, thus creating a bias towards the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt;

A significant factor contributing to the decline effect can also be the sample size of the scientific research, since smaller sample size is very likely to give more extreme results, suggesting a significant breakthrough, but also a higher probability of an error. Typical examples of this effect are the opinion polls, where those including a larger number of people are closer to reality than those with a small pool of respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = John Allen Paulos | authorlink = John Allen Paulos | title = The decline effect and why scientific 'Truth' so often turns out wrong | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/decline-effect-scientific-truth-turns-wrong/story?id=12510202 | publisher = ABC News | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggestion would not appear to account for the observed decrease over time regardless of sample size. Researcher [[John Ioannidis]] offers some explanation. He states that early research is usually small and more prone to highly positive results supporting the original idea, including early confirmatory studies. Later, as larger studies are being made, they often show regression to the mean and a failure to repeat the early exaggerated results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J. P.

A 2012 report by National Public Radio's show "On The Media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Brooke Gladstone |title=The 'Decline Effect' and Scientific Truth |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/jun/29/decline-effect-and-scientific-truth/ |publisher=NPR On The Media |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704061146/http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/jun/29/decline-effect-and-scientific-truth/ |archivedate=2012-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; covered scientists who are exploring another option: that the act of observing the universe changes the universe, and that repeated measurement might actually be rendering earlier results invalid. In other words, antipsychotic drugs ''did'' work originally, but the more we measured their effectiveness, the more the laws governing those drugs changed so they ceased to be effective. Science fiction author [[Geoff Ryman]] explores this idea and its possible ramifications further in his 2012 short story &lt;u&gt;What We Found&lt;/u&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Geoff Ryman | title = The Year's Best Science Fiction | url = https://www.amazon.com/The-Years-Best-Science-Fiction/dp/1250003547 | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Mike Addelman | title = Ryman wins one of world’s top science fiction prizes | url = http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=8297 | publisher = University of Manchester | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contesting views==

Several commenters have contested Jonah Lehrer's view of the decline effect being a problematic side of the phenomenon, as presented in his ''New Yorker'' article. "The decline effect is troubling because it reminds us how difficult it is to prove anything. We like to pretend that our experiments define the truth for us. But that's often not the case. Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe." &lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;

[[Steven Novella]] also challenges Lehrer's view of the decline effect, arguing that Lehrer is concentrating on new discoveries on the cutting edge of scientific research and applying the conclusions to all areas of science. Novella points out that most of the examples used by Lehrer come from medicine, psychology and ecology, scientific fields most influenced by a complex human aspect and that there is not much evidence of the decline effect in other areas of science, such as physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Steven Novella | title = The Decline Effect | url = http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2580/ | publisher = Neurologicablog | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist, [[Paul Zachary Myers]], is also contesting Lehrer's view on the decline effect being a surprising phenomenon in science, claiming that: "This isn't surprising at all. It's what we expect, and there are many very good reasons for the shift." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Paul Zachary Myers |title=Science is not dead |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/science_is_not_dead.php |publisher=Scienceblogs |year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303224843/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/science_is_not_dead.php |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer's statements about the difficulty of proving anything and publication bias find support from [[Jerry A. Coyne]]. Coyne holds that in the fields of genetics and evolutionary biology, almost no research is replicated and there is a premium motivation offered for publishing positive results of research studies. However, he also contests Lehrer's approach of applying conclusions on all fields of science, stating that in physics, chemistry or molecular biology, previous results are constantly repeated by others in order to progress in their own research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Jerry Allen Coyne | title = Why Evolution is True | url = http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/the-decline-effect-can-we-demonstrate-anything-in-science/ | publisher = Wordpress | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

One concern that some &lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;{{Cite web | author = John Horgan | title = The truth we'll doubt: Does the decline effect mean that all science is "truthy"? | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=the-truth-well-doubt-does-the-decli-2010-12-13 | publisher = Scientific America | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have expressed is that Lehrer's article may further fuel people's skepticism about academic science. It was long believed that Lehrer's article originally hinted that academic science is not as rigid as people would like to believe. It is especially the article's ending that has upset many scientists and led to broad criticism of the article. Lehrer ends the article by saying: "Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe." This has upset scientists in the scientific community. Many have written back to Lehrer and questioned his agenda. Some have characterized Lehrer's assertion as "absurd", while others claiming that Lehrer is trying to use publication bias as an excuse for not believing in anything.&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt;

As an answer to the many comments Lehrer received upon publishing the article, Lehrer published a comment on his blog, The Frontal Cortex,&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt; where he denied that he was implicitly questioning science and scientific methods in any way. In the same blog comment, Lehrer stated that he was not questioning fundamental scientific theories such as the theory of evolution by natural selection and global warming by calling them "two of the most robust and widely tested theories of modern science".

A further clarification was published as a follow-up note in ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt; In this note, entitled "More Thoughts on the Decline Effect", Lehrer tries mainly to answer the critics by giving examples where scientific research has both failed and succeeded. As an example, Lehrer uses [[Richard Feynman]]'s [[commencement speech]] at Caltech in 1974 as a starting point. In his commencement speech, Feynman used [[Robert Millikan]]'s and [[Harvey Fletcher]]'s [[oil drop experiment]] to measure the charge of an electron to illustrate how selective reporting can bias scientific results. On the other hand, Feynman finds solace in the fact that other scientists will repeat other scientists' experiments and hence, the truth will win out in the end.

Lehrer once again uses the follow-up note to deny that his original intention was to support people denying well verified scientific theories such as natural selection and climate change. Instead, he wishes that "we'd spend more time considering the value of second-generation antipsychotics or the verity of the latest gene-association study". In the other parts of the follow-up note, Lehrer briefly discusses some of the creative feedback he has received in order to reduce publication bias. He does not give explicit support to any specific idea. The follow-up article ends with Lehrer once again stating that the decline effect is a problem in today's science, but that science will eventually find a tool to deal with the problem.

'''Det Centrale Personregister''' ('''CPR'''; {{lang-en|Civil Registration System}}) is [[Denmark]]'s nationwide [[civil registry]]. Established in 1968, the registry contains the name, address, [[Personal identification number (Denmark)|Danish personal identification number]], date and place of birth, citizenship and other information on all the country's citizens and residents. Virtually every government agency in [[Denmark]] receives information about a person from this database.

The register is housed by [[CPR-Kontoret]] (literally "The CPR Office"), which is responsible for maintaining and developing the database and communicating data to government agencies, as well as to authorised private companies.

Anyone living in Denmark must register after 3 months (6 months if they are a citizen of a [[Nordic Council]] country). Every person registered in this database can request a free printout of his or her record.

The Danish state also runs [[Det Centrale Virksomhedsregister]] ('''CVR'''; {{lang-en|Company Registration System}}), which is a register over Danish companies, with each company being issued a unique CVR-number.&lt;ref&gt;https://erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/det-centrale-virksomhedsregister-cvr&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2724">The '''Dobrujan Germans''' ({{lang-de|Dobrudschadeutsche}}) were an [[ethnic German]] group, within the larger category of [[Black Sea Germans]], for over one hundred years. German-speaking colonists entered the approximately 23,000 km² area of [[Dobruja]] around 1840 and left during the relocation of 1940. Dobruja is a historic territory on the west coast of the [[Black Sea]].

==Colonization==
[[Image:Dobroger.png|thumb|250px|German colonies in Dobruja]]
The first of these [[Germans|German]] settlers came between 1841 and 1856 from the [[Russian Empire]]. They were farming families from the neighboring areas of [[Bessarabia]] and [[Kherson|Cherson]], who immigrated because of an economic recession in their home territories. Thirty years later colonists from [[Swabia]] also moved into the region. During this period, Dobruja still belonged to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the colonists were subject to colonization regulations from [[Turkey]]. Consequently, the Dobrujan Germans were the only [[ethnic Germans]] to ever be Turkish subjects without actually moving to Turkey (as did the [[Bosporus Germans]]). They contributed to the agricultural development of the fertile [[steppe]]s.

==Relocation==
In the first years of World War II, the majority of the 16,000 Dobrujan Germans, as well as the [[Bessarabian Germans|Bessarabian]] and [[Bukovina Germans]], were relocated into [[Germany]]. This was done under the motto: ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' (Home into the Empire). The refugees lived temporarily in relocation camps in [[Austria]], but in 1941/1942 they resettled the German occupied eastern territories in [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Poland]]. At the end of the [[Second World War|war]], they fled west, and were found as refugees in all four [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zone]]s in Germany.

'''Earth Day''' is an annual event celebrated on April 22.  Worldwide, various events are held to demonstrate support for [[environmental protection]]. First celebrated in 1970, Earth Day now includes events in more than 193 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthday.org/countries|title=Earth Day International|deadurl=yes|archivedate=March 15, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315055335/http://www.earthday.org/countries|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthday.net/ |title=Earth Day Network |publisher=Earthday.net |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 at a [[UNESCO]] Conference in San Francisco, [[List of peace activists|peace activist]] [[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]] proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General [[U Thant]] at the [[United Nations]]. A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Gaylord Nelson]] as an environmental [[teach-in]] first held on April 22, 1970. Nelson was later awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;award in recognition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/greenliving/a-brief-history-of-earth-day.html |title=Earth Day &amp;#124; Care2 Healthy Living |publisher=Care2.com |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this April 22 Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by [[Denis Hayes]], who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bullitt.org/who-we-are/staff |title=Staff — The Builtt Foundation |publisher=Bullitt.org |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therumpus.net/2009/04/the-rumpus-interview-with-denis-hayes/ |title=The Rumpus Interview With Earth Day Organizer Denis Hayes |publisher=The Rumpus.net |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous communities celebrate '''Earth Week''', an entire week of activities focused on the environmental issues that the world faces. In 2017, the [[March for Science]] occurred on Earth Day (April 22, 2017) and was followed by the [[People's Climate Mobilization]] (April 29, 2017).

==Santa Barbara Oil Blowout 1969==
{{Main|1969 Santa Barbara oil spill}}
On January 28, 1969, a well drilled by Union Oil Platform A off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out. More than three million gallons of oil spewed, killing over 10,000 seabirds, dolphins, seals, and sea lions. As a reaction to this natural disaster, activists were mobilized to create environmental regulation, environmental education, and Earth Day. Among the proponents of Earth Day were the people in the front lines of fighting this disaster, [[Selma Rubin]], [[Marc McGinnes]], and Bud Bottoms, founder of Get Oil Out.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/the-ocean-is-boiling-the-complete-oral-history-of-the-1969-santa-barbara-oil-spill-4e3eac063d8b|title=‘The Ocean Is Boiling’: The Complete Oral History of the 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill|authors=Kate Wheeling &amp; Max Ufberg |date=April 18, 2017|publisher=Pacific Standard|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Hayes|Denis Haye]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, organizer of Earth Day observance day, said that Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]] from Wisconsin was inspired to create Earth Day upon seeing Santa Barbara Channel 800 square-mile oil slick from an airplane.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://curious.kcrw.com/2017/04/how-the-1969-santa-barbara-oil-spill-sparked-earth-day |title=How the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill sparked Earth Day|author=Jonathan Bastian|date=April 21, 2017|publisher=KCRW|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santa Barbara’s Environmental Rights Day 1970==
On the first anniversary of the oil blowout, January 28, 1970, Environmental Rights Day is celebrated, where the Declaration of Environmental Rights is read. It had been written by Rod Nash during a boat trip across the Santa Barbara Channel while carrying a copy of Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/the-ocean-is-boiling-the-complete-oral-history-of-the-1969-santa-barbara-oil-spill-4e3eac063d8b|title=‘The Ocean Is Boiling’: The Complete Oral History of the 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill|authors=Kate Wheeling &amp; Max Ufberg|date=April 18, 2017|publisher=Pacific Standard|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organizers of Environmental Rights Day, led by [[Marc McGinnes]], had been working closely over a period of several months with Congressman [[Pete McCloskey]] (R-CA) to consult on the creation of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]], the first of many new environmental protection laws sparked by the national outcry about the blowout/oil spill and on the Declaration of Environmental Rights. Both McCloskey (Earth Day co-chair with Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]]) and Earth Day organizer [[Denis Hayes]], along with Senator [[Alan Cranston]], [[Paul Ehrlich]], [[David Brower]] and other prominent leaders, endorsed the Declaration and spoke about it at the Environmental Rights Day conference. According to Francis Sarguis, "the conference was sort of like the baptism for the movement." According to Hayes, this was the first giant crowd he spoke to that "felt passionately, I mean really passionately, about environmental issues." Hayes also thought the conference might be the beginning of a real movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/the-ocean-is-boiling-the-complete-oral-history-of-the-1969-santa-barbara-oil-spill-4e3eac063d8b |title=‘The Ocean Is Boiling’: The Complete Oral History of the 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill|authors=Kate Wheeling &amp; Max Ufberg|date=April 18, 2017|publisher=Pacific Standard|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nixons plant a tree C6311-11a.jpg|thumb|President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] plant a tree on the [[White House]] South Lawn to recognize the first Earth Day.]]

The first Earth Day celebrations took place in two thousand colleges and universities, roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools, and hundreds of communities across the United States. More importantly, it "brought 20 million Americans out into the spring sunshine for peaceful demonstrations in favor of environmental reform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.gov/35thanniversary/topics/epa/15c.htm |author=Jack Lewis |date=November 1985 |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |title=The Birth of EPA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922192621/http://epa.gov/35thanniversary/topics/epa/15c.htm |archivedate=September 22, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It now is observed in 192 countries, and coordinated by the nonprofit Earth Day Network, chaired by the first Earth Day 1970 organizer Denis Hayes, according to whom Earth Day is now "the largest secular holiday in the world, celebrated by more than a billion people every year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthday.org/about/default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423053633/http://www.earthday.org/about/default.aspx |archivedate=April 23, 2007 |title=About Earth Day Network |deadurl=yes |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Kelly]] created an anti-pollution poster featuring his comic strip character Pogo with the quotation [[We have met the enemy and he is us|"We have met the enemy and he is us"]] to promote the 1970 Earth Day.

===New York City===
In the winter of 1969–1970, a group of students met at [[Columbia University]] to hear Denis Hayes talk about his plans for Earth Day. Among the group were [[Fred Kent]], [[Pete Grannis]], and Kristin and William Hubbard. This group agreed to head up the New York City activities within the national movement. Fred Kent took the lead in renting an office and recruiting volunteers. "The big break came when Mayor Lindsay agreed to shut down Fifth Avenue for the event. A giant cheer went up in the office on that day," according to Kristin Hubbard (now [[Kristin Kuhns Alexandre|Kristin Alexandre]]). 'From that time on we used Mayor Lindsay's offices and even his staff. I was Speaker Coordinator but had tremendous help from Lindsay staffer Judith Crichton."

In addition to shutting down [[Fifth Avenue]], Mayor [[John Lindsay]] made [[Central Park]] available for Earth Day. In [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], ''New York Times'' estimated crowds of up to 20,000 people at any given time and, perhaps, as many as over 100,000 over the course of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 23, 1970|title=Millions Observe Earth Day with a Variety of Activities Across the Country|url=|journal=New York Times|volume=|page=30|via=ProQuest Historical Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Manhattan]] was also the home of [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[Newsweek]]'', it provided the best possible anchor for national coverage from their reporters throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/earthday/01.htm |title=The Spirit of the First Earth Day|publisher=U.S.Environmental Protection Agency|date=January–February 1990|accessdate=April 22, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328214819/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/earthday/01.htm|archivedate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia===
U.S. Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] was the keynote speaker on Earth Day in [[Fairmount Park]] in Philadelphia. Other notable attendees included consumer protection activist and presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]]; Landscape Architect [[Ian McHarg]]; Nobel prize-winning Harvard Biochemist, [[George Wald]]; U.S. Senate Minority Leader, [[Hugh Scott]]; and poet, [[Allen Ginsberg]].

==Earth Day 1990==
Mobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and lifting the status of [[list of environmental issues|environmental issues]] onto the world stage, Earth Day activities in 1990 gave a huge boost to [[recycling]] efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Unlike the first Earth Day in 1970, this 20th Anniversary was waged with stronger marketing tools, greater access to television and radio, and multimillion-dollar budgets.&lt;ref name="nytimes1989"/&gt;
[[File:Ed20-peace-climb-logo-web.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The official logo of the [[Mount Everest]] [[Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb]]]]
Two separate groups formed to sponsor Earth Day events in 1990: The Earth Day 20 Foundation, assembled by [[Edward Furia]] (Project Director of Earth Week in 1970), and Earth Day 1990, assembled by [[Denis Hayes]] (National Coordinator for Earth Day 1970). Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]], the original founder of Earth Day, was honorary chairman for both groups. The two did not combine forces over disagreements about leadership of combined organization and incompatible structures and strategies.&lt;ref name="nytimes1989"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/business/the-business-of-earth-day.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Business of Earth Day |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=November 12, 1989 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the disagreements, key Earth Day 20 Foundation organizers were critical of Earth Day 1990 for including on their board [[Hewlett-Packard]], a company that at the time was the second-biggest emitter of chlorofluorocarbons in Silicon Valley and refused to switch to alternative solvents.&lt;ref name="nytimes1989"/&gt; In terms of marketing, Earth Day 20 had a grassroots approach to organizing and relied largely on locally based groups like the [[National Toxics Campaign]], a Boston-based coalition of 1,000 local groups concerned with industrial pollution. Earth Day 1990 employed strategies including focus group testing, direct mail fund raising, and email marketing.&lt;ref name="nytimes1989" /&gt;

The Earth Day 20 Foundation highlighted its April 22 activities in [[George, Washington]], near the [[Columbia River]] with a live satellite phone call with members of the historic [[Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb]] who called from their base camp on [[Mount Everest]] to pledge their support for world peace and attention to environmental issues.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=4oJvMfeQlr8C&amp;dat=19900423&amp;printsec=frontpage|title=Ellensburg Daily Record – Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb was led by [[Jim Whittaker]], the first American to summit Mt. Everest (many years earlier), and marked the first time in history that mountaineers from the [[United States]], [[Soviet Union]], and [[China]] had roped together to climb a mountain, let alone Mt. Everest.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; The group also collected more than two tons of trash (transported down the mountain by support groups along the way) that was left behind on Mount Everest from previous climbing expeditions. The master of ceremonies for the Columbia Gorge event was the TV star, [[John Ratzenberger]], from "[[Cheers]]", and the headlining musician was the "Father of Rock and Roll," [[Chuck Berry]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

[[Warner Bros. Records]] released an Earth Day-themed single in 1990 entitled "Tomorrow's World", written by [[Kix Brooks]] (who would later become one-half of [[Brooks &amp; Dunn]]) and [[Pam Tillis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/28757025.html?dids=28757025:28757025&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+22%2C+1990&amp;author=Jack+Hurst%2C+Country+music+writer&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=Earth+calling.+.+.Help!+Cautious+Nashville+is+starting+to+turn+green&amp;pqatl=google |title=Earth calling. . .Help!

==Earth Day 2000==
Earth Day 2000 combined the ambitious spirit of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. This was the first year that Earth Day used the [[Internet]] as its principal organizing tool, and it proved invaluable nationally and internationally. Kelly Evans, a professional political organizer, served as executive director of the 2000 campaign. The event ultimately enlisted more than 5,000 environmental groups outside the United States, reaching hundreds of millions of people in a record 183 countries.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/23/us/peaceful-easy-feeling-imbues-30th-earth-day.html?pagewanted=1 |work=The New York Times |title=Peaceful, Easy Feeling Imbues 30th Earth Day |first=Jeff |last=Gerth |date=April 23, 2000 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was the official host for the event,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; and about 400,000 participants stood in the cold rain during the course of the day.

==Subsequent Earth Day events==
[[Image:Earth Day 2007 at City College San Diego.JPG|thumb|Earth Day 2007 at [[San Diego City College]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]]]]
To turn Earth Day into a sustainable annual event rather than one that occurred every 10 years, Nelson and Bruce Anderson, New Hampshire's lead organizers in 1990, formed Earth Day USA. Building on the momentum created by thousands of community organizers around the world, Earth Day USA coordinated the next five Earth Day celebrations through 1995, including the launch of EarthDay.org. Following the 25th Anniversary in 1995, the coordination baton was handed to Earth Day Network.

As the millennium approached, Hayes agreed to spearhead another campaign, this time focusing on [[global warming]] and pushing for [[Sustainable energy|clean energy]]. The April 22 Earth Day in 2000 combined the big-picture feistiness of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. For 2000, Earth Day had the [[internet]] to help link activists around the world. By the time April 22 came around, 5,000 environmental groups around the world were on board reaching out to hundreds of millions of people in a record 184 countries. Events varied: A [[talking drum]] chain traveled from village to village in [[Gabon]], [[Africa]], for example, while hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], USA.

Earth Day 2007 was one of the largest Earth Days to date, with many people participating in the activities in thousands of places including [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]; [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]; [[Tuvalu]]; [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]; [[Togo]]; [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]; [[London]]; and [[New York City|New York]].

For Earth Day 2017, the Earth Day Network created four toolkits to aid organizations wanting to hold teach-ins to celebrate the theme "Environmental and Climate Literacy."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/earth-day-network-releases-teach-in-toolkits-for-earth-day-2017/|title=Earth Day Network releases teach-in toolkits for Earth Day 2017|date=April 20, 2017|work=Davis Enterprise|access-date=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The four toolkits are:
* Earth Day Action Toolkit: Educating and Activating Communities for Change
* Environmental Teach-in Toolkit
* Global Day of Conversation Toolkit for Local Governments
* MobilizeU: Campus Teach-in Toolkit
2017 also saw the Earth Day Network co-organize the [[March for Science]] rally and teach-in at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==The Earth Day name==
According to Nelson, the moniker "Earth Day" was "an obvious and logical name" suggested by a lot of other people in the fall of 1969, including, he writes, both "a friend of mine who had been in the field of public relations" and "a New York advertising executive," [[Julian Koenig]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gaylord Nelson Papers, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Box 231, Folder 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Koenig, who had been on Nelson's organizing committee in 1969, has said that the idea came to him by the coincidence of his birthday with the day selected, April 22; "Earth Day" rhyming with "birthday," the connection seemed natural.&lt;ref name="tal"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Origin Story |url=http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |series=This American Life |airdate=June 19, 2009 |number=383 |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624012919/http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nci.org/06nci/06/NCI25thAnniversary.htm |title=Statement by Paul Leventhal on the 25th Anniversary of the Nuclear Control Institute |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names circulated during preparations—Nelson himself continued to call it the National Environment Teach-In, but national coordinator Denis Hayes used the term Earth Day in his communications and press coverage of the event was "practically unanimous" in its use of "Earth Day," so the name stuck.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The introduction of the name "Earth Day" was also claimed by John McConnell (see "Equinox Earth Day," below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.about.com/od/earthday/f/who-invented-earth-day.htm |title=Who invented Earth Day? |date=|accessdate=March 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Canadian Earth Day was held on Thursday, September 11, 1980, and was organized by Paul D. Tinari, then a graduate student in Engineering Physics/Solar Engineering at Queen's University. [[Flora MacDonald (politician)|Flora MacDonald]], then [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Kingston and the Islands]] and former Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, officially opened Earth Day Week on September 6, 1980 with a ceremonial tree planting and encouraged MPs and [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPPs]] across the country to declare a cross-Canada annual Earth Day. The principal activities taking place on the first Earth Day included educational lectures given by experts in various environmental fields, garbage and litter pick-up by students along city roads and highways as well as tree plantings to replace the trees killed by Dutch Elm Disease.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, Teresa (July 23, 1980), "A Little Litter is Too Much", ''Kingston This Week''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Sylvia (July 1980), "Canada's First Earth Day Scheduled for Sept. 11", ''The Kingston Whig Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Equinox Earth Day (March 20)==

The equinoctial Earth Day is celebrated on the [[March equinox]] (around March 20) to mark the precise moment of astronomical [[spring (season)|spring]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and of astronomical [[autumn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.

[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |publisher="EarthSite" |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced the idea of a global holiday called "Earth Day" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

United Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.&lt;br /&gt;
Earth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way – which is also the most ancient way – by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mead, "Earth Day," EPA Journal, March 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration. On March 20, 2008, in addition to the ceremony at the United Nations, ceremonies were held in New Zealand, and bells were sounded in California, Vienna, Paris, Lithuania, Tokyo, and many other locations. The equinox Earth Day at the UN is organized by the Earth Society Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthsocietyfoundation.org |title=Earth Society Foundation |publisher="Earth Society Foundation" |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Day ringing the peace bell is celebrated around the world in many towns, ringing the Peace Bell in [[Vienna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorfwiki.org/wiki.cgi?Earth__Day/EarthDay2010 |title=Earth Day 2010 |publisher=Dorf Wiki |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berlin]], and elsewhere. A memorable event took place at the UN in Geneva, celebrating a Minute for Peace ringing the Japanese Shinagawa Peace Bell with the help of the Geneva Friendship Association and the Global Youth Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newciv.org/nl/newslog.php/_v396/__show_day/_w2011-03-21 |title=Seeds of Change - Heiner Benking's Blog - quergeist.info |publisher=Newciv.org |date=March 21, 2011 |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly after in deep mourning about the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] catastrophe 10 days before.

Beside the Spring Equinox for the Northern Hemisphere, the observance of the Spring Equinox for the Southern Hemisphere in September is of equal importance. The International Day of Peace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/events/peaceday/ |title=International Day of Peace, 21 September 2012 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is celebrated on September 21, and can thus be considered to accord with the original intentions of [[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]], [[U Thant]] and others.

==April 22 observances==

===Growing eco-activism before Earth Day 1970===
In 1968, [[Morton Hilbert]] and the U.S. Public Health Service organized the Human Ecology Symposium, an environmental conference for students to hear from scientists about the effects of environmental degradation on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=bhlead;cc=bhlead;view=text;rgn=main;didno=umich-bhl-07183 |title=Bentley Historical Library Finding Aids |publisher=Quod.lib.umich.edu |date=October 18, 1976 |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of Earth Day. For the next two years, Hilbert and students worked to plan the first Earth Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sph.umich.edu/about/timeline.html |title=Historical Timeline – About UM SPH |publisher=Sph.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011109091133/http://www.sph.umich.edu/about/timeline.html |archivedate=November 9, 2001 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1970—along with a federal proclamation from U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson—the first Earth Day was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=2535 |title=Earth Day co-founder Morton S. Hilbert dies |publisher=Ns.umich.edu |date=January 5, 1999 |accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Survival]], an early environmentalism-awareness education event, was held at [[Northwestern University]] on January 23, 1970. This was the first of several events held at university campuses across the United States in the lead-up to the first Earth Day. Also, [[Ralph Nader]] began talking about the importance of [[ecology]] in 1970.

The 1960s had been a very dynamic period for ecology in the US. Pre-1960 grassroots activism against [[DDT]] in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and widespread opposition to open-air [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]] with their global [[nuclear fallout]], had inspired [[Rachel Carson]] to write her influential bestseller, ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962).

===Significance of April 22===
[[File:NASA-14147-EarthDay20140422-GlobalSelfie-20140522.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Global [[selfie]] – Earth Day, April 22, 2014.]]
Nelson chose the date in order to maximize participation on college campuses for what he conceived as an "environmental teach-in". He determined the week of April 19–25 was the best bet as it did not fall during exams or spring breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonearthday.net/earth-day/proposal.htm |title=A proposal reprinted across the country |date=April 18, 2010 |publisher=Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326062706/http://www.nelsonearthday.net/earth-day/proposal.htm |archivedate=March 26, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it did not conflict with religious holidays such as Easter or Passover, and was late enough in spring to have decent weather. More students were likely to be in class, and there would be less competition with other mid-week events—so he chose Wednesday, April 22. The day also fell after the anniversary of the birth of noted conservationist [[John Muir]]. The [[National Park Service]], [[John Muir National Historic Site]], has a celebration every year on or around Earth Day (April 21, 22 or 23), called Birthday-Earth Day, in recognition of Earth Day and John Muir's contribution to the collective consciousness of environmentalism and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/jomu/planyourvisit/john-muir-birthday-earth-day-2016.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported that some suspected the date was not a coincidence, but a clue that the event was "a Communist trick", and quoted a member of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] as saying, "subversive elements plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them."&lt;ref name="time-memento"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943782,00.html |title=A Memento Mori to the Earth |date=May 4, 1970 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.

Subbotniks were also imposed on other countries within the compass of Soviet power, including Eastern Europe, and at the height of its power the Soviet Union established a nationwide subbotnik to be celebrated on Lenin's birthday, April 22, which had been proclaimed a national holiday celebrating communism by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1955.

The '''Chinese community in Belize''' consists of descendants of Chinese immigrants who were brought to [[British Honduras]] as indentured laborers as well as recent immigrants from China and Taiwan.

==History==
===Early history===
The importation of Chinese workers to British Honduras was a response to economic shifts in the mid-19th century. As [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] and [[mahogany]] production declined, [[sugarcane]] [[plantations]] became of increasing importance. Recruitment of workers from China was facilitated by the colonial governor [[John Gardiner Austin]], who had previously served as a labour broker in [[Xiamen]], [[Fujian]] on China's southeast coast.&lt;ref name="Robinson108"&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA108 108]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 474 Chinese workers thus arrived in British Honduras in 1865.&lt;ref name="Meagher254"&gt;{{harvnb|Meagher|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=H7dBmBsd-XgC&amp;pg=PA254 254]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were sent to the north of the colony, but were reassigned to central and southern areas beginning in 1866 due to the large numbers of deaths and abscondments.&lt;ref name="Robinson108"/&gt; By 1869, only 211 remained accounted for; 108 had died, while another 155 had sought refuge with the native peoples at [[Chan Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name="Meagher254"/&gt; Many of the deaths were due to suicide in response to horrifying working conditions.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA109 109]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More Chinese laborers migrated to Belize in the early 20th century. The second largest batch came just before the outbreak of World War II, when they traveled to the United States from where they gradually trickled southward by land to Mexico and [[Central America]].
The Chinese were originally brought to Belize as Indentured Servants as Slaves.

===Late 20th century===
Belize's [[Immigrant investor programs|citizenship-by-investment]] programme, which began in 1986, was a popular option among Chinese migrants in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=50aL41XGlQAC&amp;pg=PA27 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the demand, the price rose from US$25,000 to US$50,000 in 1997. Hong Kong migrants, who lacked real [[British citizenship]] but only had [[British National (Overseas)]] status, sought to obtain [[Belizean passport]]s as an insurance policy in case conditions in their homeland went downhill after the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|1997 resumption of sovereignty by China]]. [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] migrants, for their part, sought to use Belize as a stepping stone to get around tough [[U.S. immigration policy toward the People's Republic of China|U.S. migration policy against them]]; however, the U.S. tightened up its visa requirements for Belizeans in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=50aL41XGlQAC&amp;pg=PA166 166]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants from [[Taiwan]] also took advantage of this programme.&lt;ref name="Sutherland25"&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=50aL41XGlQAC&amp;pg=PA25 25]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among migrants from Taiwan it was especially popular to bring aged relatives to settle in Belize.&lt;ref name="Sutherland28"/&gt;

Not all of the migrants returned to their homeland or went on to the U.S.; some settled in the [[Belize River]] on the tracts of land that the government granted them in exchange for their investments, bringing in workers to building houses and schools. In the mid-1990s there may have been as many as six or seven thousand Chinese people in Belize. However, when the government tightened its work permit policies, an exodus began &amp;mdash; the migrants went to other Chinese communities in [[Chinese people in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Thai Chinese|Thailand]], and [[Chinese Filipino|the Philippines]] where migration policies were more favourable. By 1998 the Chinese were estimated to have fallen to about 1.5% of the Belizean population, or three thousand people. [[Corozal Town|Corozal]] for example was reported to have had a peak Chinese population of 500, but then fell to just one-tenth that.&lt;ref name="Sutherland28"&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=50aL41XGlQAC&amp;pg=PA28 28]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and employment==
In the 19th century, during the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]] in neighbouring [[Yucatán]], [[Mexico]], Chinese and Lebanese shopkeepers began setting up businesses in [[Belize City]]. A hardware store run by a Chinese migrant named Augusto Quan was well known as the only supplier of certain tools, nails, and buckets for a long time.&lt;ref name="Sutherland25"/&gt; Others established laundries, brothels, gambling houses, '''[http://ajclub.org/live-draw-xiamen-lottery/ Live Draw Xiamen Lottery]''' and restaurants.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Today the Chinese community control most of the economy and became dominant in the grocery, restaurant, fast food, and lottery trades.

==Demography==
The 2000 Census found 1,716 Chinese people (0.7% of the population) living in the country, and 1,607 people speaking Chinese as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Census|2000|loc=Tables B1 &amp; B7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese are an overwhelmingly urban population, with five-sixths living in cities, the highest proportion out of all tabulated ethnic groups. This is a slightly higher proportion than [[Garifuna people]] and Creoles, but contrasted sharply with East Indians, of whom roughly half live in rural areas. The majority live in [[Belize City]] (988 people) and [[Cayo District]] wherein lies the capital [[Belmopan]] (351 people).&lt;ref name="Census2000"/&gt; Compared to other ethnic groups their median level of education is higher, with 46% having completed secondary education, a proportion second only to Africans and Caucasians, similar to that of Spanish people, and more than double that of Creoles, Garifuna people, East Indians, and other ethnic groups; however, relatively few (12%) go on to tertiary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Census|2000|loc=Table D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to hire Chinese interpreters for the census, the Central Statistical Office indicated in an official report that many Chinese migrants, like other foreign-born persons, did not respond to the census and thus were undercounted. The language barrier may have been compounded by the fact that [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]]' unwillingness to participate in the census for fear that the information they provided could be used for law enforcement; however this may have been ameliorated somewhat by an immigration amnesty in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Census|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 Census did not break out Chinese separately, but recorded 2,823 "Asians" (a separate category from "East Indians").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Census|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Unusual naming customs arose among Chinese people in Belize. Indentured migrants were assigned identifying numbers, which were sometimes used in place of names. Workers sometimes traded numbers or misused numbers of deceased fellows to obtain extra rations. After they had filled their indenture contracts, they had to register their own names. Some used approximations of their Chinese names, some took on English given names while keeping Chinese surnames, while others (especially those who had remigrated from Guatemala) had Spanish translations of their Chinese surnames.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&amp;pg=PA111 111]&amp;ndash;112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important festival for the Chinese community is [[Lunar New Year]], which falls on the first day of the first lunar month. Lion dances, accompanied by cymbals, drums, gongs, and firecrackers are a common sight during these festivities.

For a majority of the Chinese, religion is a mixture of all the various Chinese philosophies. The older generation, especially the women, continue to practice an abbreviated form of [[ancestor worship]] and [[Buddhism]], while most of their children born in Belize have adopted [[Catholicism]] consequent upon their Catholic education.

==Organisations==
Community organisations include the Belize Chinese Association, which conducts [[Chinese New Year]] gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.reporter.bz/index.php?mod=archive&amp;act=view&amp;article=4948|title=Chinese Celebrate New Year|periodical=The Belize Reporter|date=2011-02-13|accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its former president [[Lee Mark Chang]] has also been active in speaking out against crime committed against Chinese businesspeople, and responding to accusations that the businesspeople themselves bear responsibility for the crime because they do not provide employment opportunities to local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=16923|title=The Chinese Community's Contribution|periodical=7 News Belize|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the BCA organised a nationwide shutdown of Chinese shops in response to the murder of 14-year-old Hellen Yu, a local-born girl of Chinese descent, during a robbery of her parents shop; BCA secretary Eric Chang expressed disappointment at other Belizeans' indifference to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=10206|first=Daniel|last=Ortiz|date=2010-08-20|title=Hellen Yu’s murder sparks Chinese business shutdown|periodical=Amandala News|accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the BCA and the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce organised joint street protests in response to the murder of two Chinese women. New BCA president Edmund Quan was quoted as stating that his organisation would submit requests to the authorities for amendments of relevant criminal laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.antiguaobserver.com/?p=56823|title=Asian community protest murder of two female shop keepers|periodical=Antigua Observer|date=2011-04-05|accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community relations==
Racism in Belize is directed by [[Belizean Creole people]] against both the indigenous Maya people of Belize as well as recent migrants such as the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mwakikagile|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BQiEyaVNUWQC&amp;pg=PA138 138]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with mestizos, Chinese, as a [[visible minority]], are highly vulnerable to being targeted for exclusion from society. Chinese themselves are often reluctant to integrate into local society, preferring to maintain their own institutions and social circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mwakikagile|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BQiEyaVNUWQC&amp;pg=PA192 192]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of robberies against Chinese shopkeepers has also contributed to poor relations between Chinese and Creoles; many of these robberies are believed to be committed by Creole gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mwakikagile|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BQiEyaVNUWQC&amp;pg=PA194 194]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the iron window bars which Chinese merchants use to protect their businesses from burglary are seen as a symbol of their desire to remain aloof from Belizean society. Resentment at the commercial success of Asians (both East Indians and Chinese) is also widespread, especially because they run [[family business]]es which rarely offer employment opportunities to outsiders. Few learn to speak the [[Belizean Kriol language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mwakikagile|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BQiEyaVNUWQC&amp;pg=PA188 188]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese people's extensive use of the economic citizenship programme has also proven to be controversial among local people.&lt;ref name="Sutherland25"/&gt;

==Enactments==
King [[Childebert I|Childebert]] had ordered the Council to be summoned&lt;ref&gt;Mansi, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; to deal with the case of Bishop Marcus of Orleans, who had been driven from his See.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory of Tours, ''De vitis patrum,'' ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  After defending [[Mark, Bishop of Orléans]], from attacks made upon him, finding nothing in the charges made by his enemies, the Council issued some twenty-four canons.&lt;ref&gt;Mansi, pp. 129-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council pronounced an [[anathema]] against the errors of [[Nestorius]] and [[Eutyches]] (Canon I).  It prohibited [[simony]], and prescribed that the election of bishops take place in all freedom, by the clergy and the people, and with the consent of the king (Canon X).&lt;ref&gt;Mansi, p. 131:  ''ut nulli epsicopatum praemiis aut comparatione liceat adipisci, sed ucm voluntate regis, juxta electionem cleri ac plebis, sicut in antiquis canonibus tenetur scriptum, a metropolitano vel quem in vice sua praemiserit, cum provincialibus pontifex consecretur.''    The sentence is paraphrased by Hefele, pp. 368-369.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise,  that no one be consecrated a bishop until he had been one year in the clergy, during which he is to be taught by learned and proven persons in spiritual discipline and rules (Canon IX).

It censured all who attempted to subject slaves who had been emancipated within the church to any [[Indentured servitude|servitude]] whatsoever, and those who dared take, retain, or dispose of church property (Canon XXII).  It stated however that bishops should not ordain slaves, and that a slave who was freed should not be ordained without the consent of his former master (Canon VI). It threatened with [[excommunication]] all who embezzled or appropriated funds given by [[Childebert I|King Childebert]] for the foundation of a hospital of [[Lyon]] (Canon XV), and it placed [[leprosy|lepers]] under the special charge of each bishop.

The Council ruled that if any cleric of any degree should return to the marriage bed, he should be deprived of his clerical Order and his office, but that communion must be administered to him (Canon IV).

It forbade priests from suspending persons from Holy Communion for small and trivial reasons, and ordered that they should adhere to the traditional rules of the Church Fathers (Canon II).
===Cannon of the Council===
The minutes of the council are 24 canons.
# The first canon of the council pronounced an anathema against the errors of Nestorius and Eutyches. The council seems to have feared that the troubles that appeared in the East and aroused by the Nestorians and Eutychians do not spread in the West.
# The second canon prohibits bishops from excommunicating for light causes.
# The third canon prohibits clerics from having at home foreign women or relatives at undue hours, which can create bad suspicions.
# The fourth canon commands the clergy to live in continence, even with their lawful wives.
# The fifth canon prohibits bishops from ordering clerics from another diocese without the consent of the bishop of the latter diocese.
# The sixth canon prohibits bishops from ordering slaves or freedmen without the consent of their master.
# The seventh canon forbids the slavery of enslaved slaves in the church, unless they have committed marked faults in the law.
# The eighth canon forbids the bishops to ordain clerics during the vacancy of the episcopal see.
# The ninth canon forbids a bishop to be consecrated if he has not belonged to the clergy for at least a year.
# The tenth canon forbids simony and buying the episcopate by money. He has prescribed that the election of bishops be conducted with complete freedom, with the consent of the clergy, the people, and the king.
# The eleventh canon prohibits imposing on the people a bishop whom he has not accepted. Otherwise the ordained bishop will be deposed.
# The twelfth canon forbids the ordination of a bishop in the place of a living bishop, if he is not deposed as a capital crime.
# The thirteenth canon prohibits the taking of bequeathed goods to churches, monasteries and hospitals.
# The fourteenth canon extends this prohibition to bishops, clerics, and laymen in relation to the property of the Church.
# The fifteenth canon confirms the foundation of a hospital in Lyon by Childebert and it is forbidden to the bishop of Lyon and his successors to claim some property from this hospital.
# The sixteenth canon pronounces anathema against anyone who dares to deprive the churches of the donations made to them.
# The seventeenth canon deals with disputes between a person and a bishop.
# The eighteenth canon suspends for six months any bishop who refuses to come to a council or to leave before the end, except for obvious infirmity.
# The nineteenth canon deals with the entry of girls into monasteries and the conditions of taking the religious habit.
# The twentieth canon says that prisoners for any crime whatsoever will be visited every Sunday by the archdeacon.
# The twenty-first canon indicates that the bishops will take special care of the lepers in their diocese by providing clothing and food.

{{History of the Philippines}}
[[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] played a role in pre-Hispanic Philippine history. Malay involvement in [[History of the Philippines|Philippine history]] goes back to the Classical Era with the establishment of Rajahnates as well as the Islamic era, in which various sultanates and Islamic states were formed in [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]].

Malays made large contribution to Philippine history, and influenced modern-day lifestyles of [[Filipinos]]. The [[Malay language]] was the lingua franca of the archipelago prior to [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish rule]]. Due to the religious history of the [[Malay Archipelago]], many of these historical rulers also contained a mix of [[Arabs|Arab]] or [[Indian people|Indian]] ancestry in addition to their Malay descent.

The Philippines doesn't have a significant ethnic [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] population today, and most if any, descendants of Malays have been assimilated into the general culture, characterized by Spanish influence and [[Roman Catholicism]]. Malay influence is still strong in the culturally conservative regions of [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]], whose' people actually reject being called ''Filipino'', and to some extent, in [[Visayas]] as well where much Malay involvement came during the classical era. These three island groups are where most Filipinos of Malay descent live.

In the modern-day, the closest population to Malays are the Moro people, the native Muslim population of the Philippines that inhabit Mindanao, Sulu Archipelago, parts of Visayas and the Quiapo district in Manila. They follow a culture and lifestyle similar to Malays.

There is an often a lot of confusion in the Philippines between "ethnic Malays" and "[[Malay race]]", a term coined for brown-skinned Austronesian natives of not only the [[Philippines]], but also of [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Brunei]], [[Singapore]] and southern [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jory |first1=Patrick |last2= |first2= |date=2007 |title=From Melayu Patani to Thai Muslim: The spectre of ethnic identity in southern Thailand |journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies |volume=15 |issue=02 |pages=273 |doi=10.5367/000000007781509535 |jstor=23750846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country had its own Malay nationalism, un-associated with the [[Early Malay nationalism|anti-colonial struggle in the British and Dutch East Indies]]. The Philippine nationalism occurred albeit the end of [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish occupation]] and spearheaded by [[José Rizal]]. Unlike the Malay nationalism and "[[Malayness]]" in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] which was defined by [[Islam]] as well as being of the ethnic group, Rizal's movement was that of a secular vision to unify the natives of the [[Malay Archipelago]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]], believing them to have falsely been divided by colonial powers.

==History==
Interaction between the natives of the Philippines and the Malay [[Srivijaya]] Kingdom (as well as the Javanese kingdoms of Majapahit and Medang) are recorded by the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, which dates approximately 900 A.D. This steel plate was written in a mix of Old Tagalog, [[Old Malay]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. Among the Malays, the classical Philippine kingdoms also interacted with other native peoples of [[Indonesia]], including the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]].

The first-recorded Malay in Philippine history was Sri Lumay, although accounts him are mostly in Visayan folklore. Sri Lumay was born in Sumatra, an island in Indonesia with a high [[Malay Indonesian|Malay-population]], and was of mixed Malay and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] descent.&lt;ref name=bulwagan&gt;[http://thebulwaganfoundation.wordpress.com/2010/09/01/the-rajahnate-of-cebu/ The Rajahnate of Cebu], [http://thebulwaganfoundation.wordpress.com/ The Bulwagan Foundation Trust]. {{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in somewhere in modern-day Visayas. Sri Lumay established the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]]. His sons also ruled nearby regions and kingdoms.

The name "Visayas" originates from the name "Srivijaya", the name of the aforementioned ancient [[Srivijaya Empire|Malay kingdom of the same]] that was centered in [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]].

Upon the Islamization of the southern Philippines, Sri Lumay was known to have resisted the Islamic expansion, and enacted a scorched-earth policy for the Moro raiders.

In the 16th century, the Islamization of the [[Alam Melayu]] (literally "Malay realm") was near-complete and its influence had spilled into the Philippines. [[Sharif Kabungsuwan]], a native of [[Johore]] migrated to Mindanao where he preached Islam to the inland natives - and established the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]].&lt;ref name=mnlf&gt;http://www.mnlf.net/History/The%20Maguindanao%20Sultanate.htm {{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209134649/http://www.mnlf.net/History/The%20Maguindanao%20Sultanate.htm |date=December 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/lppsec/pp/maguindanao.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:59:24 {{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His descendants provided Mindanao with a fierce resistance to Spanish occupation, one of his descendants, Muhammad Dipaduan Kudarat is known as a national hero in the Philippines.

The late 15th century and through 1521 is filled with preachers of Islam, particularly Malays, along with Arabs, Chinese Muslim and Indian Muslims spreading Islam in the southern Philippines. During the reign of Sultan Bolkiah of Brunei, the Bruneian armies attacked the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] and established the [[Kingdom of Maynila|Kingdom of Selurong]], or Seludong where modern-day Manila is located. This was a Bruneian satellite state, and was placed under the rule of [[Rajah Sulayman]], a native Muslim from the Manila area.

[[Rajah Sulayman]] came from a long line of rulers, of mixed [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] and [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] descent. His grandfather for example, [[Rajah Sulaiman I|Salila]], was a descendant of the Bolkiah family from Brunei.

In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Visayas where he encountered [[Rajah Humabon]], one of Sri Lumay's descendants. Humabon accepted Roman Catholicism, and urged his rival [[Lapu-Lapu]] to allow Europeans. Magellan used his Malay servant, Enrique of Malacca to converse with the natives. Magellan and Enrique both perished in the Battle of Mactan.

===Pan-Malayan movement===
Throughout the 300 years of Spanish colonization, any sort of Malay identity was lost in assimilation, even in the Muslim south where [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was the favored and promoted language over [[Malay language|Malay]]. [[José Rizal]], an avid pan-Malayan nationalist spearheaded a movement to "re-unite" the natives of the archipelago with that of its southern neighbors in what would today become the countries of [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Brunei]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]].

This type of "Malayan" movement was significantly different than the one that took place in [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. While those movements were focused on the [[Ethnic Malays|lone ethnic group]] originating from [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]], Rizal envisioned a larger pan-Austronesian nation, what would later become coined as the [[Malay race]]. Rizal's movement was known as the "Indios Bravos", ("Brave Indians"). Rizal had actually tried to learn [[Malay language|Malay]], but he was executed in 1896, therefore never getting a chance to fully revive the Malay language in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/57875/pre-malaysia-federation--the-malay-ties-that-bind-and-a-pan-malay-dream-betrayed|title=Pre-Malaysia Federation: The 'Malay' ties that bind, and a pan-Malay dream betrayed|author=Joel C. Paredes|publisher=Interaksyon|date=25 March 2013|accessdate=29 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305073234/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/57875/pre-malaysia-federation--the-malay-ties-that-bind-and-a-pan-malay-dream-betrayed|archive-date=5 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wenceslao Vinzons]], a Filipino politician and guerrilla leader during World War II, was another noted pan-Malayan nationalist. He found the ''Perhimpoenan Orang Melayu'' ("Pan Malay Alliance") at the [[University of the Philippines]].

It is for this reason that definition of "Malay" in the Philippines differ from that of its southern neighbors, therefore making it difficult to get an accurate estimate of who contains descent from the actual ethnic group. As for "Malay race", this would cover approximately 90,000,000 natives in the Philippines.

==Religion==
{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
Historically, the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] in the [[Philippines]] followed the religious trend of Maritime Southeast Asia. They followed a mix of [[Animism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Paganism]]. They introduced cultural influence from the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

In the late 15th century through the 16th century, the Islamisation of the Malay realm also influenced the Philippines, and the Malays introduced Islam. [[Sharif Kabungsuwan]], a Johor-born native of [[Ethnic Malay|Malay]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] descent introduced [[Islam]]. [[Rajah Sulayman]], the ruler of [[Kingdom of Maynila|Seludong]], was a Muslim convert.

During the Spanish occupation, the overwhelming majority were converted to [[Christianity]], [[Roman Catholicism]] to be specific. [[Enrique of Malacca]], a Malaccan Malay who accompanied the Portuguese conquistador [[Ferdinand Magellan]] to [[Cebu]], was a convert to [[Roman Catholicism]], though he wasn't converted in the Philippines and was already a Catholic convert upon arrival. [[Rajah Humabon]], a descendant of Sri Lumay, as well as [[Lakan Dula]] of [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo]], both converted to Catholicism and were given the names "Carlos".

==Modern misconceptions==
It is understood in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] that [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], as in the ethnic group, are those who speak Malay a native language. In [[Indonesia]], Malay and Indonesian are regarded as two different languages. The [[Malay race]], on the other hand, is not the same as the ethnic group, and simply refers to the [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] natives of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Though the ethnic Malays are part of the bigger Malay Race.

In the [[Philippines]], there is misconception and often mixing between the two definitions. Filipinos consider Malays as being the natives of the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]]. Consequently, Filipinos consider themselves Malay when in reality, they are referring to the Malay Race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2013/02/are-filipinos-malays/|title=Are Filipinos Malays?|author=Mong Palatino|publisher=[[The Diplomat]]|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filipinos in Singapore]] also prefer to be [[Malay Singaporean|considered Malay]], but their desire to be labeled as part of the ethnic group was rejected by the Singaporean government. Paradoxically, a minor percentage of Filipinos prefer the Spanish influence and may associate themselves with being [[Hispanics|Hispanic]], and have made no realistic attempts to promote and/or revive the Malay language in the Philippines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

This leads to misconceptions about the ancient rulers of the Philippines. [[Lapu-Lapu]] for example was thought to be a Malay Muslim, though he was ethnically [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] and his religious background is obscure. Though the [[Moro people|Bangsamoro]] follows a Malay-influenced culture, they are also mistakenly called Malays by the majority of Christian Filipinos.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[José Rizal]], the Philippines' most regarded national hero is often called the "Pride of the Malay Race".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This gave rise to a political concept known as [[Maphilindo]], a proposed confederation that would consist of [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]. With the creation of [[ASEAN]], this proposal never manifested.

'''Gokomere''' is a place in [[Zimbabwe]], sixteen kilometers from [[Masvingo]] known for its rock art dating from 300 to 650 AD.

The ancient [[Bantu people]] who inhabited the area of [[Great Zimbabwe]] around the 4th century AD probably built the complex between 1000 and 1200 AD. The Gokomere traded via ancient trading routes over the [[Chimanimani]] mountains on the current [[Zimbabwe]] / [[Mozambique]] border with the [[Swahili culture|Swahili]] civilization on the Kenyan and Tanzanian coast. This group gave rise to the ma[[Shona people|Shona]] and the wa[[Rozwi]] tribes. They may also comprise the majority of the African ancestry of the [[Lemba people|Lemba]] people, who claim descent from the ancient Jews via [[Sena, Yemen|Sena]] in Yemen, this belief however is due to Christian influence. The modern descendants of the waRozwi are called the baRotse tribe. Gokomere also refers to a school located close to the town of [[Masvingo]]. They speak the [[Kalanga language|Karanga]] language and second languages like [[English language|English]] in Zimbabwe and Sena, [[Ndau dialect]] of [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] in Mozambique.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">There is a criticism of the [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]].  The criticism stems from the fact that this measurement of [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] does not account for [[environmental degradation]] and [[resource depletion]].  A new approach to the situation of allocating these omitted environmental features in the [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] has been the advent of the '''green national product'''.

== Criticism of gross national product ==

The [[gross national product]] (GNP) measures the [[Welfare economics|welfare]] of a nation's economy through the aggregate of products and services produced in that nation.  Although GNP is a proficient measurement of the magnitude of the economy, many economists, environmentalists and citizens have been arguing the validity of the GNP in respect to measuring [[Welfare economics|welfare]].  [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize–winning economist]], states that this standard measurement for any [[national economy]] has become deficient as a measure of long-term economic health in our recently resource-driven and [[Globalization|globalizing]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/02/8387507/index.htm?postversion=2006092508 | title=Good Numbers Gone Bad | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2008-04-02 | date=2006-10-02 | first=Joseph | last=Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics suggest that GNP often includes the environment on the wrong side of the balance sheet because if someone first pollutes and then another person cleans the pollution, both activities add to GNP making environmental degradation frequently look good for the economy.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | title=Green Accounting | publisher=[[Gernot Wagner]] | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223603/http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | archive-date=2008-03-07 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of [[mainstream economics]] complain that GNP compiles spending that makes us worse off, spending that allows us to stay in the same place, and spending that makes us better off all in a single measure, giving a nation no clue if they are making progress or not.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", [[University Press of America]], c1994. p.2 "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manfred Max-Neef]], Chilean economist, explains that politicians feel that it is irrelevant whether the spending is productive, unproductive, or destructive.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"/&gt;  In this sense, it is common to see political policies that call to depredate a natural resource in order to increase the GNP.  To take into account the environmental depredation and resource depletion, there is a call to shift away from the traditional GNP and construct an assessment of national product that takes into account environmental effects.

== History ==

=== Measure of economic welfare ===

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, scientists and economists have warned of an [[inflection point]] for the United States economy where expansion is inevitably limited by the steadily decreasing availability of natural resources.  In 1973, [[William D. Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]], [[Yale University|Yale]] economists, were the first to question the GNP in "is growth obsolete?"  Nordhaus and Tobin developed a [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW) and stated that welfare must be sustainable, in the sense that nations that devour their stock of capital are not as "well" as the national income would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p03b/p0398a.pdf |format = pdf |  title=Is Growth Obsolete? | publisher=Milton Moss | year=1973 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Index of sustainable economic welfare ===

However, in "The Green National Product", Clifford Cobb and John Cobb argue that the Measure of Economic Welfare failed to encompass the depletion of [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.10-11 "How to Measure Welfare: Some Options"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, [[Herman Daly]], John Cobb, and Clifford Cobb created what is known as the [[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]] (ISEW).  This new measurement of welfare was created in the hopes that it would replace the flawed GNP.  Herman Daly stated that the key flaw of the traditional GNP was that it ignored core accounting principles of business where all revenues and expenses are allocated to income.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | publisher=National Public Radio | date=April 9, 2004 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233502/http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archive-date=2008-04-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ISEW called for ecological and economic sustainability to coincide since the economy is ultimately dependent on the natural resources that the earth provides.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than the original GNP, ISEW takes into account costs that are naturally unsustainable.  By creating ISEW, they wanted to expand the current national product so that individuals, businesses, and governments could take actions that will generally enhance welfare, rather than merely enhancing the traditional GNP.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280-281 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genuine progress indicator ===

In 1995, Redefining Progress created the [[genuine progress indicator]] (GPI) as an alternative to the traditional GNP.  This new measurement of national income would allow policymakers to gauge how well citizens are, economically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redifining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike welfare adjustments in the past like MEW and ISEW, GPI adjusts not only for environmental depredation, but also for income distribution, housework, volunteering, crime, changes in leisure time, and life-span of consumer durables and public infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redefining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the first alternatives to the traditional GNP to be used by the scientific community and governmental organizations globally.

=== In the United States ===

In 1992, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] initiated intensive work to create an environmental accounting system.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rcted.ncu.edu.tw/speech/On%20Green%20NP%202007%201117[1].pdf |format = pdf |  title=On "Green National Product": Theories and a Comparison Among Difference Approaches | publisher=Eolss Publishers | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA began by creating satellite accounts with easily measurable commodities such as petroleum and coal.  The first BEA publication was the U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts (IEESA) in 1994.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;  The initial results were quite significant, and showed how GNP was overestimating the impact of mining industries in respect to the nations economic wealth.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"/&gt;  Mining companies didn't care for the initial publications, for obvious reasons, and soon [[Alan Mollohan]], a Democratic House Representative from [[West Virginia]]'s coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 [[Appropriation Bill]].  In response, Congress directed the BEA to suspend further work in [[Sustainability measurement|environmental accounting]], and to obtain an external review on their findings.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;

== Need ==

Many people are calling for a green national product that would indicate if activities benefit or harm the economy and well-being.  This green national product would revolve around the social and economic issues on which many green movements have focused: care for the earth and all that sustain it.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"/&gt;  This new national product would differ from the traditional GNP by addressing both the sustainability and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"/&gt;  It is essential that this system takes into account natural capital, which is currently hidden from our traditional measurement.

== Background ==
[[File:Prithvinarayanshah.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], First King of Unified [[Kingdom of Gorkha]].]]

During the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814–16) between the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] (present-day [[Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal]]) and the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], the Gorkhali soldiers made an impression on the British, who called them ''Gurkhas''.&lt;ref&gt;

== British East India Company Army ==
[[File:Eight Gurkha men depicted in a British Indian painting, 1815.jpg|thumb|Gurkha soldiers during the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]], 1815.]]

The Anglo-Nepalese war was fought between the Gurkha [[Kingdom of Nepal]] and the [[British East India Company]] as a result of border disputes and ambitious expansionism of both the belligerent parties. The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816.

David Ochterlony and British political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Gurkha army and employ them as irregular forces. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George’s Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he "had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions". 

About 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.

As well as Ochterlony’s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lt. Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion--the Kumaon--was also raised, eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.

Gurkhas served as troops under contract to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in the [[Pindaree War]] of 1817, in [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] in 1826 and the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10782099 |title= Who are the Gurkhas?|date=27 July 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the [[British Indian Army]] on its formation. The [[2nd Gurkha Rifles|8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion]] made a particularly notable contribution during the conflict, and indeed 25 [[Indian Order of Merit]] awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=58}} 

Three days after the mutiny began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 km a day.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=57}} Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended [[Raja Hindu Rao|Hindu Rao]]'s house, losing 327 out of 490 men. During this action they fought side-by-side with the [[60th Rifles]] and a strong bond developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.army.mod.uk/gurkhas/history.aspx | title = History of the Brigade of Gurkhas | publisher = website of the Brigade of Gurkhas |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120403165108/http://www.army.mod.uk/gurkhas/history.aspx |archivedate= 3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Heather |last=Streets |year=2004 |title=Martial races: the military, race and masculinity in British imperial culture, 1857–1914 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-7190-6962-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BscnZT_1po8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 79] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve regiments from the Nepalese Army also took part in the relief of [[Lucknow]]{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=62–63}} under the command of Shri Teen (3) Maharaja [[Jung Bahadur Rana]] of Nepal and his older brother C-in-C [[Ranodip Singh Kunwar]] (Ranaudip Singh Bahadur Rana) (later to succeed Jung Bahadur and become Sri Teen Maharaja Ranodip Singh of Nepal).

After the rebellion the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|60th Rifles]] pressed for the Sirmoor Battalion to become a rifle regiment. This honor was granted then next year (1858) when the battalion was renamed the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|Sirmoor Rifle Regiment]] and awarded a third color.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rZ9HeuRZvTMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 13]}} In 1863 [[Queen Victoria]] presented the regiment with the [[Queen's Truncheon]], as a replacement for the colors that rifle regiments do not usually have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Margaret |year=2008 |title=Discovering London Statues and Monuments |volume=Volume 42 of Shire Discovering |edition=5, illustrated |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=0-7478-0495-8 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pVJLa5jgzQ4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 18] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 until the start of [[World War I]], the Gurkha Regiments saw active service in [[Burma]], [[Afghanistan]], the [[Northeast India|North-East Frontier]] and the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontiers]] of India, Malta (the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78]]), Cyprus, Malaya, China (the [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1900) and Tibet ([[British expedition to Tibet|Younghusband's Expedition]] of 1905).

Between 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions within the ten regiments.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=79}}

[[File:5thRoyalGurkhaRiflesNorth-WestFrontier1923.JPG|thumb|left|2nd/5th [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], North-West Frontier 1923.]]

During [[World War I]] (1914–1918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}} The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labor battalions.

A large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=9}} They served on the battlefields of [[France]] in the battles of [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]]; in [[Belgium]] at the battle of [[Ypres]]; in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Suez Canal]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] against Turkish advance, [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=99}} One detachment served with [[Lawrence of Arabia]], while during the Battle of Loos (June–December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defenses, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, "found its Valhalla".&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the ultimately unsuccessful [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take out a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as "Gurkha Bluff".{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=117–118}} At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the Straits, which was the ultimate objective.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=121}} The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) was involved in the conquest of [[Baghdad]].

Following the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of troubles.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=150}} 

As such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the [[Third Afghan War]] in 1919. The regiments then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in [[Waziristan]], where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier. They kept the peace among the local populace and engaged with the lawless and often openly hostile [[Pashtun people|Pathan tribesmen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

During this time the North-West Frontier was the scene of considerable political and civil unrest and troops stationed at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna saw an extensive amount of action.&lt;ref&gt;For more detail see {{harvnb|Barthorp|2002|p=}}.{{page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] (1939–1945) there were ten Gurkha regiments, with two battalions each, making a total of 20 pre-war battalions.&lt;ref name="Cross31"&gt;Cross &amp; Gurung 2002, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in 1940, the Nepalese government offered to increase recruitment to enlarge the total number of Gurkha battalions in British service to 35.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=157–158}} This would eventually rise to 43 battalions.

In order to achieve the increased number of battalions, third and fourth battalions were raised for all ten regiments, with fifth battalions also being raised for 1 GR, 2 GR and 9 GR.&lt;ref name="Cross31" /&gt; This expansion required ten training centers to be established for basic training and regimental records across India. In addition, five training battalions (14 GR, 29 GR, 38 GR, 56 GR and 710 GR) were raised, while other units (25 GR and 26 GR) were raised as garrison battalions for keeping the peace in India and defending rear areas.&lt;ref name="Cross32"&gt;Cross &amp; Gurung 2002, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of Gurkha men were also recruited for non-Gurkha units, and other specialized functions such as paratroops, signals, engineers and military police.

A total of 250,280&lt;ref name="Cross32" /&gt; Gurkhas served in 40 battalions, plus eight [[Nepalese Army]] battalions, parachute, training, garrison and porter units during the war,&lt;ref&gt;Osprey Military Elite Series #49 The Gurkhas by Mike Chappell 1993 {{ISBN|1-85532-357-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in almost all theaters. In addition to keeping peace in India, Gurkhas fought in [[Syria]], [[North Africa]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and against the Japanese in the jungles of [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], [[Battle of Imphal|northeast India]] and also [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]].&lt;ref name="PARTICIPANTS-INDIAN-SUBCONTINENT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the Second World War|url = http://www.mgtrust.org/ind2.htm
|accessdate=27 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They did so with considerable distinction, earning 2,734 bravery awards in the process&lt;ref name="Cross32" /&gt; and suffering around 32,000 casualties in all theaters.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Parker|2005|p=xvii}}. Gurkha casualties for the Second World War can be broken down as 8,985 killed or missing and 23,655 wounded.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurkha ranks in the British Indian Army followed the same pattern as those used throughout the rest of the Indian Army at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Gurung 2002, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the British Army itself, there were three distinct levels: private soldiers, non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers. Commissioned officers within the Gurkha regiments held a ''Viceroy's Commission'', which was distinct from the King's or Queen's Commission that British officers serving with a Gurkha regiment held. Any Gurkha holding a commission was technically subordinate to any British officer, regardless of rank.&lt;ref name="Cross34"&gt;Cross &amp; Gurung 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''
* British Army officers received Queen's or King's Commissions, but Gurkha officers in this system received the Viceroy's Commission. After Indian independence in 1947, Gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the British Army received the King's (later Queen's) Gurkha Commission, and were known as King's/Queen's Gurkha Officers (KGO/QGO). Gurkha officers had no authority to command troops of British regiments. The QGO Commission was abolished in 2007.
* [[Jemadar]]s and [[subedar]]s normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ICs but were junior to all British officers, while the subedar major was the Commanding Officer's advisor on the men and their welfare. For a long time it was impossible for Gurkhas to progress further, except that an honorary lieutenancy or captaincy was (very rarely) bestowed upon a Gurkha on retirement.&lt;ref name="Cross34" /&gt;
* The equivalent ranks in the post-1947 Indian Army were (and are) known as Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs). They retained the traditional rank titles used in the British Indian Army: Jemadar (later Naib Subedar), Subedar and Subedar Major.
* While in principle any British subject may apply for a commission without having served in the ranks, Gurkhas cannot. It was customary for a Gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission.&lt;ref name="Cross34" /&gt;
* From the 1920s Gurkhas could also receive King's Indian Commissions, and later full King's or Queen's Commissions, which put them on a par with British officers. This was rare until after the Second World War.
* Gurkha officers commissioned from the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and Short Service Officers regularly fill appointments up to the rank of major. At least two Gurkhas have been promoted to lieutenant colonel and there is theoretically now no bar to further progression.&lt;ref name="Cross34" /&gt;
* After 1948, the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] (part of the British Army) was formed and adopted standard British Army rank structure and nomenclature, except for the three Viceroy Commission ranks between Warrant Officer 1 and Second Lieutenant (jemadar, subedar and subedar major) which remained, albeit with different rank titles Lieutenant (Queens Gurkha Officer), Captain (QGO) and Major (QGO). The QGO commission was abolished in 2007; Gurkha soldiers are currently commissioned as Late Entry Officers (as above).&lt;ref name="Cross34" /&gt;

THE GURKHA&lt;br /&gt;
SOLDIER&lt;br /&gt;
''Bravest of the brave,''&lt;br /&gt;
''most generous of the generous,''&lt;br /&gt;
''never had country''&lt;br /&gt;
''more faithful friends''&lt;br /&gt;
''than you.''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Professor Sir [[Ralph Turner]] MC&lt;ref&gt;The inscription on a monument to Gurkha soldiers which was unveiled in 1997 in [[Whitehall]], [[London]] (Staff.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1997/gurkhas/36397.stm The Gurkhas&amp;nbsp;— Britain's oldest allies] BBC, 4 December 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;]]

After [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]]—and the [[partition of India]]—in 1947 and under the [[Britain-India-Nepal Tripartite Agreement|Tripartite Agreement]], the original ten Gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the British Army and the newly independent [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref name="Cross32" /&gt; Six Gurkha regiments (12 battalions) were transferred to the post-independence Indian Army, while four regiments (eight battalions) were transferred to the British Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=224}}

To the disappointment of their British officers, the majority of Gurkhas given a choice between British or Indian Army service opted for the latter. The reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=226}} The only substantial change was the substitution of Indian officers for British. By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]—a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service have since been reduced to a single (two-battalion) regiment, while the Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=229}}

The principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=322–323}} This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha's actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=323}}

With the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt. A spokesperson for the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic, stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the [[Demographics of Nepal|Nepalese people]] and would be banned.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=344}} However, as of 2018, Gurkha recruitment for foreign service continues.

===British Army Gurkhas===
{{Main article|Brigade of Gurkhas}}
[[File:Gurkhas on Patrol in Helmand MOD 45151723.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles on patrol in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2010.]]
Four Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army on 1 January 1948:
* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]]
* [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]
* [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]]
* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]]

They formed the '''Brigade of Gurkhas''' and were initially stationed in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. There were also a number of additional Gurkha regiments including the 69th and 70th Gurkha Field Squadrons, both included in the 36th Engineer Regiment. Since then, British Gurkhas have served in [[Borneo]] during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]] with Indonesia, in the [[Falklands War]] and on various peacekeeping missions in [[Sierra Leone]], [[East Timor]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=360}}

Gurkhas in Hong Kong:
* 26th Gurkha Brigade (1948–1950)
* 51st Infantry Brigade (disbanded 1976)
* 48th Gurkha Infantry Brigade (1957–1976; renamed Gurkha Field Force 1976–1997; returned to old title {{nowrap|1987 – c. 1992)}}

As of July 2018, the ''Brigade of Gurkhas'' in the British Army has the following units:
* 1st Battalion, [[The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (1RGR)
* 2nd Battalion, [[The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (2RGR)
* [[Queen's Gurkha Signals]] which includes:
** 250 Gurkha Signal Squadron
** 246 Gurkha Signal Squadron
** 248 Gurkha Signal Squadron
* [[10 Queen's Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment RLC]]
* Queen's Gurkha Engineers, which includes:
** 69th Gurkha Field Squadron
** 70th Gurkha Field Squadron
*[[Gurkha Staff and Personnel Support Company]]
*Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas
*Gurkha Company (Sittang), [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]
*Gurkha Wing (Mandalay), [[Infantry Battle School]]

The Brigade of Gurkhas also has its own chefs posted among the above-mentioned units. Gurkhas were among the troops who retook the Falklands in 1982 and have served a number of tours of duty in the current [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 June 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13619825|title=Bravery medal for Gurkha who fought Taliban|newspaper=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anup |last=Kaphle |first2=Graeme |last2=Wood |date=10 May 2010 |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/keyword/Gurkhas |title=Back to the Afghan Future: The return of the Gurkhas |volume=15 |number=32 |journal=The Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Farmer |date=31 October 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/9646824/British-Gurkhas-shot-dead-in-Afghanistan-attack-named.html |title=British Gurkhas shot dead in Afghanistan attack named |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian Army Gurkhas ===
[[File:Indian Army Gurkha rifles.jpg|thumb|upright|The 1st Battalion of 1 Gurkha Rifles of the [[Indian Army]] takes position outside a simulated combat town during a training exercise.]]
{{Main article|Gorkha regiments (India)}}

Upon independence in 1947, six of the original ten Gurkha regiments remained with the [[Indian Army]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=224}} These regiments were:
* [[1 Gorkha Rifles|1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)]]
* [[3 Gorkha Rifles|3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]
* [[4 Gorkha Rifles|4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles]]
* [[5 Gorkha Rifles|5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]
* [[8 Gorkha Rifles|8th Gurkha Rifles]]
* [[9 Gorkha Rifles|9th Gurkha Rifles]]

Additionally, a further regiment, [[11 Gorkha Rifles]], was raised. In 1949 the spelling was changed from "Gurkha" to the original "Gorkha".{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=12}} All royal titles were dropped when India became a republic in 1950.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=12}}

Since partition, the Gurkha regiments that were transferred to the Indian Army have established themselves as a permanent and vital part of the newly independent Indian Army. Indeed, while Britain has reduced its Gurkha contingent, India has continued to recruit Gorkhas of Nepal into Gorkha regiments in large numbers, as well as Indian Gorkhas.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=229}} In 2009 the Indian Army had a Gorkha contingent that numbered around 42,000 men in 46 battalions, spread across seven regiments.

Although their deployment is still governed by the 1947 Tripartite Agreement, in the post-1947 conflicts India has fought in, Gorkhas have served in almost all of them, including the wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999 and also against China in 1962.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=230}} They have also been used in peacekeeping operations around the world.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=12}} They have also served in Sri Lanka conducting operations against the [[Tamil Tigers]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=203}}

=== Singapore Gurkha Contingent ===
[[File:Gurkha IOC 4.jpg|thumb|A trooper of the Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police Force gives directions to a member of the public.]]
The [[Gurkha Contingent]] (GC) of the [[Singapore Police Force]] was formed on 9 April 1949 from selected ex-British Army Gurkhas. It is an integral part of the police force and was raised to replace a [[Sikh]] unit that had existed prior to the Japanese occupation during the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=390}}

The GC is a well trained, dedicated and disciplined body whose principal role is as [[riot police]]. In times of crisis it can be deployed as a reaction force. During the turbulent years before and after independence, the GC acquitted itself well on several occasions during outbreaks of civil disorder. The Gurkhas displayed the courage, self-restraint and professionalism for which they are famous and earned the respect of the society at large.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=390}}

=== Brunei Gurkha Reserve Unit ===
The [[Gurkha Reserve Unit]] (GRU) is a special guard and elite shock-troop force in the [[Sultanate of Brunei]]. The Brunei Reserve Unit employs about 500 Gurkhas. The majority are veterans of the British Army and the Singaporean Police, who have joined the GRU as a second career.

=== Victoria Cross recipients ===
{{Main article|List of Brigade of Gurkhas recipients of the Victoria Cross}}

There have been 26 [[Victoria Cross]]es awarded to members of the Gurkha regiments.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=391–393}} The first was awarded in 1858 and the last in 1965. For a detailed list of the recipients and their deeds, see the [[British Ministry of Defence]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mod.uk/gurkhas/7561.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205193507/http://army.mod.uk/gurkhas/7561.aspx |archivedate=5 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen of the recipients have been British officers serving with Gurkha regiments, although since 1915 the majority have been received by Gurkhas serving in the ranks as private soldiers or NCOs.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}} In addition, since Indian independence in 1947, Gurkhas serving in the Indian Army have also been awarded three [[Param Vir Chakra]]s, which are roughly equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prideofindia.net/param.html|title=Param Vir Chakra|work=Pride of India.net|accessdate=29 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525075456/http://prideofindia.net/param.html|archivedate=25 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note also, there have been two [[George Cross]] medals awarded to Gurkha soldiers, for acts of bravery in situations that have not involved combat.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}}

=== Treatment of Gurkhas in the United Kingdom ===
[[File:Nick Clegg being presented a Gurkha Hat, by a Gurkha veteran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nick Clegg]] being presented a Gurkha Hat by a Gurkha veteran during his [[Maidstone]] visit, to celebrate the success of their joint campaign for the right to live in Britain, 2009]]

The treatment of Gurkhas and their families was the subject of controversy in the United Kingdom once it became widely known that Gurkhas received smaller pensions than their British counterparts.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=334}} The nationality status of Gurkhas and their families was also an area of dispute, with claims that some ex-army Nepali families were being denied residency and forced to leave Britain. On 8 March 2007 the [[British Government]] announced that all Gurkhas who signed up after 1 July 1997 would receive a pension equivalent to that of their British counterparts. In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years' service and women would also be allowed to join--although not in first-line units--conforming to the British Army's policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in Britain for retired Gurkhas and their families.

Despite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement. An advocacy group, [[Gurkha Justice Campaign]],&lt;ref name="gurkha justice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gurkhajustice.org.uk/ |title=Gurkha Justice Campaign |accessdate=31 January 2011 |last=Lumley |first=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Lumley |publisher=Gurkha Justice Campaign }}&lt;/ref&gt; joined the debate in support of the Gurkhas.

In a landmark ruling on 30 September 2008 the High Court in London decided that the Home Secretary's policy allowing Gurkhas who left the Army before 1997 to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom was irrationally restrictive in its criteria, and overturned it. In line with the ruling of the High Court the Home Office pledged to review all cases affected by this decision.&lt;ref name="bbc_764"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7644441.stm | title = Gurkhas win right to stay in UK | accessdate=2 September 2011 | date = 30 September 2008 | work=UK News | publisher = BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 2009 a motion in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] that all Gurkhas be offered equal right of residence was passed by 267 votes to 246. This was the only first-day motion defeat for a government since 1978. [[Nick Clegg]], the Liberal Democrat leader, stated that "this is an immense victory ... for the rights of Gurkhas who have been waiting so long for justice, a victory for Parliament, a victory for decency." He added that it was "the kind of thing people want this country to do".&lt;ref name="bbc_802"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8023882.stm | title = Brown defeated over Gurkha rules | accessdate=31 January 2011 | date = 29 April 2009 | work=UK Politics | publisher = BBC News|quote=Gordon Brown's government has suffered a shock defeat in the Commons on its policy of restricting the right of many former Gurkhas to settle in the UK. MPs voted by 267 to 246 for a Lib Dem motion offering all Gurkhas equal right of residence, with the Tories and 27 Labour rebels backing it. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 2009 Home Secretary [[Jacqui Smith]] announced that all Gurkha veterans who retired before 1997 with at least four years service would be allowed to settle in the UK. Actress [[Joanna Lumley]], daughter of Gurkha corps Maj. James Lumley who had highlighted the treatment of the Gurkhas and campaigned for their rights, commented, "This is the welcome we have always longed to give".&lt;ref name="bbc_806"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8060607.stm | title = Gurkhas win right to settle in UK | accessdate=31 January 2011 | date = 21 May 2009 | work=UK News | publisher = BBC News | quote=All Gurkha veterans who retired before 1997 with at least four years' service will be allowed to settle in the UK, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has said. Ms Smith told MPs she was 'proud to offer this country's welcome to all who have served in the brigade of Gurkhas'. It comes after a high-profile campaign by Joanna Lumley and other supporters of Gurkha rights&amp;nbsp;– and an embarrassing Commons defeat for the government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A charity, [[Gurkha Welfare Trust|The Gurkha Welfare Trust]], provides aid to alleviate hardship and distress among Gurkha ex-servicemen.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=379–383}}

On 9 June 2015, a celebration called the Gurkha 200, held at The Royal Hospital Chelsea and attended by members of the royal family, commemorated the bicentennial of the Gurkha Welfare Trust by paying tribute to Gurkha culture and military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gurkha 200|url = http://www.gurkha200.co.uk/|website = Gurkha 200|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2017}}

Gurkha Square in [[Fleet, Hampshire|Fleet]], Hampshire, which contains the Fleet war memorial, is named after the Gurkhas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fleethants.com/allhistory/gurkhas/main1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Settlement rights====
A 2008 [[High Court of Justice|UK High Court]] decision on a test case in London, ''R. (on the application of Limbu) v Secretary of State for the Home Department'' [2008] EWHC 2261 (Admin), acknowledged the "debt of honour" to Gurkhas discharged before 1997. The Home Secretary's policy allowing veterans to apply on a limited set of criteria (such as connection to the United Kingdom) was quashed as being unduly restrictive. The Court found that the Gurkhas had suffered a "historic injustice" and that the policy was irrational in failing to take into account factors such as length of service or particularly meritorious conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7644441.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gurkhas win right to stay in UK | date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harbin Hot Springs''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[hot spring]] retreat and workshop center at [[Harbin Springs, California|Harbin Springs]] in [[Lake County, California|Lake County]], [[Northern California]]. Named after Matthew Harbin, a pioneer who settled in the Lake County area. It is located about two hours northeast of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], in the United States. The facility was partially destroyed in the [[Valley Fire]] in September 2015, and was temporarily closed; as of September 2017 it was announced the resort would reopen in early spring 2018.&lt;ref name="sacr_Nudi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Harbin-News--Has-it-really-been-two-years-.html?soid=1102083551652&amp;aid=lhA0WXzIzgA|title=Harbin News|first=|date=September 2017|publisher=|quote=|author=|work=myemail.constantcontact.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The baths were commercially developed by settlers in the 1860s, when buildings were erected on the site. The region is prone to wildfires and, over the years, successive lodges have been rebuilt when they burned down. Harbin Hot Springs issued several postcards advertising the resort in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the property was run as a [[commune]] with the name Harbinger, "centered around a man named Don Hamrick, a charismatic fellow who wore business suits and combined science with spiritualism in his lectures/sermons". In 1969, Harbinger had about 120 people, but ultimately, the community did not thrive.{{sfn|Klages|1991}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first= John |last= Wester |title= Speed Willy |newspaper= Anderson Valley Advertiser |accessdate= September 18, 2012 |date= October 21, 2009 |url= http://theava.com/archives/909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the [[Nudity|clothing-optional]] retreat center was known as an outdoor spa with a [[New Age]] ambiance, where [[Watsu]] was developed.&lt;ref name=weil/&gt;

The resort was evacuated because of the [[Valley Fire]] on September 12, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/4470252-181/wildfire-forces-evacuation-of-cobb?gallery=4470892 |title= Wildfire Forces Evacuation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Rossman |first= Randi |last2= Payne |first2= Paul |title= Valley Fire: Devastation During the Night as Fire Destroys Homes |newspaper= [[Santa Rosa Press Democrat]] |date= September 13, 2015 |url= http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/4473490-181/valley-fire-devastation-during-the?gallery=4470892 |accessdate= September 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 14, Harbin was almost completely destroyed by the fire with only the pool complex largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Sernoffsky |first= Evan |title= Harbin Hot Springs Ravaged by Valley Fire |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= September 14, 2015 |url= http://m.sfgate.com/news/article/Harbin-Hot-Springs-ravaged-by-Valley-Fire-6503417.php |accessdate= September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbin is a center for the expression of [[New Age]] beliefs. Harbin's clothing-optional policy, its pools, and the natural beauty of the local landscape are part of Harbin's appeal to visitors, who must agree to membership, if only temporarily, for admission.

Harbin has been a center for the development of new modes of healing and personal development, including [[Watsu]] (water [[shiatsu]]), a massage technique created by [[Harold Dull]] at Harbin in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name = "weil"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Watsu - Dr. Weil's Wellness Therapies |accessdate= September 18, 2012 |url= http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART03102/Watsu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watsu, based on gently moving the body through water, is now practiced in spas throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Watsu |publisher = Watsu NYC |accessdate= September 18, 2012 |url= http://watsunyc.com/watsu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Welcome to Healing Dance "Proof" |accessdate= September 18, 2012 |url= http://www.healingdance.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Watsu India |accessdate= September 18, 2012 |url= http://www.watsu.in/home.html |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121022000211/http://www.watsu.in/home.html |archivedate= October 22, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Colin Campbell''' (died April 18, 1930), aka '''The Torch Murderer''', was [[capital punishment|executed]] by the State of [[New Jersey]] for the [[murder]] of Mildred Mowry, whom he met through a personal ad placed with a "matrimonial agency." A career criminal and [[bigamist]] whose previous crimes were non-violent, Campbell married Mowry in 1929 despite having another wife. Six months after marrying Mowry, Campbell murdered her to collect on a $1,000 investment she owned and burned her corpse.

He was also suspected in another, similar murder of Margaret Brown in 1928. Both Mowry and Brown had been shot in the head, had their [[Dump job#Police usage|bodies dump]]ed on the side of a road, and were set on fire.

During his adult life, Campbell worked as a civil engineer and advertising executive and posed as a physician. Using a matchmaking service in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], Campbell married several women between 1910 and 1928 although police looking into his life were never able to find any record of divorce actions.

A pair of shoes at the Mowry crime scene were traced to Campbell who subsequently confessed to killing her. He denied killing Brown and never stood trial for her murder. Police suspected he murdered some of his previous "wives".

The '''Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions''' (IFTU) is the largest [[union federation]] in [[Iraq]] and the only officially recognized [[trade union]] body.  It was formed in the aftermath of the [[Iraq War]] by several groups, most prominently the [[Iraqi Communist Party]], which wished to disassociate itself from the National Front it had formed with the [[Ba'ath Party]] in the 1970s.

The IFTU was formed on May 16, 2003, at a meeting of the [[Workers Democratic Trade Union Movement]] (WDTUN) attended by 350 Iraqi trade unionists.&lt;ref&gt;Muhsin, "The Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU): Outline History and Future Tasks,"  General Federation of Iraqi Workers, August 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially opposed by the U.S.-led occupation forces, the federation was later given exclusive rights to unionize [[public sector]] workers in the country.  The union has since been attacked by sections of the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]], and former leader [[Hadi Saleh]] was assassinated in January 2005.

It often finds itself in competition with the [[Federation of Workers Councils and Unions in Iraq]] and the [[Federation of Oil Unions in Iraq]], neither of which are officially recognized. One of the issues that divide these unions is how they relate to the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|occupation]] authorities.

The IFTU, which is linked to political parties that are part of the Iraqi government, opposed the American invasion but claims it has been forced to work with the occupation forces following the invasion. The FWCUI takes a harder line toward the occupation authorities, calling for an immediate troop withdrawal.

However, all three union federations have agreed on a common statement, which states that the "occupation must end in all its forms, including military bases and economic domination" and that the "war was fought for oil and regional domination, in violation of international law, justified by lies and deception, without consultation with the Iraqi people." The statement also condemned the occupation's economic program, stating its "opposition to the imposition of [[privatization]] of the Iraqi economy by the occupation, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]], &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; foreign powers".&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, "Between Soldiers and Bombs, ''Foreign Policy In Focus,'' August 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eltman, "Iraqi Labor Leader Calls for Immediate Withdrawal of U.S. Troops," ''Associated Press,'' June 23, 2005; Cardinale, "Iraqi Labor Activists Say U.S. Has Split Nation on Religious, Ethnic Lines," ''Buffalo News,'' June 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the IFTU joined with the other trade union federations to oppose the U.S.-backed national oil law, and supported a planned strike by the Federation of Oil Unions in Iraq to protest the law.&lt;ref&gt;"Iraq Unions Against Oil Privatization," ''United Press International,'' December 14, 2006; Juhasz, "Whose Oil Is It, Anyway?", ''New York Times,'' March 13, 2007; "Iraq Workers Stall Strike for Oil Ministry," ''United Press International,'' May 9, 2007; "Iraqis to U.S. Congress: Back Off Oil Law," ''United Press International,'' June 8, 2007; "Iraq Oil Strike on Hold, Troops Remain," ''United Press International,'' June 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a member of the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] (or Japanese-[[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]]) language family, and [[Classification of the Japonic languages|its relation]] to other languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]], is debated. Japanese has been grouped with language families such as [[Ainu languages|Ainu]], [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], and the now-discredited [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance.

Little is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the [[Heian period]] (794–1185), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] had considerable influence on the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|vocabulary]] and [[phonology]] of [[Old Japanese]]. [[Late Middle Japanese]] (1185–1600) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, and the first appearance of [[Gairaigo|European loanwords]]. The standard dialect moved from the [[Kansai]] region to the [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]) region in the [[Early Modern Japanese]] period (early 17th century–mid-19th century). Following the end in 1853 of [[Sakoku|Japan's self-imposed isolation]], the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords, in particular, have become frequent, and [[Wasei-eigo|Japanese words from English roots]] have proliferated.

Japanese is an [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], [[Mora (linguistics)#Japanese|mora]]-timed language with simple [[phonotactics]], a [[monophthong|pure]] vowel system, phonemic [[Vowel length#Phonemic vowel length|vowel]] and [[Gemination|consonant]] length, and a lexically significant [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch-accent]]. Word order is normally [[subject–object–verb]] with [[Japanese particles|particles]] marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is [[topic–comment]]. [[Sentence-final particle]]s are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or make questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. Verbs are [[Japanese verb conjugation|conjugated]], primarily for [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Voice (grammar)|voice]], but not [[Grammatical person|person]]. [[Japanese equivalents of adjectives]] are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of [[Honorific speech in Japanese|honorifics]] with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.

Japanese has no [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] with [[Chinese language|Chinese]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook to Life in Medieval and Early Modern Japan |first=William E. |last=Deal |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=0816074852 |page=242 |quote=Japanese has no genetic affiliation with Chinese, but neither does it have any clear affiliation with any other language. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKr3XPabVQIC&amp;pg=PA242}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it makes extensive use of [[Chinese characters]], or {{Nihongo|''[[kanji]]''|漢字}}, in its writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|borrowed from Chinese]]. Along with ''kanji'', the [[Japanese writing system]] primarily uses two [[syllabary|syllabic]] (or [[Mora (linguistics)|moraic]]) scripts, {{Nihongo|''[[hiragana]]''|ひらがな or 平仮名}} and {{Nihongo|''[[katakana]]''|カタカナ or 片仮名}}. [[Latin script]] is used in a limited fashion, such as for imported acronyms, and the [[Japanese numerals|numeral system]] uses mostly [[Arabic numerals]] alongside traditional [[Chinese numerals]].

==History==

===Prehistory===
A common ancestor of Japanese and Ryukyuan languages or dialects is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from either continental Asia or nearby Pacific islands sometime in the early- to mid-2nd century BC (the [[Yayoi period]]), replacing the languages of the original [[Jōmon]] inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/world/asia/04language.html|title=Finding on Dialects Casts New Light on the Origins of the Japanese People|first=Nicholas|last=Wade|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the ancestor of the modern [[Ainu language]]. Very little is known about the Japanese of this period. Because writing like the "Kanji" which later devolved into the writing systems "Hiragana" and "Katakana"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; had yet to be introduced from China, there is no direct evidence, and anything that can be discerned about this period of Japanese must be based on the reconstructions of [[Old Japanese]].

===Old Japanese===
[[File:Genryaku Manyosyu.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Page from the Man'yōshū|A page from the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'', the oldest anthology of classical [[Japanese poetry]]]]
{{main|Old Japanese}}
Old Japanese is the oldest attested stage of the Japanese language. Through the spread of [[Buddhism]], the Chinese writing system was imported to Japan. The earliest texts found in Japan are written in [[Classical Chinese]], but they may have been meant to be read as Japanese by the [[kanbun]] method. Some of these Chinese texts show the influences of Japanese grammar, such as the word order (for example, placing the verb after the object). In these hybrid texts, [[Chinese characters]] are also occasionally used phonetically to represent [[Japanese particles]]. The earliest text, the ''[[Kojiki]]'', dates to the early 8th century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters. The end of Old Japanese coincides with the end of the [[Nara period]] in 794. Old Japanese uses the [[Man'yōgana]] system of writing, which uses ''kanji'' for their phonetic as well as semantic values. Based on the Man'yōgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct syllables. Texts written with Man'yōgana use two different ''kanji'' for each of the syllables now pronounced {{lang|ja|き ki, ひ hi, み mi, け ke, へ he, め me, こ ko, そ so, と to, の no, も mo, よ yo and ろ ro}}.&lt;ref&gt;Shinkichi Hashimoto (February 3, 1918)「国語仮名遣研究史上の一発見―石塚龍麿の仮名遣奥山路について」『帝国文学』26–11(1949)『文字及び仮名遣の研究(橋本進吉博士著作集 第3冊)』(岩波書店)。&lt;/ref&gt; (The ''Kojiki'' has 88, but all later texts have 87. The distinction between mo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; apparently was lost immediately following its composition.) This set of syllables shrank to 67 in [[Early Middle Japanese]], though some were added through Chinese influence.

Due to these extra syllables, it has been hypothesized that Old Japanese's vowel system was larger than that of Modern Japanese – it perhaps contained up to eight vowels. According to [[Shinkichi Hashimoto]], the extra syllables in Man'yōgana derive from differences between the vowels of the syllables in question.&lt;ref&gt;大野 晋 (1953)『上代仮名遣の研究』(岩波書店) p.126&lt;/ref&gt; These differences would indicate that Old Japanese had an eight-vowel system,&lt;ref&gt;大野 晋 (1982)『仮名遣いと上代語』(岩波書店) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the five vowels of later Japanese. The vowel system would have to have shrunk some time between these texts and the invention of the ''[[kana]]'' (''[[hiragana]]'' and ''[[katakana]]'') in the early 9th century. According to this view, the eight-vowel system of ancient Japanese would resemble that of the Uralic and [[Altaic language]] families.&lt;ref&gt;有坂 秀世 (1931)「国語にあらはれる一種の母音交替について」『音声の研究』第4輯(1957年の『国語音韻史の研究 増補新版』(三省堂)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not fully certain that the alternation between syllables necessarily reflects a difference in the vowels rather than the consonants – at the moment, the only undisputed fact is that they are different syllables. A newer reconstruction of ancient Japanese shows strikingly similarities with Southeast-Asian languages, especially with [[Austronesian languages]].&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Vovin,|title=Proto-Japanese beyond the accent system|url=https://www.academia.edu/19253123/Proto-Japanese_beyond_the_accent_system|journal=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Japanese does not have {{IPA|/h/}}, but rather {{IPA|/ɸ/}} (preserved in modern ''fu'', {{IPA|/ɸɯ/}}), which has been reconstructed to an earlier *{{IPA|/p/}}. Man'yōgana also has a symbol for {{IPA|/je/}}, which merges with {{IPA|/e/}} before the end of the period.

Several fossilizations of Old Japanese grammatical elements remain in the modern language – the genitive particle ''tsu'' (superseded by modern ''no'') is preserved in words such as ''matsuge'' ("eyelash", lit. "hair of the eye"); modern ''mieru'' ("to be visible") and ''kikoeru'' ("to be audible") retain what may have been a [[mediopassive voice|mediopassive]] suffix -''yu(ru)'' (''kikoyu'' → ''kikoyuru'' (the attributive form, which slowly replaced the plain form starting in the late Heian period) &gt; ''kikoeru'' (as all shimo-nidan verbs in modern Japanese did)); and the genitive particle ''ga'' remains in intentionally archaic speech.

===Early Middle Japanese===
[[File:Genji emaki 01003 001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two pages from Genji Monogatari emaki scroll|Two pages from a 12th-century [[emaki]] scroll of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' from the 11th century]]
{{main|Early Middle Japanese}}
Early Middle Japanese is the Japanese of the [[Heian period]], from 794 to 1185. Early Middle Japanese sees a significant amount of Chinese influence on the language's phonology – length distinctions become phonemic for both consonants and vowels, and series of both labialised (e.g. ''kwa'') and palatalised (''kya'') consonants are added.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Intervocalic {{IPA|/ɸ/}} merges with {{IPA|/w/}} by the 11th century.
The end of Early Middle Japanese sees the beginning of a shift where the attributive form (Japanese ''rentaikei'') slowly replaces the uninflected form (''shūshikei'') for those verb classes where the two were distinct.

===Late Middle Japanese===
{{main|Late Middle Japanese}}
Late Middle Japanese covers the years from 1185 to 1600, and is normally divided into two sections, roughly equivalent to the [[Kamakura period]] and the [[Muromachi period]], respectively. The later forms of Late Middle Japanese are the first to be described by non-native sources, in this case the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] and [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] missionaries; and thus there is better documentation of Late Middle Japanese phonology than for previous forms (for instance, the ''[[Arte da Lingoa de Iapam]]''). Among other sound changes, the sequence {{IPA|/au/}} merges to {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, in contrast with {{IPA|/oː/}}; {{IPA|/p/}} is reintroduced from Chinese; and {{IPA|/we/}} merges with {{IPA|/je/}}. Some forms rather more familiar to Modern Japanese speakers begin to appear – the continuative ending -''te'' begins to reduce onto the verb (e.g. ''yonde'' for earlier ''yomite''), the -k- in the final syllable of adjectives drops out (''shiroi'' for earlier ''shiroki''); and some forms exist where modern standard Japanese has retained the earlier form (e.g. ''hayaku'' &gt; ''hayau'' &gt; ''hayɔɔ'', where modern Japanese just has ''hayaku'', though the alternative form is preserved in the standard greeting ''o-hayō gozaimasu'' "good morning"; this ending is also seen in ''o-medetō'' "congratulations", from ''medetaku'').

Late Middle Japanese has the first loanwords from European languages – now-common words borrowed into Japanese in this period include ''pan'' ("bread") and ''tabako'' ("tobacco", now "cigarette"), both from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

===Early Modern Japanese===
{{main|Early Modern Japanese}}
Early Modern Japanese, not to be confused with Modern Japanese, was the dialect used after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Because the two languages are extremely similar, Early Modern Japanese is commonly referred to as Modern Japanese. Early Modern Japanese gradually evolved into Modern Japanese during the 19th century. Only after 1945, shortly after World War II,  did Modern Japanese become the standard language, seeing use in most official communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Adaptation|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1989|isbn=0-521-36255-5|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this time period the Japanese in addition to their use of Katakana and Hiragana they also used traditional Chinese characters called "[[Chinese characters|Han]]" which later developed in "Kanji" which is a form of writing used to express ideas in the Japanese and Chinese languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minimal Old Chinese and Later Han Chinese : A Companion to Grammata Serica Recensa.|last=SCHUESSLER|first=KARLGREN|publisher=Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|isbn=9780824832643|location=Honolulu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Japanese===
Modern Japanese is considered to begin with the [[Edo period]], which lasted between 1603 and 1868. Since Old Japanese, the de facto standard Japanese had been the [[Kansai dialect]], especially that of [[Kyoto]]. However, during the Edo period, Edo (now Tokyo) developed into the largest city in Japan, and the Edo-area dialect became standard Japanese. Since the end of [[Sakoku|Japan's self-imposed isolation]] in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages has increased significantly. The period since 1945 has seen a large number of words borrowed from other languages{{mdash}}such as German, Portuguese and English.&lt;ref&gt;Miura, Akira, ''English in Japanese'', Weatherhill, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Many English loan words especially relate to technology{{mdash}}for example, ''pasokon'' (short for "personal computer"), ''intānetto'' ("internet"), and ''kamera'' ("camera"). Due to the large quantity of English loanwords, modern Japanese has developed a distinction between {{IPA|/tɕi/}} and {{IPA|/ti/}}, and {{IPA|/dʑi/}} and {{IPA|/di/}}, with the latter in each pair only found in loanwords.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Geographic distribution==
Although Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan, it has been spoken outside. Before and during [[World War II]], through Japanese annexation of [[Taiwan]] and [[Korea]], as well as partial occupation of [[China]], the [[Philippines]], and various Pacific islands,&lt;ref&gt;Japanese is listed as one of the official languages of [[Angaur]] state, [[Palau]] ([http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=PW Ethnologe], [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ps.html CIA World Factbook]). However, very few Japanese speakers were recorded in the [http://www.spc.int/prism/country/pw/stats/PalauStats/Publication/2005CENSUS.pdf 2005 census].&lt;/ref&gt; locals in [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|those countries]] learned Japanese as the language of the empire. As a result, many elderly people in these countries can still speak Japanese.

Japanese emigrant communities (the largest of which are to be found in [[Brazil]],&lt;ref name="IBGE traça perfil dos imigrantes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madeinjapan.uol.com.br/2008/06/21/ibge-traca-perfil-dos-imigrantes/ |title=IBGE traça perfil dos imigrantes – Imigração – Made in Japan |publisher=Madeinjapan.uol.com.br |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119132009/http://madeinjapan.uol.com.br/2008/06/21/ibge-traca-perfil-dos-imigrantes/ |archivedate=2012-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1.4 million to 1.5 million Japanese immigrants and descendants, according to Brazilian [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] data, more than the 1.2 million of the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR:041&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;) sometimes employ Japanese as their primary language.

===Official status===
Japanese has no [[official language|official status]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://houseikyoku.sangiin.go.jp/column/column068.htm|title=法制執務コラム集「法律と国語・日本語」|publisher=Legislative Bureau of the House of Councillors|accessdate=9 November 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is the ''[[de facto]]'' [[national language]] of Japan. There is a form of the language considered standard: {{nihongo|''hyōjungo''|標準語}}, meaning "standard Japanese", or {{nihongo|''kyōtsūgo''|共通語}}, "common language". The meanings of the two terms are almost the same. ''Hyōjungo'' or ''kyōtsūgo'' is a conception that forms the counterpart of dialect. This normative language was born after the {{nihongo|[[Meiji Restoration]]|明治維新|meiji ishin|1868}} from the language spoken in the higher-class areas of Tokyo (see [[Yamanote]]). ''Hyōjungo'' is taught in schools and used on television and even&lt;!--???--&gt; in official communications.{{cn|date=October 2018}} It is the version of Japanese discussed in this article.

Formerly, standard {{nihongo|Japanese in writing|文語|[[Bungo (Japanese language)|bungo]]|"literary language"}} was different from {{nihongo|colloquial language|口語|[[Kogo (Japanese language)|kōgo]]}}. The two systems have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary. ''Bungo'' was the main method of writing Japanese until about 1900; since then ''kōgo'' gradually extended its influence and the two methods were both used in writing until the 1940s. ''Bungo'' still has some relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived [[World War II]] are still written in ''bungo'', although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). ''Kōgo'' is the dominant method of both speaking and writing Japanese today, although ''bungo'' grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect.

===Dialects===
{{Main|Japanese dialects}}
[[File:Japanese dialects-en.png|thumb|Map of Japanese dialects and Japonic languages]]

Dozens of dialects are spoken in Japan. The profusion is due to many factors, including the length of time the [[Japanese Archipelago]] has been inhabited, its mountainous island terrain, and Japan's long history of both external and internal isolation. Dialects typically differ in terms of [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch accent]], inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[vocabulary]], and particle usage. Some even differ in [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] inventories, although this is uncommon.

The main distinction in Japanese accents is between {{nihongo|Tokyo-type|東京式|Tōkyō-shiki}} and {{nihongo|Kyoto-Osaka-type|京阪式|Keihan-shiki}}. Within each type are several subdivisions. Kyoto-Osaka-type dialects are in the central region, roughly formed by [[Kansai region|Kansai]], [[Shikoku]], and western [[Hokuriku region]]s.

Dialects from peripheral regions, such as [[Tōhoku Region|Tōhoku]] or [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]], may be unintelligible to speakers from the other parts of the country. There are some [[language island]]s in mountain villages or isolated islands such as [[Hachijōjima|Hachijō-jima island]] whose dialects are descended from the Eastern dialect of [[Old Japanese]]. Dialects of the [[Kansai region]] are spoken or known by many Japanese, and [[Osaka]] dialect in particular is associated with comedy (see [[Kansai dialect]]). Dialects of Tōhoku and North [[Kantō region|Kantō]] are associated with typical farmers.

The [[Ryūkyūan languages]], spoken in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and the [[Amami Islands]] (politically part of [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]]), are distinct enough to be considered a separate branch of the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] family; not only is each language unintelligible to Japanese speakers, but most are unintelligible to those who speak other Ryūkyūan languages. However, in contrast to linguists, many ordinary Japanese people tend to consider the Ryūkyūan languages as dialects of Japanese. The imperial court also seems to have spoken an unusual variant of the Japanese of the time.&lt;ref&gt;See the comments of George Kizaki in {{cite web|last1=Stuky|first1=Natalie-Kyoko|title=Exclusive: From Internment Camp to MacArthur's Aide in Rebuilding Japan|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/from-internment-camp-to-macarthur-s-aide.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely being the spoken form of [[Classical Japanese language]], a writing style that was prevalent during the [[Heian period]], but began decline during the late [[Meiji period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Adaptation|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1989|isbn=0-521-36255-5|location=|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Japanese has become prevalent nationwide (including the Ryūkyū islands) due to [[education]], [[mass media]], and an increase of mobility within Japan, as well as economic integration.

== Classification ==
{{see also|Classification of the Japonic languages}}

Japanese is a member of the [[Japonic languages]] family, which also includes the [[Ryukyuan languages|languages]] spoken throughout the [[Ryūkyū Islands]]. As these closely related languages are commonly treated as dialects of the same language, Japanese is often called a [[language isolate]].

According to Martine Irma Robbeets, Japanese has been subject to more attempts to show its relation to other languages than any other language in the world.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=20}} Since Japanese first gained the consideration of linguists in the late 19th century, attempts have been made to show its genealogical relation to languages or language families such as Ainu, Korean, Chinese, [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]], [[Ural–Altaic languages|Ural-Altaic]], Altaic, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]], [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] and [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]]. At the fringe, some linguists have suggested a link to [[Indo-European languages]], including [[Greek language|Greek]], and to [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]. As it stands, only the link to Ryukyuan has wide support, though linguist Kurakichi Shiratori maintained that Japanese was a language isolate.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Hirano|1978|pp=30–31}}

===Korean hypothesis===
Similarities between [[Korean language|Korean]] and Japanese were noted by [[Arai Hakuseki]] in 1717,{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=25}} and the idea that the two might be related was first proposed in 1781 by Japanese scholar Teikan Fujii.{{sfnm|1a1=Robbeets|1y=2005|1p=25|2a1=Vovin|2y=2010|2p=3}} The idea received little attention until [[William George Aston]] proposed it again in 1879. Japanese scholar Shōsaburō Kanazawa took it up in 1910, as did Shinpei Ogura in 1934. Shirō Hattori was nearly alone when he criticised these theories in 1959.{{sfn|Vovin|2010|p=3}} [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel Martin]] furthered the idea in 1966 with his "Lexical evidence relating Korean to Japanese", as did John Whitman with his dissertation on the subject in 1985.{{sfnm|1a1=Robbeets|1y=2005|1p=25|2a1=Vovin|2y=2010|2p=3}} Despite this, definitive proof of the relation has yet to be provided. Historical linguists studying Japanese and Korean tend to accept the genealogical relation, while general linguists and historical linguists in Japan and Korea have remained skeptical.{{sfn|Vovin|2010|p=3}}

[[Alexander Vovin]] suggests that, while [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] modern Korean and Japanese share similarities that sometimes allow word-to-word translations, studies of the pre-modern languages show greater differences. According to Vovin, this suggests [[Language convergence|linguistic convergence]] rather than [[Language divergence|divergence]], which he believes is amongst the evidence of the languages not having a genealogical connection.{{sfn|Vovin|2010|p=6}}

===Altaic hypothesis===
&lt;!--Linked from infobox above--&gt;
[[File:Altaic family2.svg|thumb|alt=Map of distribution of proposed Altaic languages|Distribution of the proposed [[Altaic languages]] across [[Eurasia]], tentatively including Japanese and [[Korean language|Korean]]]]
The largely discredited [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] family, which would include languages from far eastern Europe to northeastern Asia, has had its supporters and detractors over its history. The most controversial aspect of the hypothesis is the proposed inclusion of Korean and Japanese, which even some proponents of Altaic have rejected.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=18}} [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] suggested the connection in 1832,{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=20}} but the inclusion first attracted significant attention in the early 1970s.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=19}} [[Roy Andrew Miller]] published ''Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages'', and dedicated much of his later career to the subject. [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]] published a 1991 monograph which was another significant stepping stone in Japanese—Altaic research. A team of scholars made a database of Altaic etymologies available over the internet, from which the three-volume ''Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages'' was published in 2003.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=22}} Scholars such as [[Yevgeny Polivanov]] and Yoshizo Itabashi, on the other hand, have proposed a hybrid origin of Japanese, in which [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] and Altaic elements became mixed.&lt;ref&gt;http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/kumar1996does.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|pp=21, 23}}

Skepticism over the Japanese relation to Altaic is widespread among Altaic's proponents, in part because of a large number of unsuccessful attempts to establish genealogical relationships with Japanese and other languages.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|p=20}} Opinions are polarized, with many strongly convinced of the Altaic relation, and others strongly convinced of the lack of one. While some sources are undecided, often strong proponents of either view will not even acknowledge the claims of the other side.{{sfn|Robbeets|2005|pp=26–27}}

==Phonology==
{{Main|Japanese phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}

[[File:Ja-ksb-botchan 1-1 1-2.ogg|thumb|Spoken Japanese]]

All Japanese vowels are pure—that is, there are no [[diphthong]]s, only [[monophthong]]s. The only unusual vowel is the high back vowel {{IPA|/u/}} {{Audio|Ja-U.oga|''listen''}}, which may be [[roundedness|compressed]] rather than rounded and fronted. Japanese has five vowels, and [[vowel length]] is phonemic, with each having both a short and a long version. Elongated vowels are usually denoted with a line over the vowel (a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]) in [[Romanization of Japanese|rōmaji]], a repeated vowel character in [[hiragana]], or a [[chōonpu]] succeeding the vowel in [[katakana]].

Some Japanese consonants have several [[allophone]]s, which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds. However, some of these allophones have since become phonemic. For example, in the Japanese language up to and including the first half of the 20th century, the phonemic sequence {{IPA|/ti/}} was [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] and realized phonetically as {{IPA|[tɕi]}}, approximately ''chi'' {{Audio|Ja-Chi 2.oga|''listen''}}; however, now {{IPA|[ti]}} and {{IPA|[tɕi]}} are distinct, as evidenced by words like ''tī'' {{IPA|[tiː]}} "Western style tea" and ''chii'' {{IPA|[tɕii]}} "social status".

The "r" of the Japanese language is of particular interest, ranging between an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[central consonant|central]] [[tap consonant|tap]] and a [[lateral approximant]]. The "g" is also notable; unless it starts a sentence, it may be pronounced {{IPAblink|ŋ}}, in the Kanto prestige dialect and in other eastern dialects.

The syllabic structure and the [[phonotactics]] are very simple: the only [[consonant cluster]]s allowed within a syllable consist of one of a subset of the consonants plus {{IPA|/j/}}. This type of cluster only occurs in onsets. However, consonant clusters across syllables are allowed as long as the two consonants are a nasal followed by a [[homorganic]] consonant. [[Gemination|Consonant length]] (gemination) is also phonemic.

The phonology of Japanese also includes a [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch accent system]], which is a system that helps differentiate words with identical [[Hiragana]] spelling or words in different [[Japanese dialects]]. An example of words with identical Hiragana would be the words {{IPA|[haꜜ.ɕi]}} ("chopsticks") and {{IPA|[ha.ɕiꜜ]}} ("bridge"), both spelled (はし, ''hashi'') in Hiragana. The stresses differentiate the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bullock|first1=Ben|title=What is Japanese pitch accent?|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/pitch-accent.html|publisher=Ben Bullock|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Please keep in mind that this section is intended to be a summary and should not dominate the article. If you feel like going in-depth about something regarding Japanese grammar, please add it to the main article linked below.--&gt;
{{Main|Japanese grammar}}

===Sentence structure===
Japanese word order is classified as [[subject–object–verb]]. Unlike many [[Indo-European languages]], the only strict rule of word order is that the verb must be placed at the end of a sentence (possibly followed by sentence-end particles). This is because Japanese sentence elements are marked with [[Japanese particles|particles]] that identify their grammatical functions.

The basic sentence structure is [[topic–comment]]. For example, ''Kochira wa Tanaka-san desu'' ({{lang|ja|こちらは田中さんです}}). ''kochira'' ("this") is the topic of the sentence, indicated by the particle '' wa''. The verb ''de aru'' (''desu'' is a contraction of its polite form ''de arimasu'') is a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], commonly translated as "to be" or "it is" (though there are other verbs that can be translated as "to be"), though technically it holds no meaning and is used to give a sentence 'politeness'. As a phrase, ''Tanaka-san desu'' is the comment. This sentence literally translates to "As for this person, (it) is Mr./Ms. Tanaka." Thus Japanese, like many other Asian languages, is often called a [[topic-prominent language]], which means it has a strong tendency to indicate the topic separately from the subject, and that the two do not always coincide. The sentence ''Zō wa hana ga nagai '' ({{lang|ja|象は鼻が長い}}) literally means, "As for elephant(s), (the) nose(s) (is/are) long". The topic is ''zō'' "elephant", and the subject is ''hana'' "nose".

In Japanese, the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated if it is obvious from context. As a result of this grammatical permissiveness, there is a tendency to gravitate towards brevity; Japanese speakers tend to omit [[pronoun]]s on the theory they are inferred from the previous sentence, and are therefore understood. In the context of the above example, ''hana-ga nagai'' would mean "[their] noses are long," while ''nagai'' by itself would mean "[they] are long." A single verb can be a complete sentence: ''Yatta!'' ({{lang|ja|やった!}}) "[I / we / they / etc] did [it]!". In addition, since adjectives can form the predicate in a Japanese sentence (below), a single adjective can be a complete sentence: ''Urayamashii!'' ({{lang|ja|羨ましい!}}) "[I'm] jealous [of it]!".

While the language has some words that are typically translated as pronouns, these are not used as frequently as pronouns in some Indo-European languages, and function differently. In some cases Japanese relies on special verb forms and auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of benefit of an action: "down" to indicate the out-group gives a benefit to the in-group; and "up" to indicate the in-group gives a benefit to the out-group. Here, the in-group includes the speaker and the out-group does not, and their boundary depends on context. For example, ''oshiete moratta'' ({{lang|ja|教えてもらった}}) (literally, "explained" with a benefit from the out-group to the in-group) means "[he/she/they] explained [it] to [me/us]". Similarly, ''oshiete ageta'' ({{lang|ja|教えてあげた}}) (literally, "explained" with a benefit from the in-group to the out-group) means "[I/we] explained [it] to [him/her/them]". Such beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in Indo-European languages to indicate the actor and the recipient of an action.

[[Japanese pronouns|Japanese "pronouns"]] also function differently from most modern Indo-European pronouns (and more like nouns) in that they can take modifiers as any other noun may. For instance, one does not say in English:
: *The amazed he ran down the street. (grammatically incorrect insertion of a pronoun)
But one ''can'' grammatically say essentially the same thing in Japanese:
: {{lang|ja|驚いた彼は道を走っていった。}}
: ''Odoroita kare wa michi o hashitte itta.'' (grammatically correct)

This is partly because these words evolved from regular nouns, such as ''kimi'' "you" ({{lang|ja|君}} "lord"), ''anata'' "you" ({{lang|ja|あなた}} "that side, yonder"), and ''boku'' "I" ({{lang|ja|僕}} "servant"). This is why some linguists do not classify Japanese "pronouns" as pronouns, but rather as referential nouns, much like Spanish ''usted'' (contracted from ''vuestra merced'', "your [(flattering [[Majestic plural|majestic]]) [[Majestic plural|plural]]] grace") or Portuguese ''o senhor''. Japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations requiring special emphasis as to who is doing what to whom.

The choice of words used as pronouns is correlated with the sex of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken: men and women alike in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as ''watashi'' ({{lang|ja|私}} "private") or ''watakushi'' (also {{lang|ja|私}}), while men in rougher or intimate conversation are much more likely to use the word ''ore'' ({{lang|ja|俺}} "oneself", "myself") or ''boku''. Similarly, different words such as ''anata'', ''kimi'', and ''omae'' ({{lang|ja|お前}}, more formally {{lang|ja|御前}} "the one before me") may be used to refer to a listener depending on the listener's relative social position and the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the listener. When used in different social relationships, the same word may have positive (intimate or respectful) or negative (distant or disrespectful) connotations.

Japanese often use titles of the person referred to where pronouns would be used in English. For example, when speaking to one's teacher, it is appropriate to use ''sensei'' ({{lang|ja|先生}}, teacher), but inappropriate to use ''anata''. This is because ''anata'' is used to refer to people of equal or lower status, and one's teacher has higher status.

===Inflection and conjugation===
Japanese nouns have no grammatical number, gender or article aspect. The noun ''hon'' ({{lang |ja|本}}) may refer to a single book or several books; ''hito'' ({{lang|ja|人}}) can mean "person" or "people", and ''ki'' ({{lang |ja|木}}) can be "tree" or "trees". Where number is important, it can be indicated by providing a quantity (often with a [[Japanese counter word|counter word]]) or (rarely) by adding a suffix, &lt;!--example? meaning "hito-tachi" and "mono-domo"?--&gt; or sometimes by duplication (e.g. {{lang|ja|人人}}, ''hitobito'', usually written with an iteration mark as {{lang|ja|人々}}). Words for people are usually understood as singular. Thus ''Tanaka-san'' usually means ''Mr./Ms. Tanaka''. Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix (a noun suffix that indicates a group), such as ''-tachi'', but this is not a true plural: the meaning is closer to the English phrase "and company". A group described as ''Tanaka-san-tachi'' may include people not named Tanaka. Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural, such as ''hitobito'' "people" and ''wareware'' "we/us", while the word ''tomodachi'' "friend" is considered singular, although plural in form.

Verbs are [[Japanese verb conjugations|conjugated]] to show tenses, of which there are two: past and present (or non-past) which is used for the present and the future. For verbs that represent an ongoing process, the ''-te iru'' form indicates a continuous (or progressive) [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], similar to the suffix ''ing'' in English. For others that represent a change of state, the ''-te iru'' form indicates a perfect aspect. For example, ''kite iru'' means "He has come (and is still here)", but ''tabete iru'' means "He is eating".

Questions (both with an interrogative pronoun and yes/no questions) have the same structure as affirmative sentences, but with intonation rising at the end. In the formal register, the question particle ''-ka'' is added. For example, ''ii desu'' ({{lang|ja|いいです}}) "It is OK" becomes ''ii desu-ka'' ({{lang|ja|いいですか。}}) "Is it OK?". In a more informal tone sometimes the particle ''-no'' ({{lang|ja|の}}) is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker: ''Dōshite konai-no?'' "Why aren't (you) coming?". Some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer's attention: ''Kore wa?'' "(What about) this?"; ''O-namae wa?'' ({{lang|ja|お名前は？}}) "(What's your) name?".

Negatives are formed by inflecting the verb. For example, ''Pan o taberu'' ({{lang|ja|パンを食べる。}}) "I will eat bread" or "I eat bread" becomes ''Pan o tabenai'' ({{lang|ja|パンを食べない。}}) "I will not eat bread" or "I do not eat bread". Plain negative forms are actually ''i''-adjectives (see below) and inflect as such, e.g. ''Pan o tabenakatta'' ({{lang|ja|パンを食べなかった。}}) "I did not eat bread".

The so-called ''-te'' verb form is used for a variety of purposes: either progressive or perfect aspect (see above); combining verbs in a temporal sequence (''Asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru'' "I'll eat breakfast and leave at once"), simple commands, conditional statements and permissions (''Dekakete-mo ii?'' "May I go out?"), etc.

The word ''da'' (plain), ''desu'' (polite) is the [[Copula (linguistics)#Japanese|copula]] verb. It corresponds approximately to the English ''be'', but often takes on other roles, including a marker for tense, when the verb is conjugated into its past form ''datta'' (plain), ''deshita'' (polite). This comes into use because only ''i''-adjectives and verbs can carry tense in Japanese. Two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence ("there is") or, in some contexts, property: ''aru'' (negative ''nai'') and ''iru'' (negative ''inai''), for inanimate and animate things, respectively. For example, ''Neko ga iru'' "There's a cat", ''Ii kangae-ga nai'' "[I] haven't got a good idea".

The verb "to do" (''suru'', polite form ''shimasu'') is often used to make verbs from nouns (''ryōri suru'' "to cook", ''benkyō suru'' "to study", etc.) and has been productive in creating modern slang words. Japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in English using a verb and an adverbial particle (e.g. ''tobidasu'' "to fly out, to flee," from ''tobu'' "to fly, to jump" + ''dasu'' "to put out, to emit").

There are three types of adjectives (see [[Japanese adjectives]]):
# {{lang|ja|形容詞}} ''keiyōshi'', or ''i'' adjectives, which have a [[Japanese verb conjugations|conjugating]] ending ''i'' ({{lang|ja|い}}) (such as {{lang|ja|暑い}} ''atsui'' "to be hot") which can become past ({{lang|ja|暑かった}} ''atsukatta'' "it was hot"), or negative ({{lang|ja|暑くない}} ''atsuku nai'' "it is not hot"). Note that ''nai'' is also an ''i'' adjective, which can become past ({{lang|ja|暑くなかった}} ''atsuku nakatta'' "it was not hot").
#: {{lang|ja|暑い日}} ''atsui hi'' "a hot day".
# {{lang|ja|形容動詞}} ''keiyōdōshi'', or ''na'' adjectives, which are followed by a form of the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], usually ''na''. For example, ''hen'' (strange)
#: {{lang|ja|変なひと}} ''hen na hito'' "a strange person".
# {{lang|ja|連体詞}} ''rentaishi'', also called true adjectives, such as ''ano'' "that"
#: {{lang|ja|あの山}} ''ano yama'' "that mountain".

Both ''keiyōshi'' and ''keiyōdōshi'' may [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] sentences. For example,
: {{lang|ja|ご飯が熱い。}} ''Gohan ga atsui.'' "The rice is hot."
: {{lang|ja|彼は変だ。}} ''Kare wa hen da.'' "He's strange."
Both inflect, though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs.
The ''rentaishi'' in Modern Japanese are few in number, and unlike the other words, are limited to directly modifying nouns. They never predicate sentences. Examples include ''ookina'' "big", ''kono'' "this", ''iwayuru'' "so-called" and ''taishita'' "amazing".

Both ''keiyōdōshi'' and ''keiyōshi'' form [[adverb]]s, by following with ''ni'' in the case of ''keiyōdōshi'':
: {{lang|ja|変になる}} ''hen ni naru'' "become strange",
and by changing ''i'' to ''ku'' in the case of ''keiyōshi'':
: {{lang|ja|熱くなる}} ''atsuku naru'' "become hot".

The grammatical function of nouns is indicated by [[postposition]]s, also called [[Japanese particles|particles]]. These include for example:
* '''{{lang|ja|が}} ''ga''''' for the [[nominative case]]. 
: {{lang|ja|'''彼が'''やった。}}'''''Kare ga''' yatta.'' "'''He''' did it."
* '''{{lang|ja|に}} ''ni''''' for the [[dative case]].
: {{lang|ja|'''田中さんに'''あげて下さい。}} '''''Tanaka-san ni''' agete kudasai'' "Please give it '''to Mr. Tanaka'''."
It is also used for the [[lative]] case, indicating a motion to a location.
: {{lang|ja|'''日本に'''行きたい。}} '''''Nihon ni''' ikitai'' "I want to go '''to Japan'''."
*However, '''へ ''e''''' is more commonly used for the lative case.
: {{lang|ja|'''パーティーへ'''行かないか。}} '''''pātī e''' ikanai ka?'' "Won't you go '''to the party'''?"
* '''{{lang|ja|の}} ''no''''' for the [[genitive case]], or nominalizing phrases.
: {{lang|ja|'''私の'''カメラ。}} '''watashi no''' kamera'' "'''my''' camera"
: {{lang|ja|スキーに行く'''の'''が好きです。}} ''Sukī-ni iku '''no''' ga suki desu'' "(I) like go'''ing''' skiing."
* '''{{lang|ja|を}} ''o''''' for the [[accusative case]]. 
: {{lang|ja|'''何を'''食べますか。}} '''''Nani o''' tabemasu ka?'' "'''What''' will (you) eat?"
* '''{{lang|ja|は}} ''wa''''' for the topic. It can co-exist with the case markers listed above, and it overrides ''ga'' and (in most cases) ''o''.
: {{lang|ja|'''私は'''寿司がいいです。}} '''''Watashi wa''' sushi ga ii desu.'' (literally) "'''As for me''', sushi is good." The nominative marker ''ga'' after ''watashi'' is hidden under ''wa''.

Note: The subtle difference between '''''wa''''' and '''''ga''''' in Japanese cannot be derived from the English language as such, because the distinction between sentence topic and subject is not made there. While ''wa'' indicates the topic, which the rest of the sentence describes or acts upon, it carries the implication that the subject indicated by ''wa'' is not unique, or may be part of a larger group.
: ''Ikeda-san '''wa''' yonjū-ni sai da.'' "As for Mr. Ikeda, he is forty-two years old." Others in the group may also be of that age.
Absence of ''wa'' often means the subject is the [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] of the sentence.
: ''Ikeda-san '''ga''' yonjū-ni sai da.'' "It is Mr. Ikeda who is forty-two years old." This is a reply to an implicit or explicit question, such as "who in this group is forty-two years old?"

===Politeness===
{{Main|Honorific speech in Japanese}}

Japanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality. This reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miyagawa|first=Shigeru|title=The Japanese Language|url=http://web.mit.edu/jpnet/articles/JapaneseLanguage.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese language can express differing levels in social status. The differences in social position are determined by a variety of factors including job, age, experience, or even psychological state (e.g., a person asking a favour tends to do so politely). The person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech, whereas the other person might use a plainer form. Strangers will also speak to each other politely. Japanese children rarely use polite speech until they are teens, at which point they are expected to begin speaking in a more adult manner. ''See [[uchi-soto]]''.

Whereas ''teineigo'' ({{lang|ja|丁寧語}}) (polite language) is commonly an [[inflection]]al system, ''sonkeigo'' ({{lang|ja|尊敬語}}) (respectful language) and ''kenjōgo'' ({{lang|ja|謙譲語}}) (humble language) often employ many special honorific and humble alternate verbs: ''iku'' "go" becomes ''ikimasu'' in polite form, but is replaced by ''irassharu'' in honorific speech and ''ukagau'' or ''mairu'' in humble speech.

The difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one's own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and their group. For example, the ''-san'' suffix ("Mr" "Mrs." or "Miss") is an example of honorific language. It is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one's company to an external person, since the company is the speaker's in-group. When speaking directly to one's superior in one's company or when speaking with other employees within one's company about a superior, a Japanese person will use vocabulary and inflections of the honorific register to refer to the in-group superior and their speech and actions. When speaking to a person from another company (i.e., a member of an out-group), however, a Japanese person will use the plain or the humble register to refer to the speech and actions of their own in-group superiors. In short, the register used in Japanese to refer to the person, speech, or actions of any particular individual varies depending on the relationship (either in-group or out-group) between the speaker and listener, as well as depending on the relative status of the speaker, listener, and third-person referents.

Most [[noun]]s in the Japanese language may be made polite by the addition of ''o-'' or ''go-'' as a prefix. ''o-'' is generally used for words of native Japanese origin, whereas ''go-'' is affixed to words of Chinese derivation. In some cases, the prefix has become a fixed part of the word, and is included even in regular speech, such as ''gohan'' 'cooked rice; meal.' Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item's owner or to the object itself. For example, the word ''tomodachi'' 'friend,' would become ''o-tomodachi'' when referring to the friend of someone of higher status (though mothers often use this form to refer to their children's friends). On the other hand, a polite speaker may sometimes refer to ''mizu'' 'water' as ''o-mizu'' in order to show politeness.

Most Japanese people employ politeness to indicate a lack of familiarity. That is, they use polite forms for new acquaintances, but if a relationship becomes more intimate, they no longer use them. This occurs regardless of age, social class, or gender.

==Vocabulary==
{{further|Yamato kotoba|Gairaigo}}
There are three main sources of words in the Japanese language, the ''yamato kotoba'' (大和言葉) or ''wago'' (和語), ''kango'' (漢語), and ''gairaigo'' (外来語).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/yamato-kotoba-language/|title=Yamato Kotoba: The REAL Japanese Language|last=Koichi|website=Tofugu|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original language of Japan, or at least the original language of a certain population that was ancestral to a significant portion of the historical and present Japanese nation, was the so-called ''[[yamato kotoba]]'' ({{lang|ja|大和言葉}} or infrequently {{lang|ja|大和詞}}, i.e. "[[Yamato people|Yamato]] words"), which in scholarly contexts is sometimes referred to as ''wago'' ({{lang|ja|和語}} or rarely {{lang|ja|倭語}}, i.e. the "[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]] language"). In addition to words from this original language, present-day Japanese includes a number of words that were either borrowed from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or constructed from Chinese roots following Chinese patterns. These words, known as ''[[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|kango]]'' ({{lang|ja|漢語}}), entered the language from the 5th century onwards via contact with Chinese culture. According to the ''Shinsen Kokugo Jiten'' (新選国語辞典) [[Japanese dictionary]], ''kango'' comprise 49.1% of the total vocabulary, ''wago'' make up 33.8%, other foreign words or ''[[gairaigo]]'' ({{lang|ja|外来語}}) account for 8.8%, and the remaining 8.3% constitute hybridized words or ''konshugo'' ({{lang|ja|混種語}}) that draw elements from more than one language.&lt;ref&gt;新選国語辞典, 金田一京助, 小学館, 2001, {{ISBN|4-09-501407-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a great number of words of mimetic origin in Japanese, with Japanese having a rich collection of [[Japanese sound symbolism|sound symbolism]], both onomatopoeia for physical sounds, and more abstract words. A small number of words have come into Japanese from the [[Ainu language]]. ''Tonakai'' ([[reindeer]]), ''rakko'' ([[sea otter]]) and ''[[shishamo]]'' ([[Smelts|smelt]], a type of fish) are well-known examples of words of Ainu origin.

Words of different origins occupy different [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] in Japanese. Like Latin-derived words in English, ''kango'' words are typically perceived as somewhat formal or academic compared to equivalent Yamato words. Indeed, it is generally fair to say that an English word derived from Latin/French roots typically corresponds to a Sino-Japanese word in Japanese, whereas a simpler [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon word]] would best be translated by a Yamato equivalent.

Incorporating vocabulary from [[languages of Europe|European languages]], ''gairaigo'', began with [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin|borrowings from Portuguese]] in the 16th century, followed by words from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] during Japan's [[sakoku|long isolation]] of the [[Edo period]]. With the [[Meiji Restoration]] and the reopening of Japan in the 19th century, borrowing occurred from [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]]. Today most borrowings are from English.

In the Meiji era, the Japanese also coined many neologisms using Chinese roots and morphology to translate European concepts;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} these are known as [[wasei kango]] (Japanese-made Chinese words). Many of these were then imported into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese via their kanji in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} For example, ''seiji'' 政治 ("politics"), and ''kagaku'' 化学 ("chemistry") are words derived from Chinese roots that were first created and used by the Japanese, and only later borrowed into Chinese and other East Asian languages. As a result, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way a large number of Greek- and Latin-derived words – both inherited or borrowed into European languages, or modern coinages from Greek or Latin roots – are shared among modern European languages – see [[classical compound]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In the past few decades, ''[[wasei-eigo]]'' ("made-in-Japan English") has become a prominent phenomenon. Words such as ''wanpatān'' {{lang|ja|ワンパターン}} (&lt; ''one'' + ''pattern'', "to be in a rut", "to have a one-track mind") and ''sukinshippu'' {{lang|ja|スキンシップ}} (&lt; ''skin'' + ''-ship'', "physical contact"), although coined by compounding English roots, are nonsensical in most non-Japanese contexts; exceptions exist in nearby languages such as Korean however, which often use words such as ''skinship'' and ''rimokon'' (remote control) in the same way as in Japanese.

The popularity of many Japanese cultural exports has made some native Japanese words familiar in English, including ''[[futon]], [[haiku]], [[judo]], [[kamikaze]], [[karaoke]], [[karate]], [[ninja]], [[origami]], [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]]'' (from {{lang|ja|人力車}} ''jinrikisha''), ''[[samurai]], [[Sayonara (disambiguation)|sayonara]], [[Sudoku]], [[sumo]], [[sushi]], [[tsunami]], [[tycoon]]''. See [[list of English words of Japanese origin]] for more.

Literacy was introduced to Japan in the form of the [[Chinese writing system]], by way of [[Baekje]] before the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.asiasocietymuseum.org/buddhist_trade/koreajapan.html Buddhist Art of Korea &amp; Japan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233011/http://www.asiasocietymuseum.org/buddhist_trade/koreajapan.html |date=2016-03-03 }}," Asia Society Museum; "[http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2046.html Kanji]," JapanGuide.com; "[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568150_4/Pottery.html Pottery] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwPni5fJ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568150_4/Pottery.html |date=2009-10-31 }}," MSN Encarta; "[http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=359&amp;pID=334&amp;cName=Japanese History of Japan]," JapanVisitor.com.

At first, the Japanese wrote in [[Classical Chinese]], with Japanese names represented by characters used for their meanings and not their sounds. Later, during the 7th century AD, the Chinese-sounding phoneme principle was used to write pure Japanese poetry and prose, but some Japanese words were still written with characters for their meaning and not the original Chinese sound. This is when the history of Japanese as a written language begins in its own right. By this time, the Japanese language was already very distinct from the [[Ryukyuan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, Patrick. [http://www.sicri-network.org/ISIC1/j.%20ISIC1P%20Heinrich.pdf "What leaves a mark should no longer stain: Progressive erasure and reversing language shift activities in the Ryukyu Islands,"] First International Small Island Cultures Conference at [[Kagoshima University]], Centre for the Pacific Islands, 7–10 February 2005; citing [[Shiro Hattori]].

An example of this mixed style is the [[Kojiki]], which was written in AD 712. They{{who|date=May 2018}} then started to use Chinese characters to write Japanese in a style known as ''man'yōgana'', a syllabic script which used Chinese characters for their sounds in order to transcribe the words of Japanese speech syllable by syllable.

Over time, a writing system evolved. [[Chinese characters]] ([[kanji]]) were used to write either words borrowed from Chinese, or Japanese words with the same or similar meanings. Chinese characters were also used to write grammatical elements, were simplified, and eventually became two syllabic scripts: [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] which were developed based on [[Manyogana]] from Baekje.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=70352|author=John R.

Hiragana and Katakana were first simplified from Kanji, and Hiragana, emerging somewhere around the 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/originofkana.html|title=How did katakana and hiragana originate?|last=Burlock|first=Ben|date=2017|website=sci.lang.japan|access-date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was mainly used by women. Hiragana was seen as an informal language, whereas Katakana and Kanji were considered more formal and was typically used by men and in official settings. However, because of hiragana's easy of use, more and more people began using it. Eventually, by the 10th century, hiragana was used by everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/japanese_hiragana.htm|title=Japanese Hiragana|last=Ager|first=Simon|date=2017|website=Omniglot|access-date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems: [[kanji]], characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese [[loanword]]s into Japanese and a number of native Japanese [[morpheme]]s; and two [[syllabary|syllabaries]]: [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]. The [[Latin script]] (or romaji in Japanese) is used to a certain extent, such as for imported acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names and in other instances where non-Japanese speakers need to know how to pronounce a word (such as "ramen" at a restaurant). Arabic numerals are much more common than the kanji when used in counting, but kanji numerals are still used in compounds, such as {{lang|ja|統一}} ''tōitsu'' ("unification").

Historically, attempts to limit the number of kanji in use commenced in the mid-19th century, but did not become a matter of government intervention until after Japan's defeat in the Second World War. During the period of post-war occupation (and influenced by the views of some U.S. officials), various schemes including the complete abolition of kanji and exclusive use of rōmaji were considered. The ''[[jōyō kanji]]'' ("common use kanji", originally called ''[[tōyō kanji]]'' [kanji for general use]) scheme arose as a compromise solution.

Japanese students begin to learn kanji from their first year at elementary school. A guideline created by the Japanese Ministry of Education, the list of ''[[kyōiku kanji]]'' ("education kanji", a subset of ''[[jōyō kanji]]''), specifies the 1,006 simple characters a child is to learn by the end of sixth grade. Children continue to study another 1,130 characters in junior high school, covering in total 2,136 ''[[jōyō kanji]]''. The official list of ''[[jōyō kanji]]'' was revised several times, but the total number of officially sanctioned characters remained largely unchanged.

As for kanji for personal names, the circumstances are somewhat complicated. ''[[Jōyō kanji]]'' and ''[[jinmeiyō kanji]]'' (an appendix of additional characters for names) are approved for registering personal names. Names containing unapproved characters are denied registration. However, as with the list of ''[[jōyō kanji]]'', criteria for inclusion were often arbitrary and led to many common and popular characters being disapproved for use. Under popular pressure and following a court decision holding the exclusion of common characters unlawful, the list of ''[[jinmeiyō kanji]]'' was substantially extended from 92 in 1951 (the year it was first decreed) to 983 in 2004. Furthermore, families whose names are not on these lists were permitted to continue using the older forms.

===Hiragana===
''[[Hiragana]]'' are used for words without kanji representation, for words no longer written in kanji, and also following kanji to show conjugational endings. Because of the way verbs (and adjectives) in Japanese are [[Japanese verb conjugations|conjugated]], kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood, as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing its meaning. For this reason, hiragana are suffixed to the ends of kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations. Hiragana used in this way are called [[okurigana]]. Hiragana can also be written in a superscript called [[furigana]] above or beside a kanji to show the proper reading. This is done to facilitate learning, as well as to clarify particularly old or obscure (or sometimes invented) readings.

===Katakana===
''[[Katakana]]'', like hiragana, are a [[syllabary]]; katakana are primarily used to write foreign words, plant and animal names, and for emphasis. For example, "Australia" has been adapted as ''Ōsutoraria'' ({{lang|ja|オーストラリア}}), and "supermarket" has been adapted and shortened into ''sūpā'' ({{lang|ja|スーパー}}).

==Study by non-native speakers==
Many major universities throughout the world provide Japanese language courses, and a number of secondary and even primary schools worldwide offer courses in the language. This is much changed from before [[World War II]]; in 1940, only 65 Americans not [[Japanese American|of Japanese descent]] were able to read, write and understand the language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Beate Sirota Gordon]] commencement address at [[Mills College]], 14 May 2011. [http://www.c-span.org/Events/Sotomayor-Denzel-Washington-GE-CEO-Speak-to-Graduates/10737421758-10/ "Sotomayor, Denzel Washington, GE CEO Speak to Graduates,"] C-SPAN (US). 30 May 2011; retrieved 2011-05-30&lt;/ref&gt;

International interest in the Japanese language dates from the 19th century but has become more prevalent following Japan's economic bubble of the 1980s and the global popularity of [[Japanese popular culture]] (such as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s) since the 1990s. Close to 4 million people studied the language worldwide in 2012: more than 1 million Chinese, 872,000 Indonesian, and 840,000 South Koreans studied Japanese in lower and higher educational institutions. In the three years from 2009 to 2012 the number of students studying Japanese in [[China]] increased by 26.5 percent/three years, and by 21.8 percent in [[Indonesia]], but dropped 12.8 percent in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/15/ri-ranks-no-2-learning-japanese-language.html |title=RI ranks No. 2 in learning Japanese language |date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, more than 90,000 foreign students studied at [[List of universities in Japan|Japanese universities]] and Japanese [[language school]]s, including 77,000 Chinese and 15,000 South Koreans in 2003. In addition, local governments and some [[non-profit organisation|NPO]] groups provide free Japanese language classes for foreign residents, including [[Japanese Brazilian]]s and foreigners married to Japanese nationals. In the United Kingdom, study of the Japanese language is supported by the [[British Association for Japanese Studies]]. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Japanese is offered as a language in the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] in some schools.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The Japanese government provides standardized tests to measure spoken and written comprehension of Japanese for second language learners; the most prominent is the [[Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] (JLPT), which features five levels of exams (changed from four levels in 2010), ranging from elementary (N5) to advanced (N1). The JLPT is offered twice a year. The Japanese External Trade Organization [[JETRO]] organizes the ''Business Japanese Proficiency Test'' which tests the learner's ability to understand Japanese in a business setting. The Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation, which took over the BJT from JETRO in 2009, announced in August 2010 that the test would be discontinued in 2011 due to financial pressures on the Foundation. However, it has since issued a statement to the effect that the test will continue to be available as a result of support from the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kanken.or.jp/bjt/english/index.html |title=BJT Business Japanese Proficiency Test |publisher=Kanken.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kanken.or.jp/bjt/pdf/statement-e.pdf |title=Relaunching of the Business Japanese Proficiency Test in FY 2012 and Temporary Measures in FY 2011 |date=25 November 2012 |publisher=Kanken.or.jp |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221212636/http://www.kanken.or.jp/bjt/pdf/statement-e.pdf |archivedate=21 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kirdi''' are the many [[culture]]s and [[ethnic group]]s who inhabit northwestern [[Cameroon]] and northeastern [[Nigeria]].

The term was applied to various peoples who had not [[Conversion to Islam|converted to Islam]] at the time of colonization and was a [[pejorative]], although some writers have [[Reappropriation|reappropriated]] it.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nelson, ''From Cameroon to Paris: Mousgoum Architecture In and Out of Africa'' (2007). University of Chicago Press: p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term comes from the [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] word for [[Paganism|pagan]]; the [[Kanuri people]] are predominantly [[Muslim]].

Estimates of how many groups may be described as Kirdi vary, with estimates ranging from 26 (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nelson, ''From Cameroon to Paris: Mousgoum Architecture In and Out of Africa'' (2007). University of Chicago Press: p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; to more than 40 (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Gert Chesi and Rudolf Kreuzer. ''The Last Africans'' (1977). Perlinger: p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bata, [[Fali people|Fali]], Fata, Gemjek, Guidar, Giziga, Hurza, [[Kapsiki people|Kapsiki]], Mada, [[Mafa people|Mafa]], Massa, Matakam, [[Mofu|Mofou]], Mora, [[Musgum people|Mousgoum]], Muyang, Ouldeme, Podoko, [[Toupouri people|Toupouri]], Vame and Zulgo are all considered Kirdi, due to their resistance to Islam. They speak [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] and [[Adamawa languages]].

The first mentioning of Kirdi is by Denham in 1826 (1985:145) who translates the word ''Kerdies'' as "Negroes who have never embraced the Mohammedan faith".

'''LGBT History Month''' is a month-long annual observance of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] history, and the history of the [[List of LGBT rights by region|gay rights]] and related [[civil rights]] movements.&lt;ref name="glsen"&gt;[http://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/educator/library/record/816.html LGBT History Month Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618034421/http://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/educator/library/record/816.html |date=June 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT History Month provides role models, builds community, and represents a civil rights statement about the contributions of the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Currently, LGBT History Month is a month-long celebration that is specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. In the United States and Canada, it is celebrated in October to coincide with National Coming Out Day on October 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2015/09/02/op-ed-story-behind-first-lgbt-history-month|title=Op-ed: The Story Behind the First LGBT History Month|date=September 2, 2015|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, it is observed during February, to coincide with a major celebration of the 2003 abolition of [[Section 28]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/|title=Home|newspaper=Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans History Month|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Berlin, It is known as Queer History Month. Other LGBT-progressive countries, however, celebrate LGBT History with much shorter events.

LGBT History Month originated in the United States, and was first celebrated in 1994. It was founded by Missouri high-school history teacher Rodney Wilson. Wilson originated the idea, served as founder on the first coordinating committee, and chose October as the month of celebration. Among early supporters and members of the first coordinating committee were [[Kevin Jennings]] of the [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]] (GLSEN); Kevin Boyer of the [[Gerber/Hart Gay and Lesbian Library and Archives]] in Chicago; Paul Varnell, writer for the [[Windy City Times]]; Torey Wilson, Chicago area teacher; Johnda Boyce, women's studies major at Columbus State University and Jessea Greenman of UC-Berkeley. Many gay and lesbian organizations supported the concept early on as did Governors William Weld of Massachusetts and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, Mayors such as Thomas Menino of Boston and Wellington Webb of Denver, who recognized the inaugural month with official proclamations. In 1995, the [[National Education Association]] indicated support of LGBT History Month as well as other history months by resolution at its General Assembly.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

October was chosen by Wilson as the month for the celebration because [[National Coming Out Day]] already was established as a widely known event, on October 11, the date of the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights|Second March of Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.]], In 1987, October also commemorated the first [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] by [[LGBT]] people in 1979. LGBT History Month is intended to encourage honesty and openness about being LGBT.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

While it was first known as Lesbian and Gay History Month, the coordinating committee soon added "bisexual" to the title. It has subsequently become known as LGBT History Month. The event has received criticism from conservative groups, such as the [[Concerned Women for America]] and others who believe it to be a form of "[[indoctrination]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last=K.L.

On June 2, 2000, President [[Bill Clinton]] declared June "Gay &amp; Lesbian Pride Month".&lt;ref name="whitehouse"&gt;{{citation |title=Clinton Declares June 2000 Gay &amp; Lesbian Pride Month|periodical=About.com |date=June 2, 2000 |url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/blgaylesproc.htm |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Barack Obama declared June Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month on June 1, 2009.&lt;ref name="obama"&gt;{{citation |title=President Hails Gay Pride Month|periodical=USA Today|date=June 2, 2009|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/06/67521623/1|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equality Forum, a national and international LGBT civil rights organization with an educational focus, undertook responsibility for LGBT Month in 2006. Each day in October, an Icon is featured with a video, biography, bibliography, downloadable images and other educational resources at www.lgbthistorymonth.com.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
 
In 2011, Equality Forum introduced an internal search engine for all Icons from inception in 2006 to present.

In 2012, for the first time, two American school districts celebrated LGBT History Month. The Broward County school district in Florida signed a resolution in September in support of LGBT Americans, and later that year the Los Angeles school district, America's second-largest, also signed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/08/two-school-districts-recognize-lgbt-month/?hpt=us_bn1 | work=CNN | title=Two school districts recognize LGBT Month | date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United Kingdom ==
LGBT History Month was initiated in the UK by [[Sue Sanders]] and [[Paul Patrick]] as a Schools OUT UK project, which first took place in February 2005. The Month is an annual event in the United Kingdom taking place every February to coincide with a slower month in the schools calendar.

The event came in the wake of the abolition of [[Section 28]] in 2003, the [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003]] as well as the government's proposals to bring in a single equality act and a public duty, although this, in fact, did not come to fruition until 2010.

The Month is intended as a means to raise awareness of, and combat prejudice against the LGBT community while celebrating its achievement and diversity and making it more visible.

The first celebration in 2005 saw the organisation of over 150 events around the UK. The second logo for the organisation behind the month was designed by LGBT [[typographer]] Tony Malone in 2006, and was reworked by him in 2007 when it then became the corporate logo for the national committee.

From that point in time, each yearly iteration of the Month started to receive its own mark designed by students of the University of the Arts and later by design students at the University of Bedfordshire.

=== In England ===
The initiative received government backing from the deputy [[DfES]] and Equalities Minister [[Jacqui Smith]], although some sections of the press argued against its [[political correctness]], and pointed out that the sexuality of some historical figures is more a matter of speculation than fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.ws/cheltmunch/lgbt/main/labels.htm|title=LGBT sub menu|website=www.geocities.ws|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the event countered that it is important to challenge [[heterosexist]] attitudes in society.

The [[DfES]] promised funding for LGBT History Month for the first two years to help get the event off the ground. It is now very well established and has garnered support from other sources. Long standing sponsors include the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]], [[Amnesty International]] and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].

The early patrons of the Month included [[Cyril Nri]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Angela Eagle]], [[Gareth Thomas (rugby)|Gareth Thomas]] and [[Labi Siffre]].

Each year, a "launch event" takes place in November, for the following Month. Those events took place in the following locations:
* 2005: [[Tate Modern]] (sponsored by [[Southwark Council]])
* 2006: the Metropolitan Police's [[Empress State Building]]
* 2007: the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] offered [[Congress House]]
* 2008: the main hall of the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. 
* 2009: [[The Urswick School]]
* 2010: the [[British Museum]] 
* 2011: the [[Oval cricket ground]] 
* 2012: [[Twickenham Stadium]]. 
* 2013: [[Bletchley Park]] 
* 2014: [[Birmingham University]] 
* 2015: the [[Museum of the Order of St John]]
* 2016: [[Queens College, Cambridge]]
* 2017: the [[Museum of Liverpool]]
*2019: [[British Library|The British Library]]

Through the years many speakers have spoken at the events. These include [[Ian McKellen]], [[Stella Duffy]], [[Allan Horsfall]], [[Linda Bellos]], [[Baroness Scotland]] and [[Barbara Follett (politician)|Barbara Follett]], [[Michael Cashman]], [[Stuart Milk]], Phyl gyimah opuku and [[Rikki Beadle Blair]] among others.

On March 5, 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown hosted a reception at Downing Street to mark the Month.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{citation |title=Gordon Brown hosts first LGBT reception |periodical=PinkNews |date=March 6, 2009|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-11500.html |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OUTing the Past festival and the annual Alan Horsfall Lecture===
In 2015 saw the first edition of ''OUTing The Past'', a festival of LGBT History spearheaded by Dr Jeff Evans. The festival started in three venues in Manchester: the LGBT Foundation, The Central Library and the Peoples History Museum. Comprising several presentations of diverse history presented by a mixture of academics, LGBT enthusiasts and activists. Sitting alongside the popular presentations was an academic conference with the inaugural [[Alan Horsfall]] Lecture given by Professor Charles Upchurch of Florida University. This is now a yearly event funded by the [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality]]. There were 3 theatrical performances across the weekend exploring the true story ‘A Very Victorian Scandal’ about the fate of men who attended a drag ball in 1880 in Hulme.

The following year the festival expanded to six hubs around England and the conference had its own slot. The Alan Horsfall lecture was given by Professor [[Susan Stryker]] of the University of Arizona in 2016.

In 2017 there were 18 venues round the country and by now over a hundred presentations on LGBT history had been given. The Alan Horsfall lecture was given by [[Diana Souhami]].

In 2018 there were 11 venues which included Wales and Northern Ireland. The lecture was given by [[Tom Robinson]].

2019 will have 18 venues and will go international as it will include events in The Republic of Ireland Sweden, Norway and New York. The lecture will be given by Dr Jeffrey Weeks in Belfast.

From 2016, Schools OUT UK has partnered with a several contract publishers to produce magazines as an Official Guide to LGBT History Month, putting 35,000 copies of their publication into every secondary school in the UK, plus community spaces, charities and businesses. The magazine had introductions from the leaders of all the main political parties and the [[Mayor of London]]. The magazine's Diversity Dashboard runs job adverts and events listings from LGBT-friendly employers and the community.

=== In Scotland ===
In 2005 and 2006, LGBT History Month was celebrated in Scotland as an LGBT community event, receiving support from LGBT community history projects such as [[Our Story Scotland]] and Remember When.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/collections/topics/lgbt-research-resources|title=Guide to LGBT research resources – National Library of Scotland|website=www.nls.uk|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2007 and 2008, the [[Scottish Government]] provided funding for a post at [[LGBT Youth Scotland]] to bring LGBT History Month into the wider community, including schools and youth groups.

=== In Berlin ===
In Berlin, it is known as Queer History Month instead of LGBT History Month. Every year it takes place in June. It is to educate and help people deal with sexual, [[sexual diversity]], and anti- discrimination in small projects.&lt;ref name="queerhistory.de"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://queerhistory.de/|title=queerhistory.de {{!}} teaching queer history|website=queerhistory.de|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Queer History Month (QHM), people are able to find detailed lessons on queer history suitable for both school and non-school education. Also educational institutions provide education to schools and youth institutions directly.&lt;ref name="queerhistory.de"/&gt;

=== In Greenland ===
In Greenland, LGBT history is celebrated with a Pride Parade instead of a month-long celebration. It started in 2010 when 19-year-old Nuka Bisgard and her friend Lu Berthelse, 24, another woman, teamed up with other Greenlanders to create a pride celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/gay-greenland-past-and-present/|title=Gay Greenland–Past and Present|date=May 6, 2015|newspaper=GlobalGayz|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was made to help Greenland's visible and invisible gay community feel more inclusive and united. On May 15, 2010, their hard work paid off when Pride drew over a thousand participants. Gay Pride has successfully been repeated since 2010.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== In Brazil ===
In Brazil, LGBT history is celebrated during the São Paulo Gay Pride. Its events have been organized by the APOGLBT – Associacao da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, Lesbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e Transexuais (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transvestite Pride Parade Association) since its foundation in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaypridebrazil.org/sao-paulo/events/history.asp|title=Parade History {{!}} Sao Paulo Gay Pride 2013 {{!}} GayPrideBrazil.Org|last=LLC|first=Bookers International|website=www.gaypridebrazil.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the events are held in either May or June.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A non-profit organization, the APOGLBT's mission is to fight for a more just and inclusive society, which recognizes equal rights for all. The association has served to promote citizenship and self-esteem of LGBT by conducting and encouraging activities of all kinds. The almost 22 years of success reflect the seriousness of the organization with its principles and goals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== In Australia ===
{{Advert|section|date=February 2017}}
In Sydney, Australia, in the middle of their summer, Mardi Gras has become a highly anticipated LGBT annual event. It is called the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. There is the parade in the Western World, the Bondi Beach Drag Races, a harbour party, a film festival, a Fair Day, and a series of academic and cultural discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fest300.com/magazine/top-13-lgbt-festivals|title=Celebrate at the 13 Best LGBT Festivals Across the Globe|newspaper=Fest300|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mardi Gras was Sydney's contribution to the international gay solidarity celebrations, an event that had grown up as a result of the Stonewall riots in New York. Mardi Gras was one of a series of events by the [[Gay Solidarity Group]] to promote the forthcoming [[National Homosexual Conference]], and offer support to San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day and its campaign against California State Senator John Brigg's attempts to stop gay rights supporters' teaching in schools. It was also intended to protest the Australian visit of homophobic{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} Festival of Light campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mardigras.org.au/history/|title=History|website=Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is one of Australia's most famous and well-loved events,{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} bringing thousands of visitors to Sydney to join in the celebrations. It captures the imagination of Australia's LGBTQI and mainstream communities, taking over the city for weeks on end, culminating in the world-famous parade: a colorful and dazzling night of pride, celebration and self-expression.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== History ==
The community was founded by Dr. Victor Baranco (son of the Oakland jazz pianist [[Wilbert Baranco]]), a self-made millionaire who had achieved “the American dream” but was still looking for more in life.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One night in 1966 he deliberately examined his life and concluded that he and everything in the world were perfect and that he was responsible for everything that had happened to him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Based on this realization, in 1968 he conceived of the Morehouse lifestyle as one in which people could live together pleasurably without doing anything they didn’t want to do,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/how-to-free-love-commune-neil-strauss-2018-6|title=INSIDE THE WORLD'S LONGEST-RUNNING, MOST SUCCESSFUL FREE LOVE COMMUNE|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=17 June 2018|work=Maxim|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livingexperiment.com/resistance/|title=Resistance to Pleasure|last=Gerasimo|first=Pilar|date=|website=The Living Experiment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while serving the world unselfishly and profiting by it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since its inception, Lafayette Morehouse has conducted extensive research in how a group can live together pleasurably,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; including groups as small as two, focusing on topics such as lifestyles, communication, coupled relationships, and sensuality.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=We’re Just People’ At More University|last=Dewolk|first=Roland|date=|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sensuality was only one among many areas of investigation, this was the topic for which the group became best known.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Their investigations of female equality and the importance of the clitoris in female orgasm were pioneering in the late 1960s and 1970s, and these findings were sometimes sensationalized in the press.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The group gained notoriety for the 1976 public demonstrations of a woman in continuous orgasm for three hours, which it claims were the first known demonstrations of that kind. The group has since trained many people to this standard.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The findings of their social experiments were initially presented as courses under the auspices of the Institute of Human Abilities.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 1977 the State of California adopted laws to encourage and regulate new educational institutions, and More University was created as a DBA of Lafayette Morehouse Inc., a for-profit corporation that had been formed in 1972.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/more-university.html|title=More University|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More University was authorized to grant bachelor of humanities degrees, master’s degrees in communication, as well as doctoral degrees in lifestyles and sensuality, with the faculty drawn from senior members of the group.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/purple-haze/Content?oid=2132347|title=Purple Haze A speedy tour of the Morehouse commune|last=Boulware|first=Jack|date=23 August 1995|work=SF Weekly|access-date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49248350|title=Planet medicine|last=1944-|first=Grossinger, Richard,|date=2000|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=1556433913|edition= Rev., 7th|location=Berkeley, Calif.|oclc=49248350}}&lt;/ref&gt; It completely complied with the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 1977 as a “State Authorized” university.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031203150354/http://www.bppve.ca.gov/reform_act/index.html Private Postsecondary and Vocational Reform Act of 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Although criticized as a “diploma mill,” over a 20-year period it granted degrees to fewer than 90 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=No More Degrees, state orders School.|last=Edwards|first=Katherine|date=5 November 1996|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, responding to a change in the law, Lafayette Morehouse declined to pursue recertification of the University under the new rules, and More University was dissolved.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; No further degrees were granted and the group resumed doing business as Lafayette Morehouse, with much of the same curriculum.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneteau: A brief history &amp; resource guide"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.trellishouse.org/lafayette-morehouse/|title=A brief history &amp; resource guide|website=Lafayette Morehouse and Victor Baranco|last=Beneteau|first=Marc|series=Adventures in Relationship and Community|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Victor Baranco’s death in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/09/12/news/obits.html|accessdate=June 7, 2008|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=September 12, 2002|quote='''Victor Baranco Jr.''', 68, of Haleiwa, educator and founder of the More Phylosophy, died Saturday.

Over the years a substantial number of communal living experiments using Morehouse principles have been conducted.{{refn|group=note|name="quantity"|Sources have estimated between 30 and 100 such communities existed at the peak in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneteau: A brief history &amp; resource guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/sgt-bilko-meets-the-new-culture-19711209|title=Sgt Bilko Meets the New Culture|last=Green|first=Robin|date=9 Dec 1971|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Most of these have been in northern California,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; but related communities have also been located in New York,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/what-this-66-year-old-model-learned-on-a-commune-women-bring-the-joy-to-the-table-172820996.html|title=66-Year-Old Model on Her Unconventional Beauty, Hedonistic Commune Life|last=Greenfield|first=Beth|date=8 March 2017|website=Yahoo!

== Life in the Community ==
The everyday goal is to live pleasurably with one’s friends.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The group has found that people who live deliberately and with awareness enjoy more fun relationships, which have tended to endure and deepen in intimacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Residents pursue their individual goals with the support of the group.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Residents also share group goals and participate in group activities, such as maintenance of the property, entertaining family and friends, putting on courses and holiday celebrations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

People have their own money and make contributions to communal expenses, goals, and projects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some residents have jobs outside of Morehouse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

One group goal is taking care of the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Residents are encouraged to include this as an ongoing part of their lives, according to the viewpoint that the best life includes serving the world unselfishly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

According to their website, “There is no label regarding sexual choices that applies across the board for our group. Sexual preference is a personal choice. Some people here are celibate, many are monogamous and some have more than one partner.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/faq.html#poly|title=Are you polyamorous?|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents adhere to a strict sexual health screening program, begun in the late 1970s, to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/faq.html#std|title=How do you maintain the sexual health of your community in this age of STDs that are incurable or potentially fatal?|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political expression of the More philosophy is called the one no-vote, a decision-making system in which any participant, regardless of age, gender, time with the community, or any other factor can cast an irrevocable “no-vote” which stops any proposed new action.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/one_no-vote.html|title=One no-vote|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is meant to encourage open communication and ensure that all voices are heard and considered before moving forward.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ic.org/directory/oakland-morehouse/|title=Oakland Morehouse|last=|first=|date=|website=Fellowship for Intentional Community|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
The business of Lafayette Morehouse Inc. relies on word of mouth, without advertising.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The courses, in which research findings are presented, are held at various locations and produce income for communally-held goals, communal financial obligations and the ongoing research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Course topics include pleasurable interpersonal relationships, effective communication, alternative lifestyles, jealousy, money, philosophical viewpoints on perfection, and a gratifying sensual life.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; “It is not our goal to have others live as we do, but rather to offer our findings so that our students can use whatever elements they find beneficial. Those situations that all people encounter and must resolve in order to have happy, fulfilling lives are addressed in these courses.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One source estimates that, as of 1997, over 100,000 people had taken at least one Lafayette Morehouse course, and over 1,000 people had lived in a Morehouse and participated in the social research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Criticisms and Controversies ==

One widely cited criticism of Victor Baranco and the Morehouse community was in David Felton's book ''Mindfuckers''.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/516433|title=Mindfuckers; a source book on the rise of acid fascism in America, including material on Charles Manson, Mel Lyman, Victor Baranco, and their followers,|last=Felton.|first=David,|date=1972|publisher=Straight Arrow Books|others=Green, Robin., Dalton, David, 1945-|isbn=0879320389|location=[San Francisco]|oclc=516433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section on Baranco was repackaged from two Rolling Stone articles, and the principle allegation was that he profited excessively by having group members pay to live in houses while renovating them.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.trussel.com/lyman/guru.html|title=Beyond Shazam at Guru Gulch|last=Green|first=Robin|date=3 August 1972|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=3 June 2018|issue=114|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Jann Wenner, the editor of Rolling Stone, said the material on Baranco was written to personally attack Baranco.{{refn|group=note|name="hagan"|''[Jann Wenner,] in an Oedipal rage...attacked Baranco in the only way he knew how: He assigned writer Robin Green, his resident assassin, to profile him [Baranco] in Rolling Stone and "really expose him for the hustler he was."'' - in ''Sticky Fingers: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner'' by Joe Hagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987992115|title=Sticky fingers : the life and times of Jann Wenner and Rolling stone magazine|last=1971-|first=Hagan, Joe,|pages=253–254|isbn=9781101874370|edition= First |location=New York|oclc=987992115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} These allegations against Baranco have not been repeated since 1972.

Many journalists have described Morehouse as a “sex commune”&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; or “sex cult,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Nicole-Daedone-s-mission-of-orgasmic-meditation-2368554.php|title=Nicole Daedone's mission of orgasmic meditation|last=Bowles|first=Nellie|date=12 June 2011|work=SF Gate|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the group’s sexual research and courses taught on sexual topics.

The group has been criticized for having poor relationships with its neighbors.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billingsley-1994-p-13" /&gt;  Most of these criticisms date to the period of time (1991 – 2000) in which the group opened its doors and provided food and shelter to a large number of homeless people as their guests, using military surplus tents.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Lawyers Open Morehouse Court Fight|last=Wasiczko|first=Donna|date=25 May 1994|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors were angered by the influx of unattractive people,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; and the county sought to enforce zoning codes to end the activity. The group argued it was their right to use their own home to take care of people that were homeless.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; In an effort to mute extensive criticism in the press, the group undertook a lawsuit against the San Francisco Chronicle, which they lost. After a long court battle with Contra Costa County, Lafayette Morehouse was ordered to take down the tents.

{{Generations Sidebar}}
The '''Lost Generation''' was the [[generation]] that came of age during [[World War I]]. Demographers [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] outlined their [[Strauss–Howe generational theory]] using 1883–1900 as birth years for them. The term was coined by [[Gertrude Stein]] and popularized by [[Ernest Hemingway]], who used it as one of two contrasting epigraphs for his novel ''[[The Sun Also Rises]].'' Hemingway credits the phrase to Gertrude Stein, who was then his mentor and patron.

== In literature ==
[[File:GertrudeStein JackHemingway Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Gertrude Stein]] with [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s son, [[Jack Hemingway]] (nicknamed Bumby) in 1924. Stein is credited with bringing the term "Lost Generation" into use.]] In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'' (1964), published after Hemingway's and Stein's deaths, Hemingway writes that Stein heard the phrase from a garage owner who serviced Stein's car. When a young mechanic failed to repair the car quickly enough, the garage owner shouted at the boy, "You are all a "''génération perdue.''"{{r|hemingway|page=29}} Stein, in telling Hemingway the story, added, "That is what you are. That's what you all are&amp;nbsp;... all of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation."{{r|hemingway|page=29}} &lt;ref&gt;Mellow, James R. (1991).

The 1926 publication of Hemingway's ''The Sun Also Rises'' popularized the term as Hemingway used it as an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]. The novel serves to epitomize the post-war expatriate generation.{{r|mellow1992|page=302}} However, Hemingway later wrote to his editor [[Max Perkins]] that the "point of the book" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that "the earth abideth forever"; he believed the characters in ''The Sun Also Rises'' may have been "battered" but were not lost.{{r|baker|page=82}}

In his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', published after his death, he writes "I tried to balance Miss Stein's quotation from the garage owner with one from [[Ecclesiastes]]."A few lines later, recalling the risks and losses of the war, he adds: "I thought of Miss Stein and [[Sherwood Anderson]] and egotism and mental laziness versus discipline and I thought 'who is calling who a lost generation?{{'"}}{{r|hemingway|pages=29–30}}

== Literary themes ==
The writings of the Lost Generation literary figures tended to have common themes. These themes mostly pertained to the writers' experiences in [[World War I]] and the years following it. It is said that the work of these writers was autobiographical based on their use of mythologized versions of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehemingwayproject.com/hemingway-the-fitzgeralds-and-the-lost-generation-an-interview-with-kirk-curnutt/|title=Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, and the Lost Generation: An Interview with Kirk Curnutt {{!}} The Hemingway Project|website=www.thehemingwayproject.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the themes that commonly appears in the authors' works is decadence and the frivolous lifestyle of the wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://writersinspire.org/content/lost-generation|title=Lost Generation {{!}} Great Writers Inspire|website=writersinspire.org|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hemingway and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]] touched on this theme throughout the novels ''The Sun Also Rises'' and ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''. Another theme commonly found in the works of these authors was the death of the [[American dream]], which is exhibited throughout many of their novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interestingarticles.com/literature/american-lost-generation-11089.html|title=American Lost Generation|website=InterestingArticles.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly prominent in ''The Great Gatsby'', in which the character [[Nick Carraway]] comes to realize the corruption that surrounds him.

==Other uses==
The term is also used in a broader context for the generation of young people who came of age during and shortly after [[World War I]]. Authors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]], well known for [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|their generational theory]], define the Lost Generation as the cohort born from 1883 to 1900, who came of age during World War I and the [[Roaring Twenties]].{{r|howe}} In [[Europe]], they are mostly known as the "Generation of 1914", for the year World War I began.{{r|wohl}} In France, the country in which many [[expatriates]] settled, they were sometimes called the ''Génération au Feu'', the "Generation in Flames". In [[Great Britain]], the term was originally used for those who died in the war,{{r|aftermath}} and often implicitly referred to upper-class casualties who were perceived to have died disproportionately, robbing the country of a future elite.{{r|winter}} Many felt that "the flower of youth and the best manhood of the peoples [had] been mowed down,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosa Luxemburg]] et al., "[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVo5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA374 A Spartacan Manifesto], ''[[The Nation]]'', March 8, 1919, pp. 373-374&lt;/ref&gt; for example such notable casualties as the poets [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]] and [[Wilfred Owen]],{{r|bbc}} composer [[George Butterworth]] and physicist [[Henry Moseley]].

Because the United States was a safe haven from the persecution, repression, and murder characteristic of fascist and communist regimes, the United States often became a refuge for entrepreneurs, scientists (like [[Enrico Fermi]]), and creative people (like [[Bohuslav Martinů]]) who did much of their best work in America.

Applying the birth years used by Strauss and Howe, the last known American member of the Lost Generation to live was [[Susannah Mushatt Jones]] (July 6, 1899 – May 12, 2016), while [[Nabi Tajima]] (4 August 1900 – 21 April 2018) from [[Japan]] was the last known living member of this generation overall,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travelwirenews.com/worlds-oldest-person-dies-giving-title-to-japanese-supercentenarian-414418/|title=World’s oldest person dies, giving title to Japanese supercentenarian|last=Lekach|first=Sasha|date=2017-09-16|work=TravelWireNews|access-date=2017-09-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it fully ancestral worldwide.

[[File:Lovestamp.png|thumb|[[United States postage stamps|1973 US postage stamp]]]]
'''''Love''''' is a [[pop art]] image by American artist [[Robert Indiana]]. It consists of the letters L and O over the letters V and E in bold [[Didone (typography)|Didone type]]; the O is slanted sideways so that its [[Rectangle|oblong]] [[negative space]] creates a line leading to the V. The original image, with green and blue spaces backing red lettering, served as a [[Photographic print|print]] image for a [[Museum of Modern Art]] [[Christmas card]] in 1964. In much this same form the design soon graced a popular US [[postage stamp]].

''Love''{{'}}s [[Love (Indianapolis)|original rendering]] in [[sculpture]] was made in 1970 and is displayed in Indiana at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]. The material is [[Weathering steel|COR-TEN]] steel.&lt;ref name="Love IMA"&gt;[http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/love-indiana-robert "Love" (sculpture)], Explore Art: IMA Collections. Retrieved 5 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana's ''Love'' design has since been reproduced in a variety of formats for rendering in displays around the world.

==Significance==

===Original inspirations===
[[File:LOVE Park Philly.JPG|thumb|[[Love Park]], officially John F. Kennedy Plaza, with the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the distant background]]
MoMA historian Deborah Wye&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Deborah Wye, Artists and Prints: Masterworks from The Museum of Modern Art, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2004, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; describes Indiana's image as "full of erotic, religious, autobiographical, and political underpinnings" that make it "both accessible and complex in meaning.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=68726|title=MoMA|work=MoMA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megan Wilde offered more detail about the autobiographical origins in an article for ''[[Mental Floss]]'' magazine, "[T]he word ''love'' was connected to [the artist's] childhood experiences attending a [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science]] church, where the only decoration was the wall inscription "God is Love". The colors were an homage to his father, who worked at a [[Phillips 66]] gas station during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]". She quotes Robert Indiana as describing the original colors as "the red and green of that sign against the blue [[Hoosier]] sky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/25276/masterpieces-robert-indianas-love|title=Masterpieces: Robert Indiana's Love|work=Mental Floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired associations===
Indiana's image was quickly adapted upon its appearance in the 1960s by the [[hippie]] [[free love]] movement and again in the 1990s by [[skateboard]] enthusiasts after skateboarding was banned in [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Love Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/lovepark/index.htm Free Love Park, Philadelphia PA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030602174604/http://ushistory.org/lovepark/index.htm |date=2003-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|List of Love sculptures}}
Versions of the sculpture now exist in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and Spanish, as well as the original English.

The image has been rendered and parodied in many forms. After the 1964 MoMA card, one of the early commercial uses of the image was on the LP cover of the 1967 studio recording of [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s [[Turangalila Symphony]], featuring the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Seiji Ozawa]] (RCA LSC-7051). The original book cover for [[Erich Segal]]'s novel ''[[Love Story (novel)|Love Story]]'' alluded to the design, and the TV series ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' included a shot of the Sixth Avenue sculpture in its opening credits. The first opening sequence of the ''[[Skip Beat!]]'' anime includes the image in the initial frames. The United States Post Office issued an eight-cent stamp in 1973 featuring the image. Parodies of the image appeared on covers of records by [[Rage Against the Machine]] (''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]''), [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] ([[Little by Little (Oasis song)|"Little by Little"]] single) and [[Acen Razvi]] (''[[75 Minutes]]''). London artist [[D*Face]] parodied the image by rendering the word "hate" with the "A" tilted and Belgian artist Eddy Gabriel made a version using the word "lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witzenstein.blogspot.com/2007/07/robert-indiana-in-temple-of-doom.html|title=Witzenstein|author=witzenstein|work=witzenstein.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is remade to read "THPS" in [[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2#Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2X|the Xbox expansion of ''Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2'']], which has a stage set in [[Love Park|Philadelphia's Love Park]]. The set reappears in ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground 2]]''.

In 2003, the iconic letters were painted on a tennis court next to the Nike SF-89L Nuclear Missile Site behind the abandoned [[Public Health Service Hospital]] in the [[Presidio]] of [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Normal|url=http://realnormal.blogspot.com/2010/04/i-scoured-internet-for-image-of-this.html|work=Public Art on Public Site|publisher=Baily Salisbury|date=26 April 2015|access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to conceptual artist, [[Erik Seidenglanz]], the letters are proportional to the tennis court, identical to [[Robert Indiana]]'s ''Love'' typography are painted in white and a mirror image of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Love Love|url=http://www.playplayplay.org/lovelove|work=Love Is Not A Zero|publisher=ESP|access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''Love'' court can be found in the History Imagery timeline of [[Google Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Earth Forums|url=https://productforums.google.com/d/topic/gec-earth-browsing/FgDTXIwAHl0/discussion|work=Public Art on Public Site|publisher=Baily Salisbury|date=26 April 2015|access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2011, [[Google]] posted a special [[Valentine's Day]] edition of its [[Google logo|logo]] based on the famous image.

The [[Directorate-General for External Security]] (DGSE) of France maintains a close relationship with both the NSA and the GCHQ after discussions for increased cooperation began in November 2006.&lt;ref name=frlemjac&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/11/29/la-france-precieux-partenaire-de-l-espionnage-de-la-nsa_3522653_651865.html |title=La France, précieux partenaire de l'espionnage de la NSA |author=Jacques Follorou |work=Le Monde |language=French |date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2014-03-22 |archivedate=2013-11-30 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131130144856/http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/11/29/la-france-precieux-partenaire-de-l-espionnage-de-la-nsa_3522653_651865.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 2010s, the extent of cooperation in the joint interception of digital data by the DGSE and the NSA was noted to have increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=frlemjac /&gt;&lt;ref name="rfi-dgse-nsa-partnerschaft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfi.fr/ameriques/20131130-espionnage-services-secrets-francais-precieux-partenaires-nsa-americaine/?ns_campaign=google_choix_redactions&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;ns_linkname=ameriques.20131130-espionnage-services-secrets-francais-precieux-partenaires-nsa-americaine&amp;ns_mchannel=editors_picks&amp;ns_source=google_actualite |title=Espionnage: les services secrets français précieux partenaires de la NSA américaine |author=Radio France Internationale |work=Radio France Internationale |language=French |date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2014-03-22 |archivedate=2014-03-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OH01RbbB?url=http://www.rfi.fr/ameriques/20131130-espionnage-services-secrets-francais-precieux-partenaires-nsa-americaine/?ns_campaign=google_choix_redactions&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;ns_linkname=ameriques.20131130-espionnage-services-secrets-francais-precieux-partenaires-nsa-americ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a formal [[memorandum]] for data exchange was signed by the DGSE and the NSA, which facilitated the transfer of millions of [[metadata]] records from the DGSE to the NSA.&lt;ref name="lemonde1" /&gt; In 2013, the existence of the Lustre treaty was revealed in documents leaked by the former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name="lemonde1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2013/10/30/surveillance-la-dgse-a-transmis-des-donnees-a-la-nsa-americaine_3505266_3210.html |title=Surveillance : la DGSE a transmis des données à la NSA américaine |author=Jacques Follorou |work=Le Monde |language=French |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-22 |archivedate=2013-11-01 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131101055116/http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2013/10/30/surveillance-la-dgse-a-transmis-des-donnees-a-la-nsa-americaine_3505266_3210.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Dannecker''' (born 1942 in [[Oberndorf am Neckar]]) is a [[Germany|German]] sexologist and author.

Dannecker was born in Oberndorf am Neckar. After his schooling, he initially entered industrial retailing and later trained as an actor at a theater school in [[Stuttgart]]. During this time, Dannecker [[coming out|came out]]&lt;ref name="queering"&gt;{{citation |title=Queering the Canon: Defying Sights in German Literature and Culture |first=John L |last=Plews |first2=Christoph |last2=Lorey |year=1998 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |isbn=1-57113-178-7 |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started to read literature on [[homosexuality]]. In 1966, Dannecker moved to [[Frankfurt am Main]], and he enrolled at the university with a focus on philosophy, sociology, and psychology. In 1974, he and psychoanalyst [[Reimut Reiche]] published ''Der gewöhnliche Homosexuelle'', a wide-ranging empirical study of German homosexuals.

Dannecker collaborated with director [[Rosa von Praunheim]] on the film ''[[It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives|Nicht der Homosexuelle ist pervers, sondern die Situation, in der er lebt]]''. This film was premiered on [[WDR Television]] in 1972 and is widely credited with launching the modern German gay rights movement.

From 1977 to 2005, Dannecker was employed at the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]], located at the University of Frankfurt clinic, where he offered courses on sexual counseling as well as homosexuality and film studies. He authored numerous articles and books on homosexuality, [[HIV/AIDS]] and sexual orientation.  He also participated in workshops and conferences on film and [[LGBT]] topics. In 2005, Dannecker retired and moved from Frankfurt to [[Berlin]].

Dannecker is a member of the board of directors at the organisation ''Queer Nations e.V.''. Along with [[Gunter Schmidt]] and [[Volkmar Sigusch]], he is editor of ''Beiträge zur Sexualforschung'', which is published in ''Psychosozial-Verlag''. He continues to offer workshops on sexual counseling, particularly in Austria.

{{merge to|Prison–industrial complex|date=November 2018}}
The [[Prison–industrial complex|Prison Industrial Complex]] is the rapid expansion of US inmates and prisons in favor of the [[private prison]] companies and businesses that profit from the services needed in the construction and maintaining of prisons. These businesses benefit and profit from cheap prison labor, food services, medical services, surveillance technology, and construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Prison–industrial complex|date=2018-11-10|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex&amp;oldid=868123716|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial incentive of building prisons encourages incarceration and affects people of color at disproportionally high rates. Native Americans are the largest group per capita in the US prison system and are more likely to affected by police violence than any other racial group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cjcj.org/news/8113|title=Who Are Police Killing? — Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice|website=www.cjcj.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Incarceration Statistics ==
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, Native Americans are incarcerated at a rate 38% higher than the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greenfield |title=American Indians and Crime |url=https://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/aic.pdf. |website=Bureau of Justice Statistics |publisher=US Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 19 states, Indigenous people are overrepresented in the prison population compared to any other race and ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sakala |first1=L |title=Breaking Down Mass Incarceration in the 2010 Census |url=https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/rates.html |website=www.prisonpolicy.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In South Dakota, Native people represent 5% of the total population, while 29% are under the prison system.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flanigan |first1=J |title=Native Americans are the unseen victims of a broken US justice system |url=https://qz.com/392342/native-americans-are-the-unseen-victims-of-a-broken-us-justice-system/ |website=Quartz |accessdate=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Alaska, data published by the 2010 US Census reveal that 38% of incarcerated people are American Indian or Alaskan Native while only 15% of the total population is.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Hawaii, Native Hawaiians only make up 24% of the general population. However, they account for 39% of the incarcerated population according to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Kalaniopua |title=Captive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison Industrial Complex |date=2015 |page=83-96 |url=https://trueleappress.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/stanely-smith-captive-genders.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native youth are highly impacted by the US prison system; despite accounting for 1% of the national youth population, 70% of youth taken into federal prison are Native American.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Native Lives Matter |url=https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lakota-peoples-law/uploads/Native-Lives-Matter-PDF.pdf |publisher=Lakota People's Law Project |date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American men are admitted to prison at four times the rate of white men while Native women are admitted at 6 times the rate of white women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Effects of US Intervention on Tribal Governments==

Due to a complicated legal history of the United States interceding and dismantling tribal justice systems, tribal governments have much more limited jurisdiction compared to federal justice systems and US state systems.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarah |first1=Deer |title=Soviengty of the Soul: Exploring the Intersection of Rape Law Reform and Federal Indian Law |journal=Suffolk UL |date=2005 |volume=37 |pages=455-466}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Major Crimes Act]] in 1885, [[Public Law 280]] in 1953, [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968|The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]] and the case law of [[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]] in 1978 are some of the first historic laws among many passed by the United States government to gain federal control over native nations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This has disrupted the autonomy of tribal justice systems today and has caused the crime on Native reservations to often be prosecuted under federal law which entails more severe sentencing than state law for the same crime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Non-native criminals including sexual predators and drug traffickers have taken advantage of the unclear chain of authority on Native lands. This disjuncture between federal government jurisdiction and tribal government jurisdiction allows non-native criminals to avoid  punishment while Native members are subjected to sexual and drug violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Azar |first1=Beth |title=When Tribal Law Conflicts with Federal Law |url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/04/tribal-law.aspx |website=American Psychological Association |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Police Violence Against Native Americans ==
[[Police brutality against Native Americans]] contributes greatly to the rising incarceration rates and deaths of Native people. While Native Americans only make up 1.2% of the total population in the US, Natives experience higher rates of death due to police violence than any other racial group.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Native Lives Matter |url=https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/lakota-peoples-law/uploads/Native-Lives-Matter-PDF.pdf |publisher=Lakota People's Law Project |date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Native Americans are 3 times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Advocacy ==

===== Native Lives Matter =====
The "Native Lives Matter" campaign is a grassroots group advocating for awareness and justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women and Native lives killed by police violence. The campaign was established in 2014 by Akicita Sunka-Wakan Ska from the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux Tribes and JR Bobick from St. Paul, Minnesota.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This campaign uses social media like Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness about issues affecting the Native population, such as police brutality, high incarceration, and missing murdered indigenous women. The campaign believes ways to lessen and end police brutality and high incarceration rates include hiring a police force that better represents Native communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This would allow for more cultural understanding and lead to less racial profiling against tribal nations by police enforcement. Native Lives Matter also believes that cultural healing programs could address and eventually lessen police brutality by fostering an understanding of mental health, addiction, and poverty which contribute to high police presence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Other social justice groups like [[Black Lives Matter|"Black Lives Matter"]] and [[Idle No More|"Idle No More"]] have called attention to the numerous deaths of Native people due to police violence.

[[Image:Nuo opera performance.jpg|270px|thumb|People performing Nuo opera]]
{{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}
'''Nuo opera''' or '''Nuo drama''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|傩戏}}|t={{linktext|儺戲}}|p={{linktext|nuóxì}}}}) is one of the most popular folk operas in [[southern China]]. Characterized by its special features such as ferocious masks, unique dresses and adornments, the strange language used in performance, and mysterious scenes, '''Nuo opera''' has been selected {{by whom|date=April 2014}}as one of the non-material cultural legacies of China. The opera is a religious performance intrinsic to the culture of [[Nuoism]], a type of [[Chinese folk religion]]. The purpose of Nuo opera is to drive away devils, disease and evil influences, and also to petition for blessings from the gods. Singing and dancing are included in Nuo opera and performers wear costumes and masks.

Nuo opera is a direct and important expressive medium of Nuo culture. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Other forms of representation of the Nuo culture include Nuo dance (傩舞/儺舞), Nuo song (傩歌/儺歌), Nuo sacrifice (傩祭) and Nuo ceremony (傩仪/儺儀) and others. The unique symbol of Nuo opera, the masks, are considered a treasure of Chinese folk art.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Zhang, Tianlin 张天林: ''Nuoxi: mysterious Chinese Opera and Its Masks (神秘的傩文化——傩戏与傩面具)''. '''Page 49, Women in China (01/2007)'''&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a considerable repertoire in Nuo opera and this varies from area to area. Nuo operas are usually based on well-known Chinese historical events or folk stories such as ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', ''[[Journey to the West]]'', ''[[Water Margin]]'' and the story of the [[Dragon Kings]]. Some famous repertoires of Nuo opera include ''[[Lady Mengjiang]]'', ''Seizing the Yellow Devil'', and ''Story of [[Mount Liang]]''.

During the [[Zhou dynasty]] (11th century-256 BC), this art form was very popular in the [[Yangtze River]], [[Yellow River]] and Nenjiang River valleys {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. However, the opera's popularity waned in those river valley areas. Nowadays, it still remains popular among rural areas in southwest China, such as [[Guizhou]], [[Anhui]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Hubei]], [[Hunan]] provinces and [[Guangxi|Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]]. It is especially popular in the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities such as the [[Tujia people|Tujia]], the [[Miao people|Miao]], the [[Dong people|Dong]] and [[Yao people|Yao]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Etymology==
''Nuo'' means an [[oath]], binding utterance, or [[exorcism]] in Chinese religious culture. The Chinese character for "nuo" is "傩" in simplified Chinese or "儺" in traditional Chinese. This is a very uncommon character in modern Chinese. The meaning of the character "Nuo" is a patterned step to drive away the devil during the last month of the Chinese lunar new year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/focus/nuo-drama.htm Nuo Drama of China: History, Mask, Region&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese character for "opera" is "戏" in simplified Chinese or "戲" in traditional Chinese.

==History==
The Nuo opera is a kind of folk dramatic art that originated from a [[Nuoism|primordial religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu Jingxia 吴靖霞: ''Dramatic Art as Cultural-historical Sediment---The Origin, Development, and Artistic Substance of the Nuo Opera  (历史文化的积淀——从傩戏的起源和发展探傩戏的本质)''. '''Page 93, No.5, 2006, Guizhou Ethnic Studies (贵州民族研究）'''&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'', "villager Nuo" (or village Nuo) was mentioned. The ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' mentions that there was also a custom that whenever there was a celebration, grand Nuo (or royal Nuo) would be a necessity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://apps.ah.gov.cn/Character/mainmenu.asp?newsid=646&amp;title=Chizhou%20Nuo%20Opera Welcome to Anhui!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
The primitive form, dating back to antiquity, of Nuo opera is ''Nuoji'' (simplified: 傩祭; traditional: 儺祭), which is a special sacrificial ceremony. "Ji" means sacrifice or sacrificial activities and events. While performing religious rites, people pray to ward off disasters and receive good luck. So, ''Nuoji'' was formed as a sacrificial activity or ceremony to worship gods and ancestors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The exact date when ''Nuoji'' was formed is unknown, but the Nuo ceremony was first recorded on [[oracle bones]] during the [[Shang dynasty]] (17th-11th century BC), and flourished in the [[Zhou dynasty]] (11th century-256BC).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the Zhou dynasty, ''Nuoji'' was already very popular within the central parts of its territory. ''Nuoji'' was performed during festivals and holidays at that time with the purpose of driving away devils and plague. ''Nuoji'' was a very important social, political, and religious event and a specific government department was established to be in charge of ''Nuoji''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} At the time, besides the grand Nuo ceremony held by the royal court, the folk Nuo ceremony also appeared in the countryside.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;http://www.nikerchina.com/english/chinaculture/art/Drama/Nuo-Culture-Legacy-of-Chinese-Ancient-Drama.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
During and after the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), ''Nuoji'' gradually developed into a dance drama and became more of a recreation than a ritual. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} It became a masked drama enacted by a priest performing an exorcism, and has been described as "theater with a presentational aspect, a festival, and the idea of gatherings to establish ties and norms."{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The rituals have been incorporated into people's lives and are seen as commentaries on Chinese life.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Around the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), people started to perform with masks during ''Nuoji''; thus Nuo opera was basically formed. During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911), Nuo opera, which had separated from ''Nuoji'', had become a unique performing art. During the 1930s and 1940s, Nuo opera began to be performed in busy cities and towns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Today, the popularity of Nuo opera has declined and it can normally only be seen during the [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]] and other important [[traditional Chinese holidays]], in remote mountainous areas, such as [[Guizhou]], [[Hunan]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Yunnan]], [[Sichuan]], and [[Anhui]] provinces, inhabited mostly by minority ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===After the Establishment of People's Republic of China===
After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, the influence and popularity of Nuo opera was suppressed by the Chinese government, because the superstitious elements in Nuo opera were contrary to the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]] which advocated atheism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Recently (probably after the year 2000), scholars from both China and abroad started becoming interested in ''nuo'' opera again because of its precious historical value. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} [[Nuoism]] has been promoted by the Chinese government as a matrix of ethnic identity, especially of the [[Tujia people]].&lt;ref&gt;Lan Li. The Changing Role of the Popular Religion of Nuo (傩) in Modern Chinese Politics. Modern Asian Studies (Impact Factor: 0.36). 01/2010; 44(02):1-23. DOI:10.1017/S0026749X10000090&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
Nuo opera varies greatly from place to place because local culture and customs have a great influence on the form, masks, costumes and conventions of Nuo opera. Generally, Nuo opera can be categorized as follows: [[Guizhou]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Anhui]], and [[Yunnan]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

===[[Guizhou]] Nuo===
[[Guizhou]] is the center of Nuo drama in southwestern China due to its long Nuo opera history and abundant repertoire. In [[Anshun]], a city in [[Guizhou]], ''nuo'' opera is the primary entertainment activity {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Musical instruments include one [[gong]] and one [[drum]]. The drummer has a very important role during a performance. A patch of land serves as a stage. As a result, Guizhou Nuo is also called ''Dixi'' (ground opera).

The only two occasions for the performance of Nuo opera are at the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and at the middle of the 7th lunar month, the time of the rice harvest. People hope the Nuo opera can drive away bad luck and bring a good harvest. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Year after year, numerous locals are attracted to this performance. Sometimes a drama can last a dozen days. As is true in most other areas, Nuo Drama in Tunbu is the performed by the men. The moment a dancer puts on his mask, he will not speak or act casually since putting on a mask means the spirit is on him already.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

===[[Jiangxi]] Nuo===
[[Jiangxi]] (江西) Nuo is usually called Gan Nuo as [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] (赣 贛) is the abbreviation of [[Jiangxi]] Province. Nuo opera is most popular in the counties of [[Nanfeng]] and Shangli in Jiangxi. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} From late [[Qing Dynasty]] to now, there were about 150 Nuo opera performing groups. A temple for the ''Nuo'' god, which was built in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and still functions well today for people to worship the ''Nuo'' god. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} About 80 Nuo opera programs from the past still exist today. The number of Nuo opera masks in Jiangxi is over 2000, and there are approximately 2000 professional Nuo opera performing folk artists {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. In Shangli county, a popular saying says that, in ancient times, there was a Nuo god every five kilometers. Therefore, Shangli county preserves over 20 Nuo god temples.&lt;ref&gt;Bai Mu 白木: ''Historical Nuo culture in China (我国历史悠远的傩文化)''. '''Page 52, No. 8, 2006, Wenshichunqiu (文史春秋)'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuo dancing, one of the most ancient arts and a necessary element in Nuo opera, has existed in [[Nanfeng]], [[Jiangxi]] for over 2000 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The movements of Nanfeng Nuo dancing are simple but powerful, retaining their ancient characters.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.fourp.org/2007/08/nuo-dancing/&lt;/ref&gt; Nanfeng Nuo dancing was even regarded as "The Active fossil of Chinese dancing Art".&lt;ref&gt;"The collection of Chinese National and folk dancing from Jiangxi"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Nanfeng county was called "The village of Chinese folk Art-Nuo Art" by National Culture Department of [[China]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===[[Anhui]] Nuo===
[[Anhui]] (安徽) Nuo is special because it is performed on a clan basis and not by a troupe as in other places. [[Chizhou]] Nuo is the best known Nuo opera of [[Anhui]] Nuo.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The origins of Nuo culture in Chizhou areas is one of the most ancient and can be traced back over thousands of years to the neolithic period. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} It has been recently included in the Nation’s First Catalogue of Intangible Cultural Heritage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Chizhou Nuo Opera is divided into three performing formats: Nuo Ritual. Nuo Dancing and Nuo Drama. The complete stage performance must be mixed with dramatic plot, role-playing, type of role, and qiemo (settings, scene and props). The performing skill can only be learned through oral instruction and the personal teachings passed on to disciples in person from generation to generation. Therefore, the performing art of Nuo opera is normally passed on within a clan from generation to generation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; There may be two sacrificial ceremonies (in which the Nuo opera are performed as a must) a year: the "spring sacrificial ceremony" that is held sometime between the seventh day to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month and the "autumn sacrificial ceremony" that is held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. Apart from these two ceremonies, there is no performance at all throughout the year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The dance, which has a strong local flavor, continues in many villages in [[Guichi County]] of Chizhou today. Surrounded in the mist of incense and smoke, Nuo dancers, colorfully dressed, walk on [[stilts]] and wear masks while performing, expressing their wishes of sacrifice to their ancestors, praying for blessing and dispelling evil. While performing in  mountainous villages, dancers have to put masks on their foreheads, letting the audiences who are standing on the surrounding slopes to see them clearly. To accompany the dancing, the music instruments range from [[drum]], [[Bell (instrument)|bell]], earthen bowl,  bamboo flute and [[Suona]].  There is a popular saying among Chizhou area that a village would not be considered a village without Nuo opera.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

When Chizhou Nuo Opera is performed, it normally has three integrated components: Nuo dancing, main performance, and salutatory &amp;and complimentary remarks. Some of the well-known repertoire of Chizhou Nuo are "Liu Wenlong", "Meng Jiangnü", "Fan Silking" and "Zhang Wenxian" etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

===[[Yunnan]] Nuo===
Leopard Nuo opera in [[Chuxiong City]], [[Yunnan]], differentiates itself by the fact that all dancers are painted with a leopard pattern on their nude bodies. The ferocious and agile leopard is regarded as the most qualified to drive away devils.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Leopards are played by twelve [[Yi people|Yi]] boys about 10 years old. On the morning of the performance, young dancers will have the leopard pattern painted on their backs, hands, feet, and belly in black, white, red, and yellow colors. A yue-kin, a four-stringed plucked instrument with a full-moon-shaped sound box, is painted on their chests. Their faces are covered with palm leaves, and their heads are decorated with two pheasant tails. When the make-up is finished, dancers enter the role of leopards, prohibiting further talking.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Village rooftops connected by ladders or wood panels form the stage for the "leopards." At the climax of the dance, leopards run after young girls watching the show until the girls take them home, where snacks have been prepared. Leopards eat some snacks as well as throwing some away, while continuing to dance. This devil-dispelling activity is performed in the rooms, kitchens and stalls of one family after another; the leopards dispel devils for all the villagers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

In the film ''[[Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles]]'' directed by [[Zhang Yimou]], Yunnan Nuo is prominently depicted and featured.

==Masks==
[[Image:Nuo opera masks.jpg|thumb|right|Masks used when performing Nuo opera]]
The most distinctive feature of Nuo opera is that the performers wear masks. Different roles require different masks to reveal the characters, through their changing facial features and decorations. The masks are highly aesthetic. The art, selected materials, colors and applications of Nuo opera masks vary among the regions, ethnic groups, culture and aesthetic interests. That distinctiveness adds the masks' beauty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The masks are mainly made of poplar and willow since poplar is light and less prone to cracks, while willow is widely regarded as having the power to ward off evil.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;[http://www1.chinaculture.org/library/2008-01/17/content_56863_2.htm Nuo Culture - Legacy of Chinese Ancient Drama&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nuo opera involves many acrobatic performances, such as getting into a hot pot, holding burned stones, crossing a fiery pit, swallowing and blowing fire, and stepping on a mountain of swords. As most of the performers are specially trained, they are good at giving exciting performances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Zhang, Tianlin 张天林: ''Nuoxi: mysterious Chinese Opera and Its Masks (神秘的傩文化——傩戏与傩面具)''. '''Page 50, Women in China (01/2007)'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of masks used in one drama ranges from several dozen to two hundred. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} There are five kinds of masks used in Nuo Drama, namely: civilian general, military general, old general, young general and woman general with other minor roles such as soldiers and Taoist monks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Each nuo mask has a fixed name, represents a certain role and has legendary stories to tell of its origins. In [[Guizhou]], a province with the largest nuo drama repertoire, at least 24 masks are required to perform an entire nuo drama piece. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The masks can appear valiant and martial, stern and tough, or gentle and kind, and they come in various styles to represent different figures. For instance, since the responsibility of valiant gods is to emit awe and dispel ghosts and devils, their masks usually have horns and buckteeth, with a very ferocious countenance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

The masks are endowed with mysterious religious and cultural meanings, both in Nuoji and Nuo opera performances. People in Nuo culture circles, who regard the masks as symbols and carriers of gods, observe various rules and conventions. For instance, the ceremony of enshrining a Buddha statue is held before making the masks; before using them, the ceremony of opening the case; and storing them, the ceremony of sealing the case. According to the rules, women are not allowed to touch or wear the masks, and only men can produce, use and store masks. Once a man wears a mask, he is supposed to be possessed by a god or spirit. And therefore, he must not speak.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

Studies also show that the face painting of [[Beijing opera]] and face changing of [[Sichuan opera]] were influenced by Nuo opera masks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

'''Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya''' ({{lang-ru|Ольга Борисовна Лепешинская}}) born as '''Protopopova''' ({{lang-ru|Протопопова}}) (August 18, 1871 – October 2, 1963), was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] biologist, a personal protegée of [[Vladimir Lenin]], later [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Trofim Lysenko]] and [[Alexander Oparin]]. She rejected [[genetics]] and was an advocate of [[spontaneous generation]] of life from inanimate matter.

==Biography==
Lepeshinskaya completed her study as a [[feldsher]] in St. Petersburg in 1887 and practised at various places in Siberia. She joined a Marxist group in St Petersburg in 1894, and married a fellow Marxist, Panteleimon Nikolaievich Lepeshinsky (1868-1944), a priest's son who was expelled from St Petersburg University in 1895 for his political activities. They were both arrested and exiled in 1897, for three years, to Yermakovsk, in Siberia, 20 miles from  Minussinsk, where Lenin was in exile. Both became loyal supporters of Lenin, and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) when it was founded, in 1898, and after Lenin had launched the newspaper ''Iskra'', they acted as its agents in [[Pskov]], in north west Russia, until 1903, when they emigrated to Geneva and opened a cafe, which was the main meeting point for the [[Bolsheviks]] who supported Lenin at a time when he was outnumbered among the Russian exiles by the [[Mensheviks]] and under pressure to settle the rift within the RSDLP. According to one witness who was in Geneva at the time, Lepeshinsky "worshipped Lenin rather as a sentimental schoolgirl worships her teachers", whereas she was "a very formidable and businesslike woman, who uttered with great aplomp the most simplistic opinions....Her general level of education was nothing to boast of, and at that time she showed no special interest in science, or biology." Lenin's opinion was that "Panteleimon won't got far wrong with her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valentinov|first1=Nikolai|title=Encounters with Lenin|date=1968|publisher=Oxford U.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple returned to Russia to take part in the 1905 revolution, but after its failure, they gave up political activity and took up teaching. In 1915, she completed her medical training in Moscow.&lt;ref name=grant&gt;{{cite book |author=Grant J |title=Corrupted Science. Fraud, ideology and politics in science. |publisher=ff&amp;f, 2007 |isbn= 978-1-904332-73-2 |page=277ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lepeshinskaya was a participant in the [[October Revolution]]. She lectured at the University of Medicine in Moscow until 1926, briefly interrupted by a 1919 stay at the [[National University of Uzbekistan|Tashkent University]], then worked at the [[Kliment Timiryazev Institute of Biology]]. In 1941 she became the head of the Department of Live Matter at the Institute of Experimental Biology, [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]] for the remainder of her career.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

Lepeshinskaya worked well into her eighties and died in Moscow at the age of 92 from pneumonia.

==Claims==
In the 1920s Lepeshinskaya discredited the work of her supervisor, [[Alexander Gurvitch]], who investigated [[biophoton]]s and mitogenic rays. She claimed that low doses of [[ultraviolet light]] were released by dying cells that had been treated with high doses of UV light. Later she claimed that cells could propagate by disintegration into granules which could generate new forms of cells, different from the parental cells. Also, crystals of inorganic matter could be converted into cells by adding nucleic acids. Further, she espoused [[spontaneous generation]] and the presence of a "vital substance".&lt;ref name=rapoport/&gt; These claims were propagated as official dogma in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; A claim that soda baths fostered [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] led to a temporary shortage of [[baking soda]].&lt;ref name=rapoport/&gt; She based her career on claims to observe ''de novo'' emergence of living cells from non-cellular materials, supporting such claims by fabricated proofs which were "confirmed" by others eager to advance in the politicized scientific system. Actually, she filmed the death and subsequent decomposition of cells, then projected these films reversed. 

In May 22–24, 1950 at the special symposium "Live Matter and Cell Development" for the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] and the USSR Academy of  Medical Sciences that was supported by Stalin and chaired by Alexander Oparin, Lepeshinskaya gave the keynote speech, and her "discoveries" were celebrated as revolutionary by the invited audience.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;&lt;ref name=rapoport/&gt; She was the recipient of the [[Stalin Prize]] for that year, and her ideas became mandatory instruction in biology. In 1952 a second conference took place to demonstrate "using experimental methods" that the bourgeois [[Rudolf Virchow|Virchowian]] concept of cell development (only a living cell can produce another cell) was replaced by a  "new dialectical-materialistic theory on the origin of all living cells from non-living matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Birstein VJ |title=The Perversion of Knowledge: the True Story of Soviet Science |publisher=Westview Press, 2004 |isbn=978-0-8133-4280-1 |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her impact and dogmatic dominance have parallels to those of [[Trofim Lysenko|Lysenko]], her claims were never officially renounced but just faded away.

She involved her daughter Olga and her son-in-law Vladimir Kryukov in her work; in contrast, her husband, Panteleimon Lepechinsky, thought little of it. "Don’t you listen to her. She’s totally ignorant about  science and everything she’s been saying  is a lot of  rubbish" he told a visitor.&lt;ref name=rapoport&gt;{{cite book |author= Rapoport JL|title= The doctors' plot of 1953 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=igzzfyanDSUC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=Olga+Borisovna+Lepeshinskaya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=prXw2_56z_&amp;sig=_WbISxqOyXLgylO4uLsMvV0wNtI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WyRGTPiHJ4Gdlgft-ITwBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Olga%20Borisovna%20Lepeshinskaya&amp;f=false |publisher= Harvard University Press, 1991 |isbn=0-674-21477-3 |page=254ff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organizational hologram''' is the method of [[organization theories]] described in the book ''[[The Organizational Hologram|The Organizational Hologram: The Effective Management of Organizational Change]]'' (1991), by [[Kenneth D. Mackenzie]].

It is claimed that if an organization has twelve [[holonomic process]]es working The organization would have the property of achieving and maintaining dynamic congruency and would be simultaneously efficient, adaptable, and efficiently adaptable.

[[Holonomic theory]] states that an organization has 12 [[management process]]es ([[HPs]]) that drive performance on six [[desired organizational characteristics]] ([[DOCs]]).

==Desired organizational characteristics==
*DOC-1 Clarity of Direction
*DOC-2 Clarity of Structures
*DOC-3 Clarity of Measurement
*DOC-4 Successful Goal Achievement
*DOC-5 Results Oriented Problem Solving
*DOC-6 Associates Are Assets and Resources

==Holonomic processes==
*HP-1 Establishing and Maintaining Clear Strategic Direction
*HP-2 Defining and Updating the Organizational Logic
*HP-3 Ensuring Best Decision Making
*HP-4 Adapting to Ensure Position Clarity
*HP-5 Ensuring Systematic Planning that is Workable, Involved, and Understood
*HP-6 Integrating Employee Selection, Development, and Flow with the Strategic Direction
*HP-7 Nurturing and Rewarding Opportunistic and Innovative Problem Solving
*HP-8 Ensuring Healthy Problem Solving Throughout the Organization
*HP-9 Setting Tough and Realistic Performance Standards
*HP-10 Operating Equitable and Effective Rewards Systems
*HP-11 Ensuring Compatibility of Interests
*HP-12 Encouraging and Rewarding Ethical Behavior for All Associates

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10836">'''Participation of medical professionals in American executions''' is a controversial topic, due to its moral and legal implications. The practice is proscribed by the [[American Medical Association]], as defined in its ''Code of Medical Ethics''. The [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] endorses this position, stating that [[lethal injections]] "can never conform to the science, art and
practice of [[anesthesiology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahq.org/Washington/FinalASAAmicusBrief.pdf |title=BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS |date=November 13, 2007 |accessdate=February 17, 2009 |publisher=[[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828013634/http://www.asahq.org/Washington/FinalASAAmicusBrief.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the American Board of Anesthesiologists, a member board of the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]], voted to revoke the certification of [[anesthesiologist]]s who participate in executing a prisoner by [[lethal injection]]. Board secretary Mark A. Rockoff defended the organization's policy, stating that participation in executions "puts anesthesiologists in an untenable position," and that physicians "can assuredly provide effective anesthesia, but doing so in order to cause a patient's death is a violation of their fundamental duty as physicians to do no harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group to censure physicians who play role in lethal injections |author=Stein, Rob |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/01/AR2010050103190.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 2, 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In at least one case, the planned execution of [[Michael Morales]], the [[execution warrant]] was [[Stay of execution|stayed]] indefinitely due to the objection of the contacted physicians to participate.

The topic was the subject of a 1992 review by the [[American Medical Association]], entitled ''Physician Participation in Capital Punishment''.&lt;ref name="AMA-1992-report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/369/ceja_6a95.pdf|title=Physician Participation in Capital Punishment: Evaluations of Prisoner Competence to be Executed: Treatment to Restore Competence to be Executed|date=June 22, 1995|accessdate=October 19, 2008|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Given the ethical conflicts involved, no physician, even if employed by the state, should be compelled to participate in the process of establishing a prisoner's competence to be executed if such activity is contrary to the physician's personal beliefs. Similarly, physicians who would prefer not to be involved with the treatment of an incompetent, condemned prisoner should be excused or permitted to transfer care of the prisoner to another physician.|||[[American Medical Association]]|&lt;ref name="AMA-1992-report"/&gt;}}

Goldberg, J.D.|publisher=[[University of Houston Law Center]]|date=October 5, 2006|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[List of United States Supreme Court decisions on capital punishment|cases]] discussing the [[United States Constitution|constitutionality]] of execution methods often involve testimony of medical professionals; one example of such a case being the 2008 ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'' case, which affirmed the constitutionality of the [[Lethal injection#Drugs|three-drug]] [[lethal injection]] protocol as a method of [[capital punishment]], despite claims that the single drug used for [[animal euthanasia]] is [[Lethal injection#Single drug|more humane]] than the three-drug cocktail currently used.

One particular concern to opponents of physician participation in capital punishment is the role that health care providers have played in treating or reviving patients to render them fit for execution. In a 1995 Oklahoma case, death row inmate Robert Brecheen intentionally overdosed on sleeping pills hours before his scheduled lethal injection. He was immediately hospitalized and had his stomach pumped, before being returned to prison for his execution. In a similar 1997 case in Texas, David M. Long attempted suicide by drug overdose two days before his execution date and prison authorities flew him from an intensive care unit in [[Galveston]], on a ventilator, accompanied by a full medical team, to the death chamber in Huntsville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Appel, Jacob M.|title=The Forcible Treatment of Criminal Defendants|periodical=Medicine &amp; Health, Rhode Island|date=November 2003|pages=367–369|volume=86|issue=11|pmid=14692338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botched executions==
Possibly botched executions include those of [[Stanley Williams]], [[Ángel Nieves Díaz]], and others. The only execution by lethal injection which failed to kill the condemned prisoner in United States occurred on September 15, 2009 in Ohio, when executioners attempted and then aborted the execution of [[Romell Broom]], leading to the implementation of a one-drug method. More than six decades earlier, on May 3, 1946, an unsuccessful attempt at the electrocution of [[Willie Francis]], then aged 17, led to an appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to reject a second attempt at electrocuting Francis, which failed by a 5-4 vote in ''[[Francis v. Resweber]]'', resulting in Francis' successful electrocution just over a year later, on May 9, 1947.

In many of these executions, the result of the error has been that executions have taken many times as long as they should have – in one case, the execution of [[Christopher Newton (criminal)|Christopher Newton]], an execution took up to two hours to complete, fifteen times longer than average; ideally, executions should be completed within about eight minutes. Some have claimed that such executions may have induced ''excruciating pain'', a possible violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. This has been argued in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Hill v. McDonough]]''. Errors occurring in these botched executions include the incorrect placing of [[Intravenous therapy|IV lines]], and injection of too little anaesthetic, reported in one study to have been consistent with awareness in 43% (21 executions) of the forty-nine executions in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|periodical=[[The Lancet]]|title=Inadequate anaesthesia in lethal injection for execution|volume=365|date=April 16, 2005|pages=1412–1414|issue=9468|author1=L. Koniaris |author2=T. Zimmers |author3=D. Lubarsky |author4=J. Sheldon |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1419|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Gregg v. Georgia|reinstatement of capital punishment]] in 1976, there have been, according to one study, forty-one possibly botched executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Examples of Post-Furman Botched Executions|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions|author=Radelet, Michael L.|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=[[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On, January 7, 2008, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] heard [[oral argument]]s in ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'', a case challenging the three-drug cocktail used for many executions by [[lethal injection]]. The respondent's lawyer, Roy T. Englert, Jr., referred to the Death Penalty Information Center's list of "botched" executions. He criticized it because a majority of the executions on the list, according to respondent, "did not involve the infliction of pain, but were only delayed by technical problems (''e.g.'', difficulty in finding a suitable vein)".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2007/2007_07_5439/argument/ ''Baze v. Rees'' oral arguments].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/some-examples-post-furman-botched-executions DPIC list of botched executions].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the petitioners' attorney disagreed.

==Legal implications==
Several states which practice capital punishment, such as [[List of individuals executed in Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Capital punishment in Oregon|Oregon]], have laws forbidding sanctions against medical professionals participating in executions.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] ruled 4-3 that the Medical Board cannot discipline doctors who participate in executions, stating that the statutes providing for lethal injection are superior to ethical guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mildwurf|first1=Bruce|title=Court: Physicians can take part in executions |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/5063064/|accessdate=25 July 2014|agency=WRAL|publisher=Capitol Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proscription in the Hippocratic Oath==
{{See also|Primum non nocere}}
The practice is proscribed in the [[Hippocratic Oath]], an ethical guide for the medical profession, albeit with no legal or constitutional force, which states:

{{quote|I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan.}}

He belongs to Gujjar family and also the ''[[Nawab]]'' of the Zehri tribe and chief of [[Jhalawan]].

On 7 June 2013, Zehri was appointed senior minister of Balochistan with portfolios of communication works, mines, minerals and industries. On 9 January 2018, due to the imminence of a no confidence vote against him, Zehri resigned from his post as Chief Minister to prevent the brewing of a political crisis.

==Biography==
Nawab Sanaullah Zehri was born  in Anjeera in the [[Khuzdar District]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], Pakistan, on 4 August 1961. His father, Sardar Doda Khan Zehri, was a tribal leader and an [[List of Pakistan Movement activists|activist]] in the [[Pakistan Movement]] who played a crucial role in gathering Balochistan's support for the cause of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite web|last1=et. al.

Upon graduating from Balochistan University, he ran in the 1990 [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan|Balochistan Assembly]] [[Pakistani general election, 1990|general election]], performing well on the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|PML(N)]]'s conservative platform.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; During this time, he campaigned for [[Local government in Pakistan|local government]] in Balochistan.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; In 1997, he contested and triumphed in a [[Senate of Pakistan|senate]] election, representing Balochistan until 1999. Zehri ran for the [[List of constituencies of Pakistan|PB-50 (Khuzdar-I)]] constituency on the [[National Party (Pakistan)|National Party]]'s platform during the 2002 [[Pakistani general election, 2002|general election]]. He served as the provincial minister of prisons and tribal affairs until 2003.&lt;ref name=e&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff, et. al|title=Sardar Sanaullah Khan Zehri|url=http://www.pakistanileaders.com.pk/profile/Sardar_Sanaullah_Khan_Zehri|publisher=Pakistani leaders online|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the National Party boycotted the general elections. Zehri disagreed with the move, left the party, and in February he won a seat in the Assembly under his own, newly founded National Party Parliamentarians. In September 2006, Zehri participated in a [[loya jirga]] called by the [[Khan of Kalat]], [[Mir Suleman Dawood Jan]], following the death of [[Akbar Bugti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Malik Siraj Akbar|title=The Redefined Dimensions of Baloch Nationalist Movement|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|year=2011|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

The '''Seven Great Singing Stars''' ({{zh|c=七大歌星|p=''qī dà gēxīng''}}) were the seven most renowned [[singer]]s of China in the 1940s.

==Background==
Several of the stars acted in [[film]]s, and their music played a prominent role in developing the [[Cinema of China]]. They dominated the Chinese pop music industry in the 1930s and 1940s, which was centered in Shanghai, and often performed in a genre known as [[Shidaiqu]] (時代曲).&lt;ref name="shidaiqu"/&gt; Amongst the earliest of the stars to emerge in the 1930s were [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Gong Qiuxia]], [[Yao Lee]], and [[Bai Hong]]. In the '40s, [[Bai Guang]], [[Li Xianglan]], and [[Wu Yingyin]] also became popular, and these seven were grouped as the seven great singing stars of the period.

[[Shanghai]] was occupied by the Japanese starting from 1937 to 1945. Li Xianglan, who was Japanese, came to prominence in this period although her Japanese ancestry was not revealed at that time. After the Communist victory in 1949, there began a large migration of people from Shanghai to [[Hong Kong]], and the [[Communist Party of China]] also denounced Shanghai popular music as [[Yellow Music]] (黃色歌曲), a form of [[pornography]], which effectively ended this period in Shanghai. The film and music industry had already begun to shift to Hong Kong in the '40s, and by the 1950s Hong Kong had become the center of the entertainment industry.&lt;ref name="shidaiqu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychemusic.org/shanghai-hongkong.html |title=History of Chinese Popular Music (1920–1960) |last=Roevens |first=Iris |date=December 1, 2009 |website=Psyche Music |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130913115706/http://www.psychemusic.org/shanghai-hongkong.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some of the seven continued to perform for many years, Zhou Xuan died in 1957, Li Xianglan retired from entertainment in 1958, and Bai Guang stopped recording in 1959.

The term '''''shooting bias''''', also known as "'''shooter bias'''", is a form of [[implicit bias|implicit]] racial [[bias]] which refers to the tendency among the police to shoot black civilians rather than white civilians, even when they are unarmed.

The probability of being shot by the police depends on factors such as ethnicity, location, the income of the neighborhood and whether or not the person is carrying a weapon&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as the emotions shown by the victim.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kubota|first=Jennifer T.|last2=Ito|first2=Tiffany A.|title=The role of expression and race in weapons identification|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0038214|journal=Emotion|language=en|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1115–1124|doi=10.1037/a0038214|pmc=4235656|pmid=25401289|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problems with police reporting practices ===
Police data could be biased due to police reporting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klinger|first=David A.|date=2011-12-13|title=On the Problems and Promise of Research on Lethal Police Violence|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088767911430861|journal=Homicide Studies|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=78–96|doi=10.1177/1088767911430861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Departments can voluntary include [[Justifiable homicide|justifiable homicides]] in the crime statistics of the [[Uniform Crime Reports|FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports]], which means that a lot of departments don't provide data at all. Some cities haven't reported their data in years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/nobodycounts-police-killings-in-the-u-s/article_8ec76c48-4414-5861-9183-134c75a4be10.html|title=Nobody counts police killings in the U.S.|last=Moskop|first=Christine Byers, Walker|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the official data doesn't accurately reflect the number of civilians that are shot by the police.

Newspapers like ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have started gathering a database of [[Lists of killings by law enforcement officers|fatal police shootings]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database|title=The Counted: people killed by police in the United States – interactive|last=Swaine|first=Jon|last2=Laughland|first2=Oliver|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30|last3=Lartey|first3=Jamiles|last4=Davis|first4=Kenan|last5=Harris|first5=Rich|last6=Popovich|first6=Nadja|last7=Powell|first7=Kenton|last8=team|first8=Guardian US interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/|title=Police shootings 2017 database|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing that in 2015 twice as many civilians had been fatally shot than the FBI's data suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-are-fatally-shooting-people-at-twice-the-rate-reported/article_828cd4cf-5d87-581d-b3b8-e93aefddebd5.html|title=Police are fatally shooting people at twice the rate reported by FBI, analysis finds|last=Post|first=Washington|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An FBI working group has started working on a proposal for making the reports more accurate, but they would still rely on voluntary data and therefore wouldn't fix the main reporting issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/fbi-to-sharply-expand-system-for-tracking-police-shootings/article_67fa6d49-f54c-554d-a591-b33bad32fe05.html|title=FBI to sharply expand system for tracking police shootings|last=Post|first=Kimberly Kindy Washington|work=stltoday.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative database by ''The Guardian'' ===
The database developed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' is currently the largest database on fatal shootings available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hehman|first=Eric|last2=Flake|first2=Jessica K.|last3=Calanchini|first3=Jimmy|date=2017-07-27|title=Disproportionate Use of Lethal Force in Policing Is Associated With Regional Racial Biases of Residents|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1948550617711229|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|language=en|pages=1948550617711229|doi=10.1177/1948550617711229|issn=1948-5506}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gather data through police reports, monitoring of regional news, fact-checked witness statements and other crowdsourced police fatality databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/about-the-counted|title=About The Counted: why and how the Guardian is counting US police killings|website=the Guardian|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of deaths ===
In 2016, ''The Guardian'' counted 1093 people&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; who were killed by the police in the United States. Out of these 574 were white and 266 were black. 95 of the white victims were unarmed, 42 of the black victims were unarmed.

More white than black people are shot. It is important to distinguish to differentiate between the number of deaths of an ethnic group and the likelihood of being shot by police. The likelihood of being shot as a black rather than a white person is higher, whether the victim is armed or not.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Prominent examples of unarmed black civilians being fatally shot by the police include: 

* November 22, 2014: [[Tamir Rice]] (Cleveland) was killed by police officers at the age of 12 because they mistook his toy gun, which lacked the orange safety feature marking it as a replica and not a true firearm, for a real weapon.

== Likelihood of being shot: Black vs. White ==
A study carried out at the [[University of California]] found "evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Cody T.|date=2015-11-05|title=A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011–2014|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141854|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4634878|pmid=26540108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the probability of being shot by the police as a black, unarmed person versus as a white, unarmed person was 3.49 times higher. Unarmed Hispanics' likelihood to be shot was 1.67 times higher than for unarmed Whites.

The number vary greatly depending on the county, sometimes reaching a probability of 20 to 1 or more for unarmed blacks to be shot. There are several maps that showcase the [https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/ distribution of fatal shootings across the country].

Contrary to popular belief, crime rate was not associated with likelihood of being shot in this study.

== Factors that influence decision to shoot ==

=== List of empirically researched factors ===
Empirical research suggests the following factors to influence the decision to shoot: 
* Implicit racial bias, prejudice, and stereotypes&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Status armed/unarmed&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Gender (men are more likely to be shot)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-white|title=Deadly Force, in Black and White|last=Sagara|first=Ryan Gabrielson, Ryann Grochowski Jones, Eric|date=2014-10-10|work=ProPublica|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Implicit racial bias ====
An implicit [[Bias|racial bias]] refers to unintentional judgments a person makes of a group (e.g. good/bad) of a certain ethnicity. So a person who shows implicit racial bias might not be aware of it. Police officers have been found to show a racial bias against black people in the decision to shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Joshua|last2=Park|first2=Bernadette|last3=Judd|first3=Charles M.|last4=Wittenbrink|first4=Bernd|last5=Sadler|first5=Melody S.|last6=Keesee|first6=Tracie|title=Across the thin blue line: Police officers and racial bias in the decision to shoot|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1006|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=92|issue=6|pages=1006–1023|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1006|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the studies, researchers investigated how stereotypes affected police officers' decisions to shoot. They used a video game and exposed their participants to pictures of either Whites or Non-Whites who were armed or unarmed. During this video game, the participants were asked to choose between "shoot" or "don't shoot" as quickly as possible. The results were that the participants shot armed black people faster than armed white people and chose "don't shoot" faster for unarmed white than unarmed black persons.

The authors explained those findings by the activation of stereotype thinking which lead white people to associate black people with danger. Because of this stereotype, the participants expected blacks to carry a gun and therefore were quicker to make the "shooting" decision.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Correll, J., Park, B., Judd, C. M. and Wittenbrink, B. (2007), The influence of stereotypes on decisions to shoot. Eur. J. Soc. Psychol., 37: 1102–1117. doi:10.1002/ejsp.450&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Joshua|last2=Wittenbrink|first2=Bernd|last3=Crawford|first3=Matthew T.|last4=Sadler|first4=Melody S.|title=Stereotypic vision: How stereotypes disambiguate visual stimuli|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/pspa0000015|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=108|issue=2|pages=219–233|doi=10.1037/pspa0000015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Payne|first=B.

==== Location and context ====
The American police officers live and work in a society full of prejudices against minorities. In addition, police officers usually deal with high crime rates in minority neighborhoods. These experiences reinforce their existing prejudices by ignoring that most people with a non-white ethnic background don’t become criminals. This leads to discrimination against minorities. Other factors that lead to discrimination by the police are institutionalized language barriers between police and some ethnic groups, experiences with disrespectful or hostile residents in certain minority neighborhoods and low punishment for police officers who misbehave towards minorities.

Those prejudices by the police are of course being noticed by the groups of minorities. So in return, the groups believe that the officers have prejudices against them. This might lead to the findings that Non-Whites are more likely to behave disrespectfully or to insult officers.

To sum up, there may exist a mutual influence between the prejudices that police officers have against minorities and the prejudices that minorities have against officers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Weitzer, Ronald. (1996). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222387219_Racial_discrimination_in_the_criminal_justice_system_Findings_and_problems_in_the_literature Racial discrimination in the criminal justice system: Findings and problems in the literature]. Journal of Criminal Justice. 24, (4), 309-322. doi:10.1016/0047-2352(96)00015-3&lt;/ref&gt;

=====  Examples that showcase prejudices among police officers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; =====
*Disruptive actions by the police like stopping and questioning citizens on the street are more common in minority neighborhoods
*More cases of Non-Whites are being dropped than of Whites. This is because the reasons for arresting them were too weak and unjustified in the first place.
*American police officers shoot more easily Non-Whites than Whites

== Ways to reduce shooting bias ==
Possibly the biggest change could be made by holding police officers accountable for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/06/i-was-a-st-louis-cop-my-peers-were-racist-and-violent-and-theres-only-one-fix/|title=Being a cop showed me just how racist and violent the police are. There’s only one fix.|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal investigations usually don't lead to punishments. The work culture within the police is highly racist, as many recent scandals have shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/michigan-police-suspend-behind-racist-footage-black-man-article-1.1527387|title=Michigan police suspend cop behind 'racist' footage of black man|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ohio-cops-suspended-racist-texts-leaked-nonprofit-article-1.2033713|title=Ohio cops suspended for exchanging racist text messages|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bet.com/news/national/2013/02/14/two-black-cops-write-statements-about-racism-in-lapd.html|title=Two Black Cops Write Statements About Racism in LAPD|work=BET.com|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing the factors that influence police officers decisions to shoot there are a few possible solutions for reducing shooting bias. The main factor is implicit racial bias, which in turn is exuberated by certain factors that could be addressed.

Diversity in police departments might not reduce shooting bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Brad W.|date=2003-05-01|title=The Impact of Police Officer Diversity on Police-Caused Homicides|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-0072.t01-1-00009/abstract|journal=Policy Studies Journal|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=147–162|doi=10.1111/1541-0072.t01-1-00009|issn=1541-0072}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reducing fatigue might lower the impact of racial bias on the decision to shoot.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Changing the training of police officers so as to not showcase black armed targets more often than white ones could help reduce racial bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sim|first=Jessica J.|last2=Correll|first2=Joshua|last3=Sadler|first3=Melody S.|date=2013-03-01|title=Understanding Police and Expert Performance: When Training Attenuates (vs. Exacerbates) Stereotypic Bias in the Decision to Shoot|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167212473157|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=291–304|doi=10.1177/0146167212473157|pmid=23401478|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plant|first=E.

Training police officers in making decisions under stress as well as assigning officers to certain locations so they can become familiar with its residents could reduce the numbers of civilians killed, says Richmond's police chief, Chris Magnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6111457/example-good-police-relations-cops-killing-outreach-culture-training|title=How to not shoot civilians: 9 community policing tips from a chief who got it right|last=Lind|first=Dara|date=2014-09-18|website=Vox|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial bias can be contagious within a social group or neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weisbuch|first=Max|last2=Pauker|first2=Kristin|date=2011-12-01|title=The Nonverbal Transmission of Intergroup Bias: A Model of Bias Contagion with Implications for Social Policy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-2409.2011.01032.x/abstract|journal=Social Issues and Policy Review|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=257–291|doi=10.1111/j.1751-2409.2011.01032.x|issn=1751-2409|pmc=3756600|pmid=23997812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weisbuch|first=Max|last2=Pauker|first2=Kristin|last3=Ambady|first3=Nalini|date=2009-12-18|title=The Subtle Transmission of Race Bias via Televised Nonverbal Behavior|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5960/1711|journal=Science|language=en|volume=326|issue=5960|pages=1711–1714|doi=10.1126/science.1178358|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3764987|pmid=20019288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training police officers to be aware of this might help in reducing this effect.

'''Thmon''' is a [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] language of northeastern Cambodia.

Kraol, Thmon, [[Khaonh language|Khaonh]], and [[Mel language|Mel]] all have about 70% lexical similarity with [[Stieng language|Stieng]], a Southern Bahnaric language (Barr &amp; Pawley 2013:32).

The Thmon live in Memom village, [[Kaoh Nheaek District]], [[Mondulkiri Province]]. They had moved to Memom village from Benam village, Kotol commune, [[Sambour District]], [[Kratie Province]] in 1973 due to war (Barr &amp; Pawley 2013:28).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4321">'''Trial by media''' is a phrase popular in the late 20th century and early 21st century to describe the impact of [[television]] and [[newspaper]] coverage on a person's reputation by creating a widespread perception of guilt or innocence before, or after, a verdict in a court of law. Its first inception was the phrase ''Trial by Television'' which found light in the response to the 3 February, 1967 television broadcast of [[The Frost Programme]], host [[David Frost]]. The confrontation and Frost's [[Emil_Savundra#Frost_Programme_controversy|personal adversarial line of questioning]] of insurance fraudster [[Emil Savundra]] led to concern from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] executives that it might affect Savundra's right to a fair trial.

==Description==
During high-publicity court cases, the media are often accused of provoking an atmosphere of public hysteria akin to a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] which not only makes a fair trial nearly impossible but means that regardless of the result of the trial the accused will not be able to live the rest of their life without intense public scrutiny.

The counter-argument is that the [[mob mentality]] exists independently of the media which merely voices the opinions which the public already has.

Although a recently coined phrase, the idea that [[mass media|popular media]] can have a strong influence on the legal process goes back certainly to the advent of the printing press and probably much further.{{OR|date=February 2013}} This is not including the use of a state controlled press to criminalize political opponents, but in its commonly understood meaning covers all occasions where the reputation of a person has been drastically affected by ostensibly non-political publications.

Often the coverage in the press can be said to reflect the views of the person in the street. However, more credibility is generally given to printed material than 'water cooler gossip'. The responsibility of the press to confirm reports and leaks about individuals being tried has come under increasing scrutiny and journalists are calling for higher standards. There was much debate over U.S President [[Bill Clinton]]'s impeachment trial and prosecutor [[Kenneth Starr]]'s investigation and how the media handled the trial by reporting commentary from lawyers which influenced public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal News: News Hour with Jim Lehrer|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/spc/bb/media/july-dec98/lawyers_10-19a.html|publisher=Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=12 March 2011|format=Transcript|date=19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, strict [[Contempt of court#England|contempt of court]] regulations restrict the media's reporting of legal proceedings after a person is formally arrested.  These rules are designed so that a defendant receives a fair trial in front of a jury that has not been tainted by prior media coverage.  The newspapers the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' have been prosecuted under these regulations, although such prosecutions are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|title=Contempt of court rules are designed to avoid trial by media|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jul/05/contempt-court-rules-trial-media|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Girls playing video games in Japan.jpg|thumb|Women playing ''[[The House of the Dead III]]'' in an [[amusement arcade]] in [[Video gaming in Japan|Japan]], 2005.]]

The relationship between '''women and video games''' has received extensive academic, corporate, and social attention. Since the 1990s,&lt;ref name=polygonNoGirls /&gt; female [[gamer]]s have commonly been regarded as a minority, but industry surveys have shown that in time the gender ratio has become closer to equal, and since the 2010s, women have been found to make up about half of all gamers. [[Sexism in video gaming]], including [[sexual harassment]] and the [[Gender representation in video games|underrepresentation of women as characters in games]], is an increasing topic of discussion in [[video game culture]].

Advocates for increasing the number of female gamers stress the problems attending disenfranchisement of women from one of the fastest-growing cultural realms as well as the largely untapped nature of the female gamer market. Efforts to include greater female participation in the medium have addressed the problems of gendered advertising, social stereotyping, and the lack of female video game creators (coders, [[Video game developer|developers]], producers, etc.). The term "'''girl gamer'''" has been used as a [[Reappropriation|reappropriated term]] for female players to describe themselves, but it has also been criticized as counterproductive or offensive.

== Demographics of female players ==
{{See also|Video game#Demographics}}
Female participation in gaming is increasing. According to a [[Entertainment Software Association]] survey, women players in the United States increased from 40% in 2010 to 48% in 2014.&lt;ref name="wsjWomenHalf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gaming-no-longer-a-mans-world-1408464249|title=Women Now Make Up Almost Half of Gamers|first1=Sven|last1=Grundberg|first2=Jens|last2=Hansegard|date=20 August 2014|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/22/adult-women-gamers-outnumber-teenage-boys/|title=Study: More women than teenage boys are gamers|date=August 22, 2014|first=Gail |last=Sullivan|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, despite the dominant perception that most gamers are men,&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015" /&gt; the ratio of female to male gamers is balanced, mirroring [[Human sex ratio|the population at large]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/adult-women-largest-gaming-demographic/?fb=ss&amp;prtnr=nerdist|title=Adult women are now the largest demographic in gaming|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=2014|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=Nicholas White|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] study found that among teens, 65% of men and 35% of women describe themselves as daily gamers. This trend was found to be stronger the younger the age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Lenhart | first=Amanda | last2=Kahna | first2=Joseph | last3=Middaugh | first3=Ellen | last4=Macgill | first4=Alexandra Rankin | last5=Evans | first5=Chris | last6=Vitak | first6=Jessica | date=16 September 2008 | title=Teens, Video Games, and Civics | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | publication-place=Washington D.C. | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2008/PIP_Teens_Games_and_Civics_Report_FINAL.pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that while adult men are significantly more likely to play [[Console game|console games]] than adult women, on other platforms they are equally likely to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Lenhart | first=Amanda | last2=Jones | first2=Sydney | last3=Macgill | first3=Alexandra Rankin | date=7 December 2008 | title=Pew Internet Project Data Memo | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2008/PIP_Adult_gaming_memo.pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even in this area, the numbers are moving towards equality: in 2013, [[Nintendo]] reported that half of its users were women,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.geekwire.com/2013/dudes-38-xbox-users-female-51-kids/ |title= Not just dudes: 38% of Xbox users female, 51% have kids |publisher= Geek Wire |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 another Pew study found that more American women (42%) than men (37%) owned video game consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=New survey findings show more women own game consoles than men|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/4/9669110/pew-research-center-female-gamers-statistics|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=Polygon|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that female participation increased with age (61% of women and 57% of men aged 45 to 64 played games).&lt;ref name=variety2013&gt;{{citation |url= https://variety.com/2013/digital/features/womengamers1200683299-1200683299/ |title= Videogame Biz: Women Still Very Much in the Minority |publisher= Variety |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-10-20 |author= Marc Graser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-2015 survey reported by UKIE indicates that 42% of UK gamers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ukie.org.uk/sites/default/files/cms/UK%20Games%20Industry%20Fact%20Sheet%2026%20January%202016.pdf |title= UK Video Games Fact Sheet |publisher= The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment |date= 26 August 2016 |accessdate= 8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data collection ===
In North America, national demographic surveys have been conducted yearly by the U.S. [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA){{efn|The ESA was known as the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) prior to 16 July 2003.}} since at least 1997, and the Canadian [[Entertainment Software Association of Canada]] (ESAC) since 2006. Other organizations including the Australian/New-Zealander [[Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association]] (IGEA) since 2005 collect and publish demographic data on their constituent populations on a semi-regular basis. In Europe, the regional [[Interactive Software Federation of Europe]] (ISFE) and numerous smaller national groups like the [[Belgian Entertainment Association]] (BEA), the [[Nederlandse Vereniging van Producenten en Importeurs van beeld- en geluidsdragers]] (NVPI), and the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) have also begun to collect data on female video gamers since 2012. One-off market research studies and culture surveys have been produced by a wide variety of other sources including some segments of [[video game journalism|the gaming press]] and other culture writers since the 1980s as well.

Not only has the general female gaming population been tracked, but the spread of this population has been tracked over many facets of gaming. For more than 10 years, groups like the ESA and ESAC have gathered data on the gender of video game purchasers, the percentage of women gamers within certain age brackets, and the average number of years women gamers have been gaming. The ESAC in particular has gone into great depth reporting age-related segmentation of the market between both male and female gamers. Other statistics have been collected from time to time on a wide variety of facets influencing the video game market.

=== Historical prevalence ===
*The author of ''[[Pac-Man]]'', [[Toru Iwatani]], attempted to appeal to a wider audience—beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021|title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man|first=Chris|last=Morris|date=March 3, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic Games'' reported in 1982 that it was "the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worley|first=Joyce|title=Women Join the Arcade Revolution|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=May 1982|volume=1|issue=3|pages=30–33 [33]|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-05/Electronic_Games_Issue_03_Vol_01_03_1982_May#page/n31/mode/2up|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the nine arcade games that ''How to Win Video Games'' (1982) discussed, ''Pac-Man'' was the only one with women as a majority of players.&lt;ref name="howtowin"&gt;{{Cite book |title=How to Win Video Games |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1982 |isbn=0-671-45841-8 |pages=82-90 | url=https://archive.org/stream/book_how_to_win_video_games#page/n81/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the sequel [[Ms. Pac-Man]], launched in 1981, featured a female protagonist.
*In May 1982, sociologist Sidney J. Kaplan reported the composition of [[arcade video game]] players to be roughly 80% male and 20% female.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Sidney J. "The Image of Amusement Arcades and Differences in Male and Female Video Game Playing". ''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]''. Vol.17. Pp.93–98. June 1983. {{ISSN|0022-3840}} (Presented as "Amusement Arcades: Video Games and Differences in Male and Female Participation" before the [[North Central Sociological Association]]. Detroit Michigan. May 1982 annual meeting.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''How to Win Video Games'' estimated that men were 95% of ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'' and 90% of ''[[Omega Race]]'' players, while women were half the players of ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and three other games.{{r|howtowin}}
*In 1983, researcher John W. Trinkaus published findings that there were 8 male players to every 3 female players in video game arcades.&lt;ref&gt;Trinkaus, John. W. "Arcade Video Games: An Informal Look", ''[[Psychological Reports]]''. Vol.52, No.2. Pg.586. 1983. {{ISSN|0033-2941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin. "Jeu Sur Micro-Ordinateur et Différences Liées au Sexe". ''[[Revue des Sciences de l'Education]]''. Vol.XII, No.2. Pp.173-196. 1986. {{ISSN|0318-479X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1983, a [[Coleco]] executive stated at the [[Boston Computer Society]] that the target audience for the new [[Coleco Adam|Adam]] home computer, based on its [[ColecoVision]] console, was "boys age 8 to 16 and their fathers. We believe those are the two groups that really fuel computer purchases". When audience members booed, he added that the marketing strategy was based on consumer research.&lt;ref name="coleco19830928"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_I9TGYM-w |title=Coleco Presents The Adam Computer System |date=2016-05-03 |publisher=YouTube |orig-year=1983-09-28 |time=44:30 |quote=We're doing that with five new television commercials, which have just been completed, and which will be shown in conjunction with the Adam launch date.

We believe those are the two groups that really fuel computer purchases, [boos] and we've directed right at 'em [more boos] - oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Women, we've a commercial for you, trust me, but the key point is that our research, which is consumer research, directed that thought [inaudible] from the research, and we've directed our commercials at that target user group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, Epyx CEO [[David Shannon Morse]] stated that ''[[California Games]]'' was the first game from his company to appeal equally to boys and girls during [[playtesting]].&lt;ref name="compute198809"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_100_1988_Sep#page/n11/mode/2up | title=Epyx Grows with David Morse | work=Compute! | date=September 1988 | accessdate=November 10, 2013 |author1=Ferrell, Keith |author2=Keizer, Gregg | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, ''[[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]]'' reported that among primary video game users, women represented 21% of all gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Main |first = Peter |title= Column: How high is up for video games? (forecast for 1989) |publisher= [[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]] |date = 1 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, a study by [[Nintendo]] reported that 27% of [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] players in the United States were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/06Kahle001551#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Video Game: Past, Present and Future. An Industry Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1993 self-reported survey by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found that 7% of its readers were female.&lt;ref name="cgw199304"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=What You've Been Playing Lately | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1993-04-01 | accessdate=7 July 2014 | page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1994, a survey by ''[[Electronic Games]]'' reported that, among American women gamers, the [[Sega Genesis]] was most popular, with 75% ownership, followed by the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] with 58.3% ownership, the [[Game Boy]] with 58%, and [[MS-DOS]] with 50%.&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Games'', issue 23 (August 1994), pages 36-42&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1997, Mattel, Inc. released [[Barbie Fashion Designer]], selling over 600,000 copies. The game was considered an important step in advancing an interest in the design of games for women.&lt;ref name="Dickey2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickey|first1=Michele D.|title=Girl gamers: the controversy of girl games and the relevance of female-oriented game design for instructional design|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=37|issue=5|year=2006|pages=785–793|issn=00071013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' stated that the video game market for young girls was "exploding" with titles such as ''[[The American Girls Premiere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8460578.html|title=VIRTUAL EQUALITY?

=== Self-identification as gamers ===
While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as [[gamer]]s, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be [[Gamer#Dedication spectrum|core or hardcore gamers]].&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=SuperData Research - Games data and market research  » Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a [[EEDAR]] survey found that nearly 60 percent of female gamers played on mobile devices and that 63 percent of these female mobile gamers played online multiplayer mobile games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/10/03/nearly-60-of-mobile-gamers-are-women-says-analyst/ | title= Nearly 60% of mobile gamers are women, says analyst|publisher=Vg247.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun 'Gamer' Label}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Girl gamers" or "gamer girls" is a label for women who regularly play games. While some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[Reappropriation|reappropriated term]],&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; others have described the term as unhelpful,&lt;ref name=ng /&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; offensive, and even harmful or misleading. The word "girl", for example, has been seen as an inherently age-linked term that glosses over the difference between women over 30 and younger women.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; The term "girl gamer" rather than simply "gamer" has also been described as perpetuating the minority position of female gamers.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; For many critics uncomfortable with the term "girl gamer", its over-embracement may lead to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; of female gamers as [[Sexual objectification|oversexualized]], casual, and sometimes defiant or confrontational.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Tyler. ''[http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-girl-gamer-stereotypes The Top 7... Girl gamer stereotypes]''. [[GamesRadar]]. 18 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trinder, Aja. ''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/technology/the-box/646926/Not-a-Girl-Gamer-just-a-gamer Not a Girl Gamer just a gamer]''. [[Stuff.co.nz]]. 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn can result in poor game design.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; These critics submit that there is no single definition of a female gamer, and that women gamers are as diverse as any other group of people.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt;

There are considerable differences between the [[video game genre]]s preferred, on average, by women and men. According to a 2017 report by the video game analytics company Quantic Foundry, based on surveys of about 270,000 gamers, the following proportions of gamers within a genre are women or men, respectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=Beyond 50/50: Breaking Down The Percentage of Female Gamers By Genre|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2017/01/19/female-gamers-by-genre/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While male audiences prefer fast-paced explosive action and combat,&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; women tend to prefer in-game communication&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; and interpersonal relationships (character development and plot dynamics).&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; Women have also been shown to prefer [[role-playing video game]]s to first-person shooters,&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; and [[Thomas W. Malone]] of Stanford University found that girls preferred to play a [[Hangman (game)|Hangman]] video game over a darts simulation that boys enjoyed.&lt;ref name="malone198112"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n259/mode/2up | title=What Makes Computer Games Fun? | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=12 August 2015 | author=Malone, Thomas W. | pages=258–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-game activities may also differ between the sexes in games with less linear plots such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. Women are often characterized as preferring story-driven games or constructive games like ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'', but this is not universally true.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that thirty percent of women were playing more violent games. Of this 30%, 20% played [[Call of Duty]] and 15% played [[Grand Theft Auto]].&lt;ref name=variety2013/&gt; There has been persistent female interest in [[action-adventure game]]s and [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]] like ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; Compared to men, female MMORPG players tend to place more emphasis on socialization relative to achievement-oriented play. This emphasis on socialization extends beyond just the game itself: In a study published in the ''Journal of Communication'' in 2009, researchers found that 61% of female MMORPG players played with a romantic partner, compared to 24% of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Dmitri|last1=Williams|first2=Mia|last2=Consalvo|first3=Scott|last3=Caplan|first4=Nick|last4=Yee|title=Looking for Gender: Roles and Behaviors Among Online Gamers|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2009|volume=59|issue=4|pages=700–725|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01453.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data collected by Quantic Foundry in 2016, the primary motivations why people play video games differ, on average, by gender. While men frequently want most to compete with others and destroy things, women often want most to complete challenges and immerse themselves in other worlds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=7 Things We Learned About Primary Gaming Motivations From Over 250,000 Gamers|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2016/12/15/primary-motivations/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While video games and advertising were initially gender-neutral, advertising began to narrow its focus to young boys as a [[target market]] following the [[video game crash of 1983]].&lt;ref name="polygonNoGirls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed|last=Lien|first=Tracey|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|title=No Girls Allowed|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overlandBrendan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://overland.org.au/previous-issues/issue-218/feature-brendan-keogh/|title=Hackers, gamers and cyborgs|publisher=overland.org.au|date= Autumn 2015|first= Brendan|last=Keogh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial hits such as ''[[Myst]]'' and ''The Sims'' appealed to women, these were nonetheless seen by some as being outside the gaming mainstream. Critic [[Ian Bogost]] opined, "We're looking at where there isn't diversity and we're saying those games are the most valid games."&lt;ref name="polygonNoGirls" /&gt; Industry studies on the lack of women in gaming have also suffered at times from biases of interpretation. Kevin Kelly of [[Joystiq]] has suggested that a high degree of [[circular reasoning]] is evident when male developers use focus groups and research numbers to determine what kinds of games girls play. After making a bad game that targets those areas suggested by the marketing research, the game's lack of popularity among both genders is often attributed to the incorrect prejudice that "girls don't play games" rather than the true underlying problems such as poor quality and playability of the game. Whereas market data and research are important to reveal that markets exist, argues Kelly, they shouldn't be the guiding factor in how to make a game that appeals to girls.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; The argument has also been advanced that emphasis on market research is often skewed by the participants in the study. In studies on male gamers of the baby boomer generation, for example, players displayed a marked aversion to violence. The incorrect conclusion that could be drawn from this result—that men dislike violent games—may also be comparable to incorrect conclusions drawn from some female-oriented gaming studies.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; It has been suggested that developers can learn what girls want in a game by observing similarities in how different girl teams will react to and modify a game if given the opportunity.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt;

[[File:Casio-Loopy-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The [[Casio Loopy]], created by [[Casio]] and released in October 1995 in Japan, was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to female gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Leah B.|title=Man Sets Guinness World Record for Largest Game Collection|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/24/man-sets-guinness-world-record-for-largest-game-collection|publisher=[[IGN.com]]|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the past, "[[girl games]]" have frequently been created by adapting girl-oriented material in other media like ''[[The Baby-sitters Club]]'', ''[[Barbie]]'', and ''[[Nancy Drew]]''&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; while leaving male-targeted genres such as sport and driving sims, role playing games, and first person shooters to the boys.&lt;ref name=yap /&gt; This has begun to change, however, with the expansion of entrepreneurial feminism and the concept of "games by girls for girls" that has been embraced by companies such as [[Her Interactive]], [[Silicon Sisters]] and [[Purple Moon]]—all video gaming start ups that are female owned and largely female staffed. Creating games designed with regard to sociological, psychological, and cognitive research into girls' cultural interests, such companies hope to awaken a female-only market emphasizing fundamental differences between what girls want and what boys want in gaming.&lt;ref name=nzegwu /&gt; The movement to expand the existing market to include women through the development of gender-neutral games has also had a number of advocates. Critics have proposed that female gamers, especially older female gamers&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; prefer gender-neutral games such as ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', or the ''[[King's Quest]]'' games to "girl games".&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;&lt;ref name=yap /&gt;

In examining game play habits at [[Internet café]]s, South Korea has seen a rise in female gamers publicly playing games such as ''[[Lineage (video game)|Lineage]]'', while in other Asian countries this kind of public female gaming has remained rare; similarly, games such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'' are seen as a gender neutral in Japan, but have been regarded as girls' games in the West.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; In other cases, female trends in one country may be indicators of associated changes in others, as in the case of a rising number of female ''Lineage'' players in Korea having led to increased number of female ''Lineage'' players in Taiwan. In Japan the rise of [[Kawaii|cute culture]] and its associated marketing has made gaming accessible for girls, and this trend has also carried over to Taiwan and recently China (both countries previously having focused mostly on [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] and where parents usually place harsher restrictions on daughters than on sons).&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt;

== Skill levels ==
An aspect of game design that has been identified as negatively impacting female interest is the degree of expertise with gaming conventions and familiarity with [[Game controller|game controls]] required to play the game.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; In-game tutorials have been found to bring both sexes into games faster,&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; and new controllers such as Nintendo's [[Wii Remote]], Microsoft's [[Kinect]], and the [[Game controller#Variants|various rhythm game controllers]] have affected demographics by making games easier to pick up and by providing a level playing-field.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; This trend has continued through the efforts of [[Nintendo]] in its release of the [[Wii]].&lt;ref name=watts&gt;Watts, Steve. ''[http://www.1up.com/news/report-suggests-female-gaming-rise Report Suggests Female Gaming on the Rise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055758/http://www.1up.com/news/report-suggests-female-gaming-rise |date=2013-10-23 }}''.

In a 2016 study published in the ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,'' researchers found that, after controlling for confounds such as the amount of play time and guild membership, women players advance at least as fast as men do in two MMOs, [[EverQuest II]] and [[cmn:剑侠情缘网络版III|Chevaliers' Romance III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Cuihua|last2=Ratan|first2=Rabindra|last3=Cai|first3=Y.

=== Male behavior towards female gamers ===
{{Main|Sexism in video gaming}}
A 2015 study found that lower-skilled male players of ''[[Halo 3]]'' were more hostile towards teammates with a female voice, but behaved more submissively to players with a male voice. Higher-skilled male players, on the other hand, behaved more positively towards female players. The authors argued the male hostility towards female gamers in terms of [[evolutionary psychology]], writing, "female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|pmid=26176699|title=Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=7|pages=e0131613|year=2015|last1=Kasumovic|first1=Michael M.|last2=Kuznekoff|first2=Jeffrey H.|pmc=4503401|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1031613K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top female players in [[Esports|competitive gaming]] mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, including such games as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'', and ''[[StarCraft II]]''. Canadian ''StarCraft II'' player [[Sasha Hostyn]] (Scarlett) first gained notoriety in the open qualifiers of IGN ProLeague 4, where she defeated top-tier Korean players. She is well known for being one of the few non-Korean players who can play at the same skill level as male Korean players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/sasha-scarlett-hostyn-starcraft-esports/|title=Meet Scarlett, the 20-year-old woman who's blazing trails in 'StarCraft'|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=dailydot.com|date=21 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029105206/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/sasha-scarlett-hostyn-starcraft-esports/|archivedate=29 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Street Fighter x Tekken]]'' player ArisBakhtanians commented on the lack of female players in the community, saying "[[sexual harassment]] is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/is-pervasive-sexism-holding-the-professional-fighting-game-community-back/|title=Is pervasive sexism holding the professional fighting game community back?|publisher=ARS Technica|author=Kyle Orland|date=29 Feb 2012|accessdate=27 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/women-are-gamers-but-largely-absent-from-e-sports/|title=Women are gamers, but largely absent from "e-sports"|publisher=ARS Technica|author=Casey Johnston|date=18 Feb 2014|accessdate=27 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, organizers for a ''[[Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft|Hearthstone]]'' tournament in Finland were criticized for limiting registrations to male players only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft-tournament-ban-female-finland|title=Hearthstone gaming tournament bans women players – ignites 'sexism' row|publisher=theguardian.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the tournament being an offline qualifier for the IeSF World Championship, with its ''Hearthstone'' tournament only open to male players. The winner of the Finnish qualifier would risk not being eligible to participate in the main event if that player were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/02/hearthstone-tournament/|title=Hearthstone tournament explains why women aren't allowed to play [updated]|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IeSF organization ultimately removed the male-only restriction from all of their tournaments, and in turn the Finnish qualifier that originally sparked the controversy also removed this restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/03/iesf-removes-male-only-restriction-from-its-e-sports-tournaments/|title=IeSF removes male-only restriction from its e-sports tournaments|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', women constituted only 3% of the gaming industry.&lt;ref name=variety2013 /&gt; In 2013, Gary Carr (the creative director of [[Lionhead Studios]]) predicted that within the next 5 to 10 years, the games development workforce would be 50% female.&lt;ref name=variety2013 /&gt; According to [[Gamasutra]]'s Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 cents for every dollar men made.

=== Support groups for women in the video game industry ===

==== WIGSIG (Women In Games Special Interest Group) ====
WIGSIG is a special interest group of IDGA (International Game Developers Association). The group was formed in order to foster a positive impact on the game industry regarding gender balance in the workplace and/or marketplace. It provides a community, resources, and opportunities for people in the gaming industry. It also works to assess the numbers of the women in the games industry and tracks the changes of these numbers over time. Additionally, it works to recruit women into the games industry and make the field more attractive to women while providing them with the support and connections they need to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.igda.org/about/ |title=About &amp;#124; WIGSIG |publisher=Women.igda.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in Games International ====
Founded in 2005, Women in Games International (WIGI), made up of both female and male professionals, works to promote the inclusion and advancement of women in the global games industry.
WIGI promotes diversity in video game development, publishing, media, education and workplaces, based on a fundamental belief that increased equality and camaraderie among genders can make global impacts for superior products, more consumer enjoyment and a stronger gaming industry.
Women In Games International stands as strong advocates for issues crucial to the success of women and men in the games industry, including a better work/life balance, healthy working conditions, increased opportunities for success and resources for career support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwigi.com/ |title=missionstatement |publisher=getwigi.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwigi.com|title=WIGI Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== WIGJ (Women In Games Jobs) ====
WIGJ is a group that works to recruit, preserve, and provide support for the advancement of women in the games industry by positively and energetically endorsing female role models and providing encouragement and information to women interested in working in the gaming field.  The group was incorporated under the UK's [[Companies Act 2006]] on June 2, 2011 as a "not for profit" or Community Interest Company. Companies in the game development industry have, in recent years, been seeking to balance the gender ratios on development teams and consoles like the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]] have seen increased numbers of female players.  In addition to using this growing interest in women in the game developing industry, WIGJ works to put more women in traditional game development with less stigma attached to them.  WIGJ seeks to help women find their place within the growing and rewarding field of game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeningamesjobs.com |title=(WIGJ) for more women in gaming |publisher=Womeningamesjobs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in video game streaming ==

The relationship between women and [[video game live streaming]] has been a rocky one. As streaming services such as YouTube and Twitch became increasingly popular, female gamers began to jump on board. Many notable streamers arose from this streaming revolution including Hafu, Glitterlanced, and Sovitia.

Geneviève Forget, a video game streamer, states in a Kotaku interview that "Harassment does happen in my stream chat from time to time that people start discussing my appearance but it really isn't the focus on my stream. I'd like to think people come back to watch it because it is quite entertaining and I try to interact with the chat as much as possible."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = They're Attractive, They're Women, And They Play Games Live On The Internet. But They're Not 'Camwhores.'|url = http://kotaku.com/5982137/theyre-attractive-theyre-women-and-they-play-games-live-on-the-internet-but-theyre-not-camwhores|website = Kotaku|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female streamers are most often criticized for purportedly using services like Twitch as an alternative to soft-core cam websites to solicit donations by performing sexually suggestive acts. Many male gamers, who dominate the industry, correlate female streamers' success to this behavior. Vivyan Andrew, a 29-year-old twitch streamer addresses this in an interview with Kotaku, ""Yes, if you're a woman and you're streaming, the misconceptions are that you're seeking attention and/or trying to use your 'assets' to receive donations. The misconceptions are very superficial as they invalidate the streamer as a person and what she has to offer beyond her appearance."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Terence Chiang of MMOs.com, writes, "gaming as a 'male hobby' seems to be integrated into our society, with the computer and technology areas commonly being seen as 'Masculine'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Girl Gamers in Streaming and eSports|url = http://mmos.com/editorials/girl-gamers-in-streaming-and-esports|website = MMOs.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This social integration makes the acceptance of female entry into gaming as a legitimate pastime difficult. Research has found that 52% of the gaming world is made up of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 52% of gamers are women – but the industry doesn't know it {{!}} Meg Jayanth|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most remain less visible in the context of the dominant culture, due to the stereotypes between masculinity and gaming.

== Gender disparity ==
{{See also|Gender representation in video games}}

Critics attribute the seeming lack of female interest in video games to the negative [[portrayal of women in video games]] and to [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] attitudes common among professional and hardcore gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/misc/22786_To_My_Someday_Daughter.html|author=Geordie Tait|title=To My Someday Daughter|publisher=Starcitygames.com|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[Twitter]] discussion among women working in games, collated under the [[hashtag]] ''#1reasonwhy'', argued that sexist practices such as the oversexualization of female characters, disinterest in topics that matter to women, as well as workplace harassment and unequal pay for men and women were common in the games industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Locker|first=Melissa|title=#1ReasonWhy: Women Take to Twitter to Talk about Sexism in Video Game Industry|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/27/1reasonwhy-women-take-to-twitter-to-talk-about-sexism-in-video-game-industry/|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[TIME magazine]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|title=Here's a Devastating Account of the Crap Women in the Games Business Have to Deal With.

Regarding elements of game design, areas such as gameplay, mechanics, and similar features have been described as gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player.&lt;ref name=hex&gt;[[Stephanie Bendixsen|Bendixsen, Stephanie 'Hex']].

[[Stuff.co.nz]]. 9 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypical female behaviors such as giggling or sighing are often presented non-ironically, and this leads young children (especially girls who identify with the female character) to think that this is how girls are supposed to look and act.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20030805000714/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/videogamestudy001214.html Not a Pretty Picture]''.

Although some of the population of male gamers have been the source of [[Sexual harassment in video gaming|harassment towards female gamers]] and over-sexualization of the characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Amanda|title=Your Argument is Invalid: Harassment Against Female Gamers|url=http://www.gameskinny.com/b0zks/your-argument-is-invalid-harassment-against-female-gamers|publisher=Game Skinny|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are many men in the gaming industry who agree that there is a problem with female over-sexualization in gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meixsell|first=Jesse|title=Female sexualization in gaming: a male gamer's perspective|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/14/female-sexualization-in-gaming-a-male-gamers-perspective/|publisher=Games Beat|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also male gamers who argue that some of the sexualization of women in video games also applies to men in video games and that portraying a man or woman in a video game in a sexual way can be acceptable if done in the right context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleasure|first=Crymson Pleasure|title=He said what?

A study in the ''Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media'' said that women who play a lot of video games disagree more with stereotypes concerning gender in gaming and are more strongly drawn towards specific gaming genres than men, regardless of the men's gaming frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vermeulen|first=Lotte|last2=Looy|first2=Jan Van|date=2016-04-02|title="I Play So I Am?"

=== Effects ===
The concept that [[video games as art|video games are a form of art]] is one that has begun to gain force in the later half of the 2000s with the U.S. [[National Endowment for the Arts]] recognizing games as a form of art in May 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. In viewing video games as [[cultural artifact]]s and the industry as a cultural industry, the disenfranchisement of women from the medium is regarded as negatively impacting the female voice in the industry and the woman's capacity to take part in the cultural dialogue that gaming inspires.&lt;ref name=spark&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan.

''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; From an education perspective, certain [[Video game genres|gaming genres]] particularly lacking in female players such as the [[first-person shooter]] game have been shown to increase spatial skills thereby giving advantages to players of the games that are currently skewed along gender lines.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; Video games have also been determined to provide an easy lead-in to computer literacy for children and correlations have been drawn between male video gaming and the predominance of male workers within the computer industry.&lt;ref name=nzegwu&gt;Nzegwu, Uzoamaka.

[[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]]. 15 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing importance of tech jobs in the 21st century and the increased role of online networking, the lack of female video game players suggests a loss of future career opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt;

=== Responses ===
The majority of the people who work on game development teams are men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burrows|first=Leah|title=Women remain outsiders in video game industry|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=Globe Correspondent|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified that one of the best ways to increase the percentage of female players comes from the aspect of authorship (either in-game as with ''[[Neopets]]'' and ''[[Whyville]]'', or indirectly as with the [[List of Harry Potter related topics#Video games based on the books and films|''Harry Potter'' series]]' inclusion of Hermione as a playable character subsequent to fan requests).&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;Dillon, Beth A.

In addressing the future of the medium, many researchers have argued for the improvement of the gaming industry to appeal to a more general gender-neutral audience and others have suggested that the appeal should be directed to women in particular.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosen, Jill|title=The gender divide: video-gaming has been largely a man's- or boy's- world, but with games by and for women, that's starting to change|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 2008|location=Maryland|page=C1|type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest attempts to broaden the market to include women could be seen in [[Sega]]'s&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; use of the increased number of female protagonists in fighting games.&lt;ref name=nzegwu /&gt; Other examples of this include games like ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', ''[[Remember Me (video game)|Remember Me]]'', and ''[[the Last of Us]]'', which include a female option for the main character.&lt;ref name="Dewitt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewitt|first=James|title=Lara Croft and the Future of Women in Videogames|url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/opinion/lara-croft-and-the-future-of-women-in-videogames|publisher=Thunderboltgames.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to use strong female characters in important roles, however, is often met with skepticism by marketers concerned with sales.&lt;ref name="Dring"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dring|first=Christopher|title="Women are the future of gaming" - how Tomb Raider and co have put females back on the agenda|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/women-are-the-future-of-gaming/0111714|publisher=Mcvuk.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of IGN's [[Big Games]] at [[E3 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Big_Games_at_E3_2012|title=Big Games at E3 2012 - E3 - Electronics Entertainment Expo Wiki Guide - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Games]] at [[E3 2013]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Big_Games_at_E3_2013|title=Big Games at E3 2013 - E3 - Electronics Entertainment Expo Wiki Guide - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows growth of the female protagonist in video games, rising 4% from 2012 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Kyle.

In [[social psychology]], the '''Yale attitude change approach''' (also known as the '''Yale attitude change model''') is the study of the conditions under which people are most likely to change their attitudes in response to [[persuasion|persuasive messages]]. This approach to persuasive communications was first studied by [[Carl Hovland]] and his colleagues at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;Aronson, Elliot, Timothy D. Wilson, and Robin M. Akert. ''Social Psychology''. Upper Saddle River, N.J: Pearson Education, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic model of this approach can be described as "who said what to whom": the source of the communication, the nature of the communication and the nature of the audience.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; According to this approach, many factors affect each component of a persuasive communication. The credibility and attractiveness of the communicator (source), the quality and sincerity of the message (nature of the communication), and the attention, intelligence and age of the audience (nature of the audience) can influence an audience's attitude change with a persuasive communication. Independent variables include the source, message, medium and audience, with the dependent variable the effect (or impact) of the persuasion.

The Yale attitude change approach has generated research and insight into the nature of persuasion.&lt;ref name="cios"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cios.org/encyclopedia/persuasion/Byale_approach5strengths&amp;weak.htm|title=The Yale Approach|publisher=cios.org|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has helped social psychologists understand the process of persuasion and companies make their marketing and advertising strategies more effective.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; Like most other theories about persuasion and attitude change, this approach is not perfect. Not a systematic theory about persuasive communications, this approach is a general framework within which research was conducted. The Yale researchers did not specify levels of importance among the factors of a persuasive message; they emphasized analyzing the aspects of attitude change over comparing them.&lt;ref name="hovbook"&gt;Carl I. Hovland, Irving L. Janis, and Harold H. Kelley "Communication and Persuasion: Psychological Studies of Opinion Change" New Haven: Yale UP, 1953 Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persuasive Communication depends on who says what to whom==

===Defining the Who: The Source of Communication===
The effects of credibility rely on the aspects of the speaker to be of "high trustworthiness" or "low trustworthiness". Prominent, credible speakers can drastically persuade more people than others who are not credible. Credible speakers also have a sense of reputation where what they say matters to whom they are speaking to. In addition, attractive speakers have a stronger influence than those who are unattractive, regardless if the material is factual or not.&lt;ref&gt;CARL I. HOVLAND, WALTER WEISS; The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness, Public Opinion Quarterly, Volume 15, Issue 4, 1 January 1951, Pages 635–650,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining the What: The Nature of the Communication===
The characteristics of the nature of the communication impacts the degree of attitude change. One such characteristic is the design of the message; people tend be more persuaded by messages that don't appear to be targeted for them.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; By nature, there is a primacy effect that occurs with speakers. People are more influenced by what they hear first. The first speaker is recorded stronger than the following speakers even if the arguments following the first speaker are stronger. If there is a delay after every speech, then it is better to go last because of the recency effect where people remember the most recent event the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/209393 | volume=21 | title=Message Order Effects in Persuasion: An Attitude Strength Perspective | year=1994 | journal=Journal of Consumer Research | page=205 | last1 = Haugtvedt | first1 = Curtis P. | last2 = Wegener | first2 = Duane T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining the To Whom: The Nature of the Audience===
Attitude may change depending on the characteristics of the audience. Audiences that are distracted during the persuasive communication will often be persuaded less than audiences that are not distracted.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; From the ages of 18-25, people are very susceptible to attitude change. After those ages, people tend to be more stable and resistant to attitude change. Additionally, an audience member that is less intelligent tends to be more persuasable than those with higher intelligence. People who do not enjoy thinking can rely on experts and trustworthy sources to conserve their cognitive resources. If the expert source is untrustworthy, then the person might have to evaluate the material on their own. In most cases, people are not knowledgeable enough to interpret the information themselves or have very low confidence in the issue, thus they must rely on knowledgeable others(expert and trustworthy sources).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Petty, R.

=={{anchor|Major History}}History==
The Yale Attitude Change Approach, also referred to as the Yale Model of Persuasion or Yale School Research is considered to be one of the first models of attitude change. It was a reflection of the Yale Communication Research Program's findings, a program which was set up under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;

During the early 1900s and World War II there was a heavy need for research on political persuasion as propaganda analysis and public opinion research,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DEMİRDÖĞEN|first=Ülkü D.|date=2010|title=The Roots of Research in (political) Persuasion: Ethos, Pathos, Logos and the Yale Studies of Persuasive Communications|url=|journal=International Journal of Social Inquiry|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Research Branch of the Army's Information and Education Division was deemed with this responsibility. The importance of understanding methods behind changing public opinion was emphasized by the success of Nazi propaganda campaigns.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897446271|title=The Psychology of Attitudes &amp; Attitude Change|last=R.,|first=Maio, Gregory|others=Haddock, Geoffrey,|isbn=9781446272268|edition=Second|location=Los Angeles|oclc=897446271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Hovland was appointed the Chief Psychologist and director of Experimental Studies for the U.S war Department. Along with others such as, Frances J. Anderson, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, John L. Finan, Nathan Maccoby, Fred D. Sheffield, Irving L. Janis, M. Brewster Smit &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Experiments_on_Mass_Communication.html?id=ooI8hL46JXEC|title=Experiments on Mass Communication|last=Hovland|first=Carl Iver|last2=Lumsdaine|first2=Arthur A.|last3=Sheffield|first3=Fred D.|date=1949|publisher=Princeton University Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertook the responsibility of conducting, analyzing, and planning experiments that explored the effectiveness of war propaganda.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; After the war Hovland, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, and Fred D. Sheffield published a report of the major research findings of the Experimental section of the Research Branch under the publication ''Experiments on Mass Communication, 1949''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''.'' These experiments are considered an antecedent to the Yale groups research.&lt;ref name="Marková 5–8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marková|first=Ivana|date=2008-02-01|title=Persuasion and Social Psychology|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0392192107087912|journal=Diogenes|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=5–8|doi=10.1177/0392192107087912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in persuasion remained strong after the war considering the increasing availability and advancements of telecommunications. With interests in persuasion persistent Carl Hovland, Irving Janis, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, Fred D. Sheffield and others&amp;nbsp;within the "Yale School" returned to Yale with desires to continue researching the topic.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; They established the Yale Communication Research Program which aimed to understand and examine factors that influenced attitude change. It was considered the first modern attempt of such a task.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;

The Yale Communication Program was a "cooperative research and study group" that encouraged members to pursue research in their line of interest regarding the subject of persuasive communication and their effects on behavior and opinion.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;The Yale group examined attitude change from a learning theory perspective and information processing approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Yale school's approach is considered ''convergent''.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; As in it started with identifying a phenomenon (attitude change) and then searched for an explanation by looking at variable factors and their effect on the phenomena, as opposed to a ''divergent approach'' which starts with a theory that is then applied to a phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The Yale school also suggested that the effects of the factors contributing to attitude change depended on a sequence of message processing stages summarized as; attention, comprehension and acceptance.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; In essence a person must "first ''notice'' the message, and ''pay attention'' to it, then ''comprehend'' its meaning, and finally accept it".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; They also introduced the concept of "incentive"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; as a crucial variable in influencing attitude change. It was not enough for a response to be learned but that motivation was provided in order to preference one opinion over another.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Hovland, Janis, and Kelly published the group's first empirical findings under the publication ''Communication and Persuasion (1953)''&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;''.'' They paralleled their research to Laswell's (1948) statement; ''who says what to whom with what effect'' &lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;''.'' In the publication they categorized their findings on the analysis of four factors: "1) the '''communicator''' who transmits the communication; 2) the '''stimuli''' transmitted by the communicator; 3) the '''audience''' responding to the communication; 4) the '''responses''' made by the audience to the communication".&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; The Yale School had a breakdown of sub-factors that they observed for each topic (The Communicator, The Communication, The Audience).&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;The fourth topic, which they deemed "Responses" was composed of two subtopics which explored the "expression of the new opinion" and "retention of the opinion change".&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;The Yale group had a total of five publications reporting the findings of their experiments (including Communication and Persuasion) under the same model, they were: ''The Order of Presentation in Persuasion, Personality and Persuasibility, Attitude Organization and Change, and Social Judgement'' that further explored each factor.

===Initial/Notable Studies by the Yale Communication Research Program===

====Characteristics of the Communicator====

The Yale group observed the effects of credibility on persuasion. Credibility was composed of; 1) Expertness: the degree to which the communicator was knowledgeable in the field, and 2) Trustworthines: In reference to the intentions of the communicator.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;

Hovland and Weiss in studies such as, ''The influence of source credibility on communication effectiveness''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hovland|first=Carl I.|last2=Weiss|first2=Walter|date=1951-01-01|title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness|url=https://doi.org/10.1086/266350|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|doi=10.1086/266350|issn=0033-362X|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1951), exposed participants to identical newspaper and magazine articles yet attributed them to either high credibility sources (like Robert Oppeinhemier) or low credibility sources (like the Soviet Newspaper Pravda). Their results indicated that participants regarded sources with higher credibility more favorably than those considered as low-credibility. They contributed this effect to the expertise of the source and the confidence in the sources sincerity in delivering the message.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also observed that effects from both positive and negative sources tended to dissipate after several weeks.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;

An exception to the gradual dissociation of the effects of a persuasive message were reported in studies conducted by Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Shieffield. Results showed that while memory of factual information decreased or memory of the source dissipated opinion change increased gradually over time, they coined this phenomenon the ''Sleeper Effect''.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;

====The Content of the Communication====
The Yale school focused on factors such as ''Motivating appeals''&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; and organization of arguments in regards to the content of the communication. In particular they focused on ''"emotional" appeals'' which were considered a class of stimuli whose contents could arouse emotion, in contrast to logical/rational appeals.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; In particular the group looked at fear-arousing appeals.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;

Janis and Feshbach in their experiment ''Effects of Fear-arousing Communications(1953)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janis|first=Irving L.|last2=Feshbach|first2=Seymour|title=Effects of fear-arousing communications.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0060732|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=78–92|doi=10.1037/h0060732|year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored degrees of intensities of fear appeal and their effects on conformity in the context of the consequences of poor dental hygiene. The study showed that messages were more effective when contained low-leveled threat references such as "cavities" or "tooth decay" instead of "strong appeal" references, such as exclaiming serious infections that could cause paralysis and kidney damage.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; The results suggested that appeals of high intensity would be less effective than milder ones.

In regards to structure of an argument Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Sheffield explored the effectiveness of one-sided and two-sided messages (containing pros and cons).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The study (referenced in ''Experiments on Mass Communications, 1948)'' looked at whether a message given to American soldiers would be more effective if it only advocated one position or if it advocated both sides of the position. It was found that two-sided messages were more effective on budging educated men's opinions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, two sided arguments were also better at generating change of opinion in those soldiers who opposed the argument initially. For less educated men who also supported the government's position, the one-sided argument was more persuasive.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; Their findings not only suggested that the content of the communication has an impact on attitude change but so do the attributes of the receiver.

A follow up study conducted by Lumsdaine and Janis, ''Resistance to counter propaganda produced by a one-sided versus'' ''two-side propaganda presentation(1953)'',&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lumsdaine|first=Arthur A.|last2=Janis|first2=Irving L.|date=1953|title=Resistance to "Counterpropaganda" Produced by One-Sided and Two-Sided "Propaganda" Presentations|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=17|issue=3|pages=311–318|doi=10.1086/266464|jstor=2746134}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the resistance of opinion change motivated by argument structure. The findings summarized that two sided messages were more effective to resistance of counter propaganda regardless of initial position held (even if the initial belief was counter to the new developed belief). Two sided messages were more effective in maintaining sustained opinion change.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;

Another study spearheaded by Hovland and Mandel, ''An experimental comparison of conclusion-drawing by the communicator and by the audience(1952)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hovland|first=Carl I.|last2=Mandell|first2=Wallace|title=An experimental comparison of conclusion-drawing by the communicator and by the audience.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0059833|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=581–588|doi=10.1037/h0059833|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted that messages are more persuasive when they are implicitly argued. The audience is then able to come to their own conclusion. Hovland and Mandel mentioned that this effect may only be evident with less complex issues that can easily be surmised by the audience.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;

====The Audience====

In terms of the audience the Yale group concerned themselves with the audience predisposition, which they defined as the audience's motives, abilities, personalities,&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt; and the context of the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In one study Kelly and Volkart, ''The resistance to change of group-anchored attitudes (Kelly, Volkart, 1952)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Harold H.|last2=Volkart|first2=Edmund H.|date=1952|title=The Resistance to Change of Group-Anchored Attitudes|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=17|issue=4|pages=453–465|doi=10.2307/2088001|jstor=2088001}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' confirmed the notion that individuals with greater interest in retaining group membership are less likely to adopt beliefs that contradict group standards. Their findings are consistent with the hypothesis that supports the relationship between internalization of norms and stronger group attachments.&lt;ref name="hovbook" /&gt;

Holland et al. studied&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2593|title=Attitude change; a critical analysis of theoretical approaches|last=1934-2002.|first=Kiesler, Charles A.,|date=1969|publisher=Wiley|others=Collins, Barry E.,, Miller, Norman, 1933-|isbn=0471474657|location=New York,|oclc=2593}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resistance to attitude change when a person is a member of a group and discovered five factors that induce conformity of opinion within a group:

1) the individual's knowledge of group norms

2) the extent to which the individual values group membership

3) the individuals social status or rank within the group

4) particular situation cues

5) salience of the group(the extent to which a specific group is dominant in the individual's awareness at the time the 'counter persuasion' is delivered

Because these five factors play an influential role in inducing conformity, members may resist attitude change when the group is exposed to a message that counters group norms/culture. The more the group membership is valued, the more resistance, to the extent that a [[Boomerang effect (psychology)|boomerang effect]] may occur.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Remarks ===
The Yale group did ample and very meaningful research in the field of attitude change and persuasion. They brought forth emphasis on the importance of learning theories behind attitude change and laid a strong foundation of mass findings that stimulated further research related to persuasion.&lt;ref name="Sage"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/310834032|title=Encyclopedia of communication theory|date=2009|publisher=Sage|others=Littlejohn, Stephen W., Foss, Karen A., Sage Publications., Sage eReference (Online service)|isbn=9781412959377|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=310834032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such work that stemmed from their findings was the ''inoculation theory'' and the ''social judgement theory''.&lt;ref name="Sage"/&gt; The research was considered a landmark in the development of attitude change and persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/310834032|title=Encyclopedia of communication theory|date=2009|publisher=Sage|others=Littlejohn, Stephen W., Foss, Karen A., Sage Publications., Sage eReference (Online service)|isbn=1412959373|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=310834032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Major theoretical approaches}}Theoretical approaches==
The Yale attitude change approach is a method of making persuasive communications effective, a study begun by Carl Hovland based on his experiences during World War II attempting to boost morale in US soldiers with propaganda.&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt; This study focused on communication-bound predispositions to accept (or reject) appeals and unbound attributes, such as tendencies to particular responses to all communications. The Yale group's research "stemmed from a variety of theoretical approaches, including, among others, Hull's learning theory, some motivational hypotheses of Freud and other psychoanalysts, and some of the formulations of Lewin, Sherif, Newcomb, and others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kilpatrick|first=F. P.|title=Communication and persuasion.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0050834|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=51|issue=4|pages=438–439|doi=10.1037/h0050834|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yale group developed a theoretical structure linking individual attributes and persuasion based on three major factors: the source of the communication, the nature of the communication and the nature of the audience.

The approach has a similar structure to Aristotle's concept of persuasion in his ''[[Rhetoric]]''. According to Aristotle, there are three means of persuasion: the character of the speaker, the emotional state of the listener and ''logos'' (the argument itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.471.7234|title=The Roots of Research in (political) Persuasion: Ethos, Pathos, Logos and the Yale Studies of Persuasive Communications|last=Demi̇rdöğen|first=Ülkü D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary psychologists use the Yale model's psychological approach and Aristotle's philosophical approach to examine components of persuasion.

=== Legacy of Yale Research on Theories and Models Pertaining to Attitude Change ===

==== Influences on McGuire ====
William McGuire(1968) further broke down Hovland et al. (1953) message processing stages (attention, comprehension, acceptance)&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; into six stages: presentation, attention, comprehension, yielding, retention, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, W. J. (1968). Personality and attitude change: An information-processing theory. In A. G. Greenwood, T. C. Brock, &amp; T. M. Ostrom, ''Psychological Foundations of Attitudes''. New York: Academic Press, 171-196.&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, McGuire proposed that a message must first be presented, drawn attention to, and then understood and comprehended by the audience. This would cause an attitude change, that must be remembered at a later time to actually influence behavioral changes.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;McGuire emphasized the importance of reception (the attention and comprehension stages of the Yale group) and yielding (anticipation and critical-evaluation steps) in his study of individual differences in influencibility.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=Nancy|last2=Wood|first2=Wendy|title=Self-esteem and intelligence affect influenceability: The mediating role of message reception.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.156|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=111|issue=1|pages=156–171|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.156|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McGuire reception was positively related to ability and motivational attributes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Individual attributes also contributed to the yielding stage(acceptance of the opinion).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One weakness of the approach is the nature of its steps—specifically, the yielding step. The approach assumes that the audience's attitude will change by learning a new message, yet learning does not always result in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, W. L. (n.d.). The yale approach. In Electronic Encyclopedia of Communication. Communication Institute for Online Scholarship. Retrieved from http://www.cios.org/encyclopedia/persuasion/Byale_approach1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This Information processing paradigm's heritage lays in the message learning theme and theories that guided the work done on persuasion and attitude change by the Yale Communications program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34731629|title=Social psychology : handbook of basic principles|date=1996|publisher=Guilford Press|others=Higgins, E. Tory (Edward Tory), 1946-, Kruglanski, Arie W.|isbn=9781572301009|location=New York|oclc=34731629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;McGuire is best known for his [[inoculation theory]] of exploring resistance to persuasion, which was influenced by the Yale School's research on the resilience of two-sided messages on opinion acceptance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Influences on Dolores Albarracín's Cognition-in-Persuasion Model ====
The Albarracín model,&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; which is a stage model developed in 2002, builds off both McGuire's work and the Yale attitude change approach in regards to the sequence of message processing stages. The study found that message processing may occasionally bypass early stages and takes a step towards addressing the role of processing stages on attitude change. The evidence that people can use processing stages in a different order or even skip a stage altogether was the important acknowledgment of this study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Influences on Elaboration Likelihood Model ====
Another model that stems from the Yale attitude change approach is the [[elaboration likelihood model]] which is a contemporary approach to persuasion. Developed by R.E. Petty and J.T. Cacioppo during the late 1980s, the model describes two ways in which persuasive communications can cause attitude change: centrally and peripherally. The central route to persuasion occurs when people have the ability and motivation to listen to a message, think about its arguments and internalize the information. The recipient relies on cognititive responses instead of heuristics when using the central route. The peripheral route to persuasion is used when the recipient has little to no motivation or effort and people are swayed not by the argument itself but by elements secondary to the message (such as the length of the communication or the attractiveness of the communicator). Under the peripheral route, the recipient relies on the context of the situation rather than the information at hand(i.e. they look at attractiveness in this case or if the person speaking is famous or not).&lt;ref name="textbook" /&gt;

==== Influences on Other Theories ====
Martin Bauer views the Yale approach from a slightly-different angle. In 2008, he argued that persuasion cannot focus only on the social influence of [[intersubjectivity]] (the sharing of subjective states by two or more individuals) but must include inter-objectivity (the understandings shared by individuals about social reality). Using the concept of the ''fait accompli'' (a completed, irreversible "done deal"), Bauer described artifacts such as nuclear power, information technology and genetic engineering as types of social influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bauer | first1 = M. W. | year = 2008 | title = Social Influence by Artefacts | url = | journal = Diogenes | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 68–83 | doi=10.1177/0392192107087918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Source credibility and experience claims in consumer advertisement ====
"Prepurchase Attribute Verifiability, Source Credibility, and Persuasion", a study by Shailendra Jain and Steven Posavac,&lt;ref name="steven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pratap Jain | first1 = Shailendra | last2 = Posavac | first2 = Steven S. | year = 2001 | title = Prepurchase Attribute Verifiability, Source Credibility, and Persuasion | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Psychology | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 169–180 | doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp1103_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the role message origin plays in the likelihood that a recipient will believe the message in an advertisement. Advertisements for mountain bikes and cameras were studied; consumers were asked their overall reaction to search claims (claims which can be statistically proven) and experience claims (testimonials). The credibility of the claims was also compared. Participants were shown advertisements for each of the products and asked questions about the advertisements, which contained search or experience claims. The search claim for the mountain bike was its weight, the experience claim was its ease of control. The search claim for the camera was its compactness and the experience claim was its photo quality. The results indicated that consumers were more likely to believe (and be satisfied with) claims if they thought the source was trustworthy or had experience with the product. They were more likely to believe advertisements with concrete evidence behind the claims, such as the weight of the bike or the compactness of the camera. The study demonstrates that the credibility of a source correlates with its ability to persuade.&lt;ref name="steven" /&gt;

==={{anchor|In persuasion}}Persuasion===

==== Attractiveness as an influence on opinion change and persuasion ====
"An Attribution Analysis of Communicator Characteristics on Opinion Change: the Case of Communicator Attractiveness", a study by Alice Eagly and Shelly Chaiken,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = Alice H. | last2 = Chaiken | first2 = Shelly | year = 1975 | title = An Attribution Analysis of Communicator Characteristics On Opinion Change: the Case of Communicator Attractiveness | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 136–44 | doi=10.1037/h0076850}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the effects of attractiveness and message content on persuasion. Eagly and Chaiken surveyed undergraduate students on communicators' attractiveness and whether they were persuaded to adopt the speaker's position (desirable or undesirable) on a topic. Students were asked to predict the speaker's position before hearing the message. The study showed that participants were more likely to be persuaded by an attractive speaker to take an undesirable position on a topic than by an unattractive speaker.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, they were equally likely to be persuaded to take a desirable position on a topic by attractive and unattractive speakers. Participants were more likely to agree with attractive speakers in general and more likely to agree with any speaker discussing a desirable position on a topic.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; More attractive individuals are more persuasive than individuals perceived as less attractive. Message content affects believability; desirable messages are more believable than undesirable ones.

Hovland states&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lindzey, G. (1954).&amp;nbsp;''Handbook of social psychology(Vol. 11, Chapter 28, p,1083)''. Cambridge, Mass: Addison-Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; another set of factors that impact attitude change, specifically, in order for the communication to be accepted by the recipient. One such factor is the prestige of the medium on which the message is communicated with. One medium may be more prestigeful than others. Most importantly, "prestige for whom?" is important to specify since certain mediums may be more prestigeful for certain segments of the population. Accordingly, how the medium differs in credibility affects the prestige of the medium; a medium judged by an individual to be the most trustworthy may be the most effective.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A second factor which may affect the comparison of media is the extent of social interaction. In a study by Knower(1935),&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; hearing a speech when a member of an audience is less effective than hearing it individually. Conversely, a study by Cantril and Allport(1935)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; suggest that radio may be more effective than print because the individual identifies as part of a larger group of people listening to the same program at the same time.

A third factor that affects the likelihood of acceptance of the message by the recipient is the extent to which the medium provides flexibility. Flexibility in this case means the extent to which the medium can canter to special interests and differences in comprehension. Print, for example, is particularly effective by providing for specialized interests and tastes to a greater extent than other mediums. Additionally, a two-way communication network may also induce flexibility. For example, in a political campaign where a two-way communication between the studio and the listener was employed, flexibility was heightened. Accordingly, "questions raised by the man-in-the-street could thus be answered immediately by the political candidate in the television studio"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=={{anchor|Controversies}}Controversy==
A major issue with the Yale attitude change approach is the fact that it is strictly functional, focusing on a change in attitude and the information processing accompanying it. Other scholars see persuasion as a function of "communication, [[social influence]], and group processes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markova | first1 = I | year = 2008 | title = Persuasion and Social Psychology | url = | journal = Diogenes | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 5–8 | doi=10.1177/0392192107087912}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking into account other factors such as social influence and the media.

A theory proposed by Margarita Sanchez-Mazas focuses on people's desire for social recognition and dignity. In this model, persuasion is seen as a way to overcome social injustice and achieve recognition and dignity. Sanchez-Mazas examines the roles of majorities and minorities in creating social change, and believes that "persuasion is a simultaneous, reciprocal process between groups, and specifically between majorities and minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanchez-Mazas | first1 = M | year = 2008 | title = Violence or Persuasion? Denial of Recognition and Opportunities for Action in Contemporary Societies | url = | journal = Diogenes | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 94–106 | doi=10.1177/0392192107087920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A persuasion developed by Clelia Nascimento-Schulze emphasizes communication in a complex society. According to Nascimento-Schulze, technology and the media are used to promote science in developing countries. It was determined that the Internet was most successful at transferring scientific knowledge to the public because it contains an optimal amount of visual information and combines art and science in a creative, informative way. Key to this theory is an "interactive society"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nascimento-Schulze | first1 = C. M. | year = 2008 | title = Science and Society: To Indicate, to Motivate or to Persuade? | url = | journal = Diogenes | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 133–42 | doi=10.1177/0392192107087923}}&lt;/ref&gt; with technology allowing communities to share common values and beliefs, such as the Internet.

Another form of public persuasion, studied by Helene Joffe, explores how the media produces visual stimuli which elicit feelings of fear, empathy or disgust. This theory highlights the substantial role of technology in evoking emotion in individuals, focusing on advertising campaigns for health, safety and charities. According to Joffe, visual stimuli lure an audience into a "state of emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joffe | first1 = H | year = 2008 | title = The Power of Visual Material: Persuasion, Emotion and Identification | url = | journal = Diogenes | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi=10.1177/0392192107087919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elaboration Likelihood Model is based on the Yale Attitude Approach Model by processing the different outcomes of attitude change. However, there are also claims that they are independent entities that have no connection.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Conclusions==
The model was a major contributor to the development and understanding of attitude change and persuasion, however it is now only one part of many perspectives on persuasion.&lt;ref name="Marková 5–8"/&gt; Research in persuasion is considering the effects of the unconscious, with scholars beginning to explore the possibility of "[[priming (psychology)|priming]] in inducing non-conscious effects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bargh | first1 = John A | year = 2006 | title = What Have We Been Priming All These Years? On the Development, Mechanisms, and Ecology of Nonconscious Social Behavior | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 147–68 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.336| pmc = 2763379}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea, new to social psychology, is beginning to shed light on the relationship between the individual unconscious and the social environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Correia Jesuino | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Lost in Translation: From Influence to Persuasion | url = | journal = Diogenes | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 107–19 | doi=10.1177/0392192107087921}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of persuasion has always been an integral part of social psychology with the focus slowly moving from attitude change and behavior modification to communications, literature, art and the other humanities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3271">The '''Österreichische Bundes- und Industriebeteiligungen GmbH''' (English: Austrian State and Industrial Holding Ltd) or short '''ÖBIB''', is a state holding company that can be characterized as a [[National_wealth_fund|National Wealth Fund]]. It administers the investments of the [[Austria|Republic of Austria]] in partially or entirely nationalized companies. It is headquartered in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.obib.co.at/die-oebib/unternehmen/ About ÖBIB (German)]." Österreichische Bundes- und Industriebeteiligungen GmbH. Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1967 the ''Österreichische Industrieverwaltungs-GmbH'' (Austrian industry administration [[GmbH]]) was established to centralize the administration of the interests in nationalized companies. It was transformed to the ''Österreichische Industrieverwaltungs-AG'' (Austrian industry administration [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]) in 1970 and at the same instant got assigned the shares of the nationalized companies. The ÖIAG (since 1986) and the companies it owned formed a group, the Austrian Industries AG until 1993 when this group was split and the ÖIAG was instructed to privatize the companies it owned.

In 2015, the Austrian state holding ÖIAG was turned into a limited liability company (GesmbH) called Österreichische Bundes- und Industriebeteiligungsholding (''ÖBIB''), which is permitted to make new acquisitions and which will report directly to the [[Ministry of Finance (Austria)|Ministry of Finance]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/13/austria-stakes-idUSL6N0US1CC20150113 Austria tightens hold over partly state-owned companies]." Reuters. Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investments==

The ÖBIB holds shares in:
* 31.50% of the [[Petroleum|Oil]] producer [[OMV]]
* 28.42% of the [[Telekom Austria]]
* 52.85% of the [[Österreichische Post AG|Österreichische Post]]

* [[voestalpine AG|voestalpine]]
* [[Austrian Airlines]]
* [[SGP Verkehrstechnik]]
* [[Austria Mikro Systeme International AG]]
* [[Austria Technologie &amp; Systemtechnik AG]] (AT &amp; S)
