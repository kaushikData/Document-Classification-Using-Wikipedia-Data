'''Aerial archaeology''' is the study of archaeological remains by examining them from altitude.

==Details==
The advantages of gaining a good aerial view of the ground had been long appreciated by [[archaeologist]]s as a high viewpoint permits a better appreciation of fine details and their relationships within the wider site context. Early investigators attempted to gain birdseye views of sites using hot air balloons, scaffolds or cameras attached to kites. Following the invention of the [[aeroplane]] and the military importance placed on [[aerial photography]] during the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, archaeologists were able to more effectively use the technique  to discover and record archaeological sites.

Photographs may be taken either vertically, that is from directly overhead, or obliquely, meaning that they are taken at an angle. In order to provide a three-dimensional effect, an overlapping pair of vertical photographs, taken from slightly offset positions, can be viewed [[stereoscope|stereoscopically]].
[[Image:Nazca monkey.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Aerial archeological photograph of the [[Nazca Lines|"Nazca monkey"]] in [[Peru]]]]

The advantages of aerial photographs to archaeologists are manifold.

Large sites could for the first time be viewed accurately, in their entirety and within their landscape. This aided the production of drawn plans and also inspired archaeologists to look beyond the discrete [[monument]] and to appreciate a site's role within its setting. Photos are taken vertically for the purposes of planning and [[spatial analysis]] and obliquely to emphasize certain features or give perspective. Through the process of [[photogrammetry]], vertical photos can be converted into scaled plans.

Archaeological features may also be more visible from the air than on the ground. In temperate Europe, aerial reconnaissance is one of the most important ways in which new archaeological sites are discovered. Tiny differences in ground conditions caused by buried features can be emphasised by a number of factors and then viewed from the air:

*Slight differences in ground levels will cast shadows when the sun is low and these can be seen best from an aeroplane. These are referred to as [[shadow mark]]s.
*Buried ditches will hold more water and buried walls will hold less water than undisturbed ground, this phenomenon, amongst others, causes crops to grow better or worse, taller or shorter, over each kind of ground and therefore define buried features which are apparent as tonal or colour differences. Such effects are called [[cropmark]]s.
*Frost can also appear in winter on ploughed fields where water has naturally accumulated along the lines of buried features. These are known as [[frostmark]]s.
*Slight differences in soil colour between natural deposits and archaeological ones can also often show in ploughed fields as [[soilmark]]s
*Differences in levels and buried features will also affect the way surface water behaves across a site and can produce a striking effect after heavy rain.
In cases like the [[Nazca lines]], the features are meaningless from the ground but easily visible from the air.

Pioneers of aerial archaeology include [[Roger Agache]] in Northern [[France]], [[Antoine Poidebard]] in [[Syria]], [[Lionel Rees|L W B Rees]] in Jordan [[O. G. S. Crawford]] in [[England]] and Sir [[Henry Wellcome]] in the Sudan, [[Giacomo Boni (archaeologist)|Giacomo Boni]] in Italy.

Following in the footsteps of [[Henry Wellcome]], [[kite aerial photography]] is now being used on archaeological sites outside the visible spectrum, from the near ultra-violet through to the near and thermal infra-red.

Aerial archaeology is used in the processes of research and investigation in [[aviation archaeology]].

'''Arcadian ecology''' is a [[school of thought]] that advocates for a harmonious relationship between humans and nature. It is named for the mountainous [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcady]] region of Greece. Gilbert White's seminal piece "Natural History of Selbourne" promotes a benign attitude towards nature and advocates for a [[peaceful coexistence]] between organisms. It was an individual realization of ancient arcadian ideas of harmonious interactions between humans and nature. The evolution of Arcadian ecological thought continuously reverts to the detailed letters and poems in this work.&lt;ref&gt;Worster, Donald. ''Nature's Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Gilbert. The natural history and antiquities of Selborne. Methuen: The Aberdeen University Press Limited, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

The harmonious relationship described by Arcadian ecology establishes a responsibility to resist the domination of nature. Donald Worster in his book, ''Nature's Economy: A History of Ecological Ideas'', uses Imperial ecology as a counterpoint to Arcadian ecology. Imperial ecology takes a different approach, and suggests that humans should attempt to manage nature, because nature exists for man's benefit ([[utilitarianism]]). This contradiction is representative of the ecologists' struggle  to explain humanity's relationship with nature while considering popular theological views of the time period. The discussion of Arcadian versus Imperial ecology would continue with prominent figures of the field such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. The long term implications of this debate have the potential to shape nature in the future as humans struggle with ethical debates and laws for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Oelschlaeger, Max. "Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective." Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Arcadian standpoint has its roots in several historical and cultural traditions which have shaped the study of [[ecology]]. One of these such cultural traditions was the [[Renaissance]], which cultivated the appreciation of [[landscape]], [[wilderness]], and nature. [[Environmental sociologist]] Kris van Koppen&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Persons/Kris-van-Koppen-1.htm dr.ir. C.S.A. (Kris) van Koppen, CV]&lt;/ref&gt; underscores this point by arguing, "The social theories that belong to the arcadian approach are particularly orientated to the recognition, elaboration and extension of the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s of nature, as well as to the social organization of their [[conservation biology|preservation]]".&lt;ref name=vKoppen&gt;van Koppen, C.S.A.(Kris). "Resource, Arcadia, Lifeworld. Nature Concepts in Environmental Sociology." Sociologia Ruralis 3 (2000): 300-318. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcadian ecology can be understood by its contrasts with another prominent view, Imperial Ecology. Sociologists and historians define Imperial Ecology as the standpoint that nature is a force to be dominated in the quest for human [[convenience]]. It is in this difference that it can be clearly seen that the arcadian approach criticizes 'resourcism' and 'reductionism'.&lt;ref name=vKoppen/&gt; Therefore, sociologists and ecologists who subscribe to the notion of arcadian ecology view natural disasters like the [[Dust Bowl]] as stemming directly from conceptions of nature like imperial ecology.

Within arcadian ecological thought, there has been a recent focus on the relationship between humans and animals. This comes primarily from Keith Tomas and his work ''Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500–1800'' published in 1983. This contribution began to highlight [[animal rights]] and the inhumane treatment of animals between 1500 and 1800. In a similar vein, Lynn White reflected on the shift from the biblical idea that animals were put on earth to serve man, to the realization that man must live in harmony with beast.&lt;ref&gt;White, L. ''The historical roots of our ecological crisis'' Science 155 (3767). 1967. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical implications==

Ethical and political implications of the Arcadian Ecology viewpoint are ever popular in scholarly and media debates during the twenty-first century. The debate however, did not begin during the current time but rather has progressed over many centuries as humans attempt to grapple with their short-term and long-term [[environmental impact]]. [[Max Oelschlaeger]] remarks, "Nearly 50 years ago [[Aldo Leopold]] identified the basic problem of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]]: learn how to live on the land without spoiling it".&lt;ref&gt;Oelschlaeger, Max. "Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective." Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It would also not even be fifteen years later when [[Rachel Carson]] wrote about [[Neanderthal science]] and its unreflective practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Oelschlaeger, Max. "Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective." Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States conservation debate===
A more reflective look at the United States' environmental practices can show in depth the struggle of a relatively new country, with substantial economic means, to come to an agreement on appropriate actions regarding nature. Historically the United States has had significant expansion and [[over-resourcing]]. The many [[national park]]s and government-protected environmental lands were in part created because there was over-framing and development. [[Teddy Roosevelt]] used his position as the United States President to set aside more than 194 million acres of park land.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adirondackalmanack.com/2008/09/teddy-roosevelt-and-the-adirondack-forest-preserve.html&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Jacoby, an expert in environmental history, has written how the [[Adirondack Park]] in New York was created to ensure a continued water source to the New York City population and a natural environment to “recharge” from city life.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, Karl. ''Crimes against nature: Squatters, poachers, thieves, and the hidden history of American conservation''. University of California Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all United States National Parks were created for reasons other than [[nature preservation]], such as [[Yosemite National Park]]. Originally it was set aside as land to be undeveloped by those who predicted that land conservation may become important in the future. For classification purposes, those ecologists that saw a need to refuse a developmental and destructive path for Yellowstone ascribe to the arcadian ecology view. However, this originally Arcadian movement was opposed, when San Francisco need a viable water supply after a devastating earthquake. This conservation issue sparked a major debate over the [[Hetch Hetchy]]. The debate pitted major thinkers against each other including [[John Muir]] who thought there was "no holier temple than Yosemite" and [[Gifford Pinchot]] who was in favor of damming to provide water resources to San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Stradling, David. ''Conservation in the Progressive Era: Classic Texts''. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hetch Hetchy examines the dichotomy of arcadian and imperial ecology.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In addition to National Parks, the United States has put many laws into motion regarding environmental protection including the National Environmental Policy Act (1969), the Wilderness Act (1964), and the [[Endangered Species Act (1973)]]. These laws all celebrate the Arcadian harmony between nature and humans and ensure its preservation. Unfortunately, Americans, according to Max Oelschlaeger, are also, "the world’s leading consumers: our ecological footprints tread heavily on other parts of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;Oelschlaeger, Max. "Valuing Our Environment: A Philosophical Perspective." Ethics and the Environment 2.1 (1997): 81-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major problems in determining if there has been success in terms of the environment in the United States is the subjectivity that comes with this environmental issue. A look at the work by Eliot Brownlee, a professor of economic history, will suggest that the United States is an economic success story that utilized the natural resources to the best of their abilities. The view looks at nature not as a pawn, but a means to an end in production which has advanced the human race further than ever thought possible.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlee, Eliot. 1974, The Dynamics of Ascent: A History of the American Economy. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, a prominent environmental philosopher, [[Joseph Petulla]], wrote a different story of the landscape of Brownlee. He saw the economic success coming at a costly price of the [[habitat destruction|destruction of the American land]]. [[Western civilization]] had encroached too far into nature and it was more reminiscent of Imperial Ecology rather than Arcadian Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Petulla, Joseph M. American environmental history. Columbus, OH: Merrill Publishing Company, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motor oil==
[[File:Oil Change oil pan 2005 gmc suv.JPG|thumb|Oil being drained from an automobile]]

Recycled motor oil can be combusted as fuel, usually in plant boilers, space heaters, or industrial heating applications such as blast furnaces and cement kilns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/media/wwwlboroacuk/content/sustainability/downloads/guidancenotes/wgn025_general_oils.pdf | title=Waste Guidance Note: WGN025 | publisher="Loughborough University" | date=May 1, 2014 | accessdate=March 22, 2016| author=Hunt, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used motor oil is burned as fuel it must be burned at high temperatures to avoid gaseous pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/8601/IETC_Waste_Oils_Compendium.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y |accessdate=November 27, 2018| title=Compendium of Recycling and Destruction Technologies for Waste Oils |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, waste motor oil can be [[Distillation|distilled]] into [[diesel fuel]] or [[Fuel oil|marine fuel]] in a process similar to oil re-refining, but without the final [[hydrotreating]] process. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The lubrication properties of motor oil persist, even in used oil, and it can be recycled indefinitely.&lt;ref name="Environmental Encyclopedia"/&gt;

===Used motor oil re-refining===
{{See also|Motor oil#Re-refined motor oil|l1=Motor oil: Re-refined motor oil}}
Used oil re-refining is the process of restoring used oil to new oil by removing chemical impurities, heavy metals and dirt.&lt;ref name="GreenvilleOnline"/&gt; Used industrial and automotive oil is recycled at re-refineries. The used oil is first tested to determine suitability for re-refining, after which it is dehydrated and the water distillate is treated before being released into the environment. Dehydrating also removes the residual light fuel that can be used to power the refinery, and additionally captures [[ethylene glycol]] for re-use in recycled antifreeze.

Next, industrial fuel is separated out of the used oil then [[vacuum distillation]] removes the lube cut (that is, the fraction suitable for reuse as lubricating oil) leaving a heavy oil that contains the used oil's additives and other by-products such as asphalt extender. The lube cut next undergoes hydro treating, or [[catalytic hydrogenation]] to remove residual polymers and other chemical compounds, and saturate carbon chains with hydrogen for greater stability.

Final oil separation, or fractionating, separates the oil into three different oil grades: Light viscosity lubricants suitable for general lubricant applications, low viscosity lubricants for automotive and industrial applications, and high viscosity lubricants for heavy-duty applications. The oil that is produced in this step is referred to as re-refined base oil (RRBL).

The final step is blending additives into these three grades of oil products to produce final products with the right detergent and anti-friction qualities. Then each product is tested again for quality and purity before being released for sale to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, C. (1994).

===REOB===
The sludge ("residue") associated with engine oil recycling, which collects at the bottom of re-refining vacuum distillation towers, is known by various names, including "re-refined engine oil bottoms" (abbreviated "REOB" or "REOBs").&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa"&gt;Arnold, Terence S. (senior research chemist, Pavement Materials Team, Office of Infrastructure Research and Development, [[Federal Highway Administration]]; Federal lab manager for the chemistry lab, [[Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center]]; fellow of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in the [[United Kingdom]]), [https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/17sept/03.cfm "What's in Your Asphalt?,"] September 2017 (last modified October 25, 2017), ''Public Roads,'' FHWA-HRT-17-006.htm,"   Office of Research, Development, and Technology, Office of Corporate Research, Technology, and Innovation Management, [[Federal Highway Administration]], [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from the U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) states that:
:The oil in a car engine... contains a variety of additives to enhance the vehicle’s performance. These include polymers, viscosity modifiers, heat stabilizers, additional lubricants, and wear additives. The REOB contains all the additives that were in the waste oil as well as the wear metals from the engine (mainly [[iron]] and [[copper]]). These additives include [[zinc dialkyldithiophosphate]], which contains [[zinc]], [[sulfur]], and  [[phosphorus]]; [[calcium phenate]], which contains [[calcium]]; and [[molybdenum disulfide]], which contains [[molybdenum]] and [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

Some producers of [[asphalt]] for [[Road surface|paving]] have—openly or secretly—incorporated REOBs into their asphalt, creating some controversy and concern in the [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]] community, with some experts suggesting it reduces the durability of the resulting [[Road surface|pavement]].&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

'''The Bogoliubov Prize for young scientists''' is an award offered to young researchers in [[theoretical physics]] by the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR), an international intergovernmental organization located in Dubna, Russia. The award is issued in memory of the physicist and mathematician [[Nikolay Bogoliubov]]. 

The prize is awarded to young (up to 33-year-old) researchers for "outstanding contributions in fields of [[theoretical physics]] related to Bogoliubov's scientific interests".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/main/article/39/3/19 Bogoliubov prize for young scientists] at CERN COURIER&lt;/ref&gt; The awardee is one who has demonstrated "early scientific maturity" and whose results are recognized worldwide and peer-reviewed. The laureates generally emulate Bogoliubov's own skill in using sophisticated mathematics to attempt to solve concrete physical problems (mostly in the fields of [[nonlinear dynamics]], [[statistical physics]], [[quantum field theory]] and elementary [[particle physics]]).

==Jury==
The jury is presided by the theoretical physicist [[Dmitry Shirkov]], who co-authored many works with Nikolay Bogoliubov.

==Laureates==
* 1999 Oleg Shvedov ([[Moscow State University]], Russia): for a series of works on asymptotical methods in statistical physics and quantum field theory.
* 2001 Evgenii Ivashkevich  ([[JINR]], Russia): for a series of works on analytical methods in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
* 2005 [[Aurélien Barrau]] (the Laboratory of sub-atomic physics and cosmology and [[Joseph Fourier University]], Grenoble, France): for a series of works on astrophysics and cosmology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6400">'''COSMIC''' Functional Size Measurement is a method to measure a standard functional size of a piece of software

'''COSMIC''' may also refer to the Common Software Measurement International Consortium, a voluntary organization that has developed the method and is still expanding its use to more software domains.

{{TOC right}}

== The COSMIC method ==
The COSMIC method defines the principles, rules and a process for measuring a standard functional size of a piece of software. Functional size is a measure of the amount of functionality provided by the software, completely independent of any technical or quality considerations. The generic principles of functional size are described in the [https://www.iso.org/standard/38931.html ISO/IEC 14143] &lt;ref name="ISO/IEC 14143"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/38931.html |title=ISO/IEC 14143 |author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7  Software and systems engineering |date=2007-02-01 |publisher=International Standards Organization |accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; standard. This method is also an International Standard by itself. The [https://www.iso.org/standard/33899.html COSMIC] &lt;ref name="COSMIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/33899.html |title=ISO/IEC 19761 |author=COSMIC |date=2003-02-19 |publisher=International Standards Organization |accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; standard is the first ''second generation'' implementation of the ISO/IEC 14143 standard. There are also four ''first generation'' implementations:
* ISO/IEC 20926 - [[IFPUG]] function points
* ISO/IEC 20968 - Mk II function points
* ISO/IEC 24570 - Nesma function points
* ISO/IEC 29881 - FiSMA function points

== The method in a nutshell ==
The COSMIC method may be used to size software that is dominated by functionality to maintain data, rather than software that predominantly manipulates data. The method can be used in a wide variety of domains, like business applications, real-time software&lt;ref name="real-time"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mathworks.com/videos/design-of-a-functional-size-measurement-tool-for-real-time-embedded-software-requirements-expressed-using-a-simulink-model-92928.html |title=Design of an FSM-tool for real-time embedded software requirements |author=Olivier Guetta, Boubker Bouzid and Jori Le-Bihan (Renault) |date=2012-04-17 |publisher=Mathwork |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, mobile apps&lt;ref name="mobile"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7000068/ |title=Measure the Functional Size of a Mobile App: Using the COSMIC Functional Size Measurement Method |author=Harold van Heeringen and Edwin van Gorp |date=2015-01-05 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, infrastructure software and operating systems. The method translates the [[functional requirements|Functional User Requirements]] of the software to four types of base functional components:
* Entry (E)
* Exit (X)
* Read (R)
* Write (W)

A public domain version of the COSMIC Measurement Manual and other technical reports, including translations into other languages can be found at the Knowledge base of [http://cosmic-sizing.org www.cosmic-sizing.org].

== The method structure ==
The foundation of the method is the ISO/IEC 19761 standard, which contains the definitions and basic principles of the method.
The detailed guidelines of the method are laid down in a [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/measurement-manual-v4-0-2/ Measurement Manual] that is independent of any software domain. For different domains underlying guidelines are available:
* [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/guideline-sizing-real-time-software/ Real-time software]
* [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/guideline-sizing-business-application-software-2/ Business Application software]
* [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/guideline-for-sizing-service-oriented-architecture-software/ Service Oriented software]
* [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/guideline-for-sizing-data-warehouse-application-software-2/ Data Warehouse software]

To explain the use of the method a number of case studies have been developed:
* Real-time - [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/automatic-line-switching-2/ Automatic line switching]
* Real-time - [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/3208/ Valve control]
* Real-time - [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/rice-cooker-case-study-v2-0/ Rice cooker]

* Business - [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/course-registration-c-reg-system-case-study/ Course registration]
* Business - [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/web-advice-module/ Web advice module]

== The organization behind the method ==
The COSMIC organization commenced its work in 1998. Legally COSMIC is an incorporated not for profit organization under Canadian law. The organization grew informally to a global community of professionals. COSMIC is an open and democratic organization. The organization relies and will continue to rely on unpaid efforts by volunteers, who work on various aspects of the method, based on their professional interest.

== Second generation ==
The first generation Functional Size Measurement methods consisted of rules that are based on empirical results. Some define their own terminology, which may have overlap with other terms in software engineering. They work well for the software domains the rules were designed for, but for other domains, the rules need to be altered or extended. Key elements of a second generation Functional Size Measurement method are:
* Adoption of all measurement concepts from the ISO metrology
* A defined measurement unit
* Fully compliant with ISO/IEC 14143
* Preferably domain independent
The COSMIC method is based on principles rather than rules that are domain independent. The principles of the method are based on fundamental software engineering principles, which have been subsequently tested in practice.&lt;ref name="field trials"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittoday.info/Articles/COSMIC_FPP/COSMIC_FPP.htm |title=COSMIC Full Function Points (FFP) and the Worldwide Field Trials Strategy |author=Alain Abran, Serge Oligny, and Charles Symons |date=2011 |publisher=Auerbach publications |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colin Crouch''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (born 1944) is an English [[Sociology|sociologist]] and [[Political science|political scientist]]. He coined the [[post-democracy]] concept in 2000 in his book ''[[Coping with Post-Democracy]]''. Colin Crouch is currently Emeritus Professor at the [[University of Warwick]] and an External Scientific Member of the [[Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies]].

== Biography ==
Crouch gained his BA at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] and his doctorate at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]]. In 1969, Crouch started as a lecturer in sociology at the London School of Economics.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.debretts.co.uk/people/biographies/browse/c/8264/Colin%20John%20CROUCH.aspx Prof. Colin Crouch's biography] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131208135859/http://www.debretts.co.uk/people/biographies/browse/c/8264/Colin%20John%20CROUCH.aspx |date=8 December 2013 }} on Debrett's site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;
From 1972 to 1973 he was a Lecturer at the [[University of Bath]]. From 1973 to 1985 he was Lecturer and Reader in Sociology at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]]. Then, from 1985 to 1994 he was a Fellow of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], and Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=MPI&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gesellschaftsforschung |first1=Max-Planck-Institut für |title=MPIfG - Researchers - Emeritus Professor Colin Crouch |url=http://www.mpifg.de/forschung/wissdetails_en.asp?MitarbID=90 |website=www.mpifg.de |accessdate=26 August 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 to 2000 he was curator of their [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; From 1995 to 2004 he was Professor of Sociology and chaired the department of Political Science at the [[European University Institute]] of [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; From 2005 until 2011 he was Professor of Governance and Public Management at [[Warwick Business School]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In 2005, he was elected fellow of the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/users/professor-colin-crouch Professor Colin Crouch] on the British Academy's website&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 he has been Emeritus Professor at the International Centre for Governance and Public Management, [[Warwick Business School]], [[University of Warwick]].

==Post Democracy==

Crouch coined the term "[[post-democracy]]" in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that are conducted by fully operating [[Democracy|democratic system]]s (elections are being held, governments fall and there is [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is making the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;Colin Crouch. [http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''. The term appeared to define a running evolution within democracies during the 21st century and is [[polemic]]al because it calls attention to recognized democracies losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The '''Corning Museum of Glass''' is a [[museum]] in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]] dedicated to the art, history and science of [[glass]]. It was founded in 1951 by [[Corning Incorporated|Corning Glass Works]] and currently has a collection of more than 45,000 glass objects, some over 3,500 years old.&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us: Corning Museum of Glass|url=http://www.cmog.org/about#.UUNVGhycd8E|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1951 by Corning Glass Works (now [[Corning Incorporated]]) as a gift to the nation for the company’s 100th anniversary, the Corning Museum of Glass is a not-for-profit museum dedicated to telling the story of a single material: glass. [[Thomas S. Buechner]], who would later become director of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the founding director of the glass museum, serving in the post from 1951 to 1960 and again from 1973 to 1980.

=== Growth and renovations ===
[[File:CorningGlassTower.jpg|thumb|250px|Tower sculpture consisting of 600 glass bowls]]
The original Museum and library were housed in a low, glass-walled building designed by [[Harrison &amp; Abramovitz]] in 1951. By 1978, the Museum had outgrown its space.  [[Gunnar Birkerts]] designed a new addition, creating a flowing series of galleries with the library at their core, linked to the old building via light-filled, windowed ramps. With memories of the 1972 hurricane still fresh (see Flood Damage), the new galleries were raised high above the flood line on concrete pillars. The new Museum opened to the public on May 28, 1980, exactly 29 years after its first opening.

By the early 1990s, the Corning Museum of Glass was once more overflowing its exhibition space, and increasing visitation put a strain on guest facilities. In 1996, the Museum embarked upon the first phase of a planned five-year, $65 million transformation. Under the directorship of Dr. [[David Whitehouse]], the first element to be added was The Studio. This state-of-the-art teaching facility for glassblowing and coldworking opened for classes in 1996.

Architects Smith-Miller + Hawkinson designed an addition to the main Museum building, using glass wherever possible to convey the beauty and elegance of the art form in the building itself. The Museum's renovation was completed in 2001, and included a new visitors' center, Sculpture Gallery, (now the Contemporary Glass Gallery), Hot Glass Show demonstration stage and a hands-on Innovation Center with exhibitions designed by [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]]. A redesigned 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) GlassMarket, one of the largest Museum shops in the country, filled the entire first floor of the museum. The Rakow Library was relocated to new quarters across the Museum campus.

Over the past decade, the Museum’s collection, programs, and global impact have grown significantly. At the beginning of 2012, the Museum announced a $64 million expansion project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/52558/corning-museum-of-glass-thomas-phifer-and-partners-expansion/ |title=Largest Contemporary Glass Museum to Open in Upstate NY |publisher=Hyperallergic.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[Thomas Phifer]], to expand contemporary gallery and Hot Glass Show space. The new contemporary wing is slated to open in March 2015.&lt;ref name=june2012pr&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterbenk|first=Yvette|title=Corning Museum of Glass Unveils Plans for $64 Million Expansion|url=https://news.yahoo.com/corning-museum-glass-unveils-plans-64-million-expansion-110345959.html|work=June 6, 2012|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2015/01/25/cmog-contemporary-glass/22313897/ |title=Corning glass museum acquires new contemporary pieces |publisher=Stargazette.com |date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Cornings-glass-museum-acquires-contemporary-works-for-new-wing/36817 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flood damage ===
In June 1972, disaster struck as [[Hurricane Agnes]] emptied a week's worth of rain into the surrounding Chemung River Valley. On June 23, the Chemung River overflowed its banks and poured five feet four inches of floodwater into the Museum. When the waters receded, staff members found glass objects tumbled in their cases and crusted with mud, the library's books swollen with water. The case holding 600 rare books tipped over, and the books were covered by mud and shards of glass panes. Half of the entire Library collection was damaged in the flood. According to Martin and Edwards, 528 of the Museum's 13,000 objects had sustained damage (1977, 11)&lt;ref name="flood"/&gt; At the time, Buechner described the flood as "possibly the greatest single catastrophe borne by an American museum."&lt;ref name="flood"/&gt;  Conservation was an immediate concern and staff moved quickly to freeze the flooded materials. Museum staff members, under the directorship of  [[Robert H. Brill]] were faced with the tremendous task of restoration: every glass object had to be meticulously cleaned and restored, while the library's contents had to be cleaned and dried page by page, slide by slide, even before being assessed for rebinding, restoration, or replacement.&lt;ref name=flood&gt;{{cite book|title=The Corning Flood: Museum Under Water|year=1977|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|location=Corning, New York|isbn=087290-063-0|page=60|url=http://www.cmog.org/sites/default/files/collections/FF/FFAE9039-62D0-4450-A0ED-ACE0BD397297.pdf|editor=Martin, John H.|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the extensive recovery efforts, the Library occupied an abandoned Acme grocery store across the street from the Museum. Altogether, staff and volunteers dried, cleaned, and restored over 7,000 water-logged, frozen books over the next 2 years. The rare books were sent to Carolyn Horton, a leading restoration expert, who disassembled, washed, deacidified and rebound them. On August 1, 1972, the Museum reopened with restoration work still underway.

== The Glass Collection ==
=== Galleries ===
The Museum's Glass Collection showcases more than 35 centuries of glass artistry. The Museum's collection of contemporary artworks includes pieces by significant artists such as [[Klaus Moje]], [[Karen LaMonte]], [[Bruno Pedrosa]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Libenský / Brychtová]] and [[Josiah McElheny]]. The Glass Collection Galleries show the most comprehensive and celebrated glass collection in the world. The galleries explore Near Eastern, Asian, European, and American glass and glassmaking from antiquity through present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Lawrence|first=Lee|date=August 9, 2011|title=Art, technology, design, crisscrossing the globe [exhibition review]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303544604576429774286392838 | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tell the story of glass creation, from a full-scale model of an Egyptian furnace, to the grand factories of Europe, to the small-scale furnaces that fueled the Studio Glass movement that began in America in 1962. The galleries contain objects representing every country and historical period in which glassmaking has been practiced. The galleries include: Glass in Nature, Origins of Glassmaking, Glass of the Romans, Glass in the Islamic World, Early Northern European Glass, The Rise of Venetian Glassmaking, Glass in 17th-19th Century Europe, 19th Century European Glass, Asian Glass, Glass in America, Corning: From Farm Town to “Crystal City,” Paperweights of the World and Modern Glass.

In addition to these galleries, there is the Jerome and Lucille Strauss Study Gallery, Frederick Carder Gallery and Ben W. Heineman Sr. Gallery of Contemporary Glass. The Study Gallery is filled with a wide range of objects from all periods. The gallery is named after Museum benefactors Jerome and Lucille Strauss, who, by gift and bequest, provided the Museum with an unparalleled collection of 2,400 drinking glasses dating from ancient to modern times. The Frederick Carder Gallery features an extensive collection of glass designed by [[Frederick Carder]] (1863–1963), a gifted English designer who managed Steuben Glass Works from its founding in 1903 until 1932. During this time, the production of Steuben changed from various types of colored glass to colorless glass.

The Museum’s gallery of contemporary glass focuses on vessels, objects, sculptures, and installations made by international artists over the last 25 years. The purpose of the gallery is to show the different ways in which glass is used as a medium for contemporary art. The gallery is named for the Ben W. Heineman Sr. family, who donated a major collection of contemporary glass to the Museum in 2005.

=== Exhibitions ===
The Corning Museum of Glass offers exhibitions year-round. Past exhibitions have included: [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/medieval-glass#.UUMv4xycd8E Medieval Glass for Popes, Princes and Peasants], [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/east-meets-west-cross-cultural-influences-glassmaking-18th-and-19th-centuries#.UUMwDhycd8E East Meets West: Cross-Cultural Influences in Glassmaking in the 18th and 19th Centuries] and [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/mirror-to-discovery#.UUMwQhycd8E Mirror to Discovery: The 200-Inch Disk and the Hale Reflecting Telescope at Palomar].

Section: Arts Beat. &lt;http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/museum-of-glass-to-get-new-wing/&gt;. Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hot Glass Show is offered all day, every day and is included in the cost of admission. At each demonstration, the glassmaker takes a glob of molten glass and shapes the globs into vases, bowls, or sculptures. Throughout the demonstration, a narrator describes the process, and cameras give viewers a close-up look into the furnaces where the glass is heated. The show gives viewers a look into an ancient Roman technique that is still used today for glass making. Each show lasts between 20–40 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Details glass blowing in Corning, N.Y. November 18, 2001. Washington Post. Accessed on LexisNexis. http://www.lexisnexis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hot Glass Roadshow =====
The Museum takes the Hot Glass Show on the road, bringing the unique demonstration to the public, designers, and other museums. The Museum uses unique equipment in order to recreate the state-of-the-art studio environment. The Hot Glass Roadshow travels internationally.&lt;ref&gt;“High Museum of Art Presents the Hot Glass Roadshow.” (2012, Aug. 28). High Museum of Art: Press Release. &lt; http://www.high.org/Press/Press-Releases/2012/August/Hot-Glass-Roadshow.aspx&gt;. Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== At sea =====
The demonstration is also presented on Celebrity cruise ships, such as Celebrity Solstice, Celebrity Equinox, and Celebrity Eclipse. Each cruise ship has a hotshop on the top deck where the Museum’s glassmakers present their live glassmaking demonstrations. The demos reach more than 300,000 people each year, and the ships visit ports around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrity eclipse launch: these pros are a glass act. Washington Post. April 30, 2010. Travel Trade Gazette UK &amp; Ireland http://business.highbeam.com/409990/article-1G1-225419675/celebrity-eclipse-launch-these-pros-glass-act&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flameworking Demonstration ====
The demo is a live, 15-minute narrated demonstration of glassworking at a 5,000 degree Fahrenheit gas- and oxygen-powered torch. The show is also included in the cost of admission, and is offered throughout the day in the Museum’s Glass Innovation Center. During the show, the glassmaker melts rods and tubes of glass to shape them into a variety of shapes from animals, beads, ornaments, sculptures and vessels. The [[flameworking]] technique is an ancient glass making technique, which is demonstrated at the Museum.

==== Optical Fiber Demo ====
The Optical Fiber Demo explains how thin threads of glass can carry enormous amounts of digital information and power our high-speed information age. The demo lasts about 15 minutes, is offered every day, and is included in the cost of admission. The demonstration takes place in the museum’s Glass Innovation Center. Demonstrators show how light can be used for communication, how glass can accurately carry light signals, what glass composition will carry light signals most clearly, and how optical fiber provides us with the massive amounts of bandwidth necessary for today’s world. The presentation begins with a discussion of how man has been using light to communicate for centuries. It continues with a demonstration of total internal reflection – the basic principle behind optical fiber. In the mid-1800s, Daniel Colladon, a Swiss scientist, explained how total internal reflection allowed light to be directed along a very specific path with lively visible demonstrations that showed light following the path of a stream of falling water. Total internal reflection traps the light in the stream, and traps it the same way in a glass fiber.

==== Glassbreaking Demo ====
The demonstration is a 15-minute demo that explores how glass breaks and why. Demonstrators show how glass can become stronger or weaker depending on how it is heated or cooled; demonstrators explain how this phenomenon affects the way it breaks. The demonstration takes place in the Windows Gallery of the Museum’s Innovation Center and the demo is included in the cost of admission.

=== The Studio ===

It was primarily influential not because of any great technical leaps, but rather because it was so successful for Schlumberger's oil divisions and because it was one of the few success stories of the AI bubble to receive wide publicity before the [[AI winter]].

The AI rules of the Dipmeter Advisor were primarily derived from Al Gilreath, a Schlumberger interpretation engineer who developed the "red, green, blue" pattern method of dipmeter interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEp1SmQqiWQC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60|title=Geological Well Logs: Their use in Reservoir Modeling|author=Stefan M. Luthi, retrieved July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately this method had limited application in more complex geological environments outside the Gulf Coast, and the Dipmeter Advisor was primarily used within Schlumberger as a graphical display tool to assist interpretation by trained geoscientists, rather than as an AI tool for use by novice interpreters. However, the tool pioneered a new approach to workstation-assisted graphical interpretation of geological information.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6568">'''Eliezer (Lazer) ben Elijah Ashkenazi''' (1512–December 13, 1585) ({{lang-he|אליעזר בן אליהו אשכנזי}}) was a [[Talmud]]ist, [[rabbi]], physician, and many-sided scholar. Though of a [[Jews of Germany|German]] family (according to some, the relative of [[Joseph Colon]]; see [[Marco Mortara]], ''Indice Alfabetico,'' s.v.), he was probably born in the [[Levant]], and received his Talmudic education under [[Joseph Taitazak]] in [[Salonica]]. Ashkenazi first became rabbi in [[Egypt]] 1538-60, probably at [[Fostat]], where, by his learning and wealth, he became widely known. Compelled by circumstances—doubtless of a political nature—to leave Egypt, he went to [[Cyprus]], remaining there for two years as rabbi at [[Famagusta]].

A desire to visit foreign lands and to observe foreign peoples impelled him to give up this position and to travel. He went first to [[Venice]], but a disagreement with the rabbis [[Meïr Padua]] and his son [[Judah Katzenellenbogen]] caused him to leave the city and in the same year to take up his residence at [[Prague]] (1561). Here—either because he was a rabbi, or, at all events, because he was a leading authority—his was the first signature appended to the constitution of the burial society of the congregation. After leaving [[Bohemia]] and proceeding eastward as far as the [[Crimea]], Ashkenazi returned to [[Italy]], not before 1570. While rabbi of [[Cremona]] he published there (1576) his work, ''Yosef Lekah'' (Increases Learning; compare [[Prov.]] i. 5), dedicated to Joseph Nasi, duke of Naxos, which was several times reprinted. Four years later he was again in eastern Europe, as rabbi of [[Poznań|Posen]]. In 1584 he left that city to take up his abode in Cracow, where he died on December 13, 1585.

== Works ==
Ashkenazi's printed works are as follows: 
* ''Yosef LekaḦ''  A commentary on the [[Book of Esther]]
* ''Ma'ase ha-Shem'' (The Works of God; Venice, 1583; several other editions), a commentary on the historical portions of the [[Pentateuch]], written for the instruction of his son Elijah, and containing also a complete commentary on the [[Passover Haggadah]], which has frequently been published separately
* Eight "[[selihot]]" (penitential prayers), included in the Bohemian liturgy
* A "tokahah" (homily), published by his son.
* His supercommentary to [[Nahmanides]], and his critical marginal notes—said to number one thousand—on [[Joseph Caro]]'s ''Bet Yosef,'' have not been preserved.

== His individuality ==
Ashkenazi's personality was an extraordinary one. He may be called the last survivor of a most brilliant epoch in the history of the [[Sephardim]].  Although educated by a [[kabalist]], and a fellow-pupil of [[Moses Alshech]], yet he was a student—if not a deep one—of philosophy and physics. As a [[Talmudist]], such men as [[Joseph Caro]], [[Moses Isserles]], and [[Solomon Luria]] considered him of equal authority with themselves; however, when the rabbinical decisions of earlier rabbis ran counter to his own judgment, he never sought a sophistical justification for them, as was then the custom, especially in Poland.

Valuable material for a correct estimate of Ashkenazi may be found in several of his decisions preserved in the [[responsa]] literature of the time. In [[Venice]] he decided that a man could be forced to a divorce, if, by immoral conduct, he had incurred his wife's aversion (Isserles, Responsa, No. 96). It was likely this decision which brought upon him the opposition of the above-mentioned Venetian rabbis, though he was connected with them, for Ashkenazi's son was [[Katzenellenbogen]]'s son-in-law. From the standpoint of strict Talmudic interpretation, Ashkenazi's opponents were in the right, since his sentence contravened that of the [[Tosafists]], who for the German-Italian Jews constituted, as it were, a court of last resort.

== Controversies with Polish rabbis ==
It appears that Ashkenazi's fierce confidence and independence led to clashes with the rabbinic establishment in Poland. The following occurrence is one such instance: The "[[Rosh yeshiva|rashei yeshivot]]" (heads of academies) had forbidden their pupils to establish a rival academy in close proximity to their own. Ashkenazi declined to assent to this resolution, even when requested in the name of [[Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon]] ha-Kohen, the "rosh yeshibah" at [[Cracow]]. In a letter to the latter he claimed that, although the decision of the Polish [[rabbis]] was based upon the authority of [[Maimonides]], he considered it unsupported by Talmudic literature and therefore deemed it as needlessly discouraging religious instruction. Ashkenazi even went so far as to question if indeed a great scholar like the rabbi of Cracow had truly requested this at all! Here too, despite the great respect shown Ashkenazi in his reply, the rabbi of Cracow responded forcefully at length, vindicating Maimonides' standpoint by erudite and astute references to the [[Talmud]] (Joseph b. Mordecai Gershon, ''She'erit Yosef,'' No. 19). Consequently, [[J. S. del Medigo]] is quoted as saying that although Ashkenazi lived and taught in Poland in his later years his work was largely unknown to Polish Jews for "his way was hidden from them, and they did not fully understand his views nor his lofty ideas" (Nobeloth Hokhmah, Samuel b. Judah Loeb Ashkenazi, Basilia 1631, p. 46a).

Ashkenazi's wife, Rachel, died at Cracow April 3, 1593. Her epitaph, still extant, bears witness to her piety and benevolence (''Monatsschrift,'' xliv. 360). His son Elijah published the liturgic collection, ''Zibhe Shelamim,'' and wrote a short elegy on his father, which was used as the latter's epitaph.

[[File:Cat fall 150x300 6fps.gif|thumb|upright|right|250px|A falling cat modeled as two independently rotating parts turns around while maintaining zero net angular momentum]]

The '''falling cat problem''' is a problem that consists of explaining the underlying [[physics]] behind the observation of the [[cat righting reflex]]: that is, how a free-falling body ([[cat]]) can change its orientation such that it is able to right itself as it falls to land on its feet, irrespective of its initial orientation, and without violating the law of [[conservation of angular momentum]].

Although amusing and trivial to pose, the solution of the problem is not as straightforward as its statement would suggest. The apparent contradiction with the law of conservation of angular momentum is resolved because the cat is not a [[rigid body]], but instead is permitted to change its shape during the fall owing to the cat's flexible [[vertebral column|backbone]] and non-functional [[collar-bone]]. The behavior of the cat is thus typical of the mechanics of [[deformable bodies]].

==History==
The falling cat problem has elicited interest from famous scientists including [[George Gabriel Stokes]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]. In a letter to his wife, Katherine Mary Clerk Maxwell, Maxwell wrote, "There is a tradition in Trinity that when I was here I discovered a method of throwing a cat so as not to light on its feet, and that I used to throw cats out of windows. I had to explain that the proper object of research was to find how quick the cat would turn round, and that the proper method was to let the cat drop on a table or bed from about two inches, and that even then the cat lights on her feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Lewis|last2=Garnett|first2=William|title=The Life of James Clerk Maxwell|publisher=Macmillan and Company|isbn=978-1402161377|page=499|date=1999-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's and other scientists interest with so-called "cat turning" was reputed to have caused the death of many cats after being dropped from windows of multi-storied buildings.{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}} Maxwell in particular was interested in discovering the precise height that a cat needed to be dropped from so that the cat would be incapable of using [[cat righting reflex|its righting reflex]] to land on its feet, an endeavor in which he eventually succeeded.

Whereas the cat-falling problem was regarded as a mere curiosity by Maxwell, Stokes, and others, a more rigorous study of the problem was conducted by [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] who applied [[chronophotography]] to capture the cat's descent on film using a chronophotographic gun. The gun, capable of capturing 12 frames per second, produced images from which Marey deduced that, as the cat had no [[rotational motion]] at the start of its descent, the cat was not "cheating" by using the cat handler's hand as a [[Lever|fulcrum]]. This in itself posed a problem as it implied that it was possible for a body in free fall to acquire angular momentum. Marey also showed that [[air resistance]] played no role in facilitating the righting of the cat's body.

[[File:Falling cat 1894.jpg|thumb|310px|left|''[[Falling Cat]]'' – images which appeared in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1894, captured by a chronophotographic gun, a device of [[Étienne-Jules Marey|Marey's]] own invention. The editor of ''Nature'' wrote, "The expression of offended dignity shown by the cat at the end of the first series indicates a want of interest in scientific investigation."]]

His investigations were subsequently published in ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes Rendus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marey|first1=É.J|title=Des mouvements que certains animaux exécutent pour retomber sur leurs pieds, lorsqu'ils sont précipités d'un lieu élevé|date=1894|volume=119|pages=714–717|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a summary of his findings were published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Photographs of a tumbling cat|journal=Nature|date=1894|volume=51|issue=1308|pages=80–81|bibcode = 1894Natur..51...80. |doi = 10.1038/051080a0 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 June 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The article's summary in ''Nature'' appeared thus:

{{Quotation| M. Marey thinks that it is the inertia of its own mass that the cat uses to right itself. The torsion couple which produces the action of the muscles of the vertebra acts at first on the forelegs which have a very small motion of inertia on account of the front feet being foreshortened and pressed against the neck. The hind legs, however, being stretched out and almost perpendicular to the axis of the body, possesses a moment of inertia which opposes motion in the opposite direction to that which the torsion couple tends to produce. In the second phase of the action, the attitude of the feet is reversed, and it is the inertia of the forepart that furnishes a fulcrum for the rotation of the rear.}}

Despite the publication of the images, many physicists at the time maintained that the cat was still "cheating" by using the handler's hand from its starting position to right itself, as the cat's motion would otherwise seem to imply a [[rigid body]] acquiring angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Donald|title=How does a cat fall on its feet?|agency=The New Scientist|date=30 June 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==
The solution of the problem, originally due to {{Harvp|Kane|Scher|1969}}, models the cat as a pair of cylinders (the front and back halves of the cat) capable of changing their relative orientations. {{harvtxt|Montgomery|1993}} later described the Kane&amp;ndash;Scher model in terms of a [[connection (principal bundle)|connection]] in the configuration space that encapsulates the relative motions of the two parts of the cat permitted by the physics.  Framed in this way, the dynamics of the falling cat problem is a prototypical example of a [[nonholonomic system]] {{harv|Batterman|2003}}, the study of which is among the central preoccupations of [[control theory]].  A solution of the falling cat problem is a curve in the configuration space that is ''horizontal'' with respect to the connection (that is, it is admissible by the physics) with prescribed initial and final configurations.  Finding an optimal solution is an example of optimal [[motion planning]] ({{harvnb|Arbyan|Tsai|1998}}; {{harvnb|Ge|Chen|2007}}).

In the language of physics, Montgomery's connection is a certain [[Yang-Mills field]] on the configuration space, and is a special case of a more general approach to the dynamics of deformable bodies as represented by [[gauge field]]s ({{harvnb|Montgomery|1993}}; {{harvnb|Batterman|2003}}), following the work of {{Harvp|Shapere|Wilczek|1987}}.

[[Image:Fillet.jpg|thumb|200px|Example of a non-filleted pole (left) and a filleted pole (right)]]
[[Image:Fillet.png|thumb|200px|It is common to find a fillet where two parts are [[welding|welded]] together]]

In [[mechanical engineering]], a '''fillet''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|ᵻ|t}} is a rounding of an interior or exterior corner of a part design. An interior or exterior corner, with an angle or type of bevel, is called a "[[chamfer]]". Fillet geometry, when on an interior corner is a line of [[concave function]], whereas a fillet on an exterior corner is a line of [[convex function]] (in these cases, fillets are typically referred to as rounds). Fillets commonly appear on welded, soldered, or brazed joints.

==Applications==
* [[Stress concentration]] is a problem of load-bearing mechanical parts which is reduced by employing fillets on points and lines of expected high stress. The fillets distribute the stress over a broader area and effectively make the parts more durable and capable of bearing larger loads.
* For considerations in [[aerodynamics]], fillets are employed to reduce [[interference drag]] where aircraft components such as wings, struts, and other surfaces meet one another.
* For manufacturing, concave corners are sometimes filleted to allow the use of round-tipped [[end mill]]s to cut out an area of a material. This has a ''cycle time'' benefit if the round mill is simultaneously being used to mill complex curved surfaces.
* Radii are used to eliminate sharp edges that can be easily damaged or that can cause injury when the part is handled.&lt;ref&gt;Visualization, modeling, and graphics for engineering design
 By Dennis Kenmon Lieu, Sheryl Sorby, Page 6-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design process==
Fillets can be quickly designed onto parts using [[Solid modeling|3D solid modeling]] engineering [[CAD software]] by invoking the function and picking edges of interest. Smooth edges connecting two simple flat features are generally simple for a computer to create and fast for a human user to specify. Once these features are included in the CAD design of a part, they are often manufactured automatically using [[cnc|computer-numerical control]].

==Terminology==
Different design packages use different names for the same operations.
* [[Autodesk Inventor]], [[AutoCAD]], [[CATIA]], [[FreeCAD]], [[Solidworks]] and Vectorworks refer to both concave and convex rounded edges as ''fillets'', while referring to angled cuts of edges and concave corners as ''chamfers''.
* [[CADKEY]] and [[Unigraphics]] refer to concave and convex rounded edges as ''blends''.
* [[PTC Creo Elements/Pro]] (formerly ''Pro/Engineer'') refers to rounded edges simply as ''rounds''.

Other 3D solid modeling software programs outside of engineering, such as [[gameSpace]], have similar functions.

'''Forensic entomology''' is the scientific study of the invasion of the succession pattern of [[arthropods]] with their developmental stages of different species found on the decomposed cadavers during legal investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verma K, Paul R | title= ''Lucilia sericata'' (Meigen) and ''Chrysomya megacephala'' (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) Development Rate and its Implications for Forensic Entomology | journal= J Forensic Sci Med | year=2016 | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=146–150 | doi=10.4103/2349-5014.191466}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the application and study of [[insect]] and other [[arthropod]] biology to criminal matters. It also involves the application of the study of arthropods, including insects, arachnids, centipedes, millipedes, and crustaceans to criminal or legal cases. It is primarily associated with death investigations; however, it may also be used to detect drugs and poisons, determine the location of an incident, and find the presence and time of the infliction of wounds. Forensic [[entomology]] can be divided into three subfields: [[Forensic entomology#Urban forensic entomology|urban]], [[Home stored product entomology|stored-product]] and [[Forensic entomology#Medico-legal forensic entomology|medico-legal/medico-criminal]] entomology.

==History==
Historically, there have been several accounts of applications for, and experimentation with, forensic entomology. The concept of forensic entomology dates back to at least the 13th century. However, only in the last 30 years has forensic entomology been systematically explored as a feasible source for evidence in [[criminal investigation]]s. Through their own experiments and interest in arthropods and death, [[Sung Tzu]], [[Francesco Redi]], [[Louis François Etienne Bergeret|Bergeret d’Arbois]], [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]] and the physiologist [[Hermann Reinhard]] have helped to lay the foundations for today's modern forensic entomology.

===Song Ci===
The Song Dynasty (960–1279) [[forensic science]] book ''[[Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified]]'' published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer [[Song Ci]] in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"&gt;Haskell (2006), 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In a murder case of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a [[sickle]]; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; The local magistrate had the villagers assemble in the town square where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; Within minutes, a mass of [[Blow-fly|blow flies]] gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of [[blood]] unseen by the naked eye.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt;

Song Ci (sometimes referred to as Sung Tzu) was a judicial intendant who lived in China 1188-1251 AD. In 1247 AD Song Ci wrote a book entitled ''[[Washing Away of Wrongs]]'' as a handbook for coroners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=T'and-Yin-Pi-Shih: Parallel cases from under the pear-tree | author=R.H. van Gulik | authorlink=Robert van Gulik | edition=reprint | publisher=Gibson Press | origyear=1956| year=2004 | isbn=0-88355-908-0 | page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book Song Ci depicts several cases in which he took notes on how a person died and elaborates on probable causes. He explains in detail on how to examine a corpse both before and after burial. He also explains the process of how to determine a probable cause of death. The main purpose of this book was to be used as a guide for other investigators so they could assess the scene of the crime effectively. His level of detail in explaining what he observed in all his cases laid down the fundamentals for modern forensic entomologists and is the first recorded account in history of someone using forensic entomology for judicial means.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tz’u., B.E. Mc Knight 1981, The Washing Away Of Wrongs, Center for Chinese Studies The University of Michigan, Pages 1-34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francesco Redi===
{{further|Francesco Redi}}
In 1668, Italian physician Francesco Redi disproved the theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. The accepted theory of Redi's day claimed that [[maggots]] developed spontaneously from rotting meat. In an experiment, he used samples of rotting meat that were either fully exposed to the air, partially exposed to the air, or not exposed to air at all. Redi showed that both fully and partially exposed rotting meat developed fly [[maggots]], whereas rotting meat that was not exposed to air did not develop maggots. This discovery completely changed the way people viewed the decomposition of organisms and prompted further investigations into insect life cycles and into entomology in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://microbes.historique.net/history2.html | title=A History of Microbiology | publisher=Historique.net | date=30 April 2003 | accessdate=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bergeret d'Arbois===
Dr. [[Louis François Etienne Bergeret]] (1814–1893) was a French hospital physician, and was the first to apply forensic entomology to a case. In a case report published in 1855 he stated a general life cycle for insects and made many assumptions about their mating habits. Nevertheless, these assumptions led him to the first application of forensic entomology in an estimation of [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI). His report used forensic entomology as tool to prove his hypothesis on how and when the person had died.&lt;ref name=Benecke&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benecke M. | title=A brief history of forensic entomology | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2001 | volume=120 | issue=1–2 | pages=2–14 | pmid=11457602  | doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00409-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermann Reinhard===
The first systematic study in forensic entomology was conducted in 1881 by [[Hermann Reinhard]], a German medical doctor who played a vital role in the history of forensic entomology. He exhumed many bodies and demonstrated that the development of many different types of insect species could be tied to buried bodies. Reinhard conducted his first study in east Germany, and collected many [[Phoridae|Phorid flies]] from this initial study. He also concluded that the development of only some of the insects living with corpses underground were associated with them, since there were 15-year-old beetles who had little direct contact with them. Reinhard's works and studies were used extensively in further forensic entomology studies.

===Jean Pierre Mégnin===
{{further|Jean Pierre Mégnin}}
French veterinarian and entomologist  Jean Pierre Mégnin (1828–1905), published many articles and books on various subjects including the books ''Faune des Tombeaux'' and ''La Faune des Cadavres'', which are considered to be among the most important forensic entomology books in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klotzbach H, Krettek R | title=The history of forensic entomology in German-speaking countries | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2004 | volume=144 | issue=2–3 | pages=259–263 | pmid=15364399  | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.04.062|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second book he did revolutionary work on the theory of predictable waves, or successions of insects onto corpses. By counting numbers of live and dead mites that developed every 15 days and comparing this with his initial count on the infant, he was able to estimate how long that infant was dead.&lt;ref name=Benecke/&gt;

In this book, he asserted that exposed corpses were subject to eight successional waves, whereas buried corpses were only subject to two waves. Mégnin made many great discoveries that helped shed new light on many of the general characteristics of decaying flora and fauna. Mégnin's work and study of the larval and adult forms of insect families found in cadavers sparked the interest of future entomologists and encouraged more research in the link between arthropods and the deceased, and thereby helped to establish the scientific discipline of forensic entomology.

==Forensic entomology subfields==

===Urban forensic entomology===
Urban forensic entomology typically concerns pests infestations in buildings gardens or that may be the basis of litigation between private parties and service providers such as landlords or exterminators.&lt;ref name="Catts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Catts |first=E. P. |authorlink= |author2=Goff, M. L. |date=January 1992| title = Forensic Entomology in Criminal Investigations|journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=37 |issue= |pages=253–272 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.37.010192.001345 |url= |quote=|pmid=1539937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban forensic entomology studies may also indicate the appropriateness of certain pesticide treatments and may also be used in stored products cases where it can help to determine chain of custody, when all points of possible infestation are examined in order to determine who is at fault.&lt;ref&gt;Bledsoe 2008, personal interview&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stored-product forensic entomology===
{{further|Home stored product entomology}}
Stored-product forensic entomology is often used in litigation over insect infestation or contamination of commercially distributed foods.&lt;ref name="Catts"/&gt;

===Medico-legal forensic entomology===
Medicolegal forensic entomology covers evidence gathered through arthropod studies at the scenes of murder, suicide, rape, physical abuse and contraband trafficking.&lt;ref name="Catts" /&gt; In murder investigations it deals with which [[insect]]s eggs appear, their location on the body and in what order they appear. This can be helpful in determining a [[post mortem interval]] (PMI) and location of a [[death]] in question. Since many insects exhibit a degree of [[endemism]] (occurring only in certain places), or have a well-defined [[phenology]] (active only at a certain season, or time of day), their presence in association with other evidence can demonstrate potential links to times and locations where other events may have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;https://peerj.com/articles/3506/?td=wk | Use of necrophagous insects as evidence of cadaver relocation: myth or reality?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eggheadblog.ucdavis.edu/?p=502 |title=Insects help convict killer |accessdate=1 April 2008 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820070919/http://eggheadblog.ucdavis.edu/?p=502 |archivedate=20 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area covered by medicolegal forensic entomology is the relatively new field of [[entomotoxicology]]. This particular branch involves the utilization of entomological specimens found at a scene in order to test for different drugs that may have possibly played a role in the death of the victim.

==Invertebrate types==

===Scorpionflies===

Scorpionflies (order [[Mecoptera]]) were the first insects to arrive at a donated human cadaver observed (by the entomologist Natalie Lindgren) at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility near [[Huntsville, Texas]], and remained on the corpse for one and a half days, outnumbering flies during that period. The presence of scorpionflies thus indicates that a body must be fresh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rutsch |first1=Poncie |title=Finding Crime Clues In What Insects Had For Dinner |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/01/22/379091257/finding-crime-clues-in-what-insects-had-for-dinner |publisher=NPR |accessdate=22 June 2015 |date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~stafs/ |publisher=STAFS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flies===

[[Calliphora latifrons|Flies]] (order [[Diptera]]) are often first on the scene. They prefer a moist corpse for their offspring (maggots) to feed on. The most significant types of fly include:

*Blow flies – Family [[Calliphoridae]]- Flies in this family are often metallic in appearance and between 10 and 14&amp;nbsp;mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as [[Calliphora latifrons|blue bottle fly]], [[cluster fly]], [[Green bottle fly|greenbottle]]s, or [[Protophormia terraenovae|black blowfly]]. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. [[Larva]]e have three stages of development (called [[instars]]); each stage is separated by a molting event. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the [[Neotropics]], and a large number of species in [[Africa]] and Southern [[Europe]]. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Central America]], and in the southern United States. The typical habitat for blow-flies are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, damp soil and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first [[insect]] to come in contact with [[carrion]] because they have the ability to smell death from up to ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/23/flies-murder-natural-history-museum |title=Lord of the flies: the insect detectives |vauthors = Henley J |date=September 23, 2010 |website=The Guardian |publisher= Guardian News and Media Ltd |access-date=November 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarcophaga nodosa.jpg|thumb|220px|Flesh fly on decomposing flesh]]
*Flesh flies – Family [[Sarcophagidae]]- Most flesh flies breed in carrion, dung, garbage, or decaying material, but a few species lay their eggs in the open wounds of mammals; hence their common name. Characteristics of the flesh-fly is its 3-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Most [[holarctic]] Sarcophagidae vary in size from 4 to 18&amp;nbsp;mm in length (Tropical species can be larger) with black and gray longitudinal stripes on the [[thorax]] and checkering on the [[abdomen]]. Flesh-flies, being viviparous, frequently give birth to live young on [[corpses]] of human and other animals, at any stage of decomposition, from newly dead through to bloated or decaying (though the latter is more common).
*[[Housefly|House fly]] – Family [[Muscidae]]- is the most common of all [[flies]] found in homes, and indeed one of the most widely distributed insects; it is often considered a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] that can carry serious diseases. The adults are 6–9&amp;nbsp;mm long. Their [[thorax]] is gray, with four longitudinal dark lines on the back. The underside of their abdomen is yellow, and their whole body is covered with hair.  Each female fly can lay up to 500 eggs in several batches of about 75 to 150 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. Genus ''[[Hydrotaea]]'' are of particular forensic importance.
*Cheese flies – Family [[Piophilidae]] - Most are scavengers in animal products and fungi. The best-known member of the family is ''[[Piophila casei]]''. It is a small fly, about four mm (1/6&amp;nbsp;inch) long, found worldwide. This fly's larva infests cured meats, smoked fish, cheeses, and decaying animals and is sometimes called the cheese skipper for its leaping ability. Forensic entomology uses the presence of Piophila casei larvae to help estimate the date of death for human remains. They do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death. The adult fly's body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly [[iridescent]] and lie flat upon the fly's [[abdomen]] when at rest. At four mm (1/6&amp;nbsp;inch) long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common [[housefly]].
*Coffin flies – [[Phoridae]]
*Lesser corpse flies – [[Sphaeroceridae]]
*Lesser house flies – [[Fanniidae]]
*Black scavenger flies – [[Sepsidae]]
*Sun flies - [[Heleomyzidae]]
*[[Black soldier fly]] - [[Stratiomyidae]] - have potential for use in forensic entomology. The larvae are common [[scavengers]] in compost heaps, are found in association with carrion, can be destructive pests in honey bee hives, and are used in [[manure]] management (for both [[house fly]] control and reduction in manure volume). The larvae range in size from 1/8 to 3/4 of an inch (3 to 19 millimeters). The adult fly is a [[mimic]], very close in size, color, and appearance to the [[organ pipe mud dauber]] wasp and its relatives.
*Phoridae – Humpbacked flies&lt;br /&gt;Larvae feed on decaying bodies. Some species can burrow to a depth of 50&amp;nbsp;cm over 4 days. Important in buried bodies.
*Non-biting midges - [[Chironomidae]] - these flies have a complex life cycle. While adults are terrestrial and phytophagous, larvae are aquatic and detritivorous. Immature instars have been used as forensic markers in several cases where submerged corpses were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, Soriano Hernando Ó, Jiménez Ríos G | title=The Use of the Developmental Rate of the Aquatic Midge ''Chironomus riparius'' (Diptera, Chironomidae) in the Assessment of the Postsubmersion Interval | journal=J. Forensic Sci. | year=2015 | volume=60 | issue=3 | pages=822–826 | doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beetles===

[[Beetle]]s (Order [[Coleoptera]]) are generally found on the corpse when it is more decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley JM, Richards CS, Villet MH, 2010. The utility of Coleoptera in forensic investigations. In: Amendt J, Campobasso CP, Goff ML, Grassberger M, eds. Current concepts in forensic entomology. Heidelberg: Springer, 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt; In drier conditions, the beetles can be replaced by moth flies ([[Psychodidae]]).

*Rove beetles – family [[Staphylinidae]] – are elongate beetles with small [[elytra]] (wing covers) and large jaws. Like other beetles inhabiting carrion, they have fast [[larval]] development with only three larval stages. [[Creophilus]] species are common predators of carrion, and since they are large, are a very visible component of the fauna of corpses. Some adult Staphylinidae are early visitors to a corpse, feeding on larvae of all species of fly, including the later predatory fly larvae. They lay their eggs in the corpse, and the emerging larvae are also predators. Some species have a long development time in the egg, and are common only during the later stages of decomposition. Staphylinids can also tear open the [[pupa]]l cases of flies, to sustain themselves at a corpse for long periods.
*Hister beetles – family [[Histeridae]]. Adult histerids are usually shiny beetles (black or metallic-green) which have an introverted head. The carrion-feeding species only become active at night when they enter the maggot-infested part of the corpse to capture and devour their maggot prey. During daylight they hide under the corpse unless it is sufficiently decayed to enable them to hide inside it. They have fast larval development with only two larval stages. Among the first beetles to arrive at a corpse are Histeridae of the genus ''[[Saprinus]]''. ''Saprinus'' adults feed on both the larvae and pupae of [[blowflies]], although some have a preference for fresh pupae. The adults lay their eggs in the corpse, inhabiting it in the later stages of decay.
*Carrion beetles – family [[Silphidae]]- Adult Silphidae have an average size of about 12&amp;nbsp;mm. They are also referred to as burying beetles because they dig and bury small carcasses underground.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Michelle Pellissier |date=January 1998 |title=The ecology and behavior of burying beetles |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=43 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.595 |pages=595–618 |pmid=15012399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents tend to their young and exhibit communial breeding. The male carrion beetle's job in care is to provide protection for the breed and carcass from competitors.
*Ham beetles – family [[Cleridae]]
*Carcass beetles – family [[Trogidae]]
* Skin/hide beetles – family [[Dermestidae]]. Hide beetles are important in the final stages of decomposition of a carcass. The adults and larvae feed on the dried skin, tendons and bone left by fly larvae. Hide beetles are the only beetle with the enzymes necessary for breaking down [[keratin]], a protein component of hair.
*Scarab beetles – family [[Scarabaeidae]]- Scarab beetles may be any one of around 30,000 beetle species worldwide that are compact, heavy-bodied and oval in shape. The flattened plates, which each antenna terminates, are fitted together to form a club. The outer edges of the front legs may also be toothed or scalloped. Scarab beetles range from {{convert|0.2|to|4.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length. These species are known for being one of the heaviest insect species.&lt;ref&gt;unknown, www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-377894.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sap beetles – family [[Nitidulidae]]

===Mites===

Many [[mite]]s (class [[Acari]], not insects) feed on corpses with ''Macrocheles'' mites common in the early stages of decomposition, while Tyroglyphidae and Oribatidae mites such as Rostrozetes feed on dry skin in the later stages of decomposition.

''[[Nicrophorus]]'' beetles often carry on their bodies the mite ''[[Poecilochirus]]'' which feed on fly eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, González Herrera L, Perotti MA, Jiménez Ríos G | title=Occurrence of ''Poecilochirus austroasiaticus'' (Acari: Parasitidae) in forensic autopsies and its application on postmortem interval estimation | journal=Exp. Appl. Acarol. | year=2013 | volume=59 | issue=3 | pages=297–305 | doi=10.1007/s10493-012-9606-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they arrive at the corpse before any fly eggs hatch into maggots, the first eggs are eaten and maggot development is delayed. This may lead to incorrect PMI estimates. ''Nicrophorus'' beetles find the [[ammonia]] excretions of blowfly maggots toxic, and the ''Poecilochirus'' mites, by keeping the maggot population low, allow ''Nicrophorus'' to occupy the corpse.

===Moths===

[[Moth]]s (order [[Lepidoptera]]) specifically [[clothes-moth]]s – Family [[Tineidae]] – are closely related to [[butterfly|butterflies]]. Most species of moth are [[nocturnal]], but there are [[crepuscular]] and [[Diurnality|diurnal]] species. Moths feed on mammalian hair during their larval stages and may forage on any hair that remains on a body.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} They are amongst the final animals contributing to the decomposition of a corpse.

===Wasps, ants, and bees===

Wasps, ants, and bees (order [[Hymenoptera]]) are not necessarily necrophagous. While some feed on the body, some are also predatory, and eat the insects feeding on the body. [[Bee]]s and [[wasp]]s have been seen feeding on the body during the early stages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This may cause problems for murder cases in which larval flies are used to estimate the post mortem interval since eggs and larvae on the body may have been consumed prior to the arrival on scene of investigators.

==Factors==

===Moisture levels===

Rain and [[humidity]] levels in the area where the body is found can affect the time for insect development. In most species, large amounts of rain will indirectly cause slower development due to drop in temperature. Light rain or a very humid environment, by acting as an insulator, will permit a greater [[core temperature]] within the maggot mass, resulting in faster development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clt.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/112507/fse07_forensic_entomology.pdf "Forensic entomology: use of insects to help solve crimes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119175704/http://www.clt.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/112507/fse07_forensic_entomology.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}.

Current concepts in forensic entomology. Heidelberg: Springer, 109-137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submerged corpses===
M. Lee Goff, a noted and well respected [[forensic entomologist]], was assigned to a case involving the discovery of a decomposing body found on a boat half a mile from shore. Upon collection of the maggot mass, only one insect, ''Chrysomya megacephala'', was discovered. He concluded that the water barrier accounted for the scarcity of other flies. He also noted that flies will not attempt to trek across large bodies of water unless there is a substantially influential attractant.

In addition, the amount of time a maggot mass has been exposed to salt water can affect its development. From the cases Goff observed he found that if subjected for more than 30 minutes, there was a 24‑hour developmental delay. Unfortunately, not many more studies have been conducted and thus a specific amount of delay time is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Goff, M. L 2000"&gt;Goff, M. L. A Fly for the Prosecution. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sun exposure===
"Because insects are cold-blooded animals, their rate of development is more or less dependent on ambient temperature." &lt;ref&gt;Catts, E. P. and N. H. Haskell, eds. ''Entomology &amp; Death: A Procedural Guide''. Joyce's Print Shop, Inc. 1990. p5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bodies exposed to large amounts of sunlight will heat up, giving the insects a warmer area to develop, reducing their development time.
An experiment conducted by Bernard Greenberg and John Charles Kunich with the use of rabbit carcasses to study accumulation of degree days found that with temperature ranging in the mid 70s to high 80s the amount of developmental time for maggots was significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Bernard, and John C. Kunich. Entomology and the Law. United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, bodies found in shaded areas will be cooler, and insects will require longer growth periods. In addition, if temperatures reach extreme levels of cold, insects instinctively know to prolong their development time in order to hatch into a more accepting and viable climate in order to increase the chance of survival and reproduction.

===Air exposure===
Hanged bodies can be expected to show their own quantity and variety of flies. Also, the amount of time flies will stay on a hanged body will vary in comparison to one found on the ground. A hanged body is more exposed to air and thus will dry out faster leaving less food source for the maggots.

As the body begins to decompose, a compilation of fluids will leak to the ground. In this area most of the expected fauna can be found. Also, it is more likely that rove beetles and other non-flying  insects will be found here instead of directly on the body. Fly maggots, initially deposited on the body, may also be found below.&lt;ref name="Goff, M. L 2000"/&gt;

===Geography===
According to [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]]'s book ''La Faune des Cadavres'' there are eight distinct faunal successions attracted to a corpse. While most [[beetle]]s and [[fly|flies]] of forensic importance can be found worldwide, a portion of them are limited to a specific range of habitats. It is forensically important to know the geographical distribution of these insects is order to determine information such as post mortem interval or whether a body has been moved from its original place of death.

[[Calliphoridae]] is arguably the most important family concerning forensic entomology given that they are the first to arrive on the corpse. The family’s habitat ranges into the southern portion of the [[United States]]. However, while ''Chrysomya rufifaces'', the hairy maggot [[Calliphoridae|blow fly]], is part of the family Calliphoridae and is widespread, it is not prevalent in the Southern [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Louisiana]], [[Florida]], or [[Illinois]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Whitworth | first1= Terry |title=Keys to Genera and Species of Blow Flies of America North of Mexico |journal = Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington | volume= 108 |issue=3 |year=2006 |page= 710 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30254115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flesh fly|Flesh flies]] fall under the family Sacrophagidae and generally arrive to a corpse following Calliphoridae. However, as previously mentioned they are capable of flying in the rain. This key advantage enables them to occasionally reach a body before Calliphoridae overall effecting the maggot mass that will be discovered. Flesh flies are globally distributed including habitats in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Thomas. ''Catalog of the Sarcophagidae of the World''. Memoirs on Entomology. Gainesville, FL: Associated, 1996. 288-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetles are representative of the order [[Coleoptera]] which accounts for the largest of the insect orders. Beetles are very adaptive and can be found in almost all environments with the exception of [[Antarctica]] and high mountainous regions. The most diverse beetle fauna can be found in the tropics. In addition, beetles are less submissive to temperatures. Thus, if a carcass has been found in cold temperatures, the beetle will be prevalent over Calliphoridae.

===Weather===
Various weather conditions in a given amount of time cause certain pests to invade human households. This is because the insects are in search of food, water, and shelter.
Damp weather causes reproduction and growth enhancement in many insect types, especially when coupled with warm temperatures. Most pests concerned at this time are [[ant]]s, [[spider]]s, [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, [[cockroach]]es, [[ladybug]]s, [[yellowjacket]]s, [[hornet]]s, [[mouse|mice]], and [[rat]]s.
When conditions are dry, the deprivation of moisture outside drives many pests inside searching for water. While the rainy weather increases the numbers of insects, this dry weather causes pest invasions to increase. The pests most commonly known during dry conditions are [[scorpion]]s, ants, [[pillbug]]s, [[millipede]]s, crickets, and spiders. Extreme drought does kill many populations of insects, but also drives surviving insects to invade more often.
Cold temperatures outside will cause invasions beginning in the late summer months and early fall. [[Box elder bug]]s, [[cluster fly|cluster flies]], ladybugs, and [[silverfish]] are noticed some of the most common insects to seek the warm indoors.&lt;ref name="terminix"&gt;[http://terminix.com/information/weather/ "Pest Control Tips: Pests and Weather"]. ''Terminix.com''. 19 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern techniques==
Many new techniques have been developed &lt;ref&gt;Villet MH, Amendt J, 2011. Advances in entomological methods for estimating time of death. In: Turk EE, ed. Forensic Pathology Reviews. Heidelberg: Humana Press, pp. 213-238&lt;/ref&gt; and are used in order to more accurately [[entomological evidence collection|gather evidence]], or reevaluate old information. The use of these newly developed techniques and evaluations have become relevant in litigation and appeals. Forensic entomology not only uses arthropod biology, but it pulls from other sciences, introducing fields like chemistry and genetics, exploiting their inherent synergy through the [[use of DNA in forensic entomology]].

===Scanning electron microscopy===
Fly larvae and fly eggs are used to aid in the determination of a PMI. In order for the data to be useful the larvae and eggs must be identified down to a species level to get an accurate estimate for the PMI. There are many techniques currently being developed to differentiate between the various species of forensically important insects. A study in 2007 demonstrates a technique that can use [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) to identify key morphological features of eggs and maggots.&lt;ref name="pmid18353656"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendonça PM, dos Santos-Mallet JR, de Mello RP, Gomes L, de Carvalho Queiroz MM | title = Identification of fly eggs using scanning electron microscopy for forensic investigations | journal = Micron | volume = 39 | issue = 7 | pages = 802–7 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18353656 | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2008.01.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the morphological differences that can help identify the different species are the presence/absence of anastomosis, the presence/absence of holes, and the shape and length of the median area.

The SEM method provides an array of morphological features for use in identifying fly eggs; however, this method does have some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that it requires expensive equipment and can take time to identify the species from which the egg originated, so it may not be useful in a field study or to quickly identify a particular egg.&lt;ref name=Sukontason&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sukontason|first1=Kom|last2=Sukontason|first2=Kabkaew L|last3=Piangjai|first3=Somsak|last4=Boonchu|first4=Noppawan|last5=Kurahashi|first5=Hiromu|last6=Hope|first6=Michelle|last7=Olson|first7=Jimmy K|title=Identification of forensically important fly eggs using a potassium permanganate staining technique|journal=Micron|volume=35|issue=5|year=2004|pages=391–395|issn=0968-4328|doi=10.1016/j.micron.2003.12.004|pmid=15006363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SEM method is effective provided there is ample time and the proper equipment and the particular fly eggs are plentiful. The ability to use these morphological differences gives forensic entomologists a powerful tool that can help with estimating a post mortem interval, along with other relevant information, such as whether the body has been disturbed post mortem.

===Potassium permanganate staining===
When scanning electron microscopy is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is [[potassium permanganate]] staining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a [[Saline (medicine)|normal saline]] solution and placed in a glass petri dish. The eggs are soaked in a 1% potassium permanganate solution for one minute and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation.&lt;ref name=Sukontason/&gt; These slides can be used with any [[Optical microscope|light microscope]] with a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the plastron, as well as the morphology of the plastron in the area around the micropyle.&lt;ref name=Sukontason/&gt; The various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.

===Mitochondrial DNA===
In 2001, a method was devised by Jeffrey Wells and Felix Sperling to use [[mitochondrial DNA]] to differentiate between different species of the subfamily Chrysomyinae. This is particularly useful when working to determine the identity of specimens that do not have distinctive morphological characteristics at certain life stages.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, D. and Sperling Felix A. H. "DNA-based identification of forensically important Chrysomyinae (Diptera: Calliphoridae)"Forensic Science International Volume 120, Issues 1-215 August 2001 110-115 . 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock crime scenes===
A valuable tool that is becoming very common in the training of forensic entomologists is the use of mock crime scenes using pig carcasses. The pig carcass represents a human body and can be used to illustrate various environmental effects on both arthropod succession and the estimate of the post mortem interval.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenly, Kenneth G. [http://www.nabt.org/sites/S1/index.php?p=2 "Recreating Death's Acre in the School Yard: Using Pig Carcasses as Model"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} American Biology Teacher v68 n7 September 2006 402-410 . 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene expression studies===
Although physical characteristics and sizes at various [[instars]] have been used to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name=Tarone&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarone |first=Aaron M.  |authorlink= |author2=Jennings, Kimberley C.|author3=Foran, David R.  |date=November 2007 |title=Aging Blow Fly Eggs Using Gene Expression: A Feasibility Study |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=1350–1354 |doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00587.x  |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00587.x |accessdate= 1 April 2008 |pmid=18093065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three genes were measured in an experiment with ''Drosophila melanogaster'': bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because they are likely to be in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high [[Confidence interval|confidence level]].&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; The hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.

==Insect activity case study==
A preliminary investigation of insect colonization and succession on remains in [[New Zealand]] revealed the following results on decay and insect colonization.&lt;ref name=Eberhardt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eberhardt TL, Elliot DA | title=A preliminary investigation of insect colonisation and succession on remains in New Zealand | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2008 | volume=176 | issue=2–3 | pages=217–223 | pmid=17997065 | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2007.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open field habitat===
This environment had a daily average maximum temperature of {{convert|19.4|C|F}} and a daily minimum temperature of {{convert|11.1|C|F}}. The average rainfall for the first 3 weeks in this environment was 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm/day. Around days 17–45, the body began to start active decay. During this stage, the insect successions started with ''[[Calliphora]] stygia'', which lasted until day 27. The larvae of ''[[Chrysomya rufifacies]]'' were present between the day 13 and day 47. ''[[Hydrotaea]] rostrata'', larvae of ''[[Lucilia sericata]]'', family [[Psychodidae]], and ''[[Sylvicola]]'' were found to be present relatively late in the body's decay.

===Coastal sand-dune habitat===
This environment had an average daily maximum temperature of {{convert|21.4|C|F}} and minimum of {{convert|13.5|C|F}}. The daily average rainfall was recorded as 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm/day for the first 3 weeks. The post-decay time interval, beginning at day six after death and ending around day 15 after death, is greatly reduced from the average post-decay time, due to the high average temperature of this environment. Insects obtained late in the post-active stage include the ''Calliphora quadrimaculata'', adult Sphaeroceridae, [[Psychodidae]] and [[Piophilidae]] (no larvae from this last family were obtained in recovery).

===Native bush habitat===
This environment had recorded daily average maximum and minimum temperatures were {{convert|18.0|C|F}} and {{convert|13.0|C|F}}, respectively. The average rainfall in this habitat was recorded at 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm/day. After the bloat stage, which lasted until day seven after death, post-active decay began around day 14. In this habitat, the ''H. rostrata'', adult [[Phoridae]], Sylvicola larvae and adult were the predominant species remaining on the body during the pre-[[skeletonization (forensics)|skeletonization]] stages.

==In literature==
Throughout its history the study of forensic entomology has not remained an esoteric science reserved only for entomologists and forensic scientists.
Early twentieth-century popular scientific literature began to pique a broader interest in [[entomology]]. The very popular ten-volume book series, Alfred Brehem’s ''Thierleben'' (Life of Animals, 1876–1879) expounded on many [[zoological]] topics, including [[arthropods]]. The accessible writing style of French entomologist [[Jean-Henri Fabre]] was also instrumental in the popularization of entomology. His collection of writings ''Souvenirs Entomologique'', written during the last half of the 19th century, is especially useful because of the meticulous attention to detail to the observed insects’ behaviors and life cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Benecke, M. (2001). A brief history of forensic entomology. Forensic Entomology International, 120, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;“Jean Henri-Fabre.” Scarab Workers World Directory. January 1998 - January 2007.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln State Museum-Division of Entomology. 13 March 2008.  {{cite web |url=http://www.unl.edu/museum/research/entomology/workers/JFabre.htm |title=Jean Henri-Fabre|accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212102902/http://www.unl.edu/museum/research/entomology/workers/JFabre.htm |archivedate=12 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real impetus behind the modern cultural fascination with solving crime using entomological evidence can be traced back to the works ''Faune des Tombeaux'' (Fauna of the Tombs, 1887) and ''Les Faunes des Cadavres'' (Fauna of Corpses, 1894) by French [[veterinarian]] and [[entomologist]] [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]]. These works made the concept of the process of insect ecological succession on a corpse understandable and interesting to an ordinary reader in a way that no other previous scientific work had done. It was after the publication of Mégnin’s work that the studies of forensic science and entomology became an established part of Western popular culture, which in turn inspired other scientists to continue and expand upon his research.&lt;ref&gt;Benecke, M. (2001). A brief history of forensic entomology. Forensic Entomology International, 120, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genomatix GmbH''' is a [[computational biology]] company headquartered in [[Munich]], Germany, with a seat of business in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], U.S.A.

== History ==
Genomatix was founded in 1997 by [http://www.bioinformatik-muenchen.de/perspektive/perspektive-bioinformatik-werner/ Dr. Thomas Werner] as a spin-off from the [[Helmholtz Zentrum München]] (formerly  "GSF - National German Research Institute for Environment and Health"). Helmholtz Zentrum Munich is part of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]. Genomatix pioneered the analysis and understanding of eukaryotic [[gene regulation]].

== Genomatix software tools ==
Genomatix offers integrated solutions and databases for [[genome annotation]] and regulation analysis.

Genomatix product portfolio contains solutions for:

• Literature and pathway mining&lt;br /&gt;
• [[Transcription factor]] analysis&lt;br /&gt;
• Genome annotation integrating a wide variety of transcript sources and a special focus on regulatory regions&lt;br /&gt;
• Analysis technology for high throughput genomic technologies ([[microarrays]] and next generation [[sequencing]])

'''Literature mining'''&lt;br /&gt;
LitInspector is a literature search tool providing gene and signal transduction pathway mining within NCBI's PubMed database.&lt;ref name="LitInspector Publication"&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=19417065 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkp303 | pmc=2703902 | volume=37 | title=LitInspector: literature and signal transduction pathway mining in PubMed abstracts | year=2009 | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | pages=W135-40 | last1 = Frisch | first1 = M | last2 = Klocke | first2 = B | last3 = Haltmeier | first3 = M | last4 = Frech | first4 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LitInspector"&gt;[http://www.litinspector.org/] LitInspector start page.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==
[[Personalized medicine]] developed to a major field for Genomatix.&lt;ref name="Personaliced Medicine"&gt;[http://www.genomatix.de/en/forscher.html] Genomatix and personalized medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; Genomatix is involved in several projects and international conferences e.g. 5th Santorini Conference - "Functional Genomics towards personalized health care" &lt;ref name="Santorini Conference"&gt;[http://www.santorini2010.org/] Conference about personalized health care.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 Genomatix has strongly focused on Next Generation Sequencing data analysis. Because of the large amount of data and the need for high-end computing power, Genomatix deploys its solutions as in-house installations (hardware software bundle)

Two systems are available:

1. The Genomatix Mining Station (GMS) is based on a proprietary genomic pattern recognition paradigm, or GenomeThesaurus, which allows for input of raw sequence reads plus optional quality files from any deep sequencing hardware. It provides ultra fast mapping of sequences of any length (starting from 8bp) with no practical limits on the number of point mutations and/or insertions and deletions that can be taken into account during the mapping process. Depending on the nature of the experiment, the GMS can provide SNP detection and genotyping, copy number analysis, and small RNA analysis. For ChIPseq data, the GMS delivers clustering and peak finding, and performs automated binding pattern identification. For RNAseq experiments, normalized expression values are calculated at the exon and transcript level. A special GenomeThesaurus is also provided for potential splice junctions, which allows for splice junction analysis and identification of new transcriptional units.

For genomic re-sequencing and newly sequenced genomes, a de-novo assembly will be provided.

2. The Genomatix Genome Analyzer (GGA) delivers downstream software tools and databases for the deep biological analysis of data coming from the GMS. It allows for easy integration and visualization in the terabytes of background annotation of the ElDorado genome database. GGA extensively annotates genomic coordinates and surrounding areas derived by the GMS or any other mapping procedure. Clustering and peak finding, analysis for phylogenetic conservation, large scale correlation analysis with annotated genomic elements, meta-analysis of data correlation between different experiments, pathway mining for groups of identified genes, transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis ( identification, over-representation, binding partner analysis, framework identification, phylogenetic conservation, regulatory SNP effects) and much more are all processes carried out on the GGA.

With the GGA and GMS Genomatix delivers the worldwide first integrative data analysis platform for Next Generation Sequencing analysis with custom workflows tailored towards specific needs.

Further developments will be the link-up of data from clinical sources and medical applications. Pilot projects were already started within Genomatix’ consulting platform linking genotype and phenotype information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24003">'''Health impact assessment''' ('''HIA''') is defined as "a combination of procedures, methods, and tools by
which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the
[[Population health|health of a population]], and the [[statistical distribution|distribution]] of those effects within the population." {{Harv|ECHP|1999|p=4}}

==Overview==
HIA is intended to produce a set of [[evidence]]-based recommendations to inform [[decision-making]] {{Harv|Taylor|Quigley|2002|p=2}}. HIA seeks to maximise the positive [[health]] impacts and minimise the negative health impacts of proposed [[policies]], programs or [[projects]].

The procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of [[impact assessment]], such as [[environmental impact assessment]] or [[social impact assessment]]. HIA is usually described as following the steps listed, though many practitioners break these into sub-steps or label them differently:

# ''Screening'' - determining if an HIA is warranted/required
# ''Scoping'' - determining which impacts will be considered and the plan for the HIA
# ''Identification and assessment of impacts'' - determining the magnitude, nature, extent and likelihood of potential health impacts, using a variety of different methods and types of information
# ''Decision-making and recommendations'' - making explicit the trade-offs to be made in decision-making and formulating evidence-informed recommendations
# ''Evaluation, monitoring and follow-up'' - process and impact [[evaluation]] of the HIA and the monitoring and management of health impacts

The main objective of HIA is to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts, to specific social and community contexts, to develop evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve [[community health]] and [[wellbeing]]. Because of financial and time constraints, HIAs do not generally involve new research or the generation of original scientific knowledge. However, the findings of HIAs, especially where these have been monitored and evaluated over time, can be used to inform other HIAs in contexts that are similar. An HIA's recommendations may focus on both [[design]] and [[operational]] aspects of a proposal.

HIA has also been identified as a mechanism by which potential [[health inequalities]] can be identified and redressed prior to the implementation of proposed policy, program or project {{Harv|Acheson|1998}}.

A number of manuals and guidelines for HIA's use have been developed (see [[#Further reading|further reading]]).

==Determinants of health==
The proposition that policies, programs and projects have the potential to change the [[determinants of health]] underpins HIA's use. Changes to health determinants then leads to changes in health outcomes or the health status of individuals and communities. The determinants of health are largely [[Social environment|environmental]] and [[social]], so that there are many overlaps with [[environmental impact assessment]] and [[social impact assessment]].

==Levels of HIA==
Three forms of HIA exist:

* Desk-based HIA, which takes 2–6 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides a broad overview of potential health impacts;
* Rapid HIA, which takes approximately 12 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides more detailed information on potential health impacts; and
* Comprehensive HIA, which takes approximately 6 months for one assessor and provides a in-depth assessment of potential health impacts. {{Harv|IMPACT|2004|p=7}}

It has been suggested that HIAs can be prospective (done before a proposal is implemented), concurrent (done while the proposal is being implemented) or retrospective (done after a proposal has been implemented) {{Harv|Taylor|Gorman|Quigley|2003|p=1}}. This remains controversial, however, with a number of HIA practitioners suggesting that concurrent HIA is better regarded as a monitoring activity and that retrospective HIA is more akin to [[evaluation]] with a health focus, rather than being assessment per se {{Harv|Kemm|2003|p=387}}. Prospective HIA is preferred as it allows the maximum practical opportunity to influence decision-making and subsequent health impacts.

==HIA practitioners==
HIA practitioners can be found in the private and public sectors, but are relatively few in number. There are no universally accepted competency frameworks or certification processes. It is suggested that a lead practitioner should have extensive education and training in a health related field, experience of participating in HIAs, and have attended an HIA training course. It has been suggested and widely accepted that merely having a medical or health degree should not be regarded as an indication of competency.

==HIA worldwide==
HIA is currently being used or developed around the world, most notably in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Africa]] and [[Thailand]].

The new safeguard policies and standards of the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), part of the [[World Bank]], were established in 2006. These contain a requirement for health impact assessment in large projects. The standards have been accepted by most of the leading lending banks who are parties to the [[Equator Principles]]. Health impact assessments are becoming routine in many large development projects in both public and private sectors of developing countries. There is also a long history of health impact assessment in the water resource development sector - large dams and irrigation systems.

==HIA conferences==
The [http://www.unige.ch/medecine/eis2013/accueil_en.html 13th International HIA Conference] was held in [[Geneva]] in 2013.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120327020826/http://www.hia2012.ca/en/home.aspx 12th International HIA Conference] was held in [[Québec City]] in 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14733">The '''Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO''' ('''IOC/UNESCO''') was established by resolution 2.31 adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]]. It first met in Paris at Unesco Headquarters from 19 to 27 October 1961. Initially, 40 States became members of the Commission. The IOC assists governments to address their individual and collective ocean and coastal management needs, through the sharing of knowledge, information and technology as well as through the co-ordination of programs and building capacity in ocean and coastal research, observations and services.

The IOC is the only UN body specialized in ocean science and services. It provides a focus for other UN organizations and agencies with regard to ocean science, observations and data exchange, and services such as global [[tsunami warning system]]s. Established in 1960, the Commission celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 and currently has 147 Member States. Since the IOC often has its own accreditation within meetings such as those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), this gives UNESCO two seats and two voices at the table.

The IOC has been a key player in the recent international debate on sustainable development as it relates to the ocean. The Rio+20 outcome document affirmed the importance of “the ocean and coasts” to the sustainability debate, and is the basis for IOC’s ongoing support to the creation of a Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to the ocean. The IOC is closely involved in several international partnerships for ocean sustainability such as with the CBD, UN-Oceans and the World Ocean Assessment.

The IOC/UNESCO is composed of its Member States (147 in 2014), an Assembly, an Executive Council and a Secretariat. The Secretariat is based in Paris, France. Additionally the IOC has a number of Subsidiary Bodies: three regional sub-commissions (IOCARIBE, IOCAFRICA, and WESTPAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icriforum.org/about-icri/members-networks/intergovernmental-oceanographic-commission-unesco-ioc-unesco|title=Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO) {{!}} International Coral Reef Initiative|website=www.icriforum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and programme and project offices in Apia (Samoa), Bangkok (Thailand), Cartagena (Colombia), Copenhagen (Denmark), Jakarta (Indonesia), Kingston (Jamaica), Nairobi (Kenya), Muscat (Oman), Perth (Australia), and Port-au-Prince (Haiti). The JCOMM in situ Observations Programme Support Centre, currently hosted in Toulouse (France), is in the process of moving to Brest (France). Additionally, IOC has a strong presence in Oostende (Belgium), where the International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) and the Secretariat for the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) are based. Under IOC mandate, the IODE coordinates since 1961 the exchange of information and data between the IOC Member States and its national oceanographic data centers. As for OBIS, it was established by the [[Census of Marine Life]] program (www.coml.org), and developed between 2000 and 2010 as an evolving strategic alliance of people and organizations sharing a vision to make marine biogeographic data, from all over the world, freely available over the World Wide Web. Any organization, consortium, project or individual may contribute data to OBIS.

== IOC High Level Objectives (2014-2021)==

# '''Healthy ocean ecosystems and sustained [[ecosystem services]]'''

The IOC is working to improve responses to unprecedented environmental changes and to promote ocean health via marine sciences. The IOC supports the UN World Ocean Assessment, the UNGA-led regular process for reviewing the state of the marine environment, including socio-economic aspects. Integrating existing information from different disciplines on the state of the ocean will improve policy responses from national governments and the international community. The IOC-led Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Joint World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) are also successful examples of multilateral efforts for ocean monitoring, observation, and services. GOOS coordinates the deployment of observation technologies, rapid and universal dissemination of data flows, and delivery of marine information to managers, decision makers, and the general public. JCOMM is an intergovernmental body of technical experts drawn from the meteorological and oceanographic communities to provide observing capabilities, data management, and services.

# '''Effective early warning systems and preparedness for tsunamis and other ocean-related hazards'''

The IOC aids and advises policy makers and managers in the reduction of risks from [[tsunami]]s, [[storm surge]]s, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) and other [[coastal hazards]]. After close to fifty years of experience coordinating the Pacific Tsunami Warning System (PTWS), IOC-UNESCO is leading a global effort to establish ocean-based tsunami warning systems as part of an overall multi-hazard disaster reduction strategy. The IOC Tsunami Unit works with Member States, together with other UN agencies and NGOs, to build sustainable tsunami early warning systems. In this context, the IOC coordinates and fosters the establishment of regional intergovernmental tsunami warning and mitigation systems in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, in the Caribbean, and in the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected seas. Through its Intergovernmental Panel on Harmful Algae (IPHAB), the IOC also works to establish systems that can predict the occurrences and mitigate the effects of HAB events.

# '''Increased resiliency to climate change and variability and enhanced safety, efficiency and effectiveness of ocean-based activities through scientifically-founded services, adaptation and mitigation strategies'''

The IOC works with developed and developing countries to monitor and document changes in order to aid in the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies. Through GOOS, the IOC monitors the physical, chemical and biological aspects and changes in the world’s ocean. This unified network permits the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies and provides information and data for governments, industry, scientists and the general public. The IOC is also actively pushing to convince decision makers of the importance of sound scientific knowledge in designing policy on integrated coastal management, HABs,  and ocean acidification (through blue carbon research and initiatives). Ocean acidification is of particular concern to the IOC, as increasing CO2 levels in the ocean are associated with coral bleaching, changes in marine biodiversity, and other related problems.

# '''Enhanced knowledge of emerging ocean science issues'''

The IOC actively assists Member States in the design and implementation of new Marine Spatial Planning tools, both at the political and managerial levels, for [[ecosystem-based management]] of marine and coastal areas. Through its International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange programme (IODE), the IOC facilitates the exploitation, development, and exchange of oceanographic data and information among participating Member States. IODE seeks, in particular, to train marine information specialists from developing countries. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) manages the global marine biodiversity knowledge base, through which hundreds of institutions and scientists contribute information on the past and current diversity, abundance and distribution of marine life. OBIS data is used worldwide for planning ocean conservation policies, and identifying biodiversity hotspots and distribution trends. It allows the IOC to provide expertise, data and information for environmental, climate change, and marine biodiversity assessments.

== IOC Contributions to UNESCO's Global Priorities ==

* '''GENDER'''

The IOC is committed to promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment in ocean science. Through the Network of Women in Ocean Science (NOW in Ocean Science), the IOC hopes to mobilize women marine scientists to work with IOC to create a space for exchange of experience and opportunities for young women willing to start a career in marine science.

* '''AFRICA'''

The IOC has established a Sub-Commission for Africa and adjacent islands to reinforce the implementation of IOC programmes in Africa and mobilize extra-budgetary resources. The IOC Regional Office, established within the UNESCO Office in Nairobi, Kenya, became operational in 2012 and has formulated IOC's strategic plan for the region.

== IOC &amp; Capacity Development ==

The IOC seeks to empower developing countries through fund-raising, team building, and decision-making skills development to sustainably use their coastal and marine resources by encouraging ‘self-driven’ capacity-development. This approach aims to reduce dependence on aid while creating incentives for states to more fully integrate scientific know-how into policy design and implementation processes.

* '''Transfer of Marine Technology'''

The IOC of UNESCO is recognized in the UN-wide system for its traditional competencies in the field of Transfer of Marine Technology (Part XIV) of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). On the occasion of its first session in 20012, the IOC’s Advisory Body of Experts on the Law of the Sea (IOC/ABE-LOS), an IOC subsidiary body whose function is to provide advice on the IOC’s role in relation to UNCLOS upon the request from the IOC governing bodies, accepted the challenge of drawing the Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology (CGTMT), following the instructions set forth in Article 271 of UNCLOS:
''States, directly or through competent international organizations, shall promote the establishment of generally accepted guidelines, criteria and standards for the transfer of marine technology on a bilateral basis or within the framework of international organizations and other fore, taking into account, in particular, the interests and needs of developing States''

In the CGTMT, marine technology refers to instruments, equipment, vessels, processes and methodologies required to produce and use knowledge to improve the study and understanding of the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas. In this sense, marine technology may include any of the following components:

a)Information and data, in a user-friendly format, on marine sciences and related marine operations and services&lt;br /&gt;
b)Manuals, guidelines, criteria, standards, reference materials&lt;br /&gt;
c)Sampling and methodology equipment (e.g., for water, geological, biological, chemical samples)&lt;br /&gt;
d)Observation facilities and equipment (e.g., remote sensing equipment, buoys, tide gauges, shipboard and other means of ocean observation)&lt;br /&gt;
e)Equipment for in situ and laboratory observations, analysis and experimentation&lt;br /&gt;
f)Computer and computer software, including models and modeling techniques&lt;br /&gt;
g)Expertise, knowledge, skills, technical/scientific/legal know-how and analytical methods related to marine scientific research and observation

Transfer of Marine Technology (TMT) should enable all parties concerned to benefit on an equitable basis from developments in marine science related activities, in particular, those aiming at stimulating the social and economic contexts in developing States.

* '''Flagship initiative: OceanTeacher Global Academy'''
{{update section|date=July 2018}}
OceanTeacher (OT) has been developed as a training system for ocean data managers (working in ocean data centres), marine information managers (marine librarians) as well as for marine researchers who wish to acquire knowledge on data and/or information for planning and management. Since 2005, more than a thousand students from over a hundred countries attended courses at the IOC Project Office for IODE, based in Oostende, Belgium, and in the context of regional projects. The “Global Academy” component of OT (OTGA) is still being developed, but it seeks to expand the program into a worldwide training facility, with training courses related to multiple IOC fields (from ICAM to Tsunami Alert Systems) in various Regional Training Centers (RTCs), all of them connected in real time via the OceanTeacher Learning Management System, and using a multilingual approach to scientific training (English, Spanish, and other national languages, depending on the regional and national context). OTGA will change training from a “north to south” culture to a north-south, south-south, and south-north model by promoting the expertise available in developing countries. This new "OceanTeacher Global Academy" concept will be implemented during 2014. OTGA will be broadcasting from and to anywhere across the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3711">[[Image:Image-Istanbul Center for Mathematical Sciences.jpg|thumb|right|Sideviews of the Center. Façade facing Bosphorus.]]
The '''Istanbul Center for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''IMBM''') is an independent center for mathematics situated in the South Campus of [[Boğaziçi University]], [[Istanbul]], in close proximity to the Mathematics  Department. The center was initiated by several major universities in Istanbul and was formally inaugurated in 2006. The center aims to host and encourage the mathematical research and the interaction of researchers.

==Background==
IMBM is currently the only center for mathematics in Turkey. The first idea was brought by Betül Tanbay in 2003, then the chairwoman of the Mathematics Department of Boğaziçi University to its rector Sabih Tansal who immediately allocated a site. The center was opened in 2006 by the rectors of three leading universities in Istanbul, Boğaziçi University (state), [[Koç University]] (private) and [[Sabancı University]] (private). At that time, the three rectors were all mathematicians ([[Ayşe Soysal]], [[Atilla Aşkar]] and [[Tosun Terzioğlu]] respectively) which made the contract easier. The universities ensured to give academic and from time to time small amounts of financial support (an account of the history can be found in [[Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society|EMS Newsletter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2010-09-77.pdf  | title = EMS Newsletter September 2010, page 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

IMBM is administrated by a management committee, a scientific steering committee, and an international scientific advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.imbm.org.tr/governance.htm  | title = IMBM Governance Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific advisory board consists of the following mathematicians: [[David Mumford]] (Brown and Harvard Universities), 
[[Victor Kac]] (MIT),
[[Selman Akbulut]]  (Michigan State University),
[[Gilles Pisier]] (Paris 6 and Texas A&amp;M ),
[[Edriss Titi]]  (Weizmann Institute and University of California Irvine).

David Mumford accepted to participate in the Scientific Advisory Board during his visit to Turkey back in 2003. He has reported his personal observations in Notices of the AMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200505/comm-mumford.pdf  | title = David Mumford's observations in Notices of the AMS, Volume 52 Number 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening seminar of IMBM was delivered by [[Dan Goldston]], [[János Pintz]] and [[Cem Yalçın Yıldırım]] in 2006. Since then, the center hosted many activities with distinguished participants.

Resources of IMBM come from endowment income, personal and institutional grants and collaboration agreements and gifts.

== Buildings==
There are two buildings of the center. Both have an excellent view of the [[Bosphorus]] strait. The buildings had been in very bad condition and were brought to life by the initiative of Betül Tanbay (Boğaziçi University Mathematics Department), the first codirector of IMBM. The first floor of the main building consists of three offices with a modest library and computers. A 40-person seminar room is on the second floor.

There are four bedrooms of the center, accommodating up to six people. Two bedrooms are located in the last floor of the main building. The other two are located in a self-contained one-storey house next to the main building, which has, besides, a kitchen and a living room.

'''Ivanovka''' ({{lang-ru|Ивановка}}) is an estate near [[Tambov]], [[Russia]], which used to be the summer residence of the Russian composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in the period between 1890 and 1917 (until his emigration). It was the family home of his aristocratic relatives, the Satins. Many of Rachmaninoff's earlier masterpieces [[List of compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff|were created]] in its bucolic atmosphere. A museum commemorating the life and works of the composer was opened there in 1982.

The estate of Rachmaninoff is actually located due east of the Russian town called Mozdek, and can be found at latitude 51°57'14.24"N and longitude 42° 0'7.85"E.1  This estate is now a museum dedicated to the beloved Russian composer, whose professional life was marked with dismissive criticism,2 although his music continues to fill concert halls around the world.  Although located in the Tambov Oblast, the house of his inheritance is some 12 miles due west from Uvaravo,3 and this was likely his community. A trip to Moscow would be some 300 miles and was likely taken by Train from Tambov.4

The '''Kaldenkirchen Sequoia Farm''' ({{lang-de|Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen}}) is a German [[arboretum]] that has been used as a biological institute for many years. Part of the [[protected area]] in the city of [[Nettetal]], it is situated in the "[[Kaldenkirchen]] Grenzwald" (forest bordering Germany and the [[Netherlands]]). Nettetal lies in the [[Lower Rhine region (Germany)|Lower Rhine region]] of Germany.

== History and use ==
In 1946, [[Illa Martin]] and Ernst J. Martin, both dentists and [[dendrology|dendrologists]] in Kaldenkirchen, founded an arboretum close to the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] border. There, and in a nearby laboratory-plantation several acres wide from 1952 on, they cultivated 1,500 [[giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum'') seedlings from seeds of US origin from Martin's nephew Albert A. Martin of Santa Barbara, CA.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hubatsch: ''Ernst Martin''. In: ''Der Niederrhein''. Krefeld. No. 3, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The seeds were collected in Sequoia National Forest at different elevations, wrapped in burlap to preserve them and sent to Germany. They wanted to find out if the giant sequoia, which had existed in Germany before the [[ice age]], could be introduced to German [[forestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lange: ''Wissenschaft als Steckenpferd. Laienforscher – ihre Leistungen und ihre Wissenschaft''. Holsten. Hamburg 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst J. Martin: ''Mammutbäume in der deutschen Forstwirtschaft?'' In: „Die Umschau in Wissenschaft und Technik“. Frankfurt 1954. {{ISSN|0041-6347}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was on the one hand an area of purely giant sequoia, on the other an experimental arboretum with trees such as ''[[Abies grandis]]'', ''[[Abies concolor|Abies concolor var. lowiana]]'' and [[Coast Douglas-fir]]s. The project was financially supported by the [[German Research Foundation]] and met with great interest from dendrological circles, particularly in Great Britain and in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Huth: ''Sequoias in Germany''. In: ''Journal of Forest History'', Vol. 3, July 1976. Durham (USA), {{ISSN|0094-5080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the field exclusively planted with giant sequoia was reserved for obtaining results of productivity by the "Ecology and Forestry Department" of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (NRW).&lt;ref&gt;Illa Martin: ''Die Wiedereinführung des Mammutbaumes (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in die deutsche Forstwirtschaft''. In: ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gesellschaft''. Vol. 75, pp. 57&amp;ndash;75. Ulmer. Stuttgart 1984. {{ISBN|3-8001-8308-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two dendrologists made further experiments growing seedlings of [[coast redwood]],&lt;ref&gt;Illa Martin: ''Der Küstenmammutbaum (''Sequoia sempervirens'') und seine Anzucht in Deutschland''. In: ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gesellschaft''. Vol. 77, pp. 57&amp;ndash;104. Ulmer. Stuttgart 1987. {{ISBN|3-8001-8310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dawn redwood]] and numerous kinds of [[southern beech]]es&lt;ref&gt;Illa Martin: ''Anzucht und Anbau von Nothofagus in Deutschland''. In: ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gesellschaft''. Vol. 70, pp. 147&amp;ndash;166. Ulmer. Stuttgart 1978. {{ISBN|3-8001-8302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pine]] trees. More than 13,000 were handed over to forestry officers, to scientists and to [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]]. As time went by, the park known as the "Sequoia Farm" became bigger and bigger, developing into a highly respected arboretum. It has more than 400 varieties of trees and interesting ground flora and is part of the "Protected area of [[Maas River|Maas]]-[[Schwalm (Meuse)|Schwalm]]-[[Nette (Niers)|Nette]]", so-called after the three rivers that run through the area.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hubatsch: ''Von der Sequoiafarm zur Biologischen Station''. In: ''Heimatbuch des Kreises Kempen-Krefeld'', Kempen 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Ernst J. Martin in 1967, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) took over the farm. At first, the teacher-training institute of NRW, later on the [[University of Cologne]], and, between 1987 and 2007, the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] made it a centre of dendrological studies.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Krause: ''Mammutbaumfarm am Niederrhein wird zum Eldorado für Wissenschaftler der Essener Uni''. In: ''[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|WAZ]]'' vom 30. Juli 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013 the arboretum has been in possession of the registered society "Sequoiafarm e.V.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sequoiafarm-kaldenkirchen.de|title=Ein einzigartiges Arboretum am Niederrhein. - Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April to October it is open to the public on Sundays and holidays.

'''Maintenance''' of an organism is the collection of processes to stay alive, excluding production processes. The [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory delineates two classes
* Somatic maintenance mainly comprises the turnover of structural mass (mainly proteins) and the maintenance of concentration gradients of metabolites across membranes (e.g., counteracting leakage). This is related to [[maintenance respiration]].
* Maturity maintenance concerns the maintenance of defence systems (such as the [[immune system]]), and the preparation of the body for reproduction.

The theory assumes that maturity maintenance costs can be reduced more easily during starvation than somatic maintenance costs. Under extreme starvation conditions, somatic maintenance costs are paid from structural mass, which causes shrinking. Some organism manage to switch to the [[turpor]] state under starvation conditions, and reduce their maintenance costs.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology''' is a [[Germany|German]] institute for [[evolutionary biology]]. It is located in [[Plön]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany.

== History ==
The Institute was founded by German zoologist [[Otto Zacharias]] as ''Hydrobiologische Station zu Plön''. Working in Italy in the 1880s, Zacharias was inspired by the highly recognised [[Stazione Zoologica]] in [[Naples]], founded in 1870 by [[Anton Dohrn]], to set up the first "Biological Station" for freshwater research in Germany. He secured financial support from the [[Prussia]]n government and several private individuals to establish it on [[Großer Plöner See]] in 1891, as a private research institute.&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel, N. / Nöthlich, R.: Vom „Homo literatus“ zum „Self made man“ – Der Werdegang des Emil Otto Zacharias. In: Mauritiana, 19 (2006), No. 3, p. 463-477. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the director, Zacharias published research reports from 1893 on the Station's activities, which were recorded from 1905 in the Archives of Hydrobiology.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, Vol 20, Leipzig, 1909, p. 831. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In so-called "summer schools" Zacharias trained teachers and laity interested in working with the [[microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Zacharias, O.: Ferienkurse in Hydrobiologie und Planktonkunde an der Biologischen Station zu Plön, in: Archiv für Hydrobiologie und Planktonkunde 4 (1909), p. 267-272. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became part of the [[Max Planck Society]] in 1948, and was renamed in 1966 as the '''Max Planck Institute of Limnology'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/instUeberInstitut/instGeschichte/index.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511173229/http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/instUeberInstitut/instGeschichte/index.html |date=2011-05-11 }} on official website&lt;/ref&gt;

It was renamed again as Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in 2007, marking a change of the research focus towards [[evolutionary biology]].

[[File:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Polar bears]] on the sea ice of the [[Arctic Ocean]], near the [[north pole]].]]
Conservation biologists have designed a variety of objective means to  measure [[biodiversity]] [[empirical]]ly. Each measure of biodiversity relates to a particular use of the data. For practical [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s, measurements should include {{clarify|text=a quantification of values that are commonly shared among locally affected organisms, including humans|date=July 2014}}. For others, a more economically defensible definition should allow the ensuring of continued possibilities for both adaptation and future use by humans, assuring  environmental [[sustainability]].

As a consequence, biologists argue that this measure is likely to be associated with the variety of genes. Since it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove beneficial, the best choice{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} for [[conservation ethic|conservation]] is to assure the persistence of as many genes as possible. For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it prohibits [[ecological succession]].

== Taxonomic Diversity ==
Biodiversity is usually plotted as taxonomic richness of a geographic area, with some reference to a temporal scale. [[Robert Whittaker|Whittaker]]&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, R.H., ''Evolution and measurement of species diversity'', Taxon, 21, 213–251 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; described three common metrics used to measure species-level biodiversity, encompassing attention to [[species richness]] or [[species evenness]]:
* [[Species richness]] - the simplest of the indices available.
* [[Simpson index]]
* [[Shannon-Wiener index]]

Recently, another new index has been invented called the [[Mean Species Abundance Index]] (MSA); this index calculates the trend in population size of a cross section of the
species. It does this in line with the CBD 2010 indicator for species [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080510063151/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/GLOBIO/PDF/Flyer_%20IB_Project_LR.pdf MSA Index (page 4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Measures of Diversity ==
Alternatively, other types of diversity may be plotted against a temporal timescale:
* [[species diversity]]
* [[ecological diversity]]
* [[morphological diversity]]
* [[genetic diversity]]

These different types of diversity may not be independent. There is, for example, a close link between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors tried to organize the measurements of biodiversity in the following way:&lt;ref&gt;Cianciaruso, M.V., Silva, I.A. &amp; Batalha, M.A. Diversidades filogenética e funcional: novas abordagens para a Ecologia de comunidades. Biota Neotrop. 9(3): [http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v9n3/pt/abstract?article+bn01309032009].&lt;/ref&gt;
* traditional diversity measures
** species density, take into account the number of species in an area
** [[species richness]], take into account the number of species per individuals (usually [species]/[individuals x area])
** [[Diversity index|diversity indices]], take into account the number of species (the [[species richness|richness]]) and their relative contribution (the [[species evenness|evenness]]); e.g.:
*** [[Simpson index]]
*** [[Shannon-Wiener index]]
* [[phylogenetic diversity]] measures, include information on phylogenetic relationships among species
** phylogenetic diversity (PD) index; Faith (1992)
** topology based measures
*** taxonomic distinctiveness; Vane-Wright et al. (1991)

== Scale ==
Diversity may be measured at different scales. These are three indices used by ecologists: 
* [[Alpha diversity]] refers to diversity within a particular area, community or ecosystem, and is measured by counting the number of taxa within the ecosystem (usually species)&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Beta diversity]] is species diversity between ecosystems; this involves comparing the number of taxa that are [[Endemic (ecology)|unique to each of the ecosystems]].
* [[Gamma diversity]] is a measurement of the overall diversity for different ecosystems within a region.

==Carlsberg display of restoration noses==
The [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] museum in Copenhagen has a nasothek collection that displays restored noses that were removed from portrait busts and statues after changes in the museum's [[art restoration]] policies.&lt;ref name=Huizing&gt;{{cite book|title=Klinik der menschlichen Sinne|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-76632-3|pages=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaOg_nkDQR0C|author=E.H. Huizing|chapter=The Nose and Beyond—No Nose|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=restor&gt;{{cite book|title=History of restoration of ancient stone sculptures|year=2003|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-723-8|pages=207–224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNAVlaA6FuUC|author=Mette Moltesen|editor=Janet Burnett Grossman|chapter=Fifty years of restoration work in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noses, some made of marble and others of plaster, were all originally exhibited on the Greek and Roman statues in the glyptotek itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sign in Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek under its nasothek display&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasothek.JPG|thumb|left|Detail: A closer look at the Copenhagen Nasothek display shows wide variety in surface textures and style.]]The [[Marble#Sculpture|white marble]] favored by Classical sculptors is easily broken, and many antique statues have been damaged since their creation by accidents, [[iconoclasm]], or vandalism. During the 19th century, it was common practice for museums to exhibit such marble sculptures in a "restored" state, with damaged parts repaired or reconstructed to make the statue look as much as possible as it did when it was first created. The noses of antique statues are especially likely to be damaged or missing, so many Greek or Roman statues acquired new noses during this era. Modern exhibition practice may differ from museum to museum. The minimalist approach prescribes removing such 19th-century additions in the interest of authenticity, as has been done in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=Getty&gt;{{cite web|title=Getty Exhibition Spotlights Practices In Antiquities Conservation|url=http://www.getty.edu/news/press/center/hope_hygieia_release_040208.html|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ny Carlsberg museum, which has an extensive collection of Greek and Roman marble statues,  participated both in 19th-century restoration and in 20th-century "de-restoration." As a result, many Roman portrait heads are now noseless again, with their restored noses removed to the museum's nasothek.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

The museum display explains its contents in both Danish and English. The English description says, "The word ''nasothek'' means a collection of noses, in analogy with ''{{linktext|discotheque}}'', a collection of records."&lt;ref name=restor/&gt; The Danish explanation compares "nasotek" (Danish equivalent of "nasothek") to "{{linktext|bibliotek}}", a collection of books.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

The '''National Botanical Research Institute''' ('''NBRI''') is a research institute of [[CSIR India|CSIR]] in [[Lucknow]]. It is engaged in the field of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and modern [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.nbri-lko.org/ | title=NBRI Webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally conceptualised and set up as the National Botanic Gardens (NBG) by Professor [[Kailas Nath Kaul]] on behalf of the State Government of [[Uttar Pradesh]], it was taken over by the CSIR in 1953. Dr [[Triloki Nath Khoshoo]] joined in 1964 as the Assistant Director, shortly afterwards becoming the Director. Initially engaged in research work in the classical botanical disciplines, the NBG went on laying an increasing emphasis in keeping with the national needs and priorities in the field of plant sciences, on its applied and developmental research activities. Due to the untiring efforts of Dr [[Triloki Nath Khoshoo|Khoshoo]], the institute rose to the stature of being the National Botanical Research Institute in 1978, reflecting the correct nature and extent of its aims and objectives, functions and R &amp; D activities. [[Sikandar Bagh]] is a famous and historic pleasure garden, located in the grounds of the Institute.

==Achievements==
* NBRI developed a new variety of [[bougainvillea]], named Los Banos Variegata-Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=92149910-6ba1-4841-ae84-8bd718b72699&amp;&amp;Headline=Scientists+develop+new+variety+of+bougainvillea&amp;strParent=strParentID | title = Scientists develop new variety of bougainvillea | accessdate = 2008-08-11 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916151019/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=92149910-6ba1-4841-ae84-8bd718b72699&amp;&amp;Headline=Scientists+develop+new+variety+of+bougainvillea&amp;strParent=strParentID | archivedate = 2008-09-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Ganga River Basin Authority''' ('''NGRBA''') is a financing, planning, implementing, monitoring and coordinating authority for the [[Ganges]] River, functioning under the water resource ministry of [[India]].  The mission of the organisation is to safeguard the [[drainage basin]] which feeds water into the Ganges by protecting it from pollution or overuse. In July 2014, the NGRBA has been transferred from the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]] to the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development &amp; Ganga Rejuvenation, formerly [[Ministry of Water Resources (India)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Organizational history of the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation|url=http://wrmin.nic.in/forms/list.aspx?lid=277|accessdate=19 May 2015|agency=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Union government in a notification issued on 20 September 2016 has taken decision under River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order 2016 for a new body named "National Council for River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management)" NCRG to replace existing NGRBA. The new body will act as an authority replacing the existing National Ganga River Basin Authority for overall responsibility for superintendence of pollution prevention and rejuvenation of river Ganga Basin.

==Establishment==
It was established by the Central [[Government of India]], on 20 February 2009 under Section 3(3) of the [[Environmental policy of the Government of India|Environment Protection Act, 1986]], which also declared Ganges as the "National River" of [[India]].&lt;ref name=envir&gt;[http://moef.nic.in/modules/recent-initiatives/NGRBA/index.html NGRBA] Ministry of Environment, GoI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Prime Minister is the chair of the Authority.  Other members include the cabinet ministers of ministries that include the Ganges among their direct concerns and the chief ministers of states through which the Ganges River flows. The Chief Ministers as members are from the states through which Ganges flow  viz. Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, among others.

The first meeting of the National Ganga River Basin Authority was held on 5 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpcb.nic.in/ngrba/about.html p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2010 Union budget of India]], the allocation for National Ganga River Basin Authority doubled to {{Indian Rupee}}500 crore.

==Members of the NGRBA==
There are total of 23 members of the NGRBA. 14 out of 23 come from the government sectors whereas the remaining 9 come from the NGO sector.

'''Neuropolitics''' investigates the interplay between the brain and politics.  It combines work from a variety of scientific fields including [[neuroscience]], political science, [[psychology]], [[behavioral genetics]], [[primatology]], and [[ethology]].  Often, neuropolitics research borrow methods from [[cognitive neuroscience]] to investigate classic questions from [[political science]] such as how people make political decisions, form political / ideological attitudes, evaluate political candidates, and interact in political coalitions.  However, another line of research considers the role that evolving political competition has had on the development of the brain in humans and other species.  The research in neuropolitics often intersects with work in [[genopolitics]], [[political psychology]], political physiology, [[sociobiology]], [[neuroeconomics]], and [[neurolaw]].

==History==
Philosophers, including [[Plato]] and [[John Locke]], have long theorized about the nature of human thought and used these theories as a basis for their [[political philosophy]].  In Locke's view, humans entered the world with a mind that was a [[blank slate]] and formed governments as a result of the necessities imposed by the [[state of nature]].  Though Locke was trained in medicine, he became skeptical about the value of anatomical studies of the brain and concluded that no useful insights about mental faculties could be developed by studying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |year=2005 |title=Soul Made Flesh |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Sperry]] and colleagues performed the first published neuropolitics experiment in 1979 with [[split-brain]] patients who had their corpus-callosum severed and thus had two brain hemispheres with severely impaired communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002839327990006X |title=Self recognition and social awareness in the deconnected minor hemisphere |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=17 |pages=153–166 |year=1979 |last=Sperry |first=Roger |author2=Eran Zaidel |author3=Dahlia W Zaidel  |format=PDF |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(79)90006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers showed photos of political figures to each of the patients' eyes (and thus each distinct brain hemisphere) separately and asked them to give a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" evaluation.  Both hemispheres were shown to be capable of rendering a political attitude about the people they were viewing.  For instance, [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Fidel Castro]] were given a thumbs down, while [[Winston Churchill]] was given a thumbs up, and [[Richard Nixon]] was given a thumb in the neutral position (the experiments were carried out prior to full revelation of the [[Watergate scandal]].)  Each hemisphere attempted to communicate clues about the identity of the individuals to the other hemisphere.  This study demonstrated that neurological approaches could inform researchers' understanding of political attitudes.

[[Frans de Waal]]'s first book in 1982, ''Chimpanzee Politics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Waal |first=Frans |year=1982 |title=Chimpanzee Politics: Power and Sex among Apes}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the brains of non-human primates like [[chimpanzees]] enabled them to engage in the strategic manipulation of others.  This "[[Machiavellian intelligence]]" facilitated the formation of coalitions and political dynamics with many analogues to human politics.  Later work by [[Robin Dunbar]] suggested a relationship between the size of an animal's neo-cortex and the size of the social group it could successfully manage.  While [[Aristotle's Politics]] compared the mental faculties of humans to other animals in trying to establish a foundation for understanding human politics, the systematic work of de Waal and Dunbar brought rigorous methods for illuminating the relationship between the brain and politics, even across distantly related species.

==Neuroimaging==
The advent of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] gave a new set of tools to [[neuroscience]] that could be used to investigate questions that were difficult or impossible to address previously.  The first neuropolitics studies using fMRI looked at the differences in brain activity between people who were knowledgeable about national politics and those who were not, while they answered political questions.  Following in the tradition of work by [[Philip Converse]] and [[John Zaller]], it found that the politically knowledgeable had elevated levels of activity in the [[default mode network]] of the brain while political novices had diminished activity in the same areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Darren |last=Schreiber |title=Evaluating politics: A search for the neural substrates of political thought |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |year=2005 |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/31/96/3196356.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5903/912.abstract |title=Biology, Politics, and the Emerging Science of Human Nature |journal=Science |volume=322 |pages=912–914 |year=2008 |last=Fowler |first=James |author2=Darren Schreiber  |format=PDF |doi=10.1126/science.1158188 |issue=5903 |pmid=18988845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A subsequent study by [[Drew Westen]] and colleagues confirmed the elevated default mode network activity for political sophisticates and suggested differences between Republicans and Democrats in how they think about political questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn.2006.18.11.1947 |title=Neural Bases of Motivated Reasoning: An fMRI Study of Emotional Constraints on Partisan Political Judgment in the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1947–1958 |year=2006 |last=Westen |first=Drew |author2=Pavel S.

==Politics in other species==
Despite the risks of anthropomorphizing the behaviors of non-human animals, researchers have investigated the politics of a number of social species.  In addition to de Waals' work on chimpanzees, scientists have investigated the dynamics of coalitions in [[hyenas]], [[dolphins]], [[elephants]], and other animals.  In the [[spotted hyena]], for instance, social interactions are characterized by a [[fission-fusion society]] in which groups of hyenas can form and dissolve on a regular basis.  The greater complexity of the political dynamics among the spotted hyena appears to require a larger [[neocortex]] than in related species with simpler social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brain Size and Social Complexity: A Computed Tomography Study in Hyaenidae |journal=Brain, Behavior, and Evolution |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=91–104 |year=2011 |last=Sakai |first=Sharleen |author2=Bradley M.

'''''No Way to Heaven''''' is a 2008 documentary feature about people allegedly living on light ([[Breatharianism]]), directed and produced by Swiss filmmakers Janos Tedeschi and Christof Schaefer. It is the world’s very first full-length film on this topic.

''No Way to Heaven'' premiered in Switzerland in January 2008. The film had theatrical release in Switzerland in January 2009 and went on to screen in Estonia and the Netherlands.

==Synopsis==
''No Way to Heaven'' begins on a remote island in Southeast Asia. There, Fritz Joss, a young man from the Swiss mountains has decided to stop eating – once and for all. He plans to find sustenance in pure (sun-)light by applying what is known as the "21 day process". Fritz sets off on his endeavour, but the planned conversion to "breatharianism" is much more difficult than anticipated.

==Cast==
The film features encounters with the following characters:
* Fritz Joss, a young Swiss yogi who stops eating and drinking by applying the "21-day process".
* [[Inedia#Prahlad Jani .28.22Mataji.22.29|Prahlad Jani]], an 82-year ascetic Hindu, who for 74 years has survived allegedly without food and liquid.
* A team of doctors, headed by [[Inedia#2003 Tests|Prof. Dr. Sudhir Shah]], a neurologist and respected scientist at Sterling Hospital Ahmedabad, India, who have conducted several case studies on breatharianism, most notably with Prahlad Jani in 2004 and 2010.
* Niranjan Bhagat, who gazes at the sun ([[sungazing]]) every day for 45 minutes and hence claims does not need to eat.
* Sanjay Padhiyar, a 110-year-old Indian saint, who tells the story of how she forgot to eat during several years of meditation, living as a recluse in a cave in northern India.

DVD Extras:

* [[Jasmuheen]], an Australian esoteric teacher and author, who introduced breatharianism (and the 21-day process) in her best-selling book "Living on Light" to Western audiences in the late 90s.
* Dr. Michael Werner, a German chemist, anthroposophist and author of "Leben durch Lichtnahrung", himself a breatharian of multiple years.
* [[Inedia#2003 Tests|Prof. Dr. Sudhir Shah]] (extended interview).
* Swami Vivekananda Saraswati, a prominent yogi and teacher of Fritz Joss.

'''Palynology''' is the "study of dust" (from {{lang-grc-gre|παλύνω|palunō}}, "strew, sprinkle"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpalu%2Fnw παλύνω], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[-logy]]'') or "particles that are strewn". A classic palynologist analyses [[particulate]] samples collected from the air, from water, or from deposits including sediments of any age. The condition and identification of those particles, organic and inorganic, give the palynologist clues to the life, environment, and energetic conditions that produced them.

The term is sometimes narrowly used to refer to a subset of the discipline, which is defined as "the study of microscopic objects of macromolecular organic composition (i.e., compounds of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen), not capable of dissolution in hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acids".&lt;ref&gt;W.A.S.

Palynology does not include [[diatoms]], [[foraminiferans]] or other organisms with [[siliceous]] or [[calcareous]] [[exoskeletons]].

Palynology is an interdisciplinary science and is a branch of [[earth science]] ([[geology]] or geological science) and [[biological science]] ([[biology]]), particularly [[plant science]] ([[botany]]). [[stratigraphy|Stratigraphical]] palynology is a branch of [[micropaleontology|micropalaeontology]] and [[paleobotany]], which studies [[fossil]] palynomorphs from the [[Precambrian]] to the [[Holocene]].

===Early history===
The earliest reported observations of pollen under a microscope are likely to have been in the 1640s by the English [[botanist]] [[Nehemiah Grew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bradbury| first=S.| date=1967| title=The Evolution of the Microscope| publisher=Pergamon Press| place=New York| pages=375 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described pollen and the stamen, and concluded that pollen is required for sexual reproduction in flowering plants.

By the late 1870s, as optical microscopes improved and the principles of [[stratigraphy]] were worked out, [[Robert Kidston]] and [[P. Reinsch]] were able to examine the presence of fossil spores in the Devonian and Carboniferous coal seams and make comparisons between the living spores and the ancient fossil spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jansonius| first=J.| author2=D.C.

=== 1890s to 1940s===
Quantitative analysis of pollen began with [[Lennart von Post]]'s published work.&lt;ref&gt;Traverse, Alfred and Sullivan, Herbert J. "The Background, Origin, and Early History of the American Association of Stratigraphic Palynologists" Palynology 7: 7-18 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Although he published in the Swedish language, his methodology gained a wide audience through his lectures. In particular, his [[Kristiania]] lecture of 1916 was important in gaining a wider audience.&lt;ref name="FIPol"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fægri| first=Knut| authorlink=Knut Fægri| author2=Johs.

Gunnar E. Erdtman| journal=Pollen et Spores| date=1973| volume=15| pages=5–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The isolation ended with the German publication of [[Gunnar Erdtman]]'s 1921 thesis. The methodology of pollen analysis became widespread throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] and revolutionized [[Quaternary]] vegetation and climate change research.&lt;ref name="FIPol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Post, L (1918) "Skogsträdpollen i sydsvenska torvmosslagerföljder", Forhandlinger ved de Skandinaviske naturforskeres 16. møte i Kristiania 1916: p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier pollen researchers include Früh (1885),&lt;ref&gt;Früh, J (1885) "Kritische Beiträge zur Kenntnis des Torfes", Jahrb.k.k.Geol.Reichsanstalt 35&lt;/ref&gt; who enumerated many common tree pollen types, and a considerable number of [[spore]]s and [[herb]] pollen grains. There is a study of pollen samples taken from sediments of Swedish lakes by Trybom (1888);&lt;ref&gt;Trybom, F (1888) "Bottenprof fran svenska insjöar", Geol.Foren.Forhandl.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pinus|pine]] and [[Picea|spruce]] pollen was found in such profusion that he considered them to be serviceable as "[[index fossils]]". [[Georg F. L. Sarauw]] studied fossil pollen of middle Pleistocene age ([[Cromerian]]) from the harbour of [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sarauw | first=G. F. L. | date= 1897 | title = Cromer-skovlaget i Frihavnen og trælevningerne i de ravførende sandlag ved København | language = Danish |trans-title= The Cromer Forest layer in the Free Harbour and Wood Remains in the Amber containing strata near Copenhagen | journal = Meddelelser fra Dansk Geologisk Forening / Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark | volume=1 | issue=4 | pages= 17–44 | url = http://2dgf.dk/xpdf/bull-1897-1-4-17-44.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagerheim (in Witte 1905) and C.&amp;nbsp;A.Weber (in H.&amp;nbsp;A. Weber 1918) appear to be among the first to undertake 'percentage frequency' calculations.

=== 1940s to 1989===

The term ''palynology'' was introduced by Hyde and Williams in 1944, following correspondence with the Swedish [[geologist]] [[Ernst Antevs]], in the pages of the ''[[Pollen Analysis Circular]]'' (one of the first journals devoted to pollen analysis, produced by [[Paul Sears]] in North America). Hyde and Williams chose ''palynology'' on the basis of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''paluno'' meaning 'to sprinkle' and ''pale'' meaning 'dust' (and thus similar to the [[Latin]] word ''pollen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hyde| first=H.A.| author2=D.A. Williams| url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/riteword.html| title=The Right Word| journal=Pollen Analysis Circular| volume=8| pages=6| date=1944| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618031355/http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/riteword.html| archivedate=2007-06-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen analysis in North America stemmed from [[Phyllis Draper]], an MS student under Sears at the University of Oklahoma. During her time as a student, she developed the first pollen diagram from a sample that depicted the percentage of several species at different depths at Curtis Bog. This was the introduction of pollen analysis in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Draper|first=Phyllis|date=|title=A DEMONSTRATION OF THE TECHNIQUE OF POLLEN ANALYSIS|url=http://ojs.library.okstate.edu/osu/index.php/OAS/article/viewFile/2553/2251|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; pollen diagrams today still often remain in the same format with depth on the y-axis and abundances of species on the x-axis.

=== 1990s to the 21st century ===
Pollen analysis advanced rapidly in this period due to advances in optics and computers. Much of the science was revised by [[Johannes Iversen]] and [[Knut Fægri]] in their textbook on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Fægri, K. &amp; Iversen, J. (1989) ''Textbook of pollen analysis''. 4th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester. 328 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of studying palynomorphs ==

===Palynomorphs===
Palynomorphs are broadly defined as organic-walled [[microfossil]]s between 5 and 500 [[micrometre]]s in size.  They are extracted from [[sedimentary rock]]s and [[pollen core|sediment cores]] both physically, by ultrasonic treatment and [[sieve analysis|wet sieving]], and chemically, by chemical digestion to remove the non-organic fraction. Palynomorphs may be composed of organic material such as [[chitin]], [[pseudochitin]] and [[sporopollenin]]. Palynomorphs that have a taxonomy description are sometimes referred to as palynotaxa.

Palynomorphs form a [[geological]] record of importance in determining the type of [[prehistoric life]] that existed at the time the sedimentary formation was laid down. As a result, these microfossils give important clues to the prevailing [[paleogeography|climatic conditions]] of the time. Their paleontological utility derives from an abundance numbering in millions of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] per gram in organic marine deposits, even when such deposits are generally not [[fossiliferous]]. Palynomorphs, however, generally have been destroyed in [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] or recrystallized rocks.

Typically, palynomorphs are [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[acritarch]]s, [[spore]]s, [[pollen]], [[fungi]], [[scolecodonts]] (scleroprotein teeth, jaws and associated features of [[polychaeta|polychaete]] [[annelid]] worms), [[arthropod]] organs (such as [[insect]] mouthparts), [[chitinozoa]]ns and [[foram|microforam]]s. Palynomorph microscopic structures that are abundant in most sediments are resistant to routine pollen extraction including strong acids and bases, and acetolysis, or density separation.&lt;!--Check this sentence, before I copy/edit-ted it. It had GROSS errors.--&gt;

==Palynofacies==
A '''palynofacies''' is the complete assemblage of [[organic matter]] and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s in a fossil deposit. The study of the palynofacies of a  [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of sediments can be used to learn about the depositional palaeoenvironments of [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]]. The term ''palynofacies'' was introduced by the French [[geologist]] [[André Combaz]] in 1964. Palynofacies studies are often linked to investigations of the palynology and organic [[geochemistry]] of [[sedimentary rock]]s.

Palynofacies can be used in two ways:
* [[Organic matter|Organic]] palynofacies considers all the acid insoluble [[particulate organic matter]] (POM), including [[kerogen]] and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s in sediments and palynological preparations of sedimentary rocks. The sieved or unsieved preparations may be examined using [[strew mount]]s on microscope slides that may be examined using a transmitted light biological microscope or [[ultraviolet]] (UV) fluorescence microscope. The abundance, composition and preservation of the various components, together with the thermal alteration of the organic matter is considered.
* Palynomorph palynofacies considers the abundance, composition and diversity of palynomorphs in a sieved palynological preparation of sediments or palynological preparation of [[sedimentary rock]]s. The ratio of [[ocean|marine]] [[fossil]] [[phytoplankton]] ([[acritarchs]] and [[dinoflagellate]] cysts), together with [[chitinozoa]]ns, to terrestrial palynomorphs ([[pollen]] and [[spores]]) can be used to derive a terrestrial input index in marine sediments.

Both types of palynofacies studies are used for [[geology|geological interpretation]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] basins in exploration geology, often in conjunction with palynological analysis and [[vitrinite]] reflectance.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the only chemical treatment used by researchers was treatment with [[Potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) to remove [[Humic acid|humic]] substances; defloculation was accomplished through surface treatment or ultra-sonic treatment, although sonification may cause the pollen exine to rupture.&lt;ref name="InMem" /&gt; The use of [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) to digest [[silicate]] [[mineral]]s was introduced by Assarson and Granlund in 1924, greatly reducing the amount of time required to scan slides for palynomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Palynological studies using peats presented a particular challenge because of the presence of well-preserved organic material, including fine rootlets, moss leaflets and organic litter. This was the last major challenge in the chemical preparation of materials for palynological study. [[Acetolysis]] was developed by Gunnar Erdtman and his brother to remove these fine cellulose materials by dissolving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=354–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; In acetolysis the specimen is treated with [[acetic anhydride]] and [[sulfuric acid]], dissolving [[cellulose|cellulistic]] materials and thus providing better visibility for palynomorphs.

Some steps of the chemical treatments require special care for safety reasons, in particular the use of HF which diffuses very fast through the skin and, causes severe chemical burns, and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Another treatment includes kerosene flotation for [[chitin]]ous materials.

===Analysis===
Once samples have been prepared chemically, they are mounted on [[microscope]] slides using silicon oil, glycerol or glycerol-jelly and examined using light [[microscopy]] or mounted on a stub for [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]].

Researchers will often study either modern samples from a number of unique sites within a given area, or samples from a single site with a record through time, such as samples obtained from [[peat]] or lake sediments. More recent studies have used the modern analog technique in which paleo-samples are compared to modern samples for which the parent vegetation is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When the slides are observed under a microscope, the researcher counts the number of grains of each pollen taxon.  This record is next used to produce a [[pollen diagram]]. These data can be used to detect [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] effects, such as logging,&lt;ref&gt;

Palynology can be applied to problems in many fields including [[geology]], [[botany]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], [[pedology (soil study)]], and [[physical geography]].

== Applications ==
Palynology is used for a diverse range of applications, related to many scientific disciplines:

* [[Biostratigraphy]] and [[geochronology]]. Geologists use palynological studies in biostratigraphy to correlate [[stratum|strata]] and determine the relative age of a given bed, horizon, formation or [[stratigraphy|stratigraphical]] sequence.
* [[paleoecology|Palaeoecology]] and [[climate change]]. Palynology can be used to reconstruct past [[vegetation]] (land plants) and [[ocean|marine]] and [[Freshwater phytoplankton]] communities, and so infer past [[natural environment|environmental]] ([[paleoenvironment|palaeoenvironment]]al) and [[paleoclimatology|palaeoclimatic]] conditions.
* [[organic compound|Organic]] [[palynofacies]] studies, which examine the preservation of the particulate organic matter and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s provides information on the depositional environment of sediments and depositional palaeoenvironments of [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]].
* [[Geothermal]] alteration studies examine the [[color|colour]] of palynomorphs extracted from rocks to give the thermal alteration and [[hydrocarbon|maturation]] of [[sedimentary]] sequences, which provides estimates of maximum [[paleotemperatures|palaeotemperatures]].
* [[Limnology]] studies. Freshwater palynomorphs and animal and plant fragments, including the [[prasinophyte]]s and [[desmid]]s ([[green alga]]e) can be used to study past lake levels and long term [[climate change]].
* [[scientific classification|Taxonomy]] and [[evolution|evolutionary studies]]. Involving the use of pollen morphological characters as source of taxonomic data to delimit plant species under same family or genus. Pollen apertural status is frequently used for differential sorting or finding similarities between species of the same taxa. This is also called Palynotaxonomy.
* [[Forensic palynology]]: the study of [[pollen]] and other palynomorphs for evidence at a crime scene.
* [[Allergy]] studies. Studies of the geographic distribution and seasonal production of pollen, can help sufferers of allergies such as [[hay fever]].
* [[Melissopalynology]]: the study of pollen and spores found in honey.
* [[Archaeological]] palynology examines human uses of plants in the past. This can help determine seasonality of site occupation, presence or absence of agricultural practices or products, and 'plant-related activity areas' within an archaeological context.  [[Bonfire Shelter]] is one such example of this application.

Because the distribution of [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[pollen]] and [[spore]]s provides evidence of [[stratigraphy|stratigraphical correlation]] through [[biostratigraphy]] and [[palaeoenvironment]]al reconstruction, one common and lucrative application of palynology is in [[petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] exploration.

Palynology also allows scientists to infer the climatic conditions from the vegetation present in an area [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years]] ago. This is a fundamental part of research into [[climate change]].

'''Peptide YY''' ('''PYY''') also known as '''peptide tyrosine tyrosine''' is a peptide that in humans is encoded by the PYY [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{EntrezGene|5697}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peptide YY is a short (36-[[amino acid]]) peptide released from cells in the [[ileum]] and [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] in response to feeding. In the blood, gut, and other elements of periphery, PYY acts to reduce appetite; similarly, when injected directly into the central nervous system, PYY is also [[anorexigenic]], i.e., it reduces appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Woods S. C. |author2=D'Alessio D. A. | year = 2008 | title = Central control of body weight and appetite | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 93 | issue = 11 Suppl 1| pages = S37–50 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2008-1630 |pmid=18987269 | pmc=2585760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dietary fiber]]s from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, consumed, increase the speed of transit of intestinal [[chyme]] into the [[ileum]], to raise PYY&lt;sub&gt;3-36&lt;/sub&gt;, and induce satiety. Peptide YY can be produced as the result of enzymatic breakdown of crude fish proteins and ingested as a food product.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/mccormick/pdf/Murashita%20et%20al%202009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Structure==
Peptide YY  is related to the [[pancreatic peptide]] family by having 18 of its 36 amino acids located in the same positions as pancreatic peptide.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7216-2888-5"&gt;{{cite book | author = DeGroot, Leslie Jacob | editor = J. E. McGuigan | title = Endocrinology | edition = | language = | publisher = Saunders | location = Philadelphia | year = 1989 | origyear =  | quote = | isbn = 0-7216-2888-5 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate =| page = 2754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major forms of peptide YY are PYY&lt;sub&gt;1-36&lt;/sub&gt; and PYY&lt;sub&gt;3-36&lt;/sub&gt;, which have PP fold structural motifs. However, the most common form of circulating PYY immunoreactivity is PYY&lt;sub&gt;3-36&lt;/sub&gt;, which binds to the [[Neuropeptide Y receptor Y2|Y&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; receptor (Y2R)]] of the [[neuropeptide y receptor|Y family]] of receptors.&lt;ref name="pmid17167473"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphy KG, Bloom SR | title = Gut hormones and the regulation of energy homeostasis | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7121 | pages = 854–9 |date=December 2006 | pmid = 17167473 | doi = 10.1038/nature05484 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peptide YY&lt;sub&gt;3-36&lt;/sub&gt; (PYY) is a linear [[polypeptide]] consisting of 34 [[amino acid]]s with structural [[homology (chemistry)|homology]] to [[NPY]] and [[pancreatic polypeptide]].

==Release==
PYY is found in L cells in the [[mucosa]] of [[gastrointestinal tract]], especially in [[ileum]] and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. Also, a small amount of PYY, about 1-10%, is found in the [[esophagus]], [[stomach]], [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]].&lt;ref name="pmid3838162"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Taylor IL | title = Distribution and release of peptide YY in dog measured by specific radioimmunoassay | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 88 | issue = 3 | pages = 731–7 |date=March 1985 | pmid = 3838162 | doi = | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; PYY concentration in the circulation increases postprandially (after food ingestion) and decreases by [[fasting]].&lt;ref name="pmid17167473"/&gt; In addition, PYY is produced by a discrete population of neurons in the [[brainstem]], specifically localized to the [[gigantocellular reticular nucleus]] of the [[medulla oblongata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glavas MM, Grayson BE, Allen SE, Copp DR, Smith MS, Cowley MA, Grove KL | title = Characterization of brainstem peptide YY (PYY) neurons | journal = J Comp Neurol| volume = 506 | issue = 2 | pages = 194–210 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18022952 | doi = 10.1002/cne.21543}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. R. Gustavsen'' et al.'' had found PYY-producing cells located in the islets of Langerhans in rats. They were observed either alone or co-localized with glucagon or PP.&lt;ref name="pmid18406449"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustavsen CR, Pillay N, Heller RS | title = An immunohistochemical study of the endocrine pancreas of the African ice rat, Otomys sloggetti robertsi | journal = Acta Histochem. | volume = 110 | issue = 4 | pages = 294–301 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18406449 | doi = 10.1016/j.acthis.2007.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
PYY exerts its action through [[neuropeptide Y receptor|NPY receptor]]s; it inhibits [[Gastrointestinal physiology#Motility|gastric motility]] and increases water and [[electrolyte]] absorption in the colon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu C, Aloia T, Adrian T, Newton T, Bilchik A, Zinner M, Ashley S, McFadden D | title = Peptide YY: a potential proabsorptive hormone for the treatment of malabsorptive disorders | journal = Am Surg | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 232–6 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8607584}}&lt;/ref&gt; PYY may also suppress [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] [[secretion]].  It is secreted by the [[neuroendocrine cell]]s in the [[ileum]] and [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] in response to a meal, and has been shown to reduce [[appetite]]. PYY works by slowing the gastric emptying; hence, it increases efficiency of digestion and nutrient absorption after a meal. Research has also indicated PYY may be useful in removing [[aluminium]] accumulated in the [[brain]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Animal studies==
Several studies have shown acute peripheral administration of PYY&lt;sub&gt;3-36&lt;/sub&gt; inhibits feeding of rodents and primates. Other studies on Y2R-[[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] have shown no [[anorectic]] effect on them. These findings indicate PYY&lt;sub&gt;3-36&lt;/sub&gt; has an anorectic (losing appetite) effect, which is suggested to be mediated by Y2R. PYY-knockout female mice increase in body weight and fat mass. PYY-knockout mice, on the other hand, are resistant to [[obesity]], but have higher fat mass and lower glucose tolerance when fed a high-fat diet, compared to control mice. Thus, PYY also plays a very important role in energy homeostasis by balancing food intake.&lt;ref name="pmid17167473"/&gt; PYY oral spray was found to promote fullness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2013/12/uf-researchers-use-oral-peptide-spray-to-stimulate-weight-loss-in-animals.html|title = UF researchers use oral peptide spray to stimulate weight loss in animals|date = Dec 19, 2013|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viral gene therapy of the salivary glands resulted in long-term intake reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Salivary PYY: a putative bypass to satiety|date = 2011|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0026137|pmid = 22028819 |volume=6 |issue = 10|pages=e26137 |pmc=3189958 |vauthors=Acosta A, Hurtado MD, Gorbatyuk O, La Sala M, Duncan D, Aslanidi G, Campbell-Thompson M, Zhang L, Herzog H, Voutetakis A, Baum BJ, Zolotukhin S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to obesity==

[[Leptin]] also reduces appetite in response to feeding, but [[obesity|obese]] people develop a resistance to leptin.  Obese people secrete less PYY than non-obese people,&lt;ref name="pmid12082881"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarez Bartolomé M, Borque M, Martinez-Sarmiento J, Aparicio E, Hernández C, Cabrerizo L, Fernández-Represa JA | title = Peptide YY secretion in morbidly obese patients before and after vertical banded gastroplasty | journal = Obes Surg | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 324–7 |date=June 2002 | pmid = 12082881 | doi = 10.1381/096089202321088084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to use PYY directly as a weight-loss drug have met with some success.  Researchers noted the caloric intake during a buffet lunch offered two hours after the infusion of PYY was decreased by 30% in obese subjects (P&lt;0.001) and 31% in lean subjects (P&lt;0.001).&lt;ref name="pmid12954742"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Batterham RL, Cohen MA, Ellis SM, Le Roux CW, Withers DJ, Frost GS, Ghatei MA, Bloom SR | title = Inhibition of food intake in obese subjects by peptide YY3-36 | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 349 | issue = 10 | pages = 941–8 |date=September 2003 | pmid = 12954742 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa030204  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some studies have shown obese persons have lower circulating level of PYY postprandially, other studies have reported they have normal sensitivity to the [[anorectic]] effect of PYY&lt;sub&gt;3-36&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, reduction in PYY sensitivity may not be one of the causes of obesity, in contrast to the reduction of leptin sensitivity. The anorectic effect of PYY could possibly be a future obesity drug.&lt;ref name="pmid17167473"/&gt;

The consumption of protein boosts PYY levels, so some benefit was observed in experimental subjects in reducing hunger and promoting weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Batterham RL, Heffron H, Kapoor S, Chivers J, Chandarana K, Herzog H, Le Roux CW, Thomas EL, Bell JD, Withers DJ |title=Critical role for peptide YY in protein-mediated satiation and body-weight regulation |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages= 223–233 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16950139 |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2006.08.001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This could partially explain the weight-loss experienced with [[high-protein diet]]s, but the high thermic effect of protein appears to be the leading cause.

Obese patients undergoing gastric bypass showed marked metabolic adaptations, resulting in frequent diabetes remission 1 year later. When the confounding of calorie restriction is factored out, β-cell function improves rapidly, very possibly under the influence of enhanced GLP-1 responsiveness. Insulin sensitivity improves in proportion to weight loss, with a possible involvement of PYY.&lt;ref name="pmid24057293"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nannipieri M, Baldi S, Mari A, Colligiani D, Guarino D, Camastra S, Barsotti E, Berta R, Moriconi D, Bellini R, Anselmino M, Ferrannini E | title = Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy: Mechanisms of Diabetes Remission and Role of Gut Hormones | journal = J.

[[File:Moon and pillbox - geograph.org.uk - 325948 crop.jpg|thumb|350px|A [[World War II]] hexagonal pillbox – on the bank of the [[Mells River]] at [[Lullington, Somerset]], England.]]

A '''pillbox''' is a type of [[blockhouse]], or concrete dug-in guard post, normally equipped with [[embrasure|loopholes]] through which to fire weapons. It is in effect a trench firing step hardened to protect against small-arms fire and grenades and raised to improve the field of fire.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term is disputed. It has been widely assumed to be a jocular reference to the perceived similarity of the fortifications to the cylindrical and hexagonal boxes in which medical pills were once sold.&lt;ref&gt;Hellis, John. [http://www.pillbox-study-group.org.uk/index.php/the-pillbox-study-group/why-pillbox/ "Why the name Pillbox?"] Pillbox Study Group&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems more likely that it originally alluded to [[pillar box]]es, with a comparison being drawn between the loophole on the pillbox and the letter-slot on the pillar box.&lt;ref name="Oldham18"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldham|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is found in print in ''[[The Times]]'' on 2 August 1917, following the beginning of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]; and in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' on 17 September 1917, following the German withdrawal onto the [[Hindenburg Line]]. Other unpublished occurrences have been found in [[War diary|war diaries]] and similar documents of about the same date; and in one instance, as "Pillar Box", as early as March 1916.&lt;ref name="Oldham18"/&gt;

==Description==
The concrete nature of pillboxes means that they are a feature of prepared positions. Some pillboxes were designed to be prefabricated and transported to their location for assembly. During World War I, Sir [[Ernest William Moir]] produced a design for concrete machine-gun pillboxes&lt;ref name="NA-pillbox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers on:- Machine-gun pill-box designed by Mr. E. W. Moir, Munitions Council member|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1890565|website=National Archives|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed from a system of interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof. Around 1500 Moir pillboxes were eventually produced (with blocks cast at [[Richborough]] in Kent) and sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="Oldham"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldham|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEHB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moir pillbox|url=http://sussexhistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=1521.0|website=South East History Boards|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pillboxes are often [[Military camouflage|camouflaged]] in order to conceal their location and to maximize the element of surprise. They may be part of a trench system, form an interlocking line of defence with other pillboxes by providing covering fire to each other ([[defence in depth]]), or they may be placed to guard strategic structures such as bridges and jetties.

The French [[Maginot Line]] built between the world wars consisted of a massive [[bunker]] and tunnel complex, but as most of it was below ground little could be seen from the ground level. The exception were the concrete [[blockhouse]]s, [[gun turret]]s, pillboxes and [[cupola (military)|cupola]]s which were placed above ground to allow the garrison of the Maginot line to engage an attacking enemy.{{sfn|Schneider|Kitchen|2002|p=87}}

Between the [[Abyssinia Crisis|Abyssinian Crisis]] of 1936 and [[World War II]], the British built about 200 pillboxes on the island of [[Malta]] for defence in case of an Italian invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guided tour of WWII defences|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20051205/local/guided-tour-of-wwii-defences.69984|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 100 pillboxes still exist, and most are found on the northeastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed nowadays as the authorities do not consider them to have any architectural or historic value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wartime pillbox at Salina being pulled down|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-04-10/news/wartime-pillbox-at-salina-being-pulled-down-4577918976/|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite heritage NGOs calling to preserve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leone Ganado|first1=Philip|title=WWII pillbox is not worth preserving, cultural watchdog says|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160830/local/wwii-pillbox-is-not-worth-preserving-cultural-watchdog-says.623544|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=30 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830155858/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160830/local/wwii-pillbox-is-not-worth-preserving-cultural-watchdog-says.623544|archivedate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 28,000 [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications]] were constructed in England in 1940 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]. About 6,500 of these structures still survive.{{sfn|CBA staff}}

Pillboxes for the [[Czechoslovak border fortifications]] were built before World War II in [[Czechoslovakia]] in defence against a German attack. None of these were actually used against their intended enemy during the German invasion, but some were used against the advancing Soviet armies in 1945. The [[Japan]]ese also made use of pillboxes in their fortifications of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]].

Pillboxes were hard to defeat and required artillery, anti-tank weapons or grenades to overcome.

'''Plant cells''' are  [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells of the types present in green plants, photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Their distinctive features include primary cell walls containing cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin, the presence of plastids with the capability to perform photosynthesis and store starch, a large [[vacuole]] that regulates turgor pressure, the absence of flagellae or centrioles, except in the gametes, and a unique method of cell division involving the formation of a cell plate or [[phragmoplast]] that separates the new daughter cells.

==Characteristics of plant cells==

* Plant primary [[cell wall]]s are constructed on the outside of the [[cell membrane]] and are composed of [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]]s and [[pectin]]. In many cases [[lignin]], [[suberin]] or [[cutin]] are secreted by the [[protoplast]] as secondary wall layers inside the primary cell wall. This contrasts with the cell walls of [[fungus|fungi]], which are made of [[chitin]], of [[bacteria]], which are made of [[peptidoglycan]] and of [[archaea]], which are made of [[pseudopeptidoglycan]]. Cell walls perform many essential functions. They provide shape to form the tissue and organs of the plant, and play an important role in intercellular communication and plant-microbe interactions.&lt;ref name=Keegstra&gt;{{cite journal| last=Keegstra |first=K |date=2010 |title=Plant cell walls |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=483–486 |doi=10.1104/pp.110.161240 |pmc=2949028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Many types of plant cells contain a large central [[vacuole]], a water-filled volume enclosed by a membrane known as the [[tonoplast]]&lt;ref name=JRaven&gt;{{Cite journal |first=JA |last=Raven |date=1997 |title=The vacuole: a cost-benefit analysis |journal=Advances in Botanical Research |volume=25 |pages=59–86 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2296(08)60148-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that maintains the cell's [[turgor]], controls movement of [[molecules]] between the [[cytosol]] and [[plant sap|sap]], stores useful material and digests waste [[protein]]s and [[organelle]]s.

* Specialized cell-to-cell communication pathways known as [[plasmodesmata]],&lt;ref name=Oparka&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oparka |first=KJ |date=1993 |title=Signalling via plasmodesmata-the neglected pathway |journal=Seminars in Cell Biology |volume=4 |pages=131–138 | doi=10.1006/scel.1993.1016}}&lt;/ref&gt; occur in the form of pores in the primary cell wall through which the [[plasmalemma]] and [[endoplasmic reticulum]]&lt;ref name=Hepler&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hepler |first=PK |date=1982 |title=Endoplasmic reticulum in the formation of the cell plate and plasmodesmata |journal=Protoplasma |volume=111 |pages=121–133 |doi=10.1007/BF01282070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of adjacent cells are continuous.

* Plant cells contain [[Plastid]]s, the most notable being [[chloroplast]]s, which contain the green-colored pigment [[chlorophyll]] that absorbs sunlight, and allows the plant to make its own food in the process known as [[photosynthesis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|editor-first1=James Alan |editor-last1=Bassham |editor-first2=Hans |editor-last2=Lambers |date=2018 |title=Photosynthesis: importance, process, &amp; reactions |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/photosynthesis |access-date=2018-04-15|language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other types of plastids are the [[amyloplast]]s, specialized for [[starch]] storage, [[elaioplast]]s specialized for [[fat]] storage, and [[chromoplast]]s specialized for synthesis and storage of [[pigment]]s.

==Types of plant cells and tissues== 

Plant cells differentiate from undifferentiated [[meristem]]atic cells (analogous to the stem cells of animals) to form the major classes of cells and tissues of [[root]]s, [[plant stem|stems]], [[leaf|leaves]], [[flower]]s, and reproductive structures, each of which may be composed of several cell types.

===Parenchyma===
[[Ground tissue#Parenchyma| Parenchyma cells]] are living cells that have  functions ranging from storage and support to [[photosynthesis]] ([[mesophyll]] cells) and phloem loading ([[transfer cells]]). Apart from the xylem and phloem in their vascular bundles, leaves are composed mainly of parenchyma cells. Some parenchyma cells, as in the epidermis, are specialized for light penetration and focusing or regulation of [[gas exchange]], but others are among the least specialized cells in plant tissue, and may remain [[totipotent]], capable of dividing to produce new populations of undifferentiated cells, throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=Haberlandt&gt;{{cite journal |first=Haberlandt |last=G. |date=1902 |title=Kulturversuche mit isolierten Pflanzenzellen |journal=Mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien Sitzungsberichte |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=69–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenchyma cells have thin, permeable primary walls enabling the transport of small molecules between them, and their cytoplasm is responsible for a wide range of biochemical functions such as [[nectar]] [[secretion]], or the manufacture of [[secondary metabolite|secondary products]] that discourage [[herbivory]]. Parenchyma cells that contain many chloroplasts and are concerned primarily with photosynthesis are called [[chlorenchyma]] cells. Others, such as the majority of the parenchyma cells in [[potato]] [[tubers]] and the [[seed]] [[cotyledons]] of [[legumes]], have a storage function.

===Collenchyma===
[[Ground tissue#Collenchyma|Collenchyma cells]] – collenchyma cells are alive at maturity and have thickened cellulosic cell walls.&lt;ref name=Cutter/&gt; These cells mature from meristem derivatives that initially resemble parenchyma, but differences quickly become apparent. Plastids do not develop, and the secretory apparatus (ER and Golgi) proliferates to secrete additional primary wall. The wall is most commonly thickest at the corners, where three or more cells come in contact, and thinnest where only two cells come in contact, though other arrangements of the wall thickening are possible.&lt;ref name=Cutter/&gt; [[Pectin]] and [[hemicellulose]] are the dominant constituents of collenchyma cell walls of [[dicotyledon]] [[angiosperm]]s, which may contain as little as 20% of cellulose in ''[[Petasites]]''.&lt;ref name=Roelofsen&gt;{{cite book |first=PA |last=Roelofsen |date=1959 |title=The plant cell wall |publisher=Gebrüder Borntraeger |location=Berlin |asin=B0007J57W0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collenchyma cells are typically quite elongated, and may divide transversely to give a septate appearance. The role of this cell type is to support the plant in axes still growing in length, and to confer flexibility and tensile strength on tissues. The primary wall lacks lignin that would make it tough and rigid, so this cell type provides what could be called plastic support – support that can hold a young stem or petiole into the air, but in cells that can be stretched as the cells around them elongate. Stretchable support (without elastic snap-back) is a good way to describe what collenchyma does. Parts of the strings in celery are collenchyma.

===Sclerenchyma===
[[Ground tissue#Sclerenchyma|Sclerenchyma]] is a tissue composed of two types of cells, [[sclereid]]s and [[fibres]] that have thickened, [[lignin|lignified]] secondary walls&lt;ref name=Cutter&gt;{{cite book|first=EG |last=Cutter |date=1977 |title=Plant Anatomy Part 1. Cells and Tissues |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |isbn=0713126388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} laid down inside of the [[primary cell wall]]. The secondary walls harden the cells and make them impermeable to water. Consequently, scereids and fibres are typically dead at functional maturity, and the cytoplasm is missing, leaving an empty central cavity.  [[Sclereid]]s or stone cells, (from the Greek '''skleros''', ''hard'') are hard, tough cells that give leaves or fruits a gritty texture. They may discourage herbivory by damaging digestive passages in small insect larval stages. Sclereids form the hard pit wall of peaches and many other fruits, providing physical protection to the developing kernel. [[Fibre]]s are elongated cells with lignified secondary walls that provide load-bearing support and tensile strength to the leaves and stems of herbaceous plants. Sclerenchyma fibres are not involved in conduction, either of water and nutrients (as in the [[xylem]]) or of carbon compounds (as in the [[phloem]]), but it is likely that they evolved as modifications of xylem and phloem initials in early land plants.

===Xylem===
[[Xylem]] is a complex vascular tissue composed of water-conducting [[tracheid]]s or [[vessel elements]], together with fibres and parenchyma cells. Tracheids &lt;ref name=Tyree&gt;MT Tyree; MH Zimmermann (2003) Xylem structure and the ascent of sap, 2nd edition, Springer-Verlag, New York USA&lt;/ref&gt; are elongated cells with lignified secondary thickening of the cell walls, specialised for conduction of water, and first appeared in plants during their transition to land in the [[Silurian]] period more than 425 million years ago (see ''[[Cooksonia (plant)|Cooksonia]]''). The possession of xylem tracheids defines the [[vascular plants]] or Tracheophytes. Tracheids are pointed, elongated xylem cells, the simplest of which have continuous primary cell walls and lignified secondary wall thickenings in the form of rings, hoops, or reticulate networks. More complex tracheids with valve-like perforations called [[pit (botany)|bordered pits]] characterise the gymnosperms. The [[fern]]s and other [[pteridophyte]]s and the [[gymnosperm]]s have only xylem [[tracheid]]s, while the [[angiosperms|flowering plants]] also have [[vessel element|xylem vessel]]s. Vessel elements are hollow xylem cells without end walls that are aligned end-to-end so as to form long continuous tubes. The bryophytes lack true xylem tissue, but their [[sporophyte]]s have a water-conducting tissue known as the hydrome that is composed of elongated cells of simpler construction.

===Phloem===
[[Phloem]] is a specialised tissue for food transport in higher plants, mainly transporting [[sucrose]] along pressure gradients generated by osmosis, a phenomenon called [[Translocation (Botany)|translocation]]. Phloem is a complex tissue, consisting of two main cell types, the [[sieve tube element|sieve tubes]] and the intimately associated [[companion cell]]s, together with parenchyma cells, phloem fibres and sclereids.&lt;ref name=Cutter/&gt;{{rp|171}} Sieve tubes are joined end-to-end with perforate end-plates between known as ''[[sieve plate]]s'', which allow transport of photosynthate between the sieve elements. The sieve tube elements lack [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] and [[ribosome]]s, and their metabolism and functions are regulated by the adjacent nucleate companion cells. The companion cells, connected to the sieve tubes via [[plasmodesmata]], are responsible for loading the phloem with [[sugar]]s. The [[bryophyte]]s lack phloem, but [[moss]] [[sporophyte]]s have a simpler tissue with analogous function known as the leptome.

[[File:Epidermal Cells of Plant Leaf..jpg|thumb|This is an electron micrograph of the epidermal cells of a Brassica chinensis leaf.  The stomates are also visible.]]

===Epidermis===
The [[Epidermis (botany)|plant epidermis]] is specialised tissue, composed of parenchyma cells, that covers the external surfaces of leaves, stems and roots. Several cell types may be present in the epidermis. Notable among these are the stomatal guard cells that control the rate of [[Gas exchange#Plants|gas exchange]] between the plant and the atmosphere, glandular and clothing hairs or [[trichome]]s, and the [[root hair]]s of primary roots.  In the shoot epidermis of most plants, only the [[stomata|guard cells]] have chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll  which is needed for photosynthesis.  The epidermal cells of aerial organs arise from the superficial layer of cells known as the ''tunica'' (L1 and L2 layers) that covers the plant [[meristem|shoot apex]],&lt;ref name="Cutter"/&gt; whereas the cortex and vascular tissues arise from innermost layer of the shoot apex known as the ''corpus'' (L3 layer). The epidermis of roots originates from the layer of cells immediately beneath the root cap. The epidermis of all aerial organs, but not roots, is covered with a [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] made of [[polyester]] [[cutin]] or polymer [[Cutan (polymer)|cutan]] (or both), with a superficial layer of [[epicuticular wax]]es. The epidermal cells of the primary shoot are thought to be the only plant cells with the biochemical capacity to synthesize cutin.&lt;ref name="Kolattukudy 1996"&gt;Kolattukudy, PE (1996) Biosynthetic pathways of cutin and waxes, and their sensitivity to environmental stresses.

== History ==
Robert A. W. Carleton graduated among the Class of 1904 with a degree of civil engineer from the School of Applied Science. After graduating, Carleton served as the lifetime Class President of the Class of 1904; Chairman of the Columbia University Engineering Center Fund Committee, the committee responsible for raising the funds to build engineering and science buildings on the Northeast corner of Columbia University's Morningside Campus; President of the Columbia Engineering Council; and a member of The Society of Older Graduates of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Columbia Needs Laboratory Space|last=|first=|date=14 January 1923|work=|page=RE1|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=COLUMBIA TO ERECT ENGINEERING CENTER COSTING $20,000,000|last=|first=|date=22 January 1932|work=The New York Times|pages=1, 3|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carleton also co-founded The Carleton Company, Inc. in the 1920s. The engineering firm that took part in the construction of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], [[Long Island Rail Road|Long Island Railroad]], the [[New York City Subway]] that ran under Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, and the [[Holland Tunnel]]. Carleton was lauded for his ability to work on these transportation hubs without interrupting regular service. In 1941 Carleton negotiated with the United States Government so that The Carleton Company Inc. could build the largest receiving and distributing centers to support war efforts by facilitating the transfer of materials during the Second World War.
[[File:Carleton Lab Bronze Plaque.jpg|thumb|281x281px|Bronze plaque located at the entrance of the laboratory, officially dedicating the space as the Robert A. W. Carleton Strength of Materials Laboratory.]]
Robert Carleton was appointed the head of the Engineering Center Development Fund Committee, which oversaw the fundraising and design of what would become the [[Seeley W. Mudd|Seeley Wintersmith Mudd]] and the Engineering Terrace buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Head of Columbia Drive For Engineering Center|last=|first=|date=8 November 1953|work=The New York Times|page=55|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Robert A. W. Carleton, Engineer On Major Tunnels in City, Dies|last=|first=|date=30 March 1971|work=The New York Times|page=38|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership, construction of the facility was completed in six months. On 4 April 1959, Carleton was awarded the [[Thomas Egleston|Egleston Medal]], Columbia University’s highest award for distinguished engineering achievement due to the breadth of engineering work undertaken during his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Engineer Here Chosen for Honor at Columbia|last=|first=|date=22 March 1959|work=The New York Times|page=48|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the Trustees of the University authorized the establishment of the Robert A. W. Carleton Strength of Materials Laboratory in the department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, due to the support of Robert A. W. (1881–1971) and his wife Christine S. Carleton (1905–1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=$8.3 Million Bequest Received at Columbia|last=|first=|date=30 September 1984|work=The New York Times|page=43|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=COLUMBIA TO INSTALL HUGE TESTING MACHINE|last=|first=|date=20 January 1930|work=The New York Times|page=18|access-date=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, the Columbia Engineering Alumni Association commissioned a portrait of Carleton, painted by artist [[Lester W. Bentley|Lester Bentley]]. The painting was dedicated and given a place inside the Monnell Engineering Library in the Seeley W. Mudd Building in December 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=PULSE: Columbia University Newsletter|last=|first=|date=8 December 1970|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This painting has since been moved into Carleton Lab and placed at the top of the staircase on the main floor.

Robert A. W. Carleton died in 1971, but his wife continued to support Carleton Lab and Columbia Engineering in her husband’s name until her death in 1983.

The '''Royal Belgian Entomological Society''' is a learned society based in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] which is devoted to [[entomology]], the study of insects. It was founded on 9 April 1855.
 
The society has several publications: the ''Bulletin'', the ''Belgian Journal of Entomology'' and the ''Mémoires''.

Its first president was [[Edmond de Sélys Longchamps]] (1813-1900).

'''Scale analysis''' (or '''order-of-magnitude analysis''') is a powerful tool used in the [[mathematical sciences]] for the simplification of [[equation]]s with many terms. First the approximate magnitude of individual terms in the equations is determined. Then some negligibly small terms may be ignored.

==Example: vertical momentum in synoptic-scale meteorology==

Consider for example the [[Primitive equations|momentum equation]] of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in the vertical coordinate direction of the atmosphere

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial w }\over{\partial t }} + u {\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}} + v {\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}} + w {\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}} - {\frac{u^2 + v^2}{R}}= - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}}} - g +2{\Omega u \cos \varphi} + \nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial y^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z^2}}\right),\qquad(1)  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is [[Earth]] radius, &amp;Omega; is [[frequency]] of rotation of the Earth, ''g'' is [[gravitational acceleration]], &amp;phi; is  latitude, &amp;rho; is [[density]] of air and &amp;nu; is [[viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] of air (we can neglect turbulence in [[free atmosphere]]).

In [[synoptic scale]] we can expect horizontal velocities about ''U'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and vertical about ''W'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Horizontal scale is ''L'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m and vertical scale is ''H'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m.  Typical time scale is ''T'' = ''L''/''U'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s.  Pressure differences in troposphere  are ''ΔP'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa and density of air &amp;rho; = 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Other physical properties are approximately:

:''R'' = 6.378 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m;

:&amp;Omega; = 7.292 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; rad&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1;&lt;/sup&gt;

:&amp;nu; = 1.46 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1;&lt;/sup&gt;

:''g'' = 9.81 m&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2.&lt;/sup&gt;

Estimates of the different terms in equation (1) can be made using their scales:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{{\partial w }\over{\partial t }} &amp;\sim \frac{W}{T} \\[1.2ex]
u {\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}} &amp;\sim U\frac{W}{L} &amp;\qquad
v {\frac{\partial w}{\partial y}} &amp;\sim U\frac{W}{L} &amp;\qquad
w {\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}} &amp;\sim W\frac{W}{H} \\[1.2ex]
{\frac{u^2}{R}} &amp;\sim \frac{U^2}{R} &amp;\qquad
{\frac{v^2}{R}} &amp;\sim \frac{U^2}{R} \\[1.2ex]
\frac{1}{\varrho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} &amp;\sim \frac{1}{\varrho}\frac{\Delta P}{H} &amp;\qquad
\Omega u \cos \varphi &amp;\sim \Omega U \\[1.2ex]
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{L^2} &amp;\qquad
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial y^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{L^2} &amp;\qquad
\nu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z^2} &amp;\sim \nu \frac{W}{H^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can introduce these scales and their values into equation (1):

:&lt;math&gt;
{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^5}}+10{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^6}}
+10{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^6}}
+10^{-2}{\frac{10^{-2}}{10^4}}
-{\frac{10^2+10^2}{10^6}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- extra blank line between lines of "displayed" TeX, for legibility --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
= - {{\frac{1}{1}} {\frac{10^4}{10^4}} } - 10 + 2 \times 10^{-4} \times 10 + 10^{-5} \left({\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{12}}} + {\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{12}}} + {\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{8}}}  \right).
\qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that all terms — except the first and second on the right-hand side — are negligibly small. Thus we can simplify the vertical momentum equation to the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] equation:

:&lt;math&gt;{ { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}}} = - g. \qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

==Rules of scale analysis==
Scale analysis is very useful and widely used tool for solving problems in the area of heat transfer and fluid mechanics, pressure-driven wall jet, separating flows behind backward-facing steps, jet diffusion flames, study of linear and non-linear dynamics. Scale analysis is recommended as the premier method for obtaining the most information per unit of intellectual effort, despite the fact that it is a precondition for good analysis in dimensionless form. The object of scale analysis is to use the basic principles of convective heat transfer to produce order-of-magnitude estimates for the quantities of interest. Scale analysis anticipates within a factor of order one when done properly, the expensive results produced by exact analyses. Scale analysis ruled as follows:

'''Rule1-''' First step in scale analysis is to define the domain of extent in which we apply scale analysis. Any scale analysis of a flow region that is not uniquely defined is not valid.

'''Rule2-''' One equation constitutes an equivalence between the scales of two dominant terms appearing in the equation. For example,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho c_P {{\partial T }\over{\partial t }} = k {\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

In the above example, the left-hand side could be of equal order of magnitude as the right-hand side.

'''Rule3-''' If in the sum of two terms given by

:&lt;math&gt; c = a+b  &lt;/math&gt;

the order of magnitude of one term is greater than order of magnitude of the other term

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) &gt; O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

then the order of magnitude of the sum is dictated by the dominant term

:&lt;math&gt; O(c) = O(a)  &lt;/math&gt;

The same conclusion holds if we have the difference of two terms

:&lt;math&gt; c = a-b &lt;/math&gt;

'''Rule4-''' In the sum of two terms, if two terms are same order of magnitude,

:&lt;math&gt; c = a+b  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) = O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

then the sum is also of same order of magnitude:

:&lt;math&gt; O(a) \thicksim O(b) \thicksim O(c)  &lt;/math&gt;

'''Rule5-''' In case of product of two terms

:&lt;math&gt; p=ab &lt;/math&gt;

the order of magnitude of the product is equal to the product of the orders of magnitude of the two factors

:&lt;math&gt; O(p) = O(a)O(b)  &lt;/math&gt;

for ratios

:&lt;math&gt; r = \frac{a}{b}  &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt; O(r) = \frac{O(a)}{O(b)}  &lt;/math&gt;

here O(a) represents the order of magnitude of a.

~ represents two terms are of same order of magnitude.

&gt; represents greater than, in the sense of order-of-magnitude.

==Scale analysis of fully developed flow==

Consider the steady laminar flow of a viscous fluid inside a circular tube. Let the fluid enter with a uniform velocity over the flow across section. As the fluid moves down the tube a boundary layer of low-velocity fluid forms and grows on the surface because the fluid immediately adjacent to the surface have zero velocity. A particular and simplifying feature of viscous flow inside cylindrical tubes is the fact that the boundary layer must meet itself at the tube centerline, and the velocity distribution then establishes a fixed pattern that is invariant. Hydrodynamic entrance length is that part of the tube in which the momentum boundary layer grows and the velocity distribution changes with length. The fixed velocity distribution in the fully developed region is called fully developed velocity profile.
The steady-state continuity and conservation of momentum equations in two-dimensional are

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial u }\over{\partial x }} + {\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}}=0 , \qquad(1)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; u {{\partial u }\over{\partial x }} + v {\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}} = - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}}} + 
\nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}}\right),\qquad(2)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; u {{\partial v }\over{\partial x }} + v {\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}} = - { { \frac{1}{\varrho}}{\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}}} + 
\nu \left({\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}}+{\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}}\right),\qquad(3)  &lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be simplified by using scale analysis. At any point &lt;math&gt;x\sim L &lt;/math&gt; in fully developed zone, we have &lt;math&gt;y\sim\delta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u\sim U_\infty &lt;/math&gt;. Now, from equation(1), 
the transverse velocity component in fully developed region simplified using scaling as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
v &amp;\sim {\frac{U_{\infty} \delta}{L}}  \qquad(4) 
\end{align} 
&lt;/math&gt;
In fully developed region the section of the duct flow far from inlet such that scale of transverse velocity component v is negligible(L&gt;&gt;d).So, in fully developed flow limit, 
continuity equation requires

:&lt;math&gt;v=0,  {{\partial u }\over{\partial x }}=0  \qquad(5)  &lt;/math&gt;

Based on equation(5), the y momentum equation eq3 reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;{{\partial P }\over{\partial y }}=0  \qquad(6)  &lt;/math&gt;

this means that P is function of x only. From this, the x momentum equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;{{d P }\over{d x }}=\mu {{d^2 u}\over{d y^2 }}=constant \qquad(7)  &lt;/math&gt;

Each term should be constant, because left side is function of x only and right is function of y. Solving equation(7) subject to the boundary condition

:&lt;math&gt; u=0, y=\pm \frac{D}{2}  \qquad(8) &lt;/math&gt;

this results in the well-known Hagen–Poiseuille solution for fully developed flow between parallel plates.

:&lt;math&gt; u=\frac{3}{2}U[1-{(\frac{y}{D/2})}^2]  \qquad(9) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; U=\frac{D^2}{12\mu}(-\frac{dP}{dx})  \qquad(10) &lt;/math&gt;

where y is measured away from the center of the channel. The velocity is to be parabolic and is proportional to the pressure per unit duct length in the direction of the flow.

'''Semiotics of culture''' is a research field within [[semiotics]] that attempts to define [[culture]] from semiotic perspective and as a type of human symbolic activity, creation of [[sign]]s and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a [[system]] of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as '''semiotics of culture and language'''. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.

The research field was of particular interest for the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]] ([[USSR]]). Linguists and semioticians by the Tartu School viewed culture as a hierarchical semiotic system consisting of set of functions correlated to it, and linguistic codes that are used by social groups to maintain coherence. These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central.

The study received a research ground also in [[Japan]] where the idea that culture and nature should not be contrasted and contradicted but rather harmonized was developed.

== Techniques ==
It is possible to amplify software diversity through automated transformation processes that create synthetic diversity. Fred Cohen was among the very early promoters of such an approach. He proposed a series of rewriting and code reordering transformations that aim at producing massive quantities of different versions of operating systems functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Frederick B.|date=1993|title=Operating system protection through program evolution|url=http://all.net/books/tech/evolve.pdf|journal=Computers &amp; Security|volume=12|issue=6|pages=565–584|doi=10.1016/0167-4048(93)90054-9|issn=0167-4048|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have been developed over the years and have led to the construction of integrated obfuscation schemes to protect key functions in large software systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chenxi Wang|first=|last2=Davidson|first2=J.|last3=Hill|first3=J.|last4=Knight|first4=J.|date=|title=Protection of software-based survivability mechanisms|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a466288.pdf|journal=Proceedings International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE Comput. Soc|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1109/dsn.2001.941405|isbn=0769511015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to increase software diversity of protection consists in adding randomness in certain core processes, such as memory loading. Randomness implies that all versions of the same program run differently from each other, which in turn creates a diversity of program behaviors. This idea was initially proposed and experimented by Stephanie Forrest and her colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forrest|first=S.|last2=Somayaji|first2=A.|last3=Ackley|first3=D.H.|date=|title=Building diverse computer systems|url=https://www.cs.unm.edu/~forrest/publications/old-hotos-97.pdf|journal=Proceedings. The Sixth Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (Cat. No.97TB100133)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE Comput. Soc.

Recent work on automatic software diversity explores different forms of program transformations that slightly vary the behavior of programs. The goal is to evolve one program into a population of diverse programs that all provide similar services to users, but with a different code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulte|first=Eric|last2=Fry|first2=Zachary P.|last3=Fast|first3=Ethan|last4=Weimer|first4=Westley|last5=Forrest|first5=Stephanie|date=2013-07-28|title=Software mutational robustness|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~zpf5a/papers/Schulte_mutation.pdf|journal=Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=281–312|doi=10.1007/s10710-013-9195-8|issn=1389-2576|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baudry|first=Benoit|last2=Allier|first2=Simon|last3=Monperrus|first3=Martin|date=2014-07-21|title=Tailored source code transformations to synthesize computationally diverse program variants|lay-url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2610384.2610415|publisher=ACM|pages=149–159|doi=10.1145/2610384.2610415|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00938855/document}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity of code enhances the protection of users against one single attack that could crash all programs at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9615">{{about|life cycles of fungi||Anamorph (disambiguation)}}
In [[mycology]], the terms '''teleomorph''', '''anamorph''', and '''holomorph''' apply to portions of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]] of [[fungi]] in the [[Phylum|phyla]] [[Ascomycota]] and [[Basidiomycota]]:

*'''Teleomorph''': the sexual reproductive stage (morph), typically a [[Ascocarp|fruiting body]]
*'''Anamorph''': an asexual reproductive stage (morph), often [[mold]]-like; When a single fungus produces multiple morphologically distinct anamorphs, these are called '''synanamorphs'''.
*'''Holomorph''': the whole fungus, including anamorphs and teleomorph.

==Dual naming of fungi==
[[Fungus|Fungi]] are classified primarily based on the structures associated with [[sexual reproduction]], which tend to be  conserved. However, many fungi reproduce only asexually, and cannot be easily placed in a classification based on sexual characters; some produce both asexual and sexual states. These problematic species are often members of the [[Ascomycota]], but a few of them belong to the [[Basidiomycota]]. Even among fungi that reproduce both sexually and asexually, often only one method of reproduction can be observed at a specific point in time or under specific conditions. Additionally, fungi typically grow in mixed colonies and sporulate amongst each other. These facts have made it very difficult to link the various states of the same fungus.

Fungi that are not known to produce a teleomorph were historically placed into an artificial [[phylum]], the "[[Deuteromycota]]", also known as "Fungi Imperfecti", simply for convenience. Some workers hold that this is an obsolete concept, and that [[molecular phylogeny]] allows accurate placement of species which are only known from part of their life cycle.  Others retain the term deuteromycetes, but give it a lowercase "d" and no taxonomic rank.&lt;ref name="guarro"&gt;{{citation | pmc = 100249 | pmid = 10398676 |date=Jul 1999 |author1=Guarro, J |author2=Genéj |author3=Stchigel, Am | title = Developments in fungal taxonomy | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 454–500 | issn = 0893-8512 | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | url = http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10398676 | format = Free full text }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Article 59 of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] permitted mycologists to give asexually reproducing fungi (anamorphs) separate names from their sexual states (teleomorphs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/frameset/0064Ch6NoFa59.htm Article 59] of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]&lt;/ref&gt; but this practice was discontinued as of 1 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

The dual naming system can be confusing for novices. It is essential for workers in plant pathology, mold identification, medical mycology, and food microbiology, fields in which asexually reproducing fungi are commonly encountered.

== From dual system to single nomenclature ==
The separate names for anamorphs of fungi with a pleomorphic life-cycle has been an issue of debate since the phenomenon was recognized in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; This was even before the first international [[Nomenclature codes|rules for botanical nomenclature]] were issued in 1867.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; Special provisions are to be found in the earliest ''Codes'', which were then modified several times, and often substantially.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; The rules have been updated regularly and become increasingly complex, and by the mid-1970s they were being interpreted in different ways by different [[mycologist]]s – even ones working on the same genus.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; Following intensive discussions under the auspices of the [[International Mycological Association]], drastic changes were made at the [[International Botanical Congress]] in 1981 to clarify and simplify the procedures – and the now terms anamorph, teleomorph, and holomorph entered general use.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; An unfortunate effect of the simplification was that many name changes had to be made, including for some well-known and economically important species; at that date, the [[Conserved name|conservation of species names]].&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

Unforeseen in the 1970s, when the 1981 provisions were crafted, was the impact of [[molecular systematics]].&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; A decade later, it was starting to become obvious that fungi with no known sexual stage could confidently be placed in genera which were typified by species in which the sexual stage was known.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; This possibility of abandoning the dual nomenclatural system was debated at subsequent [[International Mycological Congress]]es and on other occasions, and the need for change was increasingly recognized.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cannon | first1 = P. F. | last2 = Kirk | first2 = P. M. | year = 2000 | title = The philosophies and practicalities of amalgamating anamorph and teleomorph concepts | url = | journal = [[Studies in Mycology]] | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 19–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the International Botanical Congress in Vienna in 2005, some minor modifications were made which allowed anamorph-typified names to be [[epitype|epitypified]] by material showing the sexual stage when it was discovered, and for that anamorph name to continue to be used.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

The 1995 edition of the influential ''Ainsworth and Bisby’s Dictionary of the Fungi'' sought to replace the term anamorph with ''mitosporic fungus'' and teleomorph with ''meiosporic fungus'', based on the idea that the fundamental distinction is whether [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]] preceded sporulation.  This is a controversial choice because it is not clear that the morphological differences which traditionally define anamorphs and teleomorphs line up completely with sexual practices, or whether those sexual practices are sufficiently well understood in some cases.&lt;ref name="guarro"/&gt;

The Vienna Congress (2005) established a Special Committee to investigate the issue further, but it was unable to reach a consensus.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; Matters were becoming increasingly desperate as mycologists using [[molecular phylogenetic]] approaches started to ignore the provisions, or interpret them in different ways.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

==One fungus, one name==
The International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 made a change in the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' and adopted the principle "one fungus, one name".&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; After 1 January 2013, one fungus can only have one name; the system of permitting separate names to be used for anamorphs then ended.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;  This means that all [[Nomen illegitimum|legitimate names]] proposed for a species, regardless of what stage they are [[Type (biology)|typified]] by, can serve as the correct name for that species.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG  |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |chapter-url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=pf |chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All names now compete on an equal footing for [[Principle of Priority|priority]],&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; but in order not to render names for separate morphs as illegitimate, it was agreed that these should not be treated as superfluous alternative names in the sense of the ''Code''.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;  It was further decided that anamorph-typified names should not be taken up to displace widely used teleomorph-typified names until the case has been considered by the General Committee established by the Congress.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; It was decided that lists of names can be submitted to the General Committee and, after due scrutiny, names accepted on those lists are to be treated as conserved over competing synonyms (and listed as appendices to the ''Code'').&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt; [[Lichen]]-forming fungi (but not [[lichenicolous fungi]]) had always been excluded from the provisions permitting dual nomenclature.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"/&gt;

'''''The Sirian Experiments''''' is a 1980 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the third book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues the story of [[Earth]]'s [[evolution]], which has been manipulated from the beginning by advanced [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilisation]]s.&lt;ref name=BooksOfTheTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5DE143BF930A25752C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Sirian Experiments |first=John |last=Leonard |authorlink=John Leonard (American critic) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=13 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in the United States in December 1980 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in March 1981 by [[Jonathan Cape]]. The book was shortlisted for the [[List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/1981 |title=The Man Booker Prize 1981 |work=[[Booker Prize]] |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sirian Experiments'' relates directly to the first book in this series, ''[[Shikasta]]'', which is the history of the planet Shikasta (an allegorical Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, [[Canopus]], [[Sirius]] and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. ''Shikasta'' is told from the Canopean viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/shikastaby.html |title=Shikasta |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sirian Experiments'' (subtitled ''The Report by Ambien II, of the Five'') tells the story of Shikasta from the Sirian point of view and describes the activities of Sirians on the planet and the strained relations of Sirius with Canopus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/theexperiments.html |title=The Sirian Experiments |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessing stated in an [[afterword]] in the [[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8|next book]] in this series that ''The Sirian Experiments'' and ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' were inspired by her 50-year fascination with the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|1910–13 Antarctic expedition]] of [[Robert Falcon Scott]].{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DD1F38F93AA15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=29 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre and reception==
Because of its focus on characterisation and social/cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of technological details, ''The Sirian Experiments'' is not strictly science fiction but [[soft science fiction]], or "space fiction" as Lessing calls her ''Canopus in Argos'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} Robert Alter of ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre [[literary critic]] [[Northrop Frye]] called the "anatomy", which is "a combination of fantasy and morality" and that "presents us with a vision of the world in terms of a single intellectual pattern."&lt;ref name=NYTreview&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3D8173BF932A25752C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Doris Lessing in the Visionary Mode |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Robert |last=Alter |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=11 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessing has stated that she has used this series as a vehicle to "put questions, both to myself and to others" and to "explore ideas and sociological possibilities."{{sfn|Lessing|1994b|loc="Preface", p. 11}}

While Lessing's switch to "science fiction" in the late 1970s was not well received by all,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mural.uv.es/vemivein/feminismcommunism.htm |title=Doris Lessing on Feminism, Communism and 'Space Fiction' |work=[[University of Valencia]] Press |first=Lesley |last=Hazelton |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series in general has drawn positive criticism. Two reviews of ''The Sirian Experiments'' in ''The New York Times'' said that Lessing achieves "… a largeness of vision beyond the horizon of the conventional novel."&lt;ref name=NYTreview/&gt; and that it has "… some playful moments and some splendid ones. It is interesting, however, primarily because Doris Lessing wrote it."&lt;ref name=BooksOfTheTimes/&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on the other hand, which had spoken highly of the first two books in this series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947537,00.html |title=Visit to a Small Planet |first=Paul |last=Gray |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=22 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924037,00.html |title=Soul Mates |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Paul |last=Gray |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=21 April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; felt that this one "may be a small misstep on a long journey."&lt;ref name=TIMEreview&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949106,00.html |title=More Lessing |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Paul |last=Gray |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=23 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The Sirian Empire, centred in the [[Sirius]] star system, has advanced technology that made their citizens effectively immortal (barring accidents) and sophisticated machines that did almost everything for them. But this technology came at a price: many Sirians became afflicted with "the existentials", a debilitating malady that left them feeling worthless and with no reason to exist. To overcome this problem and give its people "something to do", Sirius embarked on a conquest of space and [[Colonisation|colonised]] many planets. But they also encroached on territory of the superior Canopean Empire that led to a costly war, which [[Canopus]] won. As a gesture of reconciliation, Canopus returned all the captured Sirian territory and invited Sirius to jointly colonise a new and promising planet called Rohanda (an allegorical [[Earth]]). Canopus took the northern continents and gave Sirius the southern continents.

Ambien II, one of the Five who run the Sirian Colonial Service and also govern the Sirian Empire, represents Sirius on Rohanda. She sets in motion a series of [[biology|bio]]-[[Sociology|sociological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] experiments where large numbers of primitive [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] from Sirian colonised planets are space-lifted to Rohanda and adapted there for work elsewhere in the Empire. In the north, Canopus nurtures Rohanda's bourgeoning [[humanoid]]s and accelerates their [[evolution]]. They also put a Lock on the planet that links it to the harmony and strength of the Canopean Empire. Canopus keeps Ambien II updated with reports of all their work, but she is suspicious of Sirius's former enemy, seeing them as a competitor rather than a partner, and is unable to correctly interpret them.

Then an unforeseen "cosmic re-alignment" breaks the Lock and Shammat of the malicious Puttiora Empire begins exploiting the situation by corrupting Rohanda's Natives. Canopus, seeing Rohanda decline, renames the planet [[Shikasta]] (the stricken). Sirius, unconcerned about Canopus's troubles in the north, continue to refer to the planet as Rohanda.

In an attempt to foster better relations with Sirius, Klorathy, a senior Canopean Colonial administrator, invites Ambien II to observe events in their territory. Ambien II, eager to learn more about Canopus, agrees. As Rohanda evolves and civilisations come and go, Ambien II and Klorathy meet several times to watch Rohanda's degeneration. Canopus does what it can to help communities, but with Shammat's evil and a broken Lock, they make little progress. From time to time Klorathy requests Ambien II's help and while working on the planet, she meets Nasar, another Canopean official. She also encounters Tafta, the Shammat commander on Rohanda, and at one point nearly succumbs to his corruption.

Ambien II eventually abandons the Sirian Experiments in the south when they are overrun by Shammat. The Five want her to abandon Rohanda altogether, but she has become too attached to the planet and is warming to Canopus and seeing the error of her (and Sirius's) ways. The Five question her ties to their former enemy, but when she tries to explain herself, they do not hear what she is saying, just as she initially could not hear what Canopus was saying. The Five then send her to Planet 13 on "corrective exile" to write a report on what has happened (this book). When she later releases the report, the Five issues a statement denying the authenticity of Ambien II's work.

'''Triploblasty''' is a condition of the [[blastula]] in which there are three primary [[germ layer]]s: the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]. A fourth "layer" consists of the germ cells that are set aside in the embryo at the blastula stage, which are incorporated into the gonads during organogenesis. The germ layers form during [[gastrulation]] of the [[blastula]]. Additionally, the term may refer to any ovum in which the [[blastoderm]] splits into three layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ravichandra|title=Plant Nematology|date=Jan 1, 2008|publisher=I. K.

All "higher" and "intermediate" animals, from [[flatworms]] to humans, are triploblastic and belong to the [[Bilateria]] subregnum.

Simpler animals qualified as ''[[diploblasty|diploblastic]]'', such as [[cnidaria]] (which includes jellyfish, corals and hydra), possess two germ layers. Even simpler animals, such as [[sponge]]s, contain no true tissues. The body wall of sponges consists mainly of two layers, [[pinacoderm]] and [[choanoderm]], and a non-cellular structure between these two layers called [[mesohyl]].

Triploblasts emerged within the [[Diploblast]]s.

{{distinguish|text=[[John DeFrancis|Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems]]}}

'''Visible Speech''' is  a system of phonetic symbols developed by [[Alexander Melville Bell]] in 1867 to represent the position of the speech organs in articulating sounds. Bell was known internationally as a teacher of speech and proper [[elocution]] and an author of books on the subject.  The system is composed of symbols that show the position and movement of the throat, tongue, and lips as they produce the sounds of language, and it is a type of [[phonetic transcription|phonetic notation]].  The system was used to aid the deaf in learning to speak.

In 1864 Melville promoted his first works on Visible Speech, in order to help the deaf both learn and improve upon their speech (since the profoundly deaf could not hear their own pronunciation).&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.192&lt;/ref&gt; To help promote the language, Bell created two written short forms using his system of 29 modifiers and tones, 52 [[consonant]]s, 36 [[vowel]]s and a dozen [[diphthong]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.193&lt;/ref&gt; they were named [[International English|World English]], which was similar to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], and also Line Writing, used as a shorthand form for [[stenographer]]s.&lt;ref name="Winzer 1993, pg.194"&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Melville's works on Visible Speech became highly notable, and were described by [[Édouard Séguin]] as being "...a greater invention than [[invention of the telephone|the telephone]] by his son, [[Alexander Graham Bell]]".&lt;ref name="Winzer 1993, pg.194"/&gt; Melville saw numerous applications for his invention, including its worldwide use as a [[universal language]].  However, although heavily promoted at the [[Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf]] in Milan, Italy in 1880, after a period of a dozen years or so in which it was applied to the education of the deaf, Visible Speech was found to be more cumbersome, and thus a hindrance, to the teaching of speech to the deaf, compared to other methods,&lt;ref&gt;Winzer 1993, pg.195–203&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually faded from use.

Bell's son [[Alexander Graham Bell]] learned the symbols, assisted his father in giving public demonstrations of the system and mastered it to the point that he later improved upon his father's work.  Eventually, Alexander Graham Bell became a powerful advocate of visible speech and [[oralism]] in the United States.  The money he earned from his patent of the [[telephone]] and the sale of his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] [[Volta_Laboratory_and_Bureau#Laboratory_patents|patents]] helped him to pursue this mission.

== The early years ==

In 1867, Alexander Melville Bell published the book ''Visible Speech: The Science of Universal Alphabetics''. This book contains information about the system of symbols he created that, when used to write words, indicated pronunciation so accurately, that it could even reflect regional accents.&lt;ref name="PKK"&gt;Potter, Kopp, and Kopp, 1966. ''Visible Speech''.&lt;/ref&gt; A person reading a piece of text handwritten in Melville Bell's system of characters could accurately reproduce a sentence the way it would be spoken by someone with a foreign or regional accent. In his demonstrations, Melville Bell employed his son, Alexander Graham Bell to read from the visible speech transcript of the volunteer's spoken words and would astound the audience by saying it back exactly as the volunteer had spoken it.

A few samples of the writing system invented by Melville Bell may be seen in the images on this page. These images depict Melville Bell's intention of creating a script in which the characters actually look like the position of the mouth when speaking them out loud. The system is useful not only because its visual representation mimicks the physical act of speaking, but because it does so, these symbols may be used to write words in any language, hence the name "Universal Alphabetics".&lt;ref name="M"&gt;Melville Bell, 1867. ''Visible Speech: The Science of Universal Alphabetics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melville Bell's system was effective at helping deaf people improve their pronunciation, but his son Graham Bell decided to improve upon his father's invention by creating a system of writing that was even more accurate and employed the most advanced technology of the time.

== A fresh take on pronunciation for the deaf ==

Alexander Graham Bell later devised another system of visual cues that also came to be known as visible speech, yet this system did not use symbols written on paper to teach deaf people how to pronounce words. Instead, Graham Bell's system, developed at his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C., involved the use of a [[spectrogram]], a device that makes "visible records of the frequency, intensity, and time analysis of short samples of speech".&lt;ref name="PKK"/&gt; The spectrogram translated sounds into readable patterns via a photographic process. This system was based on the idea that the eye should be able to read patterns of vocalizations in much the same way that the ear translates these vocalizations into meaning. [[Spectrogram|Modern implementations]] of Bell's idea display sound spectra in real time and are used in [[phonology]],&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Crowhurst, Phonology case studies, University of Texas at Austin 2006 [http://www.laits.utexas.edu/phonology/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[speech therapy]] and [[computer speech recognition]].

== Method ==

The idea of the use of a [[spectrograph]] to translate speech into a visual representation was created in the hopes of enabling the deaf to use a telephone.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;Kopp, 1967. ''Visible Speech Manual''.&lt;/ref&gt; If the sounds could be translated into something readable, then a deaf person at the receiving end could then read out the pattern of speech to determine its meaning without having to hear what was said. The spectrograph readings could also be used to teach pronunciation by having a person speak into the spectrograph and watch a small television-like screen to monitor the precision of their utterances.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;
