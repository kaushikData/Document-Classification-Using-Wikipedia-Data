'''Acoustic holography''' is a method for estimating the sound field near a source by measuring [[Acoustics|acoustic]] parameters away from the source by means of an array of [[pressure]] and/or [[particle velocity]] [[transducers]].  The Measuring techniques included in acoustic [[holography]] are becoming increasingly popular in various fields, most notably those of transportation, vehicle and aircraft design, and [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH).  The general idea of acoustic holography has led to different versions such as near-field acoustic holography (NAH) and statistically optimal near-field acoustic holography (SONAH).
For audio rendition, the [[wave field synthesis]] is the most related procedure.

==Life and career==
Albrecht graduated in 1979 from [[Cornell University]], [[Ithaca]] and was awarded a doctorate in 1983 at [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Philadelphia]] on cosmology. His thesis advisor was [[Paul Steinhardt]].

He later carried out post-doctoral research at [[University of Texas]], [[Austin]] and at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. Albrecht later worked at [[Fermilab]] from 1987 to 1992 and subsequently taught at [[Imperial College]], [[London]] from 1992 to 1998.

Albrecht is a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]] and [[Fellow of the Institute of Physics]] (UK).&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;

==Work==
Together with his thesis advisor, Albrecht developed New Inflation, solving the bubble collision problem of [[Alan Guth]]'s original model of inflation. Later, Albrecht studied the observable effects of cosmic [[topological defect]]s, contributing to ruling out [[cosmic strings]] as the dominant mechanism for structure formation.

Along with [[João Magueijo]], Albrecht independently proposed a model of [[Variable speed of light#The varying speed of light cosmology|varying speed of light cosmology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A time varying speed of light as a solution to cosmological puzzles |author=A.

In the 21st century, Albrecht worked on [[quantum mechanics]], as well as [[probability]] and quantum theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jacob Aron |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21728984.100-humble-coin-toss-thrust-to-heart-of-multiverse-debate.html |journal=New Scientist |title=Humble coin toss thrust to heart of multiverse debate |issue=2898 |date=Jan 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Anthrobotics''' is the science of developing and studying [[robot]]s that are either entirely or in some way human-like.

The term ''anthrobotics'' was originally coined by Mark Rosheim in a paper entitled "Design of An Omnidirectional Arm" presented at the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] International Conference on Robotics and Automation, May 13–18, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;2162–2167. Rosheim says he derived the term from "...[[Anthropomorphic]] and [[Robotics]] to distinguish the new generation of dexterous robots from its simple industrial robot forebears." The word gained wider recognition as a result of its use in the title of Rosheim's subsequent book ''Robot Evolution: The Development of Anthrobotics'', which focussed on facsimiles of human physical and psychological skills and attributes.

However, a wider definition of the term ''anthrobotics'' has been proposed, in which the meaning is derived from ''[[anthropology]]'' rather than ''anthropomorphic''. This usage includes robots that respond to input in a human-like fashion, rather than simply mimicking human actions, thus theoretically being able to respond more flexibly or to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. This expanded definition also encompasses robots that are situated in social environments with the ability to respond to those environments appropriately, such as [[insect]] robots, robotic [[pet]]s, and the like.

Anthrobotics is now taught at some [[university|universities]], encouraging students not only to design and build robots for environments beyond current industrial applications, but also to speculate on the future of robotics that are embedded in the world at large, as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s are today. In 2016 philosopher [[Luis de Miranda]] created the Anthrobotics Cluster at the [[University of Edinburgh]] "a platform of cross-disciplinary research that seeks to investigate some of the biggest questions that will need to be answered"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurism.com/anthrobotics-where-the-human-ends-and-the-robot-begins/ |title=Anthrobotics: Where The Human Ends and the Robot Begins |publisher=Futurism |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the relationship between humans, robots and intelligent systems and "a think tank on the social spread of robotics, and also how automation is part of the definition of what humans have always been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robohub.org/unity-between-human-and-social-machines-what-if-we-humans-were-anthrobots/ |title=Unity Between Human &amp; Social Machines: What If We Humans Were Anthrobots? |publisher=Robohub |date= |accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the symbiotic relationship between humans and automated protocols.

'''Astakhov Glacier''' ({{coord|70|45|S|163|21|E|type:glacier_region:AQ_source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is the [[glacier]] next south of [[Chugunov Glacier]] in the [[Explorers Range]], [[Bowers Mountains]]. It flows northeast from [[Mount Hager]] and enters [[Ob' Bay]] just west of [[Platypus Ridge]], the glacier is situated in [[Victoria Land]], [[Antarctica]]. It was mapped by the [[United States Geological Survey]] from surveys and from [[U.S. Navy]] air photos, 1960&amp;ndash;65, and named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] for [[Petr Astakhov]], Soviet exchange scientist at the U.S. [[South Pole Station]] in 1967. The glacier lies on the Pennell Coast, a portion of Antarctica lying between [[Cape Williams]] and [[Cape Adare]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1725">'''Britton–Robinson buffer''' (aka BRB aka PEM) is a "universal" [[pH]] [[Buffer solution|buffer]] used for the range pH 2 to pH 12. Universal buffers consist of mixtures of acids of diminishing strength (increasing [[Acid dissociation constant|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]]) so that the change in pH is approximately proportional to the amount of alkali added. It consists of a mixture of 0.04 M [[boric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], 0.04 M [[Phosphoric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and 0.04 M [[Acetic acid|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH]] that has been titrated to the desired pH with 0.2 M [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]]. Britton and Robinson also proposed a second formulation that gave an essentially linear pH response to added alkali from pH 2.5 to pH 9.2 (and buffers to pH 12). This mixture consists of 0.0286 M [[citric acid]], 0.0286 M [[Monopotassium phosphate|KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], 0.0286 M H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0286 M [[Barbital|veronal]] and 0.0286 M [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] titrated with 0.2 M NaOH.

This was invented in 1931 by the English chemist Hubert Thomas Stanley "Kevin" Britton (1892&amp;ndash;1960) with the New Zealand chemist [[Robert Anthony Robinson]] (1904-1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/jr?issueid=jr1931_0_0 |title=Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed) |year=1931 |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''COART''' (Coupled Ocean-Atmospheric Radiative Transfer code) - COART is established on the Coupled DIScrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (Coupled DISORT or CDISORT) code,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ao/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-45-28-7443&lt;/ref&gt; developed from [[DISORT]]. It is designed to simulate radiance (including water-leaving radiance) and irradiance (flux) at any levels in the atmosphere and ocean consistently.

[[File:Castle Romeo Runt Device 001.jpg|thumb|The ''Runt'' device]]
'''Castle Romeo''' was the code name given to one of the tests in the [[Operation Castle]] series of American [[Nuclear testing|nuclear tests]]. It was the first test of the [[Mark 17 nuclear bomb|TX-17]] [[thermonuclear weapon]] (initially the "emergency capability" EC-17), the first deployed thermonuclear bomb.

The so-called "runt" device was a weaponized "dry" [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] bomb, using [[lithium hydride|lithium deuteride]] fuel for the fusion stage of a [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|"staged" fusion bomb]], unlike the [[cryogenic]] liquid [[deuterium]] of the first-generation [[Ivy Mike]] fusion device.

Similar to the "Shrimp" device tested shortly before, in the [[Castle Bravo]] test, it differed from that device in using lithium deuteride derived from natural [[lithium]] (a mixture of [[lithium-6]] and [[lithium-7]] [[isotope]]s, with 7.5% of the former) as the source of the tritium and deuterium fusion fuels, as opposed to the relative high enrichment level of lithium (approximately 40% lithium-6) deuteride used in Bravo.

It was detonated on March 27, 1954, after several delays (which played havoc with the planned experimental measurements program) at [[Bikini Atoll]] of the [[Marshall Islands]], on a barge moored in the middle of the crater from the Castle Bravo test. It was the first such barge-based test, a necessity that had come about because the powerful thermonuclear devices completely obliterated the small islands following detonation.

Like the Bravo test, it "ran away" and produced far more than its predicted yield, and for the [[Castle Bravo#Cause of high yield|same reason]]—an unexpected participation of the common lithium-7 isotope in fusion reactions. Although it had been predicted to produce a yield of 4&amp;nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|megatons]] with a range of 1.5 to 7 megatons (before the results of the Bravo test caused an upgrade in the estimates, it had originally been estimated to produce 3–5 megatons), it actually produced a yield of 11 megatons, the third-largest test ever conducted by the U.S.

Like the Ivy Mike and Castle Bravo tests, a large percentage of the yield was produced by fast [[nuclear fission|fission]] of the natural [[uranium]] [[Nuclear weapons design#Tamper reflector|"tamper"]]; 7 megatons of the yield were from this source.

== Deployment ==

This became the first air-droppable thermonuclear device, the EC-17, of which only 5 were made and the first deployable staged radiation implosion [[Teller-Ulam]] thermonuclear weapon. This evolved into the [[Mark 17 nuclear bomb|Mk 17]] of which 200 were made. Both of these were huge devices, weighing 39,000 and 42,000 pounds respectively. As a result, they were only capable of being carried by the [[Convair B-36|B-36]]. They were also some of the largest yield devices deployed by [[Strategic Air Command]]—the EC-17 giving around 10&amp;nbsp;Mt and the Mk17 between 11 and 15&amp;nbsp;Mt. They were all out of service by August 1957.

==Fireball in popular culture==
One particular image of the Castle Romeo fireball (above, at right) has been one of the most highly reprinted images of a nuclear explosion, often serving as a stand-in for nuclear weapons in general for news stories, book covers, magazine articles, and even congressional reports (such as the [[Cox Report]]), likely because of its threatening appearance and extreme red, orange, and yellow hues. In many cases the fact that the explosion is of a US megaton-range weapon has not prevented it to be used to represent the arsenals of other states or weapons of far lower yields, which would have a very different appearance.

One prominent usage is as the backdrop for  [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Megadeth]]'s greatest hits compilation ''[[Greatest Hits: Back to the Start]]''. The image of Castle Romeo was also used on the cover of the New York hardcore music pioneers [[Cro-Mags]] debut album ''[[The Age of Quarrel]]''. It is also featured on the title screen of [[Team17]]'s turn-based artillery game ''[[Worms Armageddon]]''.

The Castle Romeo photos are sometimes confused with that of Castle Bravo; the two nuclear blasts looked very similar, and they were both conducted in the same location.

A '''circumscribed halo''' is a type of [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], an [[optical phenomenon]] typically in the form of a more or less oval ring that [[circumscribe]]s the circular [[22° halo]] centred on the [[sun]] or [[moon]].&lt;ref name="atoptics-tangent-arcs"&gt;{{cite web

}} (includes a fisheye photo of the phenomenon)&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other halos, it is slightly reddish on the inner edge, facing the sun or moon, and bluish on the outer edge.

The shape of the circumscribed halo is strongly dependent on the distance of the sun or moon above the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/circsalt.htm|title=Circumscribed Halo|website=www.atoptics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its top and bottom (i.e., the points directly below and above the sun or moon) always lie directly [[tangent]]ial to the 22° halo, but its left and right sides take on different shapes depending on solar (or lunar) elevation. At an elevation between about 35°–50°, the sides form two distinct, downward-drooping "lobes" outside of the 22° halo. As the sun or moon rises higher (between c. 50°–70°), the drooping diminishes towards a more regular oval shape. At an elevation of c. 70° or more, the shape of the circumscribed halo approaches a circle, and as such becomes nearly indistinguishable from the 22° halo, only to be identified by its tendency to show more saturated colors than the latter.&lt;ref name="meteoros" /&gt; When the sun or moon is at an elevation lower than c. 35°, the circumscribed halo breaks up into the [[upper tangent arc|upper tangent]] and [[lower tangent arc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/colsolat.htm|title=Tangent Arcs|website=www.atoptics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many definitions of co-production. One technical definition is that '''Co-production''' is where technical experts and other groups co-generate new knowledge and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Christenson. ''The Co-production of Archaeological Knowledge: The 	Essential Relationship of Amateurs and Professionals in 20th Century American Archaeology. Complutum (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) 24(2): 63-72, 2013 https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CMPL/article/view/43367&lt;/ref&gt; It is the dynamic interaction between [[technology and society]]. It has a long history, particularly arising out of radical theories of knowledge in the 1970s.

==Description==
Co-production forms part of [[Mode 2]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gibbons, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott and Martin Trow ''The New Production of Knowledge: The dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies'' Sage. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. ''States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order''.  Routledge.  2004. {{ISBN|978-0-415-40329-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbers, Hans. ''Inside the Politics of Technology: Agency and Normativity in the Co-Production of Technology and Society''.  Amsterdam University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|978-90-5356-756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term used in the [[sociology of science]] to describe one of the modes, or ways that knowledge is formed. In [[Mode 2]], science and technology studies the move from extreme [[technological determinism]] and [[social constructivism]], to a more systemic understanding of how technology and society ‘co-produce’ each other. Co-production is functionally comparable to the concepts of [[causality loop]], [[positive feedback]], and [[co-evolution]] – all of which describe how two or more variables of a system affect and essentially create each other, albeit with respect to different variables operating at different scales. And as with these other concepts, if used too broadly/uncritically, co-production risks [[noetic flatness]] – if technology and society co-produce each other equally, the justification for maintaining the boundary between them dissolves (in which case [[actor-network theory]] may be invoked). Unless overlapping sets of [[boundary-work]] are employed, co-production may also fail to account for power differentials within each variable, (in this case, within technology and society).

==Science, technology and society==
From a more [[Science, technology and society|STS]] perspective, [[Sheila Jasanoff]], has written that "Co-production is shorthand for the proposition that the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we chose to live in." Co-production draws on constitutive (such as [[Actor–network theory]]) and interactional work ([[Leviathan and the Air-Pump|such as the Edinburgh School]]) in [[Science, technology and society|STS]].  As a sensitizing concept, the idiom of co-production looks at four themes: "the emergence and stabilization of new techno-scientific objects and framings, the resolution of scientific and technical controversies; the processes by which the products of techno-science are made intelligible and portable across boundaries; and the adjustment of science’s cultural practices in response to the contexts in which science is done."  Studies employing co-production often follow the following pathways: "making identities, making institutions, making discourses, and making representations"&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order. Routledge. 2004 http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic251437.files/Fall%202007%20papers/Jasanoff_papers/Jasanoff_States_of_Knowledge_Ch2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crivitz''' is an [[impact crater]] on [[Mars]].  It is named after the small town of [[Crivitz]] in western [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Germany]]. The crater has a diameter of 6.1 kilometers and is located at 14.5 deg south and 174.7 deg east, within the larger crater [[Gusev (Mars crater)|Gusev]].

The name was proposed by Stephan Gehrke in 2002, at the time a research associate of the [[TU Berlin]] working on cartographic software and a visiting researcher at the [[United States Geological Survey]].

'''Discoverability''' is the degree to which of something, especially a piece of content or information, can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system. Discoverability is a concern in [[library and information science]], many aspects of digital media, software and web development, and in marketing, since something (e.g., a website, product, service, etc.) cannot be used if people cannot find it or do not understand what it can be used for. [[Metadata]], or "information about information," such as a book's title, a product's description, or a website's keywords, affects how discoverable something is on a database or online. In the 2010s, adding metadata to a product that is available online can make it easier for [[end user]]s to find the product. For example, if a song file is made available online, making the title, name of the band, genre, year of release, and other pertinent information available in connection with this song file will make it easier for users to find this song file. Organizing information by putting it into alphabetical order or including it in a search engine is an example of how to improve discoverability. Discoverability is related to, but different from, [[accessibility]] and [[usability]], other qualities that affect the usefulness of a piece of information.
==Etymology==
The concept of "discoverability" in an information science and online context is a loose borrowing from the concept of the similar name in the legal profession. In law, "discovery" is a pre-trial procedure in a [[lawsuit]] in which each party, through the law of [[civil procedure]], can obtain evidence from the other party or parties by means of discovery devices such as a request for answers to [[interrogatories]], [[Request for production|request for production of document]]s, request for admissions and [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Conducting Discovery in a Civil Lawsuit|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/civil-litigation/conducting-discovery-civil-lawsuit|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=30 September 2017|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using [[subpoena]]s.  When a discovery request is objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a [[motion to compel]] discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwarzner|first1=William W.|title=The Federal Rules, the Adversary Process, and Discovery Reform|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|date=1988|volume=50|page=703|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/upitt50&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The usability of any piece of information directly relates to how discoverable it is, either in a "[[walled garden (technology)|walled garden]]" database or on the open Internet. The quality of information available on this database or on the Internet depends upon the quality of the meta-information about each item, product, or service. In the case of a service, because of the emphasis placed on service reusability, opportunities should exist for reuse of this service. However, reuse  is only possible if information is discoverable in the first place. To make items, products, and services discoverable, the following set of activities need to be performed:

# Document the information about the item, product or service (the metadata) in a consistent manner.
# Store the documented information (metadata) in a searchable repository.
# Enable yourself and others to search for the documented information in an efficient manner.

Regarding number 2, storing the information in a searchable repository: while technically a human-searchable repository, such as a printed paper list would qualify, in the 2010s, "searchable repository" is usually taken to mean a computer-searchable repository, such as a [[database]] that a human user can search using some type of [[search engine]] or "find" feature. Number 3 further supports this analysis of number 2, because while reading through a printed paper list by hand might be feasible in a theoretical sense, it is not time and cost-efficient in comparison with computer-based searching.

Apart from increasing the reuse potential of the services, discoverability is also required to avoid development of solution logic that is already contained in an existing service. To design services that are not only discoverable but also provide interpretable information about their capabilities, the service discoverability principle provides guidelines that could be applied during the [[Service-oriented modeling|service-oriented analysis]] phase of the service delivery process.

===Specific to digital media===
In relation to audiovisual content, according to the meaning given by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) for the purpose of its 2016 Discoverability Summit, discoverability can be summed up to the intrinsic ability of given content to "stand out of the lot", or to position itself so as to be easily found and discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discoverability Summit|url=http://www.discoverability.ca|website=Discoverability Summit|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A piece of audiovisual content can be a movie, a TV series, music, a book ([[eBook]]), an audio book or podcast. When audiovisual content such as a digital file for a TV show, movie, or song, is made available online, if the content is "tagged" with identifying information such as the names of the key artists (e.g., actors, directors and screenwriters for TV shows and movies; singers, musicians and record producers for songs) and the genres (e.g., for movies genres such as action, drama or comedy; for songs, genres such as heavy metal music, hip hop music, etc.), this makes it easier for end users to find the content they are interested in.

In the 2010s, when users interact with online content, [[algorithm]]s typically determine what types of content the user is interested in, and then a computer program suggests "more like this", which is other content that the user may be interested in. Different websites and systems have different algorithms, but one approach, used by Amazon for its online store, is to indicate to a user, once the user searches for or looks at content/product ''x'' that "other users who purchased ''x'' also purchased the following items". This example is oriented around online purchasing behaviour, but an algorithm could also be programmed to provide suggestions based on other factors (e.g., searching, viewing, etc.). 

In the 2010s, discoverability is typically referred to in connection with [[search engine]]s. A highly "discoverable" piece of content (e.g., a certain movie) would be a movie that appears at the top, or near the top of a user's search results. A related concept is the role of "recommendation engines", which are computer programs which give a user recommendations based on his/her online activity. In the 2010s, "discoverabilty" applies to desktop and laptop computers and do the increasingly widening range of devices that can access the Internet, including various [[console video game]] systems and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. When organizations make an effort to promote certain content (e.g., a TV show, film, song, or video game), they can use "traditional marketing" (billboards, TV ads, radio ads) and digital ads (pop-up ads, pre-roll ads, etc.), or a mix of traditional and digital marketing.

Even before the user’s intervention by searching for a certain content or type of content, discoverability is the prime factor which contributes to whether a piece of audiovisual content will be likely to be found in the various digital modes of content consumption. As of 2017, modes of searching include looking on [[Netflix]] for movies, [[Spotify]] for music, Audible for audio books, etc., although the concept can also more generally be applied to content found on [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Instagram]] and other websites. It involves more than a content’s mere presence on a given platform; it can involve associating this content with "keywords" (tags), search algorithms, positioning within different categories, metadata, etc. Thus, discoverability enables as much as it promotes. For audiovisual content broadcast or streamed on digital media using the Internet, discoverability includes the underlying concepts of information science and programming architecture, which are at the very foundation of the search for a specific product, information or content.

==Applications==

===Within a webpage===
Within a specific webpage or software application ("app"), the discoverability of a feature, content or link depends on a range of factors, including the size, colour, highlighting features, and position within the page. When colour is used to communicate the importance of a feature or link, designers typically use other elements as well, such as shadows or bolding, for individuals who cannot see certain colours. Just as traditional paper printing created other physical locations that stood out, such as being "above the fold" of a newspaper versus "below the fold", a web page or app's screenview may have certain locations that give features additional visibility to users, such as being right at the bottom of the web page or screen. 

The positional advantages or disadvantages of various locations depend on different cultures and languages (e.g., left to right vs. right to left). Some locations have become established, such as having toolbars at the top of a screen or webpage. Some designers have argued that commonly used features (e.g., a print button) should be much more visually prominent than very rarely used features. Some features cannot be seen, but there is a convention that if the user places the mouse cursor in a certain area, then a toolbar or function option will become visible. In general, because of the smaller screen of mobile devices, controls are often not placed right in the centre of the screen, because that is where the user views content or text.

Some organizations try to increase the discoverability of a certain feature by adding animation, such as a moving "click here" icon. As of 2017, the addition of motion sensors and geotracking to mobile devices has made webpage design for discoverability more complex, because smartphones and tablets are typically capable of having many more inputs from the user than a 1980s era desktop, including "swiping" the [[touchscreen]], touching images on the screen, or tilting the device. One of the challenges in webpage and app design is that the degree of sophistication and experience of users with navigating in the webpage or app environment varies a great deal, from individuals who are new to using these applications at one extreme to experienced computer users.

===Internet search===
For items that are searched for online, the goal of discoverability is to be at or near the top of the search results. Organizations may make efforts to make it more likely that "their" content or webpages are at the top, or close to the top, of search results; these approaches are often collectively called [[search engine optimization]] (SEO). Note that when an organization takes action to increase the SEO of its website, this does not normally involve changes to the search engine itself; rather, it involves adding metadata tags and original content, among other strategies, to increase the "visibility" of the website to search engine algorithms.

====Services====
In a service delivery context, the application of this principle requires collecting information about the service during the service analysis phase as during this phase; maximum information is available about the service’s functional context&lt;ref name="FuncContext"&gt;The overall purpose of the service&lt;/ref&gt; and the capabilities of the service. At this stage, the domain knowledge of the business experts could also be enlisted to document meta-data about the service. In the [[Service-oriented modeling|service-oriented design]] phase, the already gathered meta-data could be made part of the service contract.&lt;ref name='servicecontract'&gt;[http://www.whatissoa.com/p11.php Service Contract]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OASIS SOA Reference Model|OASIS SOA-RM]] standard specifies ''service description'' as an artifact that represents service meta-data.&lt;ref name='Michael Poulin'&gt;Michael Poulin. [http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/service_oriented/2009/02/evolution_of_principles_of_service_orientation_service_composability_and_discoverability_part_7.php Evolution of principles of Service Orientation: Service Composability and Discoverability, part 7]. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the service meta-data accessible to interested parties, it must be centrally accessible. This could either be done by publishing the service-meta to a dedicated 'service registry'&lt;ref name='Reddy'&gt;Reddy, et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/36107373037136n2/fulltext.pdf Evaluating legacy assets in the context of migration to SOA]. pp 58. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or by simply placing this information in a 'shared directory'.&lt;ref name='DW'&gt;Dennis Wisnosky.[http://www.soamag.com/I25/0109-2.php Principles and Patterns at the U.S. Department of Defense]. Date Accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In case of a 'service registry', the repository can also be used to include QoS, SLA and the current state of a service.&lt;ref name='VS'&gt;.Vinod Sarma, Srinivas Rao Bhagavatula. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753196.1753204&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=85839924&amp;CFTOKEN=41778190 Freeway patterns for SOA systems]. Date accessed: 28 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metadata types==

===Functional===
This is the basic type of meta-information that expresses the functional context of the service and the details about the product, content, or service’s capabilities. The application of the [[standardized service contract]] principle helps to create the basic functional meta-data in a consistent manner. The same standardization should be applied when the same meta-information is being outside the technical contract&lt;ref name='technicalcontract'&gt;[http://www.whatissoa.com/p11.php technical contract]&lt;/ref&gt; of the service e.g. when publishing information to a service registry.&lt;ref name="SvcRegistry"&gt;A repository that contains meta-data about services in a specific format e.g. classification of service, its location, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

For general items, the data that might be used to categorize them may include:
* Name of product, content or service (for audiovisual content, this would be song name, or TV show/movie title)
* Name of manufacturer, designer, creators (for audiovisual content, this would be names of director/producer/artists)
* Technical data (size, weight, height for physical items, or in the case of digital files, compression approach, file size)
* For items which can identify their location via embedded sensors (such as with [[Internet of things]] [[geolocation]] data), location of use/access)

===Quality of service===
For services, to know about the service behavior and its limitations,&lt;ref name='Jim Murphy'&gt;Jim Murphy. [http://www.soamag.com/I5/0307-2.php Essential Components of an SOA Quality Foundation]. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and about the user's service experience, all of this information needs to be documented within the service registry. This way potential consumers can use this meta-information by comparing it against their performance requirements.

==Considerations==
===Services===
The effective application of this design principle requires that the meta-information recorded against each service needs to be consistent and meaningful. This is only possible if organization-wide standards exist that enforce service developers to record the required meta-data in a consistent way. The information recorded as the meta-data for the service needs to be presented in a way so that both technical and non-technical IT experts can understand the purpose and the capabilities of the service, as an evaluation of the service may be required by the business people before the service is authorized to be used.

This principle is best applied during the service-oriented analysis phase as during this time, all the details about the service’s purpose and functionality are available. Although most of the service design principles support each other in a positive manner, however, in case of [[service abstraction]] and service discoverability principle, there exists an inversely proportional relationship. This is because as more and more details about the service are hidden away from the service consumers, less discoverable information is available for discovering the service. This could be addressed by carefully recording the service meta-information so that the inner workings of the service are not documented within this meta-information.
===Algorithms===
In the online economy, sophisticated computer programs called algorithms analyse the ways that end users search for, access and use different content or products online. Thus, not only is metadata created regarding the content or product (e.g., the author and genre of an e-book), but also data is generated about specific human users' interaction with this content. If an organization such as a [[social media]] website has a user profile for a given person, indicating demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location of residence, employment status, education, etc.), then this social media website can collect and analyse information about tendencies of a given user or a given subcategory of users. When social media websites are collecting data about human users' online activities and preferences, this may raise potential privacy concerns. 

Algorithms have been called “[[black box]]es”, because the factors used by the leading  websites in their algorithms are typically proprietary information which is not released to the public. While a number of [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) firms offer the services of attempting to increase the ranking of a client’s web content or website, these SEO firms do not typically know the exact algorithms used by Google and Facebook. Ghosh et al found that algorithm "[[web crawler]]"s can only access 26% of new online content "...by recrawling a constant fraction of the entire web". &lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Anirban; Ghosh, Arpita; Kumar, Ravi; Olston, Christopher; Pandey, Sandeep; and Tomkins, Andrew. ''The Discoverability of the Web''. http://www.arpitaghosh.com/papers/discoverability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, one concern raised with the increasing role of algorithms on search engines and databases, is that once a specific person indicates a preference for a certain type of content or product, the computer algorithm may increasingly focus on making recommendations in this type of content. To give a practical example, if a person searches for comedy movies online, a search engine algorithm may start mainly recommending comedies to this user, and not showing him or her the range of other films (e.g., drama, documentary, etc.). On the positive side, if this person only likes comedy films, then this restricted "filter" will reduce the information load of scanning through vast numbers of films. However, various cultural stakeholders have raised concerns about how these filter algorithms may restrict the diversity of material that is discoverable to users. Concerns about the dangers of "filter bubbles" have been raised in regards to online news services, which provide types of news, news sources, or topics to a user based on his/her previous online activities. Thus a person who has previously searched for Fox TV content will mainly be shown more Fox TV content and a person who has previously searched for PBS content will be shown more PBS search results, and so on. This could lead to news readers becoming only aware of a certain news source's viewpoints.

The search behaviour of video content viewers has changed a great deal since the widespread popularity of video sharing websites and video streaming. Whereas a typical TV show consumer of the 1980s would read a print edition of ''[[TV Guide]]'' to find out what shows were on, or click from channel to channel ("channel surfing") to see if any shows appealed to them, in the 2010s, video content consumers are increasingly watching on screens (either [[smart TV]]s, [[tablet computer]] screens or [[smartphone]]s) that have a computerized search function and often automated algorithm-created suggestions for the viewer. With this search function, a user can enter the name of a TV show, producer, actor, screenwriter or genre to help them find content of interest to them. If the user is searching on a search engine on a device (laptop, tablet computer, smartphone) they own, the device may transmit information about the user's preferences and previous online searches to the website. Continuing with this 1980s to 2010s comparison, in the 1980s, the type or brand of television a user was watching on did not affect his/her viewing habits. However, a person searching for TV shows in the 2010s on different brands of computerized [[smart TV]]s will probably get different search results for the same search term.

===Limitations===
For organizations that are trying to get maximal user uptake of their product, content or service online, discoverability has become an important goal. However, achieving discovery does not automatically translate into market success. For example, if the hypothetical online game "xyz" is easily discoverable, but it will not function on most mobile devices, then this video game will not perform well in the mobile game market, despite it being at the top of search results. As well, even if the product functions, that is it runs or plays properly, as well, users may not like the product. 

In the case that a user does like a certain online product or service, the discoverability has to be repeatable. If the user cannot find the product or service on a subsequent search, she or he may no longer look for this product/service, and instead shift to a substitute that is easily and reliably findable. It is not enough to make the online product or service discoverable for only a short period, unless the goal is only to create “viral” content as part of a short-term marketing campaign.

'''''Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever''''' ({{lang-de|Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxe des Kindbettfiebers}}) is a medical book by [[Ignaz Semmelweis]], published in 1861. It includes studies in hospitals conducted in [[Vienna]] in 1847, dealing largely with the field of [[obstetrics]]. It was translated into English by Kay Codell Carter in 1983. The book explains how his research shows that hand hygiene in hospitals can prevent unnecessary deaths.

[[File:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|Extreme value theory is used to model the risk of extreme, rare events, such as the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].]]

'''Extreme value theory''' or '''extreme value analysis''' ('''EVA''')  is a branch of [[statistics]] dealing with the extreme [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]]s from the [[median]] of [[probability distribution]]s. It seeks to assess, from a given ordered [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of a given random variable, the probability of events that are more extreme than any previously observed. Extreme value analysis is widely used in many disciplines, such as structural engineering, finance, earth sciences, traffic prediction, and geological engineering. For example, EVA might be used in the field of [[hydrology]] to estimate the probability of an unusually large flooding event, such as the [[100-year flood]]. Similarly, for the design of a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], a [[coastal engineer]] would seek to estimate the 50-year wave and design the structure accordingly.

== Data analysis ==

Two approaches exist for practical extreme value analysis.

The first method relies on deriving block maxima (minima) series as a preliminary step. In many situations it is customary and convenient to extract the annual maxima (minima), generating an "Annual Maxima Series" (AMS).

The second method relies on extracting, from a continuous record, the peak values reached for any period during which values exceed a certain threshold (falls below a certain threshold). This method is generally referred to as the "Peak Over Threshold" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leadbetter | first1 = M. R. | year = 1991 | title = On a basis for 'Peaks over Threshold' modeling | url = | journal = Statistics and Probability Letters | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 357–362 | doi = 10.1016/0167-7152(91)90107-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; method (POT).

For AMS data, the analysis may partly rely on the results of the [[Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem]], leading to the [[generalized extreme value distribution]] being selected for fitting.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher and Tippett (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gnedenko (1943)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, various procedures are applied to select between a wider range of distributions. The theorem here relates to the limiting distributions for the minimum or the maximum of a very large collection of [[statistical independence|independent]] [[random variable]]s from the same distribution. Given that the number of relevant random events within a year may be rather limited, it is unsurprising that analyses of observed AMS data often lead to distributions other than the generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD) being selected.&lt;ref&gt;Embrechts, Klüppelberg, and Mikosch (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

For POT data, the analysis may involve fitting two distributions: one for the number of events in a time period considered and a second for the size of the exceedances.

A common assumption for the first is the [[Poisson distribution]], with the [[generalized Pareto distribution]] being used for the exceedances. 
A [[Power law#Estimating the exponent from empirical data 2|tail-fitting]] can be based on the [[Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Pickands (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balkema and de Haan (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

Novak&lt;ref&gt;Novak (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; reserves the term “POT method” to the case where the threshold is non-random, and distinguishes it from the case where one deals with  exceedances of a random threshold.

==Applications==
Applications of extreme value theory include predicting the probability distribution of:
* Extreme [[flood]]s; The size of [[freak wave]]s
* [[Tornado]] outbreaks &lt;ref&gt;|doi=10.1126/science.aah7393&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maximum sizes of ecological populations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Batt|first1=Ryan D.|last2=Carpenter|first2=Stephen R.|last3=Ives|first3=Anthony R.|title=Extreme events in lake ecosystem time series|journal=Limnology and Oceanography Letters|volume=2|issue=3|pages=63|date=March 2017|doi=10.1002/lol2.10037}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Side effects of drugs (e.g., [[Ximelagatran]])
* The amounts of large [[insurance]] losses
* [[Equity risk]]s; Day to day [[market risk]]
* Mutational events during [[evolution]]
* Large [[wildfire]]s&lt;ref&gt;Alvardo (1998, p.68.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The field of extreme value theory was pioneered by [[Leonard Tippett]] (1902–1985). Tippett was employed by the [[British Cotton Industry Research Association]], where he worked to make cotton thread stronger. In his studies, he realized that the strength of a thread was controlled by the strength of its weakest fibres. With the help of [[R. A. Fisher]], Tippet obtained three asymptotic limits describing the distributions of extremes assuming independent variables. [[Emil Julius Gumbel]] codified this theory in his 1958 book ''Statistics of Extremes'', including the [[Gumbel distribution]]s that bear his name. These results can be extended to allowing for slight correlations between variables, but the classical theory does not extend to strong correlations of the order of the variance. One universality class of particular interest is that of [[log-correlated fields]], where the correlations decay logarithmically with the distance.

A summary of historically important publications relating to extreme value theory can be found in the article [[List of publications in statistics#Extreme value theory|List of publications in statistics]].

== Univariate theory ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X_1, \dots, X_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of [[independent and identically distributed]] random variables with [[cumulative distribution function]] ''F'' and let &lt;math&gt;M_n =\max(X_1,\dots,X_n)&lt;/math&gt; denote the maximum.

In theory, the exact distribution of the maximum can be derived:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Pr(M_n \leq z) &amp; = \Pr(X_1 \leq z, \dots, X_n \leq z) \\
&amp; = \Pr(X_1 \leq z) \cdots \Pr(X_n \leq z) = (F(z))^n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The associated [[indicator function]] &lt;math&gt;I_n = I(M_n&gt;z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bernoulli process]] with a success probability &lt;math&gt;p(z)=1-(F(z))^n&lt;/math&gt; that depends on the magnitude &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the extreme event. The number of extreme events within &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; trials thus follows a [[binomial distribution]] and the number of trials until an event occurs follows a [[geometric distribution]] with expected value and standard deviation of the same order &lt;math&gt;O(1/p(z))&lt;/math&gt;.

In practice, we might not have the distribution function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; but the [[Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem]] provides an asymptotic result.  If there exist sequences of constants &lt;math&gt;a_n&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_n\in \mathbb R &lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr\{(M_n-b_n)/a_n \leq z\} \rightarrow G(z) &lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt; G(z) \propto \exp \left[-(1+\zeta z)^{-1/\zeta} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; depends on the tail shape of the distribution.
When normalized, ''G'' belongs to one of the following non-[[degenerate distribution]] families:

[[Weibull distribution|Weibull law]]: &lt;math&gt; G(z) = \begin{cases} \exp\left\{-\left( -\left( \frac{z-b}{a} \right) \right)^\alpha\right\} &amp; z&lt;b \\ 1 &amp; z\geq b \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
when the distribution of &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; has a light tail with finite upper bound.  Also known as Type 3.

[[Gumbel distribution|Gumbel law]]: &lt;math&gt; G(z) = \exp\left\{-\exp\left(-\left(\frac{z-b}{a}\right)\right)\right\}\text{ for }z\in\mathbb R.&lt;/math&gt; when the distribution of &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; has an exponential tail.  Also known as Type 1

[[Frechet distribution|Fréchet Law]]: &lt;math&gt; G(z) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; z\leq b \\ \exp\left\{-\left(\frac{z-b}{a}\right)^{-\alpha}\right\} &amp; z&gt;b. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; when the distribution of &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Heavy-tailed distribution|heavy tail]] (including polynomial decay).  Also known as Type 2.

In all cases,  &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3666">'''Friedrich Carl Knauer''' (31 March 1850, [[Graz]] – 31 July 1926, [[Vienna]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[zoologist]].

Friedrich Knauer studied [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[zoology]] at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1868 to 1872. In 1887, he became a director [[Vivarium]] in [[Prater|Vienna Prater]]. In 1893, he became the director of [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn|Vienna Zoo]]. 

Knauer wrote zoological books for schools and instruction in science as well as popular scientific works. After his death, Knauer was buried in [[Zentralfriedhof|Zentralfriedhof Cemetery]]. In 1930, a street in [[Favoriten]] was named ''[[Friedrich Knauer Gasse]]''.

The '''Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum''' ({{lang-de|Historisch-Technisches Museum Peenemünde}} or HTM), former "Peenemünde Information Centre for History and Technology" ({{lang-de|Historisch-Technisches Informationszentrum Peenemünde}} or HTI) is a museum, founded in 1991, in the observation bunker and site of the former power station in [[Peenemünde]] on the island of [[Usedom]] in eastern [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in Germany. The museum is dedicated to the history of the [[Peenemünde Army Research Centre]] and the [[Luftwaffe]] test site of "[[Peenemünde-West]]", especially the [[rocket]]s and missiles developed there between 1936 and 1945. Since January 2007 the information centre has become an anchor point on the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] (ERIH), a Europe-wide network of industrial monuments, and a part of the ERIH themed routes for ''Energy'' and ''Transport &amp; Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erih.net/nc/anchor-points/detail.html?user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bpointer%5D=0&amp;user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bmode%5D=1&amp;user_erihobjects_pi2%5BshowUid%5D=15735&amp;user_erihobjects_pi2%5Bregionalroute%5D=0&amp;user_erihobjects_pi2%5BanchorOnly%5D=1&amp;user_erihobjects_pi2%5BmembersOnly%5D=0|title=ERIH Entry:The Peenemünde Historical Museum|date=2014|ref=harv|publisher=European Route of Industrial Heritage|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 around the museum had 222,000 visitors including many school classes. Around € 6.5M were invested in the museum's renovation and expansion; a further investment of € 3.9 M is planned. In 2002 the HTM was given the Coventry [[Cross of Nails]] and in 2013 the ''European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / [[Europa Nostra Award]]'' .

== Exhibition ==
[[File:A4 peenem.jpg|thumb|100px| A4-Modell (HTI Peenemünde)]]

The main purpose of the exhibition in the power station is to be a memorial site where visitors can learn from exhibits, documents and films about the fateful pact made by the rocket engineers around [[Wernher von Braun]] with former powers in order to develop the aerospace industry.

In the mid-1960s, building on his technical experience from Peenemünde, Wernher von Braun was able to design the [[Saturn V]] rocket for [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] that was used to fly to the [[moon]]. The role of the former rocket engineer in Peenemünde, however, was to develop weapons of war. Spectacular films show visitors how [[V-1 flying bomb]]s worked.

These experiences formed the basis for the development of nuclear missiles by the Allies after the war. According to documents in the exhibition even Peenemünde experts took part, including in Great Britain and France, where they helped to develop the [[Force de Frappe]].

As part of a detailed chronicle about the test site, the living and working conditions of the forced labourers and prisoners of war in Peenemünde is illustrated. In addition, there is extensive information on [[concentration camp]] prisoners, who assembled the V1-flying bombs in Bavaria and Austria under inhuman conditions.

There is a chapel near the site which commemorates all the victims.

== Open air displays ==

Amongst the showpieces on display in the open-air part of the site are a replica [[V-1 flying bomb]] (''Fieseler Fi 103'') and the [[V-2|A4]] rocket.

Exhibits in the Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum include:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Information boards on the Peenemünder Haken ==

There is a large number of information boards at historic locations, connected with the Army Research Centre and Luftwaffe test site, spread over the whole ''Peenemünder Haken'' ("Peenemünde Hook") and managed by the HTI. The sites include Oxygen Factory II (''Sauerstoffwerk II''), two former forced labour camps and a halt on the old Peenemünde industrial railway. The displayed objects and terrain a generally freely accessible and often inconspicuous. Several were laid out with the help of youth volunteers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">'''Ideal town''' was a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] concept developed by Italian [[polymath]] [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404{{ndash}}1472), author of ten books of treatises on modern architecture  titled ''De Re Aedificatoria'' written about 1450 with additions made until the time of his death in 1472. Alberti's architectural theories concerned the planning and building of an entire town as opposed to individual [[edifice]]s for private patrons or ecclesiastical purposes. 
[[File:Braun and Hogenberg Zamość.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zamość]] in the 17th century]]
Alberti insisted on choosing the location of the town first, followed by careful setting up of the size and direction of streets, then location of bridges and gates, and finally a building pattern ruled by perfect symmetry.&lt;ref name="Blunt"&gt;Anthony Blunt, [http://www.nehawu.org.za/images/18023,%20Anthony%20Blunt,%20Alberti,%201959,%20and%20Spinoza.pdf  From "Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450‐1660". Chapter 1: Alberti.] PDF file, direct download 192 KB. NEHAWU Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more prominent examples of a town modelled on this theory was [[Zamość]] founded in the 16th century by the chancellor [[Jan Zamoyski]]. At present, it is a [[List of World Heritage Sites of Poland|World Heritage Site]] in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/564  Old City of Zamość.] UNESCO World Heritage Centre 2014, United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The ideal town was seen as a utopia to be achieved by disregarding the reasonably regular planimetrics of real, historic towns for standards – geometric, aesthetic or otherwise – of ideal perfection. Therefore the debate about ideal towns has become isolated from the debate about real, historic towns. In fact, there has often been the temptation to superimpose and identify this debate with one about utopia and those town models often linked to the utopian concept. &lt;ref name="Educativo"&gt;[http://win.liceogalilei.org/deure/Comenius/Intro-CdRomEng.html  European Educational Project: ''What city for man.''] Progetto Educativo Europeo

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3854">'''Paṇḍita Jagannātha Samrāṭ''' (1652–1744) was an [[India]]n [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]] who served in the court of [[Jai Singh II of Amber]], and was also his guru.

Jagannātha, whose father's name was Gaṇeśa,&lt;ref name=kvs/&gt;&lt;ref name=na/&gt; and grandfather's Viṭṭhala&lt;ref name=na/&gt; was from a Vedic family&lt;ref name=kvs/&gt; originally from Maharashtra.&lt;ref name=na/&gt;

At the suggestion of Jai Singh, he learned [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], in order to study [[Islamic astronomy]].&lt;ref name=kvs/&gt;&lt;ref name=na/&gt; Having become proficient in these languages, he translated texts in these languages into Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=kvs/&gt;&lt;ref name=na/&gt; These translations include:
* ''Rekhā-gaṇita'', a translation of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' made from [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]]'s Arabic recension of the same. For this work, he had to coin more than a hundred Sanskrit mathematical terms&lt;ref name=kvs/&gt;
* ''Siddhānta-sāra-kaustubha'', a translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' from [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]]'s Arabic version&lt;ref name=kvs/&gt;&lt;ref name=na/&gt;

His original works include:
*‍ ''Siddhānta-samrāṭ'', which describes astronomical instruments, their design and construction, and observations. It also describes the use of these observations in correcting parameters and preparing almanacs. It mentions how J‌ai Singh, who earlier used astronomical instruments (such as the [[astrolabe]]) made of metal, later switched to huge outdoor observatories (such as the [[Jantar Mantar]]), as they were more precise; also they were made of stone and mortar rather than brick, to diminish the effects of wear-and-tear and climate.&lt;ref name=kvs/&gt;
* ''Yantra-prakāra'', which describes astronomical instruments, measurements, computations, etc. in more detail, and also observations made by him.&lt;ref name=kvs/&gt;

Jagannātha held that when theory and observation differed, observation was the true ''pramāṇa'' and overruled theory.&lt;ref name=na/&gt; While he used and described a number of astronomical instruments, telescopes were not one of them.&lt;ref name=na/&gt;

A '''state firearm''' has only been designated by eight of the fifty States in the [[United States]]: [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Tennessee]].

In March 2011, [[Utah]] adopted the [[M1911 pistol]] as its state firearm. This gun was designed by [[Ogden, Utah]] native [[John Browning]].  The adoption was supported by Republican [[Utah]] State Representative [[Carl Wimmer]], who said, "It does capture a portion of Utah's history" and "even bigger than that, it captures a portion of American history."&lt;ref name=UT&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|title=Utah becomes first in U.S. to designate official state gun|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/18/us-automatic-pistol-utah-idUSTRE72H08Z20110318|accessdate=April 29, 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption was opposed by Democratic Utah State Representative Brian King who said, "When we are talking about a state symbol we would do well to come up with one that is more unifying than divisive and this is a very divisive symbol for obvious reasons. This is just a poor choice for a state symbol".

In April 2011, [[Arizona]] Governor Jan Brewer signed a bill into law which designated the [[Colt Single Action Army]] Revolver as Arizona's state firearm.&lt;ref name=AZ&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=David|title=Arizona governor makes Colt revolver official state gun|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/29/us-arizona-colt-idUSTRE73S05920110429|accessdate=April 29, 2011|newspaper=Reuters|date=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, [[Indiana]] adopted the [[Grouseland]] rifle as its state firearm. This rifle is kept at Grouseland, the home of President [[William Henry Harrison]] and was made between 1803 and 1812 by John Small, who later became the first sheriff in the state. "This rifle and its maker are both integral parts of Indiana history, and as such, the rifle is worthy of its designation as the Indiana State Rifle," said Senator [[John Waterman]].&lt;ref name=IN&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Niki|title=Antique firearm named state rifle|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20120307/NEWS07/303079983|accessdate=December 6, 2012|newspaper=The Journal Gazette|date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, [[Kentucky]] adopted the Kentucky [[Long rifle|Long Rifle]] as its state firearm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=42064|title=Kentucky Revised Statutes, Chapter 2.156|last=|first=|date=June 25, 2013|website=Kentucky Legislation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, [[Pennsylvania]] adopted the [[long rifle]] as its state firearm.&lt;ref name="act 73"&gt;[http://www.legis.state.pa.us//WU01/LI/LI/US/HTM/2014/0/0073..HTM Act of Jun. 26, 2014, P.L. 783, No. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, [[Alaska]] adopted the pre-1964 [[Winchester Model 70]] rifle as its state firearm. The bill, sponsored by Senate President [[Charlie Huggins]], refers to the gun as the "rifleman's rifle." The bill says the gun helped Alaskans "establish a firm foothold" in the wilderness between 1930 and 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bohrer|first=Becky|title=Parnell signs bill designating state gun|url=http://www.newsminer.com/news/alaska_news/parnell-signs-bill-designating-state-gun/article_f3e5d3b4-1804-11e4-9074-0017a43b2370.html|newspaper=Fairbanks Daily News-Miner|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[human skeleton]] of an [[adult]] consists of 206-208 bones. It is composed of 270 bones at birth, but later decreases to 80 bones in the [[axial skeleton]] and 126 bones in the [[appendicular skeleton]]. Many small [[supernumerary bone]]s, such as some [[sesamoid bone]]s, are not included in this count.

==Introduction==
As a human ages, some of its bones [[synostosis|fuse]], a process which typically lasts until sometime within the third decade of life. Therefore, the number of bones in an individual may be evaluated differently throughout their life. In addition, the bones of the skull and face are counted as separate bones, despite [[Synostosis|being fused]] naturally. Some reliable [[sesamoid bone]]s such as the [[pisiform]] are counted, while others, such as the [[hallux]] sesamoids, are not.

Individuals may have more or fewer bones than the average (even accounting for developmental stage) owing to anatomical variations. The most common variations include [[Wormian bone|sutural (wormian) bones]], which are located along the sutural lines on the back of the skull, and sesamoid bones which develop within some tendons, mainly in the hands and feet. Some individuals may also have additional (i.e., supernumerary) [[cervical rib]]s or [[lumbar vertebrae]].

==Bones==

===Spine (vertebral column)===
A fully grown adult features 26 bones in the spine, whereas a child can have 33.
* [[Cervical vertebrae]] (set of 7 bones)
* [[Thoracic vertebrae]] (set of 12 bones)
* [[Lumbar vertebrae]] (set of 5 bones)
* [[Sacral vertebrae]] (set of 5 bones at birth, and later fused into one after adolescence)
* [[Coccygeal vertebrae]] (set of 4 bones at birth; some or all fuse together, but there seems to be a disagreement between researchers as to what the most common number should be. Some say the most common is 1, others say 2 or 3, with 4 being the least likely. It is counted as 1 in this article.{{uncited|date=February 2017}})

===Chest (thorax)===
[[File:Bones of skeletal system.jpg|thumb|283x283px|Various bones of the human skeletal system.]]
There are usually 26 bones in the chest but sometimes there can be additional cervical ribs in humans. Cervical ribs occur naturally in other animals such as reptiles.
* Hyoid
*[[Human sternum|Sternum]]
* [[Ribs]] (24, in 12 pairs)
** It is important to note that three pairs (the 8th, 9th and 10th), also known as [[false ribs]], are attached to each other. They are also attached to the 7th rib by [[cartilage]] and [[synovial joint]]s. Also two pairs of [[floating ribs]] (the 11th and 12th), have no anterior attachment.
**  [[Cervical rib]]s are extra ribs that occur in some humans.

===Head===
There are 22 bones in the [[skull]]. Including the bones of the middle ear, the head contains 28 bones.
* [[Human skull|Cranial bones]] (8)
** [[Occipital bone]]
** [[Parietal bone]]s (2)
** [[Frontal bone]]
** [[Temporal bone]]s (2)
** [[Sphenoid bone]] (sometimes counted as facial)
** [[Ethmoid bone]] (sometimes counted as facial)
* [[Facial bone]]s (14)
** [[Nasal bone]]s (2)
** [[Maxillae]] (upper jaw) (2)
** [[Lacrimal bone]] (2)
** [[Zygomatic bone]] (2)
** [[Palatine bone]] (2)
** [[Inferior nasal concha]] (2)
** [[Vomer]]
** [[Human mandible|Mandible]] (lower jaw)
* [[Hyoid bone]] (not connected to any other bone)
* [[Middle ear]]s (6)
** [[Malleus]] (2)
** [[Incus]] (2)
** [[Stapes]] (2)

===Arm===
There are a total of 64 bones in the arm.
* Upper arm bones (6 bones in total; 3 on each side)
** [[Humerus]]
** [[Pectoral girdle]] (shoulder)
*** [[Scapula]]                                                                      
*** [[Clavicles]]
* Lower arm bones (4 bones, 2 on each side)
** [[Ulna]]
** [[radius (bone)|Radius]]
* [[Hand]] (54 bones in total; 27 in each hand)
** [[Carpals]]
*** [[Scaphoid bone]] (2)
*** [[Lunate bone]] (2)
*** [[triquetral|Triquetral bone]] (2)
*** [[Pisiform bone]] (2)
*** [[trapezium (bone)|Trapezium]] (2)
*** [[Trapezoid bone]] (2)
*** [[Capitate bone]] (2)
*** [[Hamate bone]] (2)

** [[Phalanges of the hand]]
*** [[Proximal phalanges]] (10 bones in total; 5 in each side)
*** [[Intermediate phalanges]] (8 bones in total; 4 in each side)
*** [[Distal phalanges]] (10 bones in total; 5 in each side)

===Pelvis (pelvic girdle)===
The [[hip bone]] has three regions which are included or fused to form two coxal bones.They are: [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]]
* The [[sacrum]] and the [[coccyx]] attach to the two hip bones to form the [[human pelvis|pelvis]], but are more important to the spinal column. For this reason it is omitted from the pelvic girdle.

===Leg===
* [[Femur]] (2)
* [[Patella]] or kneecap (2)
* [[Tibia]] (2)
* [[Fibula]] (2)
* [[Foot]] (52 bones in total, 26 per foot)
** [[Tarsus (skeleton)|Tarsus]]
*** [[Calcaneus]] or heel bone (2)
*** [[talus bone|Talus]] (2)
*** [[Navicular bone]] (2)
*** [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|Medial cuneiform bone]] (2)
*** [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|Intermediate cuneiform bone]] (2)
*** [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|Lateral cuneiform bone]] (2)
*** [[Cuboid bone]] (2)
** [[Metatarsals]] (10)
** [[Phalanges of the foot]]
*** [[Proximal phalanges]] (5 × 2 = 10)
*** [[Intermediate phalanges]] (4 x 2 = 8)
*** [[Distal phalanges]] (5 x 2 = 10)

===Sum===
Spine  26
Chest  26
Head  28
Arms  64
Legs  60
Pelvis   2
  (206)

===[[Sesamoid bone]]s===
* [[Patella]]
* [[Pisiform bone]]
* [[Fabella]]
* Sesamoids in the  [[First metacarpal bone|first]] and  [[Second metacarpal bone|second]] metacarpal bones
* Sesamoids in the [[first metatarsal bone]]
* Lenticular  [[process (anatomy)|process]] of the [[incus bone|incus]]

[[File:Ringside.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Class ring|graduation ring]] with the Master of Science designation]]

A '''Master of Science''' ({{lang-la|Magister Scientiae}}; abbreviated '''MS''', '''M.S.''', '''MSc''', '''M.Sc.''', '''SM''', '''S.M.''', '''ScM''' or '''Sc.M.''') is a [[master's degree]] in the field of science awarded by [[University|universities]] in many countries or a person holding such a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/master_of_science|title=Master of Science|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Master of Arts]] degree, the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering and medicine and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a [[thesis]].

==Algeria==
Algeria follows the [[Bologna Process]].

==Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Panamá, Perú and Uruguay==
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Panamá]], [[Perú]] and [[Uruguay]], the Master of Science or Magister is a postgraduate degree of two to four years of duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admission to a Master's program (Spanish: ''[[Maestría]]''; Portuguese: ''Mestrado'') requires the full completion of a four to five years long [[undergraduate degree]], [[bachelor's degree]] or a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]]'s degree of the same length. Defense of a research thesis is required. All master's degrees qualify for a doctorate program.

==Australia==
Australian universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 1–2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, all universities, including [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]] [[Jagannath University]], [[Dhaka University]], [[University of Chittagong]], [[Jahangirnagar University]], [[Islamic University, Bangladesh]] and [[Rajshahi University]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. After passing Bachelor of Science, any student becomes eligible to study in this discipline.

==Canada==
In Canada, Master of Science (MSc) degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a mixture. Master's programs typically take one to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required. Admission to a master's program is contingent upon holding a four-year university bachelor's degree. Some universities require a master's degree in order to progress to a doctoral program (PhD).

===Quebec===
In the province of Quebec, the Master of Science follows the same principles as in the rest of Canada. There is one exception, however, regarding admission to a master's program. Since Québécois students complete two to three years of [[College education in Quebec|college]] before entering university, they have the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Some undergraduate degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Education]] and the [[Bachelor of Engineering]] requires four years of studies. Following the obtention of their bachelor's degree, students can be admitted into a graduate program to eventually obtain a [[master's degree]].

==Chile==

Commonly the Chilean universities have used "Magíster" for a [[master degree]], but other than that is similar to the rest of South America.

==Czech Republic, Slovakia==
Like all EU member states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia follow the Bologna Process. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are using two master's degree systems. Both award a title of ''Mgr.'' or ''Ing.'' to be used before the name.
The older system requires a 5-year program. The new system takes only 2 years but requires a previously completed 3-year bachelor program (a ''Bc.'' title). It is required to write a thesis (in both master and bachelor program) and also to pass final exams. It is mostly the case that the final exams cover the main study areas of the whole study program, i.e. a student is required to prove his/her knowledge in many subjects he attended during the 2 resp. 3 years.

==Egypt==
The Master of Science (M.Sc.) is an academic degree for a post-graduate candidates or researchers, it usually takes from 4 to 7 years after passing the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree. Master programs are awarded in many sciences in the [[Egyptian Universities]]. A completion of the degree requires finishing a [[pre-master]] studies followed by a scientific [[thesis]] or [[research]]. All M.Sc. degree holders are allowable to take a step forward in the academic track to get the [[PhD]] degree.

==Finland==
Like all EU member states, Finland follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree usually follows the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) studies which typically last five years. For the completion of both the bachelor and the master studies the student must accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Germany==
Like all EU member states, Germany follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree replaces the once common ''[[Diplom]]'' or ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' programs that typically lasted four to five years. It is awarded in science related studies with a high percentage of mathematics. For the completion the student must accumulate 300 ECTS Credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Southeastern Europe==
In Slavic countries in European southeast (particularly former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] republics), the education system was largely based on the German university system (largely due to the presence and influence of the [[Austria-Hungary Empire]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the region). Prior to the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], academic university studies comprised a 4-5 year long graduate ''[[Diplom]]'' program, which could have been followed by a 2-4 year long ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' program and then later with 2-4 year long ''[[Doctoral studies]]''.

After the Bologna Process implementation, again based on the German implementation, ''Diplom'' titles and programs were replaced by the M.Sc. and M.A. programs (depending on the field of study). The studies are structured such that a ''Master'' program lasts long enough for the student to accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, so its duration would depend on a number of credits acquired during the Bachelor studies. Pre-Bologna ''Magister'' programs were abandoned - after earning an M.Sc/M.A. degree and satisfying other academic requirements a student could proceed to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree directly.

==Guyana==
In Guyana, all universities, including [[University of Guyana]], [[Texila American University]], [[American International School of Medicine]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. Students who have completed undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree are eligible to study in this discipline

==Iran==
In Iran, similar to Canada, Master of Science (MSc) or in Iranian form ''[[Karshenasi-arshad]]'' degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or sometimes a mixture. Master's programs typically take two to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required.

==Ireland==
Like all EU member states, Ireland follows the Bologna Process. In Ireland, Master of Science (MSc) may be course-based with a research component or entirely research based. The program is most commonly a one-year program and a thesis is required for both course-based and research based degrees.

==Israel==
In Israel, Master of Science (MSc) may be entirely course-based or include research. The program is most commonly a two-year program and a thesis is required only for research based degrees.

==India==

In India, universities offer MSc programs usually in science subjects. Generally speaking, in India, post-graduate scientific courses lead to MSc degree while post-graduate engineering courses lead to ME or MTech degree. For example, a master's in automotive engineering would normally be an ME or MTech, while a master's in physics would be an MSc. A few top universities also offer undergraduate programs leading to a master's degree which is known as integrated masters.

A Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree is also offered in India. It is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than [[Ph.D.]] and considered to be parallel to [[M.Phil.]] degree in humanities and science. Some institutes such as [[IITs]] offer an MS degree for postgraduate engineering courses. This degree is considered a research-oriented degree where as MTech or ME degree is usually not a research degree in India. M.S. degree is also awarded by various [[IISER]]s which are one of the top institutes in India.

==Italy==
Like all EU member states, Italy follows the Bologna Process. The degree ''Master of Science'' is awarded in the Italian form, ''[[Laurea Magistrale]]'' (formerly ''Laurea specialistica''; before the introduction of the ''Laurea'' the corresponding degree was ''[[Laurea]] quinquennale'' or ''Vecchio Ordinamento'').

==Nepal==

In Nepal, universities offer the master of science degree usually in science and engineering areas. [[Tribhuvan University]] offers MSc degree for all the science and engineering courses. [[Pokhara University]] offers ME for engineering and MSc for science. [[Kathmandu University]] offers MS by Research and ME degrees for science and engineering.

==Netherlands==
Like all EU member states, the Netherlands follows the Bologna Process. A graduate who is awarded the title Master of Science (abbreviated as MSc) may still use the previously awarded Dutch title ''ingenieur'' (abbreviated as ir.) (for graduates who followed a technical or agricultural program), ''meester'' (abbreviated as mr.) (for graduates who followed an LLM law program) or ''doctorandus'' (abbreviated as drs.)(in all other cases).

==New Zealand==
New Zealand universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Norway==
Norway follows the Bologna Process. For engineering, the Master of Science academic degree has been recently introduced and has replaced the previous award forms "[[Sivilingeniør]]" (engineer, a.k.a. engineering master) and "Hovedfag" (academic master). Both were awarded after 5 years university-level studies and required the completion of a scientific thesis.

"Siv.ing", is a protected title exclusively awarded to engineering students who completed a five-year education at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology ({{lang-no|Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet}}, NTNU) or other universities.  Historically there was no bachelor's degree involved and today's program is a five years master's degree education. The "Siv.ing" title is in the process of being phased out, replaced by (for now, complemented by) the "M.Sc." title. By and large, "Siv.ing" is a title tightly being held on to for the sake of tradition. In academia, the new program offers separate three-year bachelor and two-year master programs. It is awarded in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science fields. The completion of a scientific thesis is required. All master's degrees are designed to certify a level of education and qualify for a doctorate program.

Master of Science in Business is the English title for those taking a higher business degree, "Siviløkonom" in Norwegian. In addition, there is, for example, the 'Master of Business Administration' (MBA), a practically oriented master's degree in business, but with less mathematics and econometrics, due to its less specific entry requirements and smaller focus on research.

==Pakistan==
Pakistan inherited its conventions pertaining to higher education from [[United Kingdom]] after [[Partition of India|independence in 1947]]. Master of Science degree is typically abbreviated as M.Sc. (as in the United Kingdom) and which is awarded after 16 years of education (equivalent with a bachelor's degree in the USA and many other countries). Recently, in pursuance to some of the reforms by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (the regulatory body of higher education in Pakistan), the traditional 2-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree has been replaced by the 4-year Bachelor of Science degree, which is abbreviated as B.S. to enable the Pakistani degrees with the rest of the world. Subsequently, students who pass 4-year B.S. degree that is awarded after 16 years of education are then eligible to apply for M.S. degree, which is considered at par with Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) degree.

==Poland==
Like all EU member states, Poland follows the Bologna Process. The Polish equivalent of Master of Science is "magister" (abbreviated "mgr", written pre-nominally much like "Dr"). Starting in 2001, the MSc programs typically lasting 5 years began to be replaced as below:
* 3-year associates programs (termed "licencjat". No abbreviated pre-nominal or title.)
* 3.5-year engineer programs (termed "inżynier", utilizing the pre-nominal abbreviation "inż.")
* 2-year master programs open to both "licencjat" and "inż." graduates.
* 1.5-year master programs open only to "inż." graduates.
The degree is awarded predominantly in the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, economics, as well as in the arts and other disciplines. Those who graduate from an engineering program prior to being awarded a master's degree are allowed to use the "mgr inż." pre-nominal ("master engineer"). This is most common in engineering and agricultural fields of study. Defense of a research [[thesis]] is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a [[doctorate]] program.

==Russia==
The title of "master" was introduced by Alexander I at 24 January 1803. The Master had an intermediate position between the candidate and doctor according to the decree "About colleges structure". The master's degree was abolished from 1917 to 1934. Russia follows the [[Bologna Process]] for higher education in Europe since 2011.

==Spain==
Like all EU member states, Spain follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (MSc) degree is a program officially recognized by the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]]. It usually involves 1 or 2 years of full-time study. It is targeted at pre-experience candidates who have recently finished their undergraduate studies. An MSc degree can be awarded in every field of study. An MSc degree is required in order to progress to a PhD. MSci, MPhil and DEA are equivalent in Spain.

==Sweden==
Like all EU member states, Sweden follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science academic degree has, like in Germany, recently been introduced in Sweden. Students studying Master of Science in Engineering programs are rewarded both the English Master of Science Degree, but also the Swedish equivalent "Teknologisk masterexamen". Whilst "Civilingenjör" is an at least five year long education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kth.se/utbildning/civilingenjor/datateknik|title=Datateknik, civilingenjör 300 hp  - KTH|author=|date=|website=www.kth.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;   .

==Syria==
The Master of Science is a degree that can be studied only in public universities. The program is usually 2 years, but it can be extended to 3 or 4 years, the student is required to pass a specific bachelor's degree to attend a specific master of science degree program, the master of science is mostly a research master (except for some types of programs held with cooperation of foreign universities), The student should attend some courses in the first year of the master then he/she should prepare a research thesis. Publishing two research papers is recommended and will increase the final evaluation grade.

==United Kingdom==
The Master of Science (MSc) is typically a taught postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examinations and a project dissertation (normally taking up a third of the program). Master's programs usually involve a minimum of 1 year of full-time study (180 UK credits, of which 150 must be at master's level) and sometimes up to 2 years of full-time study (or the equivalent period part-time).&lt;ref name="QAA master's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Master's Degree Characteristics Statement |publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2977#.WK59n38WI2g|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught master's degrees are normally classified into Pass, Merit and Distinction (although some universities do not give Merit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/msc_degree_classification/|title=MSc Classification|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities also offer MSc by research programs, where a longer project or set of projects is undertaken full-time; master's degrees by research are normally pass/fail, although some universities may offer a distinction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-research-mathematics?wssl=1|title=MSc by Research in Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent Master ''in'' Science (MSci or M.Sci.) degree (Master of Natural Science at the [[University of Cambridge]]), is an undergraduate (UG) level integrated master's degree offered by UK institutions since the 1990s. It is offered as a first degree with the first three (four in Scotland) years similar to a BSc course and a final year (120 UK credits) at master's level, including a dissertation.&lt;ref name="QAA master's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FHEQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2843#.WK5-J38WI2g|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final MSci qualification is thus at the same level as a traditional MSc.

==United States==
The ''Master of Science'' (''Magister Scientiæ'') degree is normally a full-time two-year degree often abbreviated "MS" or "M.S." It is the primary type in most subjects and may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a combination of the two. The combination often involves writing and defending a thesis or completing a research project which represents the culmination of the material learned.

Admission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a [[bachelor's degree]] and progressing to a [[doctorate|doctoral]] program may require a master's degree. In some fields or graduate programs, work on a doctorate can begin immediately after the bachelor's degree. Some programs provide for a joint bachelor's and master's degree after about five years. Some universities use the Latin degree names and due to the flexibility of [[Latin grammar|word order in Latin]], ''Artium Magister'' (A.M.) or ''Scientiæ Magister'' (S.M. or Sc.M.) may be used in some institutions.

'''Mimaland''' was a recreation theme park in [[Gombak]], [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]]. It opened in 1971 and it ceased operations in 1994 after a landslide damaged the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohmedia.my/2014/06/taman-tema-pertama-malaysia-mimaland.html |title=Taman Tema Pertama Malaysia – Mimaland (1971 – 1994)|publisher=Ohmedia.my |date=2012-06-24 |language=Malay|accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mimaland started operating in 1971. The name '''''Mimaland''''' is actually an acronym of the word combination '''Malaysia In Miniature Land'''. Mimaland was built on a hilly area of 300 acres in Ulu Gombak near [[Kuala Lumpur]], served by an exit to the [[Malaysia Federal Route 68|old Gombak-Bentong road]]. It was owned by '''Mimaland Berhad''', a member of '''[[Magnum Corporation|Magnum Group of Companies]]''' (now '''[[Magnum Corporation]]''').

Mimaland's construction was done in phases and the theme park was opened in stages. Mimaland's first phase was completed in 1970, and consisted of 24 motels, 5 chalets and a swimming pool.

Among the main attractions, was the 'prehistoric animal park' containing dinosaur models of a very impressive size. Additionally, Mimaland also had a lake for boating and fishing activities, a 'giant maze', as well as a cross-forest area.

In January 1993, a 27-year-old Singaporean was killed while using the giant slide at the Mimaland pool. The incident shocked the public and resulted in a temporary closure of Mimaland. After improvement was done to the giant slide, Mimaland was reopened. However, a minor landslide caused damage to the walls of the same pool in May 1994. This incident caused muddy water to seep into the pool, causing the area to close to the public.

Several parties, including government agencies, took the management of Mimaland to court on a number of offenses, among which were security control issues. As a result, the court barred Mimaland from continuing its operations. Mimaland was closed permanently in 1994. Mimaland relics still exist to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4747">In [[computer chess]] programs, the '''null-move heuristic''' is a [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] technique used to enhance the speed of the [[alpha-beta pruning]] [[search algorithm|algorithm]].

== Rationale ==

[[Alpha-beta pruning]] speeds the [[minimax algorithm]] by identifying ''cutoffs'', points in the [[game tree]] where the current position is so good for the side to move that best play by the other side would have avoided it.  Since such positions could not have resulted from best play, they and all branches of the game tree stemming from them can be ignored.  The faster the program produces cutoffs, the faster the search runs. The null-move heuristic is designed to guess cutoffs with less effort than would otherwise be required, whilst retaining a reasonable level of accuracy.

The null-move heuristic is based on the fact that most reasonable chess moves improve the position for the side that played them.  So, if the player whose turn it is to move can forfeit the right to move (or make a [[null move]] - an illegal action in [[chess]]) and still have a position strong enough to produce a cutoff, then the current position would almost certainly produce a cutoff if the current player actually moved.

== Implementation ==

In employing the null-move heuristic, the computer program first forfeits the turn of the side whose turn it is to move, and then performs an alpha-beta search on the resulting position to a shallower depth than it would have searched the current position had it not used the null move heuristic.  If this shallow search produces a cutoff, it assumes the full-depth search in the absence of a forfeited turn would also have produced a cutoff.  Because a shallow search is faster than deeper search, the cutoff is found faster, accelerating the computer chess program.  If the shallow search fails to produce a cutoff, then the program must make the full-depth search.

This approach makes two assumptions.  First, it assumes that the disadvantage of forfeiting one's turn is greater than the disadvantage of performing a shallower search.  Provided the shallower search is not too much shallower (in practical implementation, the null-move search is usually 2 or 3 [[ply (game theory)|plies]] shallower than the full search would have been), this is usually true.  Second, it assumes that the null-move search will produce a cutoff frequently enough to justify the time spent performing null-move searches instead of full searches.  In practice, this is also usually true.

== Problems with the null-move heuristic ==

There are a class of chess positions where employing the null-move heuristic can result in severe tactical blunders.  In these ''[[zugzwang]]'' (German for "forced to move") positions, the player whose turn it is to move has only bad moves as their legal choices, and so would actually be better off if allowed to forfeit the right to move.  In these positions, the null-move heuristic may produce a cutoff where a full search would not have found one, causing the program to assume the position is very good for a side when it may in fact be very bad for them.

To avoid using the null-move heuristic in zugzwang positions, most chess-playing programs that use the null-move heuristic put restrictions on its use.  Such restrictions often include not using the null-move heuristic if
*the side to move is in check
*the side to move has only its king and pawns remaining
*the side to move has a small number of pieces remaining
*the previous move in the search was also a null move.

== Verified null-move pruning ==

Another heuristic for dealing with the zugzwang problem is Omid David and [[Nathan Netanyahu]]'s '''verified null-move pruning'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David-Tabibi|first1=Omid|last2=Netanyahu|first2=Nathan S.|author2-link=Nathan Netanyahu|title=Verified Null-Move Pruning|journal=[[ICGA Journal]]|date=September 2002|volume=25|issue=3|pages=153–161|arxiv=0808.1125|bibcode=2008arXiv0808.1125D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In verified null-move pruning, whenever the shallow null-move search indicates a fail-high, instead of cutting off the search from the current node, the search is continued with reduced depth.

The '''United States's Fulcrum nuclear test series'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a group of 21 [[nuclear test]]s conducted in 1976-1977. These tests &lt;ref group=note&gt;A bomb test may be a salvo test, defined as two or more explosions "where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points and does not exceed 40 kilometers in length". {{cite journal|first=V.

 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Estimated energy yield in [[TNT equivalent|tons, kilotons, and megatons]]. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184&amp;nbsp;gigajoules (1&amp;nbsp;gigacalorie).&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" class="unsortable" | [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known.  The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and "all" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shifra Baruchson-Arbib''' (born 1951) is a [[Full Professor]] in the Department of [[Information science|Information Science]] at  [[Bar-Ilan University]] Israel, specializing in the history and sociology of media. She was the Head of the Information Science Department (1990-1998, 2005-2008, 2012–2014) and has served as the Dean of the Faculty of [[Humanities]] at Bar- Ilan  University (2015-2016).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://is.biu.ac.il/en/baruchs_en|title=Baruchson-Arbib Shifra {{!}} Department of Information Science  {{!}} Bar-Ilan University|website=is.biu.ac.il|access-date=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her major achievements include her studies in the fields of the "History of Hebrew Books and Manuscripts" and of "[[Information science|Information Science]]", leading the Department of Information Science; and developing the academic field of Social  Information Science.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bar-Ilan University: from idea to practice: Milestones and history of   departments|last=Shwartz|first=Dov|publisher=Bar Ilan University|year=2006|isbn=965-226-321-4|location=Israel|pages=438–448| quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Shifra Baruchson-Arbib was born in December 1951 in Tel-Aviv, as Zipora Baruchson, to a learned rabbinical family. She is  married to Chaim Eric Arbib. Her paternal grandfather, Rabbi Yitzhak Baruchson, was a descendent of 17 generations of  ''Dayanim'' (judges of Jewish Law) and a leader in the [[Musar movement|Musar (Ethical) movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The   Musar movement: Its history, leading personalities and doctrines|last=Katz|first=Dov|publisher=Bitan Hasefer|year=1946| location=|pages=|language=Hebrew|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal grandfather, Rabbi Avraham Sochovolski, was one of the first  [[Scribe]]s (''Sofer Stam'') in Tel-Aviv in the 1930s. Her father, Shlomo Baruchson, was the owner of the "Shalom  publishing house" and was the first person in Israel to turn the Bible, the [[Siddur]] (prayer book), and the [[Haggadah]] (the  prayer book of Passover) into gifts by using luxurious silver book covers using the work of the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]] in Israel. Baruchson-Arbib's uncle, Yehuda Makavy, was the owner of the "International Company of Publishing" house and he initiated and published the first historical-archeological project in Israel. This project was published in a series of books called "The view of the Biblical World", edited by the know archeologists [[Michael Avi-Yonah]] and Avraham Malamat, and  "The Military Art in the Lands of the Bible", by [[Yigael Yadin]]. Baruchson-Arbib's family background greatly influenced her  scientific and research work.

Baruchson, Rabbi Yitzhak Baruchson, Yehuda Makavy ; back: Rabbi Haim Goldvicht; Tel-Aviv, 1950.]]

Baruchson-Arbib began her studies at Bar-Ilan University in 1970, in the Departments of Bible Studies, [[Jewish history|Jewish History]], and [[Library science|Library Science]]. She completed her master's and doctorate degrees in the field of Jewish  History in topics related to manuscripts, rare books, and the reading culture. In 1974, she began to work at Bar-Ilan  University as a research assistant&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;]. In 1990, Baruchson-Arbib was appointed Head of the Department of Bibliographical and Librarianship Studies at Bar-Ilan  University. As only a few students were interested in the field at the time, she changed the name of the department and its  content to The Department of [[Information science|Information Science]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This interdisciplinary field is  known throughout the world and regards the theory and practice of producing, collecting, processing, storing, retrieving,  representing, and distributing information. The field aims to understand the process that information undergoes as it  transforms from data to knowledge, and it trains information scientists, information managers, and librarians. Changing the  name of the department and its curriculum increased the number of students in the department from 50 to 500 in two years, and  it allowed its graduates to work in an innovative and modern field. Today, graduates of the department are employed in various  fields, including in high-tech companies, industry, hospitals, libraries, and the private sector. To date, the Department of  Information Science at Bar-Ilan University is the largest and most significant in the field in Israel, and it awards  bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Baruchson-Arbib has served as the Head of the department for many  years and has supervised more than 70 research students. She has also developed a new discipline in the field of Information  Science – the "[[Social Information Science]]" discipline.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Information Science: Love,   Health and the Information Society - The Challenge of the 21st Century|last=Baruchson-Arbib|first=Shifra|publisher=Academic   Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1898723363|location=Brighton: Sussex|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which teaches to balance between  [[information overload]] and the need for reliable and available information, especially in the fields of health and  [[welfare]].

In 1993, Baruchson-Arbib received the [[Zalman Shazar]] Award for Outstanding Research in [[Jewish history|Jewish History]],  due to her book "Books and Readers: The Reading Culture of Italian Jews at the Close of the Renaissance", which was published  in that year. This book was based on her doctorate work and received the Award due to its innovative methodology and  findings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to her research activities, Baruchson-Arbib studied the [[Milton H. Erickson|Milton Erickson]] hypnosis technique  in the United States, and she was accredited to practice hypnosis in the State of New York. Baruchson-Arbib has participated in numerous international conferences and has lectured at various universities, such as the  [[Sorbonne University (alliance)|Sorbonne]] in Paris and the [[University of British Columbia]]. She is currently a member of  several organizations, including the International Center for Information Ethics (ICIE) and the [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal  Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]] (RSA). In addition, she is a member of several journal boards,  including the Israeli journal 'Alei Sefer: Studies in Bibliography and in the History of the Printed and the Digital Hebrew  Book', the British 'Journal of Communication &amp; Ethics in Society', and the Polish journal 'Przeglad Biblioteczny Library  Review'. She is also a member of the board of directors of the 'Joshua and Bracha Barzilai Scholarship Fund for Jewish  Bibliographic Research', a member of the board of directors of the 'Naima and Yehoshua Salti Center for Ladino Studies', and a  member of the high-school professional committee for 'Digital Discovery and Finding' in the Ministry of Education. In addition to being the dean of Humanities at Bar-Ilan University, Baruchson-Arbib also teaches in the Department of  Information Science, where she gives various courses and seminars on [[information ethics]], the "digital man" in the  [[information society]], social information, and reference work. In 2013, she established the "Information 21" project, within  which the annual conference "Information, Society, and Industry" is held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://is.biu.ac.il/meyda21| title=The "Information 21" project website – including the programs of previous years' conferences|last=|first=|date=| website=is.biu.ac.il|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Until the 1990s, the research of Baruchson-Arbib consisted mainly of the study of Hebrew books, manuscripts, rare books, the  reading culture, and the Interdisciplinary methodology of book research – also known as "[[the new bibliology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baruchson-Arbib|first=Shifra|year=1984|title=Nuova bibliologia e storia del libro ebraico|url=|journal=Annuario di   Studi Ebraici|language=Italian|volume=10|pages=17–28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since establishing the Department of Information Science,  Baruchson-Arbib has published research in the fields of social information, public libraries, [[information behavior]],  [[library management]], and information skills.

=== The study of Hebrew books ===
Baruchson-Arbib began studying the field of "Hebrew books" in her thesis on Rabbi [[Jacob Margalith]] and his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rabbi Jacob Margalith his Life and his Work, Master thesis,|last=Baruchson|first=Zipora (Shifra)| publisher=Bar-Ilan University|year=1978|isbn=|location=Israel|pages=|language=Hebrew|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that study, and in  the related research publications that followed, the mystery of the controversial identity of Rabbi Jacob Margalith was solved,  identifying him as a Rabbi who lived and served in the German cities of Nürnberg and Regensburg, and who died in 1501. Rabbi  Jacob Margalith was the editor of the manuscript "''Sedder Gittin Ve'Halitza''" (The Ritual of Divorce and Levirate Marriage),  which aimed to serve as a unified codex of the Jewish ruling in laws of the ''Gett'' (the Jewish divorce document) and was  included in the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (the Code of Jewish Law). Within the hand-written manuscripts of this essay, Baruchson-Arbib  also identified previously unknown letters of Jewish Ashkenazi (European) sages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baruchson|first=Zipora (Shifra)|year=1979|title=Five letters by 15th century German rabbis|url=|journal=Alei Sefer|language=Hebrew|volume=6-7| pages=85–101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her doctorate work, Baruchson-Arbib studied the private libraries of the north Italian Jews at the close of the  [[Renaissance]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Private Libraries of North Italian Jews at the Close of the Renaissance| last=Baruchson|first=Zipora (Shifra)|publisher=Bar-Ilan University|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=Hebrew|quote=| via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was later published in the book "Books and Readers",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Books and Readers: The   Reading Interest of Italian Jews at the Close of the Renaissance|last=Baruchson|first=Shifra|publisher=Bar-Ilan University| year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=Hebrew|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baruchson-Arbib|first=Shifra| year=1994|title=Jewish libraries: Culture and Reading interests in 16th century Italy|url=|journal=Library History|volume=10| pages=19–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in a French-translated edition with a preface written by Professor Jean-Pierre  Rothschild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La culture liveresque des Juifs d'Italie a la Fin de la Renaissance|last=Baruchson-Arbib| first=Shifra|publisher=CNRS - Institut de Recherche et D'Histoire des Textes|year=2010|isbn=2-271-05933 X|location=Paris| pages=|language=French|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book and the subsequent research publications provide numerous scientific  innovations on the literary interest and printing culture of Jews at the time of the counter-reformation when Hebrew books were  persecuted. The book is based on a collection of manuscripts, altogether amounting to 628 pages that include 438 book  inventories, which were located in the homes of 430 Jews and 8 synagogues of the [[Mantua|Mantua Duchy]], and which were  presented to the censor, upon his request, for examination in 1595. The entire list of books is written in different  handwriting, and part of the lists mention the name of the owner of the particular library and sometimes his profession.  Altogether, the collection included 21,142 volumes, divided into 1234 titles in Hebrew, Yiddish, Italian, and Latin. The  research by Baruchson-Arbib was based on deciphering and analyzing the entire dataset, in addition to researching the tax  records of the community in an attempt to understand the influence of the socioeconomic background on the content of the  libraries. The censors who were appointed to examine and expurgate the books [including deleting 'forbidden' parts, such as the  words "''Goy''" (gentile, non-Jew), idolater, etc.] were three apostates, headed by [[Domenico Gerosolimitano]]. The censors,  who were highly paid by the Jewish community, visited the Jewish homes, deleted the 'forbidden' parts in red ink (which, to  this day, allows reading the text underneath the ink), and signed their names on the last page of the books to affirm that the  books do not contain anti-Christian paragraphs. Thus, Baruchson-Arbib concluded that all were satisfied with the arrangement;  the church, which censored the books, the Jews, whose books were not burned (thus allowing them to study and pray), and [[Duke of Mantua]], who continued to receive taxes from the Jews. Years later, Domenico Gerosolimitano wrote the "''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''" (''Sefer ha-Zikkuk'') – a guide to the forbidden parts in the books of Jews. The life and work of Domenico  Gerosolimitano, who was originally a Rabbi in Israel, were studied extensively by a doctorate student of Baruchson-Arbib, Dr.  Gila Prebor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baruchson-Arbib|first=S|last2=Prebor|first2=G|year=2007|title=Sefer Ha-Ziquq: The Book's   use and its influence on Hebrew Printing|url=|journal=Bibliofilia: rivista di storia del libro e di bibliografia| language=Italian|volume=109 |issue=1|pages=3–31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research of Baruchson-Arbib opened, for the first time, a gateway to analyzing private libraries from a time when the cost  of purchasing a book was very high. This is true mostly for the great Bibles and ''Pesika'' ('religious rulings') books, which  were extremely costly at the time. For instance, the price of the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' book (that includes commentaries on  the Bible) was equivalent to a month and a half worth of work; the price of the ''[[Talmud]]'' was equivalent to three and a  half months of work; and the price of the ''[[Siddur]]'' (prayer book) was equivalent to a day's work. Under these conditions,  it is no wonder that the typical library in most communities comprised between 26 and 50 books, whereas wealthy families held  libraries of between 101 and 350 books. Baruchson-Arbib found that the most prominent books in the libraries were prayer books,  ''Bibles'', ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'' (Ethics), [[Mishneh Torah|''Mishneh'' ''Torah'']] by Maimonides, and the ''[[Mishnah]]'' (the  oral ruling). In this society, the ''[[Zohar]]'' book (the Jewish book of ''Kabbalah'' and mysticism) was prevalent in  approximately 10.5% of the libraries, and the philosophical book of Maimonides, ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]]'', was prevalent in approximately 9.5% of the libraries, which indicates an intellectual interest in the study of  the occult and in philosophy. In addition, the libraries of the Mantuan Jews contained copies of books in Latin and Italian,  written by the great writers of the Greek and Roman cultures, of the Middle Ages, and of the Renaissance (including writings of  [[Virgil]], [[Cicero]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], and others). Nevertheless, Baruchson-Arbib  found that the most popular non-Jewish writings were [[Orlando Furioso]] by [[Ludovico Ariosto]] and the collection of love  sonatas by [[Petrarch]].

Baruchson-Arbib found that, in the Mantuan community, the reading culture also reflected class differences. The wealthier Jews,  such as Jewish doctors and Rabbis, owned the largest libraries, while the libraries of the tailor, the hatter, and the servant  comprised only a few books. The study shed light also on the fact that the interest of the Jewish community in books was  greater than that of the surrounding society. The study also delved into research on publishing houses, book prices, means of  book distribution, and the ambivalent relationships between the Jews, the church, and the local ruler. Some of the volumes of  the Jews of Mantua are today stored in the Israeli National Library and in Bar-Ilan University's library. In addition to many  new data revealed in the book, the study stands out due to its methodology, which integrates many disciplines, such as history,  statistics, sociology, and bibliography. Thus, the study of Baruchson-Arbib is part of the modern trend of the study of  history, and it implements the French school of "Livre et Societe" into the study of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Coming   of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450-1800|last=Febvre|first=L.|last2=Martin|first2=H-J.|publisher=Verso|year=1984|isbn=| location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of research, also called "the new bibliology", is discussed in other  publications by Baruchson-Arbib.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baruchson|first=Zipora (Shifra)|year=1989|title=The Investigation of   the Hebrew Book and Bibliometrics|url=|journal=Yad-Lakore|language=Hebrew|volume=24 |issue=1-2|pages=41–52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a  byproduct of studying the Mantuan libraries, 202 unknown published Hebrew books were found. Quantitatively, this is the one of  most comprehensive data found in this field of Hebrew bibliography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baruchson|first=Zipora (Shifra)| year=1990|title=In search of the lost books of the 15th-16th centuries|url=|journal=Alei Sefer|language=Hebrew|volume=16| pages=37–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baruchson-Arbib has continued studying Hebrew books, together with her doctorate student, Dr. Esther  Lapon-Kandelshein, in the fields of 16th century "''science books''" and the publication of ''"Ladino''  ''literature''" in Israel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapon-Kandelshein|first=Ester|last2=Baruchson-Arbib|first2=Shifra|year=2012| title=Ladino Press in Eretz-Israel: From Bak to Azriel (1843–1923)|url=|journal=Mahbarot Liyehudit, Studies Presented to   Professor Judith Dishon,|language=Hebrew|volume=|pages=351–388|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Information science ===
Baruchson-Arbib began her research in the field of Information Science in the early 1990s, when she published her book "Social  Information Science: Love, Health and the Information Society" (1996).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In this book, Baruchson-Arbib predicted  the benefits, problems, and challenges of the digital world, and set out a way of intelligently using digital and printed  information for the benefit of society. The novel discipline developed by Baruchson-Arbib was termed "Social Information  science" – a new field of research that studies the development and implementation of the various aspects related to the  transfer and sharing of social and medical information. These aspects include locating and processing information, researching  the needs of the society, the ethics of sharing information, and the development of computerized tools for providing social  information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baruchson-Arbib|first=Shifra|year=2000|title=Social Information – From Vision to Reality| url=|journal=Information and Librarianship|language=Hebrew|volume=25 |issue=2|pages=23–32|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the field  includes the development of relevant institutions and professions, such as information  banks (data centers) for social and  medical information that will be managed by a social information scientist, sections for [[self-help]] in libraries, and  private information services, information websites, and social portals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baruchson-Arbib| first=Shifra|year=2000|title=Social Information – A Challenge of the 21st Century|url=|journal=Information and Librarianship| language=Hebrew|volume=25 |issue=1|pages=16–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While developing this field of research, Baruchson-Arbib has relied on  several hypotheses:
# A person needs reliable, available, and rapid information for welfare purposes, for medical issues, and for support in life-changing situations.
# The required relevant information in these areas is divided into two parts. The first part is "''direct information''", i.e., information regarding organizations, means of coping within the bureaucratic institutions, and locating specialists who can  assist in special situations (doctors social workers, etc.). The second part is "''indirect information''", namely'', support '' information'' that can instill hope and help in coping and in managing one's life. This information is found in literature, '' poetry, films, and daily newspapers. Baruchson-Arbib perceives such literature as information that can assist a person and  provide a relevant example and model for the wellbeing and life management of an individual.
# There is a need for specialist "[[social information scientists]]", because there are parts of society that lack a high degree of [[information literacy]]. A social information scientist will help the information consumer to evaluate the required  information and to locate reliable information in various languages by using appropriate keywords and by being proficient in  the various visible and hidden information channels, including expensive databases.
# The role of the "social information scientist" is to retrieve reliable information and to outline a roadmap of "''direct and ''supporting information''" to a person in need.''
Baruchson-Arbib describes her vision and the ideal for the field of social information:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to have a large group of informed and skilled people in our society, and for humans to understand what is the power of information and the great potential that it has in assisting our lives, a new generation must be educated, .A generation that will learn, in schools, the new profession of information skills, and will be provided with information tools for social needs…"Social information science", at this stage, is the beginning of a vision to enlarge educated smart users and diminish "digital divide "; the materialization depends on the integration of currently available" information technologies" in a creative and responsible way by knowledgeable specialists, such as the "social information scientist" and a group of people proficient in information literacy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Baruchson-Arbib, the "social information" approach can greatly influence the role of public and school libraries in the community. The librarian/information scientist can serve as a "social  information scientist", constructing sections for "self-help" in libraries, directing readers toward relevant and accurate  sources, and turning the library into a center of information and culture. Due to the seminars given by Baruchson-Arbib in the  field of "social information", some of her students have begun to practice the social aspects of information; some of them have  established self-counseling and assistance sections in public libraries, and even initiated a project of "a Reading School" in  school libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belous|first=Yifat|last2=Baruchson|first2=Shifra|year=2001|title=Teaching information   skills to elementary school students by building an electronic resource center|url=|journal=Information and Librarianship| volume=26 |issue=2|pages=22–31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horenstein|first=Vicky|last2=Baruchson‐Arbib|first2=Shifra| year=2007|title=An experiment to enhance awareness of the power of information: The social information science concept and   individual empowerment in Israeli high schools|url=|journal=Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society| volume=5| issue =  2/3|pages=79–97|doi=10.1108/14779960710837588|via=Emerald Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, due to her research in  the field of social information, Baruchson-Arbib was asked to edit two volumes in the field for the "''Journal of Information '' Communication and Ethics in Society''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2007|editor-last=Baruchson-Arbib|editor-first=Shifra|title=Information Science Facing Social and Ethical Challenges|url=|journal=Journal of Information Communication   and Ethics in Society|volume=5| issue = 2/3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' Baruchson-Arbib has continued her research in the relationship between society and modern information tools in a series of  studies.

For instance, she has published papers on the future of the printed book in the  information society, information behavior of researchers in the field of Jewish studies and of university students, teaching  information skills, community information and the public library, plagiarism in the information society, information behavior  of start-up entrepreneurs, public library management in an era of changes, and the future of the information science profession  (a Delphi research). In recent years, Baruchson-Arbib is engaged in research on information in multicultural societies,  information ethics, and smart information usage.

[[File:Spencer Lister00.jpg|thumb]]
'''Sir Frederick Spencer Lister''' (8 April 1876 – 6 September 1939) was an English-born South African [[Physician|doctor]] and [[bacteriologist]].

Lister was born in [[Norwell, Nottinghamshire]]. In 1897 he joined West Hertfordshire Football Club (later [[Watford Football Club]]) as an amateur [[association football]] player, making twelve appearances and scoring three goals for the team in all competitions.&lt;ref name=WhosWho&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Trefor|year=1996|title=Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who|isbn=0-9527458-0-1|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He trained as a doctor at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] in [[London]], qualifying in 1905. He then went to the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], serving as medical officer to the [[Premier Mine|Premier Diamond Mines]] from 1907 to 1912 and to the [[Rand Gold Mines]] near [[Johannesburg]] from 1912 to 1917. In 1917 he was appointed Research Bacteriologist at the [[South African Institute for Medical Research]] in Johannesburg. He later became Director of the Institute and Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. From 1928 he served on the [[South African Medical Council]]. He wrote important papers on [[pneumonia]] and [[influenza]] and was also an expert on [[leprosy]].

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 1920 New Year Honours, for services to bacteriology.&lt;ref name=WhosWho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Colonial Office List", ''[[The Times]]'', 1 January 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

Lister died of a [[heart attack]] in the library of the Institute for Medical Research.

[[File:Gilles-Eric Séralini, October 2015 (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[Gilles-Éric Séralini]], in a 2015 photograph]]
The '''Séralini affair''' was the controversy surrounding the publication, retraction, and republication of a [[journal article]] by French [[Molecular biology|molecular biologist]] [[Gilles-Éric Séralini]]. First published by ''[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]] '' in September 2012, the article presented a two-year feeding study in rats, and reported an increase in [[tumor]]s among rats fed [[genetically modified maize|genetically modified corn]] and the [[herbicide]] [[RoundUp]]. Scientists and regulatory agencies subsequently concluded that the study's design was flawed and its findings unsubstantiated. A chief criticism was that each part of the study had too few rats to obtain statistically useful data, particularly because the strain of rat used, [[Sprague Dawley rat|Sprague Dawley]], develops tumors at a high rate over its lifetime.&lt;ref name=Hayes2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=CassasusNatureNews25June2014/&gt;

The publicity surrounding publication of the article also attracted criticism, with science writer Declan Butler calling it "a tightly orchestrated media offensive".&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/490158a |title=Hyped GM maize study faces growing scrutiny |date=10 October 2012 |last1=Butler |first1=Declan |journal=Nature |volume=490 |issue=7419 |pages=158 |pmid=23060167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a [[news embargo]], Séralini required journalists to sign an unusual [[confidentiality agreement]] in exchange for advance access to the article, prohibiting them from conferring with other scientists before the [[Science by press conference|press conference]] announcing publication.{{refn|group=n|[[Agence France-Presse]], 20 September 2012: "Breaking with a long tradition in scientific journalism, the authors allowed a selected group of reporters to have access to the paper, provided they signed confidentiality agreements that prevented them from consulting other experts about the research before publication."&lt;ref name=AFP20Sept2012/&gt;}} At the press conference, Séralini emphasized the study's potential cancer implications, and photographs from the article of treated rats with large tumors were widely circulated by the media.&lt;ref name=AFP20Sept2012&gt;{{cite web|title=France orders probe after rat study links genetically modified corn to cancer|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/750751/france-orders-probe-after-rat-study-links-genetically-modified-corn-to-cancer|publisher=Agence France-Presse|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Society of Toxicologic Pathology pointed out that, because such tumors are commonly found in older rats, the inclusion in the article of those images from treated rats, without also showing control rats, was misleading.&lt;ref name=Barale-ThomasMarch2013/&gt; Séralini also released a book and documentary film about the study in conjunction with the press conference.&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews25Sept2012"&gt;{{cite web|author=Butler, Declan|url=http://www.nature.com/news/rat-study-sparks-gm-furore-1.11471|title=Rat study sparks GM furore|publisher=Nature News|date=25 September 2012|doi=10.1038/489484a|PMID=23018942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following widespread criticism by scientists, ''Food and Chemical Toxicology'' retracted the paper in November 2013 after the authors refused to withdraw it.&lt;ref name=Elsevier2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier Announces Article Retraction from Journal Food and Chemical Toxicology|url=http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-announces-article-retraction-from-journal-food-and-chemical-toxicology|publisher=Elsevier|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor-in-chief said that the article was retracted because its data were inconclusive and its conclusions unreliable.&lt;ref name=Hayes2014/&gt; In June 2014 an amended version of the article was republished in ''[[Environmental Sciences Europe]]'', and the raw data were made public. According to writer Nathanael Johnson, not all of the raw data was, in fact, released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Nathanael|title=Retracted Roundup-fed rat research republished|url=https://grist.org/food/retracted-roundup-fed-rat-research-republished/|accessdate=4 April 2018|publisher=Grist|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal did not conduct any further [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]]; reviewers checked only that the scientific content of the paper had not changed.&lt;ref name=CassasusNatureNews25June2014&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15463|last1=Cassasus|first1=Barbara|title=Paper claiming GM link with tumours republished|journal=Nature|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Gilles-Éric Séralini}}
Séralini, a professor of molecular biology at the [[University of Caen]], is president of the scientific advisory board of the Committee of Research and Independent Information on Genetic Engineering (CRIIGEN), which opposes [[genetically modified food]] (GM food).

== 2012 study ==

=== Study background ===
On 19 September 2012, the journal ''[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]]'' published a peer-reviewed paper entitled "Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize."&lt;ref name=Seralini2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Séralini | first1 = Gilles-Eric | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize | url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0278691512005637/1-s2.0-S0278691512005637-main.pdf?_tid=45793e00-ad46-11e5-8d17-00000aab0f6c&amp;acdnat=1451295483_6248ce99f7b21b57b6f3855d0821febf | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 50 | issue = 11| pages = 4221–4231 | doi=10.1016/j.fct.2012.08.005 | pmid=22999595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews25Sept2012" /&gt; The two-year toxicity study, which cost €3.2 million, was conducted at the University of Caen by Séralini and seven colleagues. It had been funded by and run with the collaboration of CRIIGEN.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianSeralini/&gt;

The study used 100 male and 100 female [[Sprague Dawley]] rats, divided into twenty groups with 10 rats each. Ten diets were tested separately on the males and females. The diets comprised 11 percent, 22 percent and 33 percent genetically modified corn (NK603) and the rest standard laboratory rat food; NK603 corn that had been treated with Roundup, also at 11, 22 and 33 percent; and corn that had not been genetically modified, accompanied by differing concentrations of Roundup in the water. A control group was fed 33 percent non-GMO corn; the rest of their diet was standard laboratory rat food.&lt;ref name=VIB&gt;[http://www.vib.be/en/news/Documents/20121008_EN_Analyse%20rattenstudie%20S%C3%A9ralini%20et%20al.pdf "A scientific analysis of the rat study conducted by Gilles Eric Séralini et al."], Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie, 19 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–4}}

The paper's abstract stated: "In females, all treated groups died 2–3 times more than controls, and more rapidly. This difference was visible in 3 male groups fed GMOs. All results were hormone and sex dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable."

=== Publication strategy ===
Séralini held a [[Science by press conference|press conference]] on the day the study was released in which he "promoted the cancer results as the study’s major finding."&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012"/&gt; At the press conference he also announced the release of a book and film about the study.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tous Cobayes !: OGM, pesticides et produits chimiques  |first=Gilles-Eric |last=Séralini  |publisher=Editions Flammarion |year=2012 |isbn=978-2-08-126236-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2411114/ |title=Tous cobayes?

Seralini's approach was widely criticized. A [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] editorial called it "a public-relations offensive." The result of the confidentiality agreement, the journal said, was that critical commentary was absent from the first round of stories, the ones most likely to be remembered.{{refn|group=n|[[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], September 2012: "With such strong claims and the predictably large effect they will have on public opinion, researchers should take care how they present their findings to the public and the media. They should spell out their results clearly; emphasize the limitations and caveats; and make it clear that the data still need to be assessed, and replicated, by the scientific community. That didn't happen. The paper was promoted in a public-relations offensive, with a related book and film set for release this week. Furthermore, journalists wishing to report the research had to sign confidentiality agreements that prevented them from contacting other scientists for comment on the paper until after the embargo had expired. Some, to their credit, refused, or accepted and then revisited the story critically once their hands were no longer tied by these outrageous restrictions. The result was the exclusion of critical comment in many of the breaking stories — the ones that most people will remember."&lt;ref name="NatureOnSeralini2012"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Poison postures | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7417 | page = 474 |date=September 2012 | pmid = 23025010 | doi = 10.1038/489474a }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The press conference and publication occurred weeks before the vote on [[California Proposition 37 (2012)|California Proposition 37]], which called for labeling [[genetically modified food]]. The study was cited by supporters of the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/09/20129257471016420.html|title=California's Prop 37: Monsanto, GMO labelling and the public interest|publisher=Al Jazeera|first=Charlotte|last=Silver|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics committee of the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] wrote that Seralini's public-relations approach was "inappropriate for a high-quality and objective scientific debate."&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012" /&gt; Science journalist [[Carl Zimmer]] criticized the science journalists who participated.&lt;ref&gt;On the Media Radio Show, 2012 Sep 28 [http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/sep/28/manipulating-science-reporting/ Manipulating Science Reporting]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cosmos Magazine]]'''s [[Elizabeth Finkel]] said that the confidentiality clause had allowed Seralini's story to "prance unfettered" before second opinions arrived.&lt;ref name=cosmos&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130610121733/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/gm-corn-and-cancer-seralini-affair/ GM Corn and Cancer: the Seralini Affair]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Scientific evaluation ===
The study was criticized by various regulatory authorities and scientists. With few exceptions, the scientific community dismissed the study and called for a more rigorous peer-review system in scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinelli|first1=L|last2=Karbarz|first2=M|last3=Siipi|first3=H|title=Science, safety, and trust: the case of transgenic food.|journal=Croatian Medical Journal|date=February 2013|volume=54|issue=1|pages=91–6|doi=10.3325/cmj.2013.54.91|pmid=23444254|pmc=3584506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many said that Séralini's conclusions were impossible to justify given the [[statistical power]] of the study. Sprague-Dawley rats have a lifespan of about two years and have a high risk of cancer over their lifespan (one study concluded that over eighty percent of males and over seventy percent of females developed cancer under normal conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=521452 |year=1979 |last1=Suzuki |first1=H |last2=Mohr |first2=U |last3=Kimmerle |first3=G |title=Spontaneous endocrine tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=187–96 |journal=Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology |doi=10.1007/BF00401012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huntingdon_sprague_dawley_data/&gt;&lt;ref name=harlan_sprague_dawley_data/&gt; The Séralini experiment covered the normal lifespan of these rats. The longer an experiment continues, the more rats get cancer naturally, that makes it harder to separate statistical "noise" from the hypothetical signal. For the study to achieve such separation ([[statistical power]]), each control and test group would have to include sufficiently many subjects.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012/&gt; [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) guidelines recommend 20 rats for chemical-toxicity studies, and 50 rats for carcinogenicity studies.&lt;ref name=EFSA/&gt;{{rp|5–6}} In addition, if the survival of the rats is less than 50% at 104 weeks (which is likely for Sprague-Dawley rats) the recommended number of rats is 65.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="huntingdon_sprague_dawley_data"&gt;

Tom Sanders from [[King's College London]] noted a lack of data on amount of food given, and on growth rates. Further noting that rats are susceptible to mammary tumors when food intake is not restricted. Sanders said, "The statistical methods are unconventional ... and it would appear the authors have gone on a statistical fishing trip."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland.

The journal published a statement in their November 2012 issue, that "the Editors have encouraged those people with concerns to write formally to the Editor-in-Chief, so that their views can be publicly aired."

In March 2013 FCT published a letter&lt;ref name=Barale-ThomasMarch2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fct.2012.10.041 |title=Letter to the editor |year=2013 |last1=Barale-Thomas |first1=Erio |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=53 |pages=473–4 |pmid=23165156}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Erio Barale-Thomas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://be.linkedin.com/in/eriobaralethomas Erio Barale-Thomas linked in page]&lt;/ref&gt; Principal Scientist of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development]] and the President of the Conseil d’Administration of The Société Française de Pathologie Toxicologique (SFPT, French Society of Toxicologic Pathology&lt;ref name=sfpt&gt;[http://www.toxpathfrance.org/ webpage of the Société Française de Pathologie Toxicologique]&lt;/ref&gt;).  SFPT is "a non governmental/non profit organization formed by veterinarians, physicians, pharmacists and biologists specialized in veterinary and toxicologic pathology. Its aim is to promote knowledge in pathology, toxicology and laboratory animal sciences for safety studies of drugs, chemicals and food products, and the role of the pathologist in the study design and data interpretation."&lt;ref name="Barale-ThomasMarch2013" /&gt;  The letter criticized the Seralini study on several fronts, and concluded: "However, given this study presents serious deficiencies in the protocol, the procedures and the interpretation of the results, the SFPT cannot support any of the scientific claims drawn by the authors, and any relevance for human risk assessment. This letter presents the consensus scientific opinion of the Conseil d’Administration of the SFPT."&lt;ref name="Barale-ThomasMarch2013" /&gt;

The Belgian Federal Minister of Public Health asked the Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council (BBAC) to evaluate the paper. The BBAC was asked to "inform the Minister whether this paper (i) contains new scientific information with regard to risks for human health of GM maize NK603 and (ii) whether this information triggers a revision of the current authorisation for commercialisation for food and feed use of this GM maize in the European Union (EU)."&lt;ref name=Belgium&gt;Bioveiligheidsraad Conseil de Biosécurité (Belgian Biosafety Advisory Council) (2012).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Given the shortcomings identified by the experts regarding the experimental design, the statistical analysis, the interpretation of the results, the redaction of the article and the presentation of the results, the Biosafety Advisory Council concludes that this study does not contain new scientifically relevant elements that may lead to reconsider immediately the current authorisation for food and feed use of GM maize NK603. Considering the issues raised by the study (i.e. long term assessment), the Biosafety Advisory Council proposes EFSA urgently to study in depth the relevance of the actual guidelines and procedures. It can find inspiration in the GRACE project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grace-fp7.eu/|title=GRACE project|work=grace-fp7.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find useful information and new concerted ideas."&lt;ref name="Belgium"/&gt;{{rp|9}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The study was also criticized by the European Society of Toxicologic Pathology, which expressed shock at the way the rats in the study were treated and questioned whether the study was legal to perform under European law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomaeus|first1=A|last2=Parrott|first2=W|last3=Bondy|first3=G|last4=Walker|first4=K|last5=ILSI International Food Biotechnology Committee Task Force on Use of Mammalian Toxicology Studies in Safety Assessment of GM|first5=Foods|title=The use of whole food animal studies in the safety assessment of genetically modified crops: limitations and recommendations.|journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology|date=November 2013|volume=43 Suppl 2|pages=1–24|doi=10.3109/10408444.2013.842955|pmid=24164514|pmc=3833814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 reanalysis of multiple animal studies found that Seralini chose to forgo statistical tests in the main conclusions of the study. Using Seralini's published numerical data, the review found no [[Statistical significance|significant]] effects on animal health after analysis with [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]]. The finding that "in females, all the treated groups died 2–3 times more than controls" was not statistically significant. The highest mortality was observed for the group of female rats fed 22% genetically modified [[maize]]. This difference was not statistically significant. Seralini also originally claimed males in groups fed 22% and 33% genetically modified maize had three times lower mortality than controls, but this was also not statistically significant. The findings of liver necrosis and mammary tumors were also not significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Published GMO studies find no evidence of harm when corrected for multiple comparisons|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/07388551.2015.1130684|journal = Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|date = 2016-01-14|issn = 0738-8551|pmid = 26767435|pages = 1–5|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.3109/07388551.2015.1130684|first = Alexander Y.|last = Panchin|first2 = Alexander I.|last2 = Tuzhikov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that since it was retracted, Seralini et al.

Séralini responded to criticisms of his methodology (and specifically a lack of difference between rodent groups at higher doses) with a July 2015 paper in ''[[PLOS ONE]]'' claiming that all laboratory rodent diets are contaminated with "dangerous" levels of GMOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mesnage |first1=R |last2=Defarge |first2=N |last3=Rocque |first3=LM |last4=Spiroux de Vendômois |first4=J |last5=Séralini |first5=GE |title=Laboratory Rodent Diets Contain Toxic Levels of Environmental Contaminants: Implications for Regulatory Tests. |journal=[[PLoS One]] |date=2015 |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=e0128429 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0128429 |pmid=26133768 |pmc=4489719}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been strongly criticised by numerous experts,&lt;ref name="smc-plos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-investigating-content-of-and-contaminants-in-laboratory-rodent-diets/ |title=expert reaction to study investigating content of and contaminants in laboratory rodent diets |publisher=Science Media Center |date=2 July 2015 |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[Tamara Galloway]] said that the study "speculates beyond the evidence presented in this paper".&lt;ref name="news24-galloway"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/Green/News/Pesticides-in-lab-rat-feed-causes-a-stir-20150703 |title=Pesticides in lab rat feed causes a stir |work=news24.com |date=3 July 2015 |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Séralini supporters criticized the retraction of the study, concluding the response was a product of industry-driven campaign and regard this as a concerning example of industry interference in the scientific process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fagan|first1=John|last2=Traavik|first2=Terje|last3=Bøhn|first3=Thomas|title=The Seralini affair: degeneration of Science to Re-Science?|journal=Environmental Sciences Europe|date=29 August 2015|volume=27|issue=19|doi=10.1186/s12302-015-0049-2|accessdate=3 September 2015|url=http://www.enveurope.com/content/27/1/19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Officials ===
At the time of the initial release, [[French Prime Minister]] [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] said that, if the results are confirmed, the government would press for a Europe-wide ban on the maize and The [[European Commission]] instructed the EFSA in Parma, Italy, to assess the study.&lt;ref name=ButlerNatureNews25Sept2012/&gt; In late September 2012, Russia temporarily suspended importing GM corn as a result of the study&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Phys.org.  26 September 2012  [http://phys.org/news/2012-09-russia-monsanto-corn-imports.html Russia suspends Monsanto corn imports]&lt;/ref&gt;  and in November 2012, Kenya banned all GM crops.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Willingham for Forbes.  9 December 2012.

=== Media ===
The press conference led to widespread negative media coverage for GM food, especially in Europe.&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews25Sept2012" /&gt; ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' covered the press conference in a story called, "Yes, GMOs are poisons!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/ogm-le-scandale/20120918.OBS2686/exclusif-oui-les-ogm-sont-des-poisons.html |author = Malaurie, Guillaume | title=EXCLUSIF. Oui, les OGM sont des poisons ! – Le Nouvel Observateur |publisher=Tempsreel.nouvelobs.com |date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Entine]] in ''[[Forbes]]'' stated,  "Seralini's research is anomalous. Previous peer-reviewed rat feeding studies using the same products (NK603 and Roundup) have not found any negative food safety impacts. The Japanese Department of Environmental Health and Toxicology released a 52-week feeding study of GM soybeans in 2007, finding "no apparent adverse effect in rats." In 2012, a team of scientists at the University of Nottingham School of Biosciences released a review of 12 long-term studies (up to two years) and 12 multi-generational studies (up to 5 generations) of GM foods, concluding there is no evidence of health hazards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2012/09/30/does-the-seralini-corn-study-fiasco-mark-a-turning-point-in-the-debate-over-gm-food/|title=Does the Seralini Corn Study Fiasco Mark a Turning Point in the Debate Over GM Food? |accessdate= 11 May 2013|work= Forbes.com|first=Jon|last=Entine|date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Revkin]] wrote in a blog the study was another instance of "single-study syndrome", and that the study was in support of an "agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew C.

[[Henry I. Miller]], in an opinion piece for Forbes, said "[Seralini] has crossed the line from merely performing and reporting flawed experiments to committing gross [[scientific misconduct]] and attempting [[fraud]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/09/25/scientists-smell-a-rat-in-fraudulent-genetic-engineering-study/2/|title=Scientists Smell A Rat In Fraudulent Genetic Engineering Study | work=Forbes | format= opinion|first=Henry I.|last=Miller|date =25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Séralini responded by saying, "...that he won't make any data available to the EFSA and the BfR until the EFSA makes public all the data under-pinning its 2003 approval of NK603 maize for human consumption and animal feed."&lt;ref name="ButlerNatureNews10Oct2012"/&gt;

''The Guardian'''s Environmental Blog stated that the study linking GM maize to cancer "must be taken seriously by regulators" and that although it "attracted a torrent of abuse", "it cannot be swept under the carpet". They also noted CRIIGEN's funding of the research and reported Séralini's response: namely, that studies in support of GM food are usually funded by "corporates or by pro-biotech institutions".&lt;ref name=GuardianSeralini&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/28/study-gm-maize-cancer|title = Study linking GM maize to cancer must be taken seriously by regulators|accessdate = 8 May 2013|work = The Guardian|location=London|first=John|last=Vidal|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of California's GM labeling referendum, Proposition 37, hailed the study.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Right to Know.[http://www.carighttoknow.org/tags/seralini Posts tagged Seralini]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/business/energy-environment/disputed-study-links-modified-corn-to-greater-health-risks.html | title=Foes of Modified Corn Find Support in a Study | date=20 September 2012 | agency=New York Times | accessdate=15 November 2014 | author=Pollack, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement about the controversy, and especially the attacks on Seralini, was published in ''[[Le Monde]],'' signed by 140 French scientists; the letter said: "...the protocol followed in this study presents defects that are subject to debate within the scientific community.... We are deeply shocked by the image of our community that this controversy gives citizens.  The risk expertise to human health or the environment is a difficult activity which is facing many uncertainties. Many of the threats to our planet have been revealed by scientists isolated and confirmed by many studies coming from the scientific community. In this case, it would be more efficient to implement research on the health and environmental risks of GMOs and pesticides, improve toxicological protocols used for placing on the market and finance a variety of researchers in this domain...."&lt;ref&gt;Andalo C, Chercheuse AHS, Atlan A, Auclair D, Austerlitz F, Barot S.

=== Lawsuit ===
In 2012 Séralini sued the editor of ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'' and journalist Jean-Claude Jaillet for defamation after they accused him of fraud. The [[High Court of Paris]] ruled in Seralini's favor in 2015. The court said that the fraud allegation had first been made by  Henry I.

== Retraction ==
In November 2013, Elsevier announced that FCT was retracting the paper, after the authors refused to withdraw it.&lt;ref name="Elsevier2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casassus"&gt;Barbara Casassus for Nature News. 28 November 2013 [http://www.nature.com/news/study-linking-gm-maize-to-rat-tumours-is-retracted-1.14268 Study linking GM maize to rat tumours is retracted: Publisher withdraws paper over authors' objections, citing weak evidence]&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's editors concluded that while there was "no evidence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the data", the results were inconclusive and "[did] not reach the threshold of publication for Food and Chemical Toxicology". After an in-depth look at the study's raw data, no definitive conclusions could be reached regarding the role of either NK603 or glyphosate in overall mortality or tumor rates, given the high incidence of tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats and the small sample size. Normal variance could not be excluded as the cause of the results.&lt;ref name="Elsevier2013" /&gt; Following many enquiries about the retraction, FCT's editor-in-chief said that:
{{Pull quote|The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant [[Committee on Publication Ethics|COPE]] guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (i.e., conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Séralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error. The review of the data made it clear that there was no misconduct. However, to be very clear, it is the entire paper, with the claim that there is a definitive link between GMO and cancer that is being retracted.

On 1 August 2017, as part of a lawsuit against Monsanto, documents were released showing, among other things, that the Editor-in-Chief, Wallace Hayes, had once had a contractual relationship with Monsanto. Hayes said in an interview that he did not have a contract with Monsanto when he retracted Seralini's paper, and that his decision to retract it was not influenced by Monsanto at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/business/monsantos-sway-over-research-is-seen-in-disclosed-emails.html|title=Monsanto Emails Raise Issue of Influencing Research on Roundup Weed Killer|last=Hakim|first=Danny|date=2017-08-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the original study was republished with the addition of the entire data set, in the journal ''Environmental Sciences Europe''.&lt;ref name="SeraliniRepublish2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Séralini|first1=Gilles-Eric|last2=Clair|first2=Emilie|last3=Mesnage|first3=Robin|last4=Gress|first4=Steeve|last5=Defarge|first5=Nicolas|last6=Malatesta|first6=Manuela|last7=Hennequin|first7=Didier|last8=de Vendômois|first8=Joël|title=Republished study: long-term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize|journal=Environmental Sciences Europe|volume=26|issue=1|pages=14|doi=10.1186/s12302-014-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casassus2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/paper-claiming-gm-link-with-tumours-republished-1.15463 | title=Paper claiming GM link with tumours republished |  work=Nature | date=26 June 2014 | accessdate=26 June 2014 | author=Casassus, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire data set was published because of requests from the national regulatory bodies [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency|CFIA]], [[EFSA]], [[FSANZ]], [[Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail|ANSES]] and [[BfR]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/genetically-modified-foods-other-novel-foods/canadian-food-inspection-agency-statement-seralini-2012-publication-2-year-rodent-feeding-study-glyphosate-formulations-maize-nk603.html canada.ca: "Health Canada and Canadian Food Inspection Agency statement on the Séralini et al. (2012) publication on a 2-year rodent feeding study with glyphosate formulations and GM maize NK603"], 25 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor said that the paper was republished without further scientific peer review, "because this had already been conducted by ''Food and Chemical Toxicology'', and had concluded there had been no fraud nor misrepresentation."&lt;ref name="Casassus2" /&gt; The republication renewed the controversy, but now with additional controversy over the behavior of the editors of both journals.&lt;ref&gt;Science Media Centre.  25 June 2014.

In July 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] published a monograph on glyphosate, which contained an evaluation of the Séralini paper as republished in June 2014 and the conclusion, that the study "was inadequate for evaluation because the number of animals per group was small, the histopathological description of tumours was poor, and incidences of tumours for individual animals were not provided."&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol112/mono112-10.pdf IARC monograph on glyphosate, p. 35, right column]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermal science''' is the combined study of [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[heat transfer]], and [[combustion]].

==Overview==
Introductory subjects studied in thermal science generally are focused on [[thermodynamics]].  These include studies of properties of pure substances, pressure-volume-temperature diagrams, the [[ideal gas law]], [[heat]] and its relationship to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], [[heat transfer]], the [[laws of thermodynamics]], [[Heat engine|engine]] and [[refrigeration]] cycles, and [[combustion]].

Another area of concern in thermal science is [[fluid mechanics]]. These include [[fluid statics]], fluid flows, e.g. [[laminar flow]] vs. [[turbulent flow]], the [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli equation]]. The applicability of this area is piping networks, turbo-machineries, airfoils.

[[Heat transfer]] has applications for [[heat exchangers]], [[heat engines]], [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning]], and cooling of [[microelectronics]].

[[Combustion]] involves both thermal effects and chemical reaction.

Intensive study of thermal sciences requires additional knowledge and experience in other areas such as [[Experiment|experimental techniques]] and [[Numerical analysis|numerical or computational methods]].

'''''Undoing Gender''''' is a 2004 book by the philosopher [[Judith Butler]].

==Summary==
Butler examines gender, sex, psychoanalysis and the way medicine and the law treat intersex and transgender people.&lt;ref name=za&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zavaletta |first1=Atticus Schoch |date=May 2005 |title=Undoing Gender (review) |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/192731/pdf |journal=''[[The Comparatist]]'' |volume=29 |issue= |pages=152-153 |doi= |access-date=October 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on the case of [[David Reimer]] who was medically reassigned from male to female after a botched circumcision, Butler reexamines the theory of [[performativity]] that she originally explored in ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990). David then renamed as a girl- Brenda, rediscovers their masculinity and goes on to live his life as a male again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/genderwatch/docview/233630965/fulltext/BCC08508438546CFPQ/1?accountid=14169|title=Log In - GenderWatch - ProQuest|last=Chinn|first=Sarah|date=2017-03-07|website=ProQuest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of Butler's books are intended for a highly academic audience, ''Undoing Gender'' reaches out to a much broader readership.

Butler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is "automatic or mechanical". She argues that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The philosopher also debates our notions of "human" and "less-than-human" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a "viable life" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if their desires differ from normality. She states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life "unlivable". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.&lt;sup&gt;[[Judith Butler#cite note-37|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
