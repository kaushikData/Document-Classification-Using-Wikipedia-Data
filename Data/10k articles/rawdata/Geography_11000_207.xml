The '''A374''' is a main road in the [[United Kingdom]], one of six [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A-roads]] making the border crossing between [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. It is the most southerly of the A37x group of roads, starting and ending its journey with the [[A38 road|A38 trunk road]], from the outskirts of [[Plymouth]] in Devon to the [[Trerulefoot]] roundabout in Cornwall.

==Route==
[[File:The A374 into Plymouth - geograph.org.uk - 935996.jpg|thumb|The A374 in [[Plymouth]]]]
[[File:TorpointFerryNew.jpg|thumb|right|Torpoint Ferry, the A374 crossing over the River Tamar]]
[[File:Halfway House Pub on A374 - geograph.org.uk - 342931.jpg|thumb|The Halfway House, [[Polbathic]]]] 
Starting at the Marsh Mills junction of the A38, the A374 heads west into Plymouth, following the course of the [[River Plym]] along a section of dual carriageway. At Prince Rock the [[A379 road|A379]] merges from [[Plymstock]] and continues into the city. On the edge of the city centre it meets the Charles Cross roundabout, in the middle of which stands the preserved shell of the derelict [[Charles Church, Plymouth|Charles Church]]. Skirting the Plymouth city centre to the north, the A374 continues past the main buildings of the [[University of Plymouth]] and is met by the [[A386 road|A386]] near [[Plymouth railway station]]. Going westward down the locally notorious [[Union Street, Plymouth|Union Street]], the road enters [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]] and comes to the [[River Tamar]].&lt;ref name=OS&gt;Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 ''Plymouth &amp; Launceston'' {{ISBN|978-0-319-23146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The A374 continues on into Cornwall, across the river, via the vehicle carrying [[Torpoint Ferry]]. Through the town of [[Torpoint]] the road continues, following the [[River Lynher]], through the villages of [[Antony, Cornwall|Antony]] and [[Sheviock]] and on to [[Polbathic]], where the B3249 starts northwards to join the A38, avoiding a low bridge at Trerulefoot roundabout. The A374 climbs further through agricultural land, with the [[A387 road|A387]] joining from the west, and ends at Trerulefoot roundabout, re-joining the A38.&lt;ref name=OS /&gt;

==History==
The original road designated as the A374, as of 1922, ran from [[Horton, Somerset|Horton Cross]], just north of [[Donyatt]] in [[Somerset]], southwards to [[Colyford]] in Devon along the route of what is now the [[A358 road|A358]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/r10/notes.php?number=A358 |title=A358. |publisher=SABRE|accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Plymouth-Torpoint-Trerulefoot road (current A374) was designated as part of the [[A389 road]] to [[Bodmin]] in Cornwall at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml |title=1922 Road List. |publisher=SABRE|accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the phases of road re-classification carried out in the 1920s and 1930s, the Trerulefoot-Torpoint-Marsh Mills stretch of road formed part of the A38, as the Torpoint Ferry was the main route across the River Tamar. After the [[Tamar Bridge]] opened in 1961 the A38 was re-designated through [[Tideford]], on what was previously the route of the A374 and the current route of the A374 was numbered as such.

The current A374 also used to extend beyond Marsh Mills through [[Plympton]] to its southwestern edge, taking the previous route of the A38 prior to the Plympton bypass. However this has now been downgraded to the B3416 and other unclassified roads within Plympton town centre.

The A374 from Torpoint to Trerulefoot is also a very highly prized road in the motorcycling fraternity. Known locally as the "Torpoint Twisties" it offers a challenge to all with its series of bends and straights. However it also causes controversy because of the number of accidents and fatalities which occur, meaning the road has been classed as a "red" status road by the local constabulary and is patrolled regularly and monitored by static speed cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcsafetycameras.org/news/news-articles/091008.aspx |title=Speed detection on the Torpoint Twisties |publisher=Devon &amp; Cornwall Safety Camera Partnership |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''A38''', part of which is also known as the Devon Expressway, is a major A-class [[trunk road]] in England.

The road runs from [[Bodmin]] in [[Cornwall]] to [[Mansfield]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. It is {{convert|292|mi}} long, making it the longest 2-digit A road in England. It was formerly known as the ''Leeds–Exeter Trunk Road'', when this description also included the [[A61 road (Great Britain)|A61]]. Prior to the opening of the [[M5 motorway]] in the 1960s and 1970s, the A38 formed the main "holiday route" from the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] to [[Somerset]], [[Devon]] and Cornwall.

Considerable lengths of the road in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] closely follow [[Roman roads]],&lt;ref&gt;Margary (1967), 140-1 287-8 and 305-6.&lt;/ref&gt; including part of [[Icknield Street]].&lt;ref name="taylor-190"&gt;Taylor (1979), page 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Between [[Worcester]] and [[Birmingham]] the current A38 follows the line of a [[Saxon]] [[salt road]];&lt;ref name="taylor-96"&gt;Taylor (1979), page 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
For most of the length of the M5 motorway, the A38 road runs alongside it as a single carriageway road.

==Route description==

===Bodmin to Birmingham===

The road starts on the eastern side of [[Bodmin]] at a junction with the [[A30 road|A30]] before traversing the edge of the town to meet the A30 again. It travels through the picturesque Glynn Valley to [[Dobwalls]] and [[Liskeard]], which are bypassed by a [[dual carriageway]]. The Dobwalls section contains the most sophisticated [[bat bridge]] yet constructed in the UK. The A38 continues through the Cornish countryside, bypassing the centre of [[Saltash]] and continuing through the [[Saltash Tunnel]]. Immediately after the tunnel the [[River Tamar]] is crossed using the [[Tamar Bridge]] where the route resumes dual carriageway status. The section from Plymouth to Exeter is known locally as the Devon Expressway; it forms the southern border of [[Dartmoor|Dartmoor National Park]], and serves as a southward extension of the [[M5 motorway]] opening in 1977.&lt;ref name="highways.gov.uk"/&gt; It is {{convert|42|mi|km}} long and was completed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a38-devon/ |title=Motorway Database&amp;nbsp;— A38 Devon Expressway |publisher=CBRD |date= |accessdate=23 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416234421/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a38-devon/| archivedate= 16 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several [[Grade separation|grade separated junctions]] along its length mainly for local traffic; including a three-level stacked [[roundabout]] for the [[A386 road (England)|A386]], which heads out towards Dartmoor National Park. The route was reserved for the Parkway as early as 1943, when it was included in the Plan for Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/719176 | work= | title= Plymouth Parkway&amp;nbsp;— photo | accessdate= 4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the Marsh Mills junction was significantly remodelled, reducing the size of the roundabout and building a flyover over the top of it, allowing free flowing access from the Plympton bypass onto the Parkway. The viaducts carrying the A38 over the [[River Plym]], which after the construction of the Marsh Mills flyover became the Exeter bound sliproads, were built in 1969–70 as part of the Plympton bypass. They were replaced in the 1990s due to suffering from [[Alkali Silica Reaction]],&lt;ref name=marchmillsproblem&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bullard|first=T.P.|title=A38 Marsh Mills junction improvement|journal=Highways and Transportation|date=September 1993|volume=40|issue=9|pages=10–14|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/download.cfm/docid/145E621B-4F7C-4455-9A754C268F6D9FC7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the project, completed in February 1996 at a cost of £12.25million, involved the world's largest sideways bridge slide at the time for the {{convert|410|m|ft}}, 5,500 tonne bridge.&lt;ref name="Construction News"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/hochtief-completes-biggest-bridge-slide/956811.article | work= Construction News | title= Hochtief completes biggest bridge slide | accessdate= 4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giant Bridge Slide Completed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant Bridge Slide Completed|url=http://www.costain.com/news/news-releases/2010/3/30/giant-bridge-slide-completed.aspx|publisher=Costain|accessdate=27 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427185211/http://www.costain.com/news/news-releases/2010/3/30/giant-bridge-slide-completed.aspx|archivedate=27 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dywidag Systems"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biggest sideways bridge slide in the world|url=http://www.dywidag.co.uk/references/miscellaneous/details-miscellaneous/article/marsh-mills-viaduct-united-kingdom.html|publisher=Dywidag Systems|accessdate=27 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427205825/http://www.dywidag.co.uk/references/miscellaneous/details-miscellaneous/article/marsh-mills-viaduct-united-kingdom.html|archivedate=27 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This required the road to be closed for only 48&amp;nbsp;hours, which won it an [[The Automobile Association|AA]] National Motoring Award in 1996 for innovation and minimisation of traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.tgp.co.uk/services/projects/marshmills.html | work= Tony Gee and Partners LLP | title= A38 Marsh Mills Interchange | accessdate= 4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Brent]] bypass opened in 1974 and the [[Ivybridge]] bypass in 1973, both on new alignments. The A38 passes Endsleigh Garden Centre, which used to have direct access from the dual carriageway, although since the early 2000s this has been closed and the garden centre is accessed from the Westover junction for Ivybridge. After Ivybridge, the route roughly parallels the original route, bypassing the village of Lee Mill which is now home to a large trading estate. The road widens to a three-lane dual carriageway for the [[Plympton]] bypass. This opened in 1971&lt;ref name="highways.gov.uk"/&gt; and was the first section of the Devon Expressway to be built on a new alignment, as well as being the first sizeable dual carriageway section of the route. The route originally ended at the Marsh Mills roundabout, which when opened was the largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A38#Section_1:_Bodmin_-_Exeter | work= | title= A38 - Route Description| accessdate= 4 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090609163323/http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A38| archivedate= 9 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section of the A38 between the A382 junction and [[Ashburton, Devon|Ashburton]] was built on a new alignment parallel to the old road, and was opened in 1974. [[Trago Mills]], a locally well known retailer, is passed by the road. The Ashburton bypass, much like the Kennford bypass, uses the alignment of a much older 1930s single carriageway bypass, which was subsequently upgraded to dual carriageway by 1974.&lt;ref name="highways.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.highways.gov.uk/aboutus/documents/FOI_HA_Data_Response_Road_Bridges_Construction_Dates.pdf | archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/aboutus/documents/FOI_HA_Data_Response_Road_Bridges_Construction_Dates.pdf | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 10 August 2012 | work= Highways Agency | title= List of Road Bridge Construction Dates| accessdate= 27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the town of [[Buckfastleigh]], the route once again bypasses on a new alignment, although due to the challenging topography of the area, the road crosses part of the town on a viaduct. From Buckfastleigh to the [[A385 road|A385]] junction, the current road follows the route of original single carriageway, with the majority of this section being upgraded between 1973 and 1974, although a small section at Dean Prior was upgraded between 1966 and 1967.&lt;ref name="highways.gov.uk"/&gt; This section is of a poor quality when compared to the majority of the route between Exeter and Plymouth, containing several side turnings with short exit/entry slips, and properties which back onto the road.

The town of [[Chudleigh]] and the village of [[Chudleigh Knighton]] are bypassed on a new alignment, which opened in 1973, and the following section at Heathfield up to the [[A382 road|A382]] junction was upgraded from the original route between 1966 and 1968.&lt;ref name="highways.gov.uk"/&gt; Some of this section follows part of the old [[Teign Valley Line]] railway.

Before Kennford, the route splits, with the A38 heading for Plymouth and the [[A380 road|A380]] heading towards [[Torbay]]. At this point, the road becomes a dual two-lane road although a third-lane emerges immediately for uphill traffic as the route climbs [[Haldon|Haldon Hill]], which has an average gradient of 1 in 20 over a 4&amp;nbsp;km distance, and a maximum gradient of around 1 in 10 (the adjacent A380 Telegraph Hill has about the same maximum gradient). The third lane is lost at the top of the hill, and the next section, the Harcombe bends is an original dual carriageway section, older than the rest of the route and this is evident with its sharp bends.

The Devon Expressway ends near the village of [[Kennford]], south of Exeter, at the terminus of the M5. This initial section was opened in 1977, along with the remaining section of the M5, and is a three-lane dual carriageway. The village of Kennford is bypassed, on an alignment of a 1930s bypass, which was upgraded to dual carriageway in the 1960s and then widened to a dual three-lane road in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1974/jul/31/roads-south-west | work= Hansard | title= Roads (South-West), Hansard, 31 July 1974| accessdate= 3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A junction to the south of [[Exeter]] represents a third meeting point of the A38 with the A30, from which point the A38 [[Concurrency (road)|multiplexes]] with the M5 before re-emerging from junction 27 near Waterloo Cross, {{convert|21|mi|km}} north of Exeter. From junction 27 the A38 heads north via [[Wellington, Somerset|Wellington]], [[Taunton]], [[Bridgwater]], [[Highbridge, Somerset|Highbridge]] and [[Bristol]]. From Waterloo Cross to Birmingham, the road is paralleled by the M5, where the A38 has reverted to taking local traffic only.

From Bristol, it continues north via [[Gloucester]], [[Tewkesbury]], [[Worcester]] and [[Bromsgrove]] to [[Birmingham]]. Between Worcester and Birmingham the A38 followed the line of an identified [[Saxon]] [[Salt road]], one of six leading out of [[Droitwich]].&lt;ref name=taylor-96/&gt; At Bromsgrove, it meets the [[M42 motorway|M42]] and the B4096 at junction 1 at [[Lickey End]].

[[File:BristolRoad.JPG|thumb|left|A38 Bristol Road running through Bournbrook, Birmingham, before completion of the Selly Oak Bypass]]
It passes through [[Catshill|Upper Catshill]] and meets the M5 at junction 4 (along with the [[A491 road]]) near [[Lydiate Ash]]. From here to [[Edgbaston]], the road is mostly dual carriageway, single-lane sections having been replaced in the first decade of the 21st century (see history section, below).
[[File:Spaghetti-Junction-Crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gravelly Hill Interchange]] looking westwards; the A38 runs from the top left of the image to the bottom right. Here, the A38 crosses the M6 motorway and the A38 becomes known as the A38(M) between here and Central Birmingham]] 
In the centre of Birmingham, a section of the road becomes the Aston Expressway [[A38(M) motorway]], running from the north-eastern side of the [[A4540 road|Inner Ring Road]] through [[Aston]] to the junction with the [[M6 motorway]] at [[Gravelly Hill Interchange]], better known as ''[[Spaghetti Junction]]''.
[[File:A38(M) Aston Expressway.jpg|thumb|right|The [[A38(M) motorway]] looking southwards towards [[Central Birmingham]]]]
The West Midlands section of the A38 is one of the areas chosen by the [[Highways Agency]] to monitor the effectiveness of [[driver location signs]] in assisting motorists to communicate their location to the emergency services.

===Birmingham to Mansfield===
From Birmingham the road bypasses [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Lichfield]], before taking up the route of the [[Roman roads|Roman road]], [[Icknield Street|Ryknild Street]],&lt;ref name=taylor-190/&gt; (also spelt ''Icknield'' or ''Rykneld''), as far as [[Derby]]. At [[Wychnor]], the road crosses the [[River Trent]] and enters the district of [[East Staffordshire]]. At Barton Turn, near the B5016 junction, the road runs right alongside the [[Cross Country Route]] for around {{convert|1|mi|km}}. This railway line follows the line of the A38 from Derby to Plymouth. From Alrewas to Burton, the path called The Way for the Millennium follows the northbound carriageway.

From Clay Mills, the road passes through the district of [[South Derbyshire]], passing the grade separated junction with the A5132 for [[Willington, Derbyshire|Willington]]. There is the [[Derby with Burton services]] at the [[Burnaston]] [[A50 road|A50]] interchange. The road enters the City of Derby borough {{convert|0.5|mi}} north of the [[Littleover]] interchange. For nearly {{convert|4|mi}}, the A38 forms part of Derby's outer ring road, including three roundabouts: Kingsway (or ''Grand Canyon'') for the A5111; [[Markeaton]] for the [[A52 road|A52]]; and [[Little Eaton]] (or ''Abbey Hill'') for the A61 and B6179. The section of road between Kingsway roundabout to just north of Markeaton is urban in nature and thus subject to a {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit.

Originally terminating in Derby at the junction of ''Babington Lane'' with ''St Peter's Street'' (formerly the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]]), The road enters the district of Amber Valley where it passes Drum Hill just north of Little Eaton and is crossed at this point by the [[Midshires Way]] and Centenary Way. There is a junction for the B6179 to Ripley and [[Belper]]. At Alfreton, there is a grade separated junction with the A61, A615 and B6179. The section from Alfreton to the M1, the Alfreton-[[South Normanton]] Bypass, opened as the A615 in the late 1960s. This section has a grade separated junction with the B600 for [[Somercotes]] and the [[Cotes Park]] industrial estate, and where it crosses the Nottingham spur of the [[Midland Main Line]] it enters the district of [[Bolsover (district)|Bolsover]].

As a 1970s upgrade to the route of the [[A61 road (Great Britain)|A61]] north of Derby (which became the B6179), the A38 bypasses [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] passing through former opencast mining land, before joining end-on with the former A615 Alfreton bypass at [[Robert Watchorn|Watchorn]] Intersection. The road crosses the [[M1 motorway|M1]] at junction 28. Into [[Nottinghamshire]], the road bypasses [[Sutton-in-Ashfield]], dropping to a single carriageway configuration of 1980s construction, including multiple traffic light controlled junctions&amp;nbsp;– such as the Mansfield, Ashfield Regeneration Route ("MARR"). The final section of the A38 from Sutton, past [[King's Mill Hospital]] into [[Mansfield]], is purely urban in nature and is single carriageway, joining the A6009 in Mansfield Town Centre at the end of the route from Cornwall to the North Midlands.

==History==
When first designated in 1922, the A38 ran from the centre of Plymouth to Derby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/roadlists/1922.shtml 1922 road list]&lt;/ref&gt; It was later extended west from Plymouth on the former route of the A389 over the [[Torpoint Ferry]] to a junction with the A30 at Bodmin. When the Tamar Bridge was opened in 1961, the A38 was rerouted on the former line of the [[A374 road|A374]], through Tideford, over the new bridge and through [[Crownhill]], joining the old route at Plympton. The old route of the A38, via Torpoint and the centre of Plymouth, was redesignated the A374.

The A38 was extended north from Derby to the M1 motorway and Mansfield in 1977, partly on the former line of the A615.

The [[Liskeard]] bypass, stretching for {{convert|6|mi|0}} from the west of Liskeard to [[Trerulefoot]], opened in June 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1974/jul/31/roads-south-west |title=Hansard Roads (South-West) |publisher=Hansard |date=31 July 1974 |accessdate=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate improvement within the Glynn Valley, the [[Highways Agency]] stabilised a {{convert|840|m|mi|adj=on}} section of the road near [[Bodmin Parkway railway station]]. The work, which commenced in October 2007, was carried out to shore up the verge, which had been built on an [[Embankment (transportation)|embankment]] supported by dry stone walling and the root systems of large trees. It was completed in May 2008 seeing the installation of kerbing, road drainage gulleys, safety barriers as well as increasing the verge width to allow for a new surface water drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/16561.aspx | archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/16561.aspx | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 10 August 2012 | work= Highways Agency | title= A38 Glynn Valley Stabilisation | accessdate= 27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devon===

The A38 in Devon runs between Tamar Bridge outside Plymouth and junction 31 of the M5, where the motorway ends; this section is known as the Devon Expressway. It is mainly a two-lane dual carriageway which runs between [[Exeter]] and [[Plymouth]] serving as a continuation of the M5 motorway. It is a common route for tourists travelling to [[Cornwall]], though those wanting to use a continuous dual carriageway route to Cornwall can use the A30 rather than the Devon Expressway. It then runs concurrently with the M5 until junction 27, where it splits and enters Somerset independent but parallel to the M5.

During the mid-1960s, small sections of the route between Plymouth and Exeter were upgraded to dual carriageway, such as those at Dean Prior and Heathfield. This was followed by the construction of Plympton bypass in 1970-71, with the majority of realignment, such as the Ivybridge and Buckfastleigh bypasses, being completed during 1973-74. The route, now known as the Devon Expressway, was largely complete by 1975, with the final section between Kennford and the M5 opening in 1977, coinciding with the completion of the M5 during the same year. Whilst many of the sections were newly constructed realignments, some sections such as the Ashburton and Kennford bypasses were upgraded from the original 1930s single carriageway bypasses.&lt;ref name="highways.gov.uk"/&gt; The Parkway, the section of dual carriageway through the suburbs of Plymouth between the Tamar Bridge and Marsh Mills, was constructed in 1983-84, along a route which had been reserved for this road since 1943. This was followed by the construction of a flyover over Marsh Mills roundabout in 1992, providing a non-stop route between the Plympton bypass and the Parkway.&lt;ref name="highways.gov.uk"/&gt;

The Plympton bypass was used for a stage in the [[1974 Tour de France]], the first time [[Tour de France|the race]] had ever come to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bikebrothers.co.uk/tdf1974.htm| work= | title= Tour de France 1974| accessdate= 4 July 2009| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120722202810/http://www.bikebrothers.co.uk/tdf1974.htm| archivedate= 22 July 2012| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular belief is held that the Plympton bypass was newly completed, but had not yet opened. In fact, the Plympton bypass had been open some three years earlier.

The viaducts carrying the A38 over the River Plym, which after the construction of the Marsh Mills flyover became the Exeter bound sliproads, were built in 1969-1970 as part of the Plympton bypass. They were replaced in the 1990s due to suffering from [[Alkali Silica Reaction]],&lt;ref name=marchmillsproblem/&gt; and the project, completed in February 1996 at a cost of £12.25million, involved the world's largest sideways bridge slide at the time for the {{convert|410|m|ft}}, 5,500 tonne bridge.&lt;ref name="Construction News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giant Bridge Slide Completed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dywidag Systems"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/hochtief-completes-biggest-bridge-slide/956811.article | work= Construction News | title= Hochtief completes biggest bridge slide | accessdate= 18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This required the road to be closed for only 48&amp;nbsp;hours, winning it an [[The Automobile Association|AA]] National Motoring Award in 1996 for innovation and minimisation of traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tgp.co.uk/services/projects/marshmills.html | work= Tony Gee and Partners LLP | title= A38 Marsh Mills Interchange | accessdate= 18 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090413160337/http://www.tgp.co.uk/services/projects/marshmills.html| archivedate= 13 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any major road, accidents are likely to occur; however due to the substandard design of some sections of the route between Exeter and Plymouth, the accident rate has been identified as being above the national average for the type of road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11388.aspx | archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11388.aspx | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 10 August 2012 | work= Highways Agency | title= A38 Bodmin-Exeter Route Management Strategy | accessdate= 27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spate of accidents in April 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/KILLED-HORROR-CRASH/story-11510207-detail/story.html | work=[[Western Morning News]] | title= Two killed in horror crash | accessdate= 13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; heightened local awareness of the issue, with local MP [[Gary Streeter]] calling for a review of the road. A number of improvements have been made along the route in recent years, mainly being the replacement of worn-out road surfaces, such as those at Buckfastleigh and Ivybridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11388.aspx | archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11388.aspx | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 10 August 2012 | work= Highways Agency | title= A38 Wrangaton&amp;nbsp;— Ivybridge | accessdate= 27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects have also included the replacement of signage, and the reconstruction of exit/entry slips for side turnings, in a bid to make the road safer.

Presently, the route between Plymouth and the end of M5 is all dual carriageway, and branded the Devon Expressway, being the primary route that links Plymouth to the rest of the country.

Beyond the end of M5, the road runs concurrently with and as the M5 until junction 27. The original route between Exeter and junction 27 of the M5 (Waterloo Cross) was downgraded to become the [[B3181]] when the M5 was opened in 1977

===Somerset===
From Junction 27 of the M5 to [[East Brent, Somerset|East Brent]], the A38 runs broadly parallel to the motorway: junctions 22 to 27 are mostly spurs connecting to the road and all no further than {{convert|1.5|mi}} from it. The A38 runs around Wellington, through the county seat of [[Taunton]], [[North Petherton]] and Highbridge. Beyond Highbridge and junction 22, the road departs the motorway and resumes primary status, going through [[Winscombe]] and [[Lower Langford]]. This route is the suggested route for accessing the south of Bristol and [[Bristol Airport]] from the South West.

The centre of Bridgwater was a notorious bottle neck on the "holiday route" as traffic from both the A38 and the [[A39 road|A39]] had to negotiate through the town centre in order to cross the [[River Parrett]]. The construction of a new reinforced concrete road bridge, the Blake Bridge, which opened in March 1958 as part of a southern bypass took much of the traffic away from the centre of Bridgwater.&lt;ref name="Fitzhugh-93"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fitzhugh| first = Rod| title = Bridgwater and the River Parrett in Old Photographs| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-7509-0518-3| page = 93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the M5 in 1974 further reduced the traffic pressure. This is complemented by a link road (Western Way) linking the A38 and the A39 north and west of the town respectively.

Much of the A38 through Somerset was built as single carriageway, with some three-lane passing points. However, the construction of the M5 through Somerset, in the early 1970s, led to the building of links between the A38 and the M5 in the form of new roundabouts on the A38 linking into adjacent junctions on the M5.

===Bristol===
The A38 serves Bristol Airport to the south west of the city, and enters the city itself at Highridge, along [[Bishopsworth|Bedminster Down]] and into [[Bedminster, Bristol|Bedminster]]. It runs through central Bristol before leaving northwards along North Street, [[Stokes Croft]] and [[Gloucester Road, Bristol|Gloucester Road]]. It runs past [[Filton Airport in South Gloucestershire]] to meet the M5 again at junction 15. Thereafter it runs through [[Almondsbury]] and by-passes [[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire|Thornbury]] to enter Gloucestershire.

South of Bristol, the road was diverted in 2001 to cater for an extension of the runway and installation of a [[Instrument landing system|Category 3 landing system]] at Bristol Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bristolairport.co.uk/~/media/files/brs/about-us/bristol-airport-master-plan.ashx |title=Bristol International Airport Master Plan 2006 to 2030|page=12|publisher=Bristol International|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route south of the city, despite serving the airport, is single carriageway and suffers from heavy volume of traffic at peak times, and congestion along Bedminster Down. Drivers from the south are advised by road signs not to follow the A38 into the city, but to use the A3029 Winterstoke road to enter from the west, as this route has a greater capacity. As part of the "Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study", a link road is under consideration to the south of Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/planning-and-building-regulations/south-bristol-link-route-planning| title=South Bristol Link route&amp;nbsp;— planning| publisher=Bristol City Council| accessdate=27 April 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427203812/http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/planning-and-building-regulations/south-bristol-link-route-planning| archivedate=27 April 2014| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the congestion at Winterstoke Road and Barrow Gurney,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Village-calls-North-Somerset-clear-drains-avoid-road-disaster/article-469475-detail/article.html Village drains may cause road tragedy&amp;#124; Bristol News &amp;#124; This Is Bristol &amp;#124; &amp;#124; Bristol Post] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120917101857/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Village-calls-North-Somerset-clear-drains-avoid-road-disaster/article-469475-detail/article.html |date=17 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are very busy, especially the latter where the road can only accommodate travelling at one direction at a given time; and the incomplete Bristol Ring Road (A4174).

The route to the north of the city is also very busy: it runs as a single carriageway up to the junction with the [[A4174 road|A4174 ring road]] at [[Filton]], and where it runs as Gloucester Road is a busy shopping parade. Beyond the ring road, it runs as a dual carriageway past Filton Airport which lies in South Gloucestershire, which contains bases for Royal Mail, Airbus, Rolls Royce and others. Beyond the junction with M5 it runs as a broad single carriageway, again parallel to the M5 in route towards Gloucester.

The present road from Bristol through [[Horfield]] was one of the additional roads added to the [[Bristol turnpike roads]] in 1749. This passed through Thornbury to [[Stone, Gloucestershire|Stone]], just beyond the boundary of [[South Gloucestershire]], where it met one of the [[Gloucester turnpike roads]].&lt;ref&gt;Local Act 27 Geo. II c.28.&lt;/ref&gt; From Almondsbury, the road approximately follows the line of the Roman road from [[Sea Mills, Bristol|Sea Mills]] to Gloucester.&lt;ref&gt;Margary (1967), 104-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous main route out of Bristol (one of twelve roads from the city, turnpiked in 1727 was [[Stapleton, Bristol|Stapleton]] and [[Hambrook]] to the upper end of [[Tytherington, Gloucestershire|Tytherington]] and thence to Stone.&lt;ref&gt;Local Act, 13 Geo. I, c.12&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be parts of [[B4058 road|B4058]], B4424, and then unclassified roads. However, Ogilvy's ''Britannia'' shows a route following the B4058 as far as [[Cromhall]], then through [[Stinchcombe|Stinchcombe Bottom]], [[Dursley]], and [[Cam, Gloucestershire|Cam]] before joining the present road.&lt;ref&gt;Ogilvy (1675), 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gloucestershire===
The Bristol turnpike roads were continued by a turnpike road established in 1727, described as "from the City of Gloucester to the village of Stone being the great road from the north to west of this kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;Local Act, 12 Geo. I, c.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the road, follows a Roman road, but deviates from it between [[Buckover]] and [[Whitfield, Gloucestershire|Whitfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Margary (1967), 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The A38 was rerouted along the Gloucester Bypass when it was built, and the old route through the city became the A430. In 2007 the Gloucester South Western Bypass opened to traffic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/6518169.stm |title=Road relief as bypass opens soon |publisher=BBC News |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; costing £43 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/4455389.stm |title=New cash secured for city bypass |publisher=BBC News |date=18 April 2005 |accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is numbered A430 and not technically part of the A38, traffic wishing to continue on the A38 on the other side of the city is signed to use the bypass, rather than the existing A38.

Beyond Gloucester, the A38 was probably only improved in 1756 under an Act dealing with roads from that city towards [[Cheltenham]] and [[Tewkesbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1977), 348, citing Local Act 29 Geo. II, c.58; cf. Local Act 38 Geo. III, c.12.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--"Cheltenham" is in a list of trusts in Pawson; that this 1756 Act included A38 is inferred from 1798 Act.   --&gt; The next section (from [[Coombe Hill, Gloucestershire|Coombe Hill]]) was improved as one of the Tewkesbury roads, again from 1727. The Act refers to this as the Upper Way to Gloucester in contrast to the Lower Way, which went via Wainsload Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Local Act, 12 Geo. I, c.18.&lt;/ref&gt; When this Act was renewed in 1756, the road from Tewkesbury to a farm house called the Old Blue Ball (now Bluebell Farm) was also included. This was in [[Earls Croome]], Worcestershire, and was where one of the Worcester turnpikes ended.&lt;ref&gt;Local Act 29 Geo. II, c.51.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this stretch of the road originated as a Roman road, but the later road left the Roman line near Naunton in [[Ripple, Worcestershire|Ripple]]. The name Stratford Bridge on the county boundary confirms its Roman origin there.&lt;ref&gt;Margary (1967), 287-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worcestershire===
The current A38 road follows from the southern end of one of the Worcester turnpike trust's roads which was originally (in 1726) at [[Severn Stoke]], but an Act of 1737 extended it to Upton Bridge (taking it past Bluebell Farm).&lt;ref&gt;Local Acts, 12 Geo. I, c.12 and 10 Geo. II, c.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

North of the city, the road was a particularly important one as it connected the [[salt]]making centre of [[Droitwich Spa|Droitwich]] with the river Severn. In 1706, this was described as heavily used for the 'carriage of salt, iron, coals and other wares'.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1977), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="King06"&gt;King (2006), 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Turnpike Act for this road was an extremely early one, being passed in 1713 and recites:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The highway from the city of Worcester to the Borough of Droitwich ... by reason of the heavy and many loads and carriages of salt and other goods which daily pass through the said road is almost impassible for the space of nine months.&lt;ref&gt;Private Act, 12 Anne, Stat. II, c.3.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
When it was renewed in 1725, it was extended from the Tything of Whistons to the Lower Slip of the Quay of Worcester; from Droitwich to Dyers Bridge (M5 Junction 5) near Bromsgrove; and through the town of Droitwich from "Netherwith" [Netherwich] Bridge to a place called "Chapel on the Bridge".&lt;ref&gt;Local Act 12 Geo. I c.20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749, this was again extended through the town of Bromsgrove to Spadebourne Bridge, immediately north of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Local Act, 22 Geo. II, c.43.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the road leaves Worcester, it again does not follow the line of the Roman road in the same direction until it picks up the Roman line, just south of [[Martin Hussingtree]]. The Roman road took a more direct line over Rainbow Hill and through Blackpole, now [[B4550 road|B4550]]. From Martin Hussingtree, the A38 closely follows the Roman line to beyond Bromsgrove.&lt;ref name="Margary287"&gt;Margary (1967), 287.&lt;/ref&gt; The present road deviates from its line when it was originally classified at Droitwich where the main road is a bypass, the old road now mostly being [[B4090 road|B4090]]. This happens again at Bromsgrove, where A38 is again a bypass, the old line mostly now being [[B4091 road|B4091]] and Bromsgrove High Street (now partly pedestrianised, then through the town centre. The Bromsgrove Eastern Bypass was constructed in 1980. &lt;!-- Detail needed as to the dates of these two bypasses, with references --&gt;

A short distance north of where the old A38 (now declassified) joins the Bromsgrove bypass, is Lickey End, where an old highway intersection has been replaced by Junction 1 of [[M42 motorway]]. Here, the road is joined from the southeast by the [[B4096 road|B4096]], Alcester Road, which was from 1754 one of the roads of the [[Alcester]] turnpike trust.&lt;ref&gt;Local Act, 27 Geo. II, c.54.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuation northwards of B4096 is called Old Birmingham Road, because it was the original route of the turnpike to Birmingham, climbing to a pass in the [[Lickey Hills]]. The Roman road also went through the same pass, but its route to the pass was probably rather straighter.&lt;ref name="Margary287"/&gt; Beyond the motorway junction, the A38 was turnpiked, not as the turnpike to Birmingham, but to [[Halesowen]] and [[Dudley]], by the 1726 Act that also turnpiked Old Birmingham Road.&lt;ref&gt;Local Act, 13 Geo. I, c.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The next Acts appointed separate trustees for the Dudley Road in 1742 and for the Birmingham Road in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Local Acts, 15 Geo. II, c.7; 21 Geo. II, c.22.&lt;/ref&gt; The road continues from the M42 Junction 1 towards Catshill and up a short incline at which there is a fork. Prior to the construction of the M5 motorway in the early 1960s, the Halesowen Road continued West whilst Birmingham Road continued North to meet the existing dual carriageway just South of Rubery. After the M5 was constructed, all traffic was diverted along Halesowen Road which was widened and lit to provide a direct route for the A38 to meet the M5 at Junction 4 at Lydiate Ash, with the dual carriageway continuing North to Rubery. The original Birmingham Road survives to this day, but is noticeably lightly trafficked due to its cul-de-sac nature. Its considerable width makes it a very popular route for learner drivers and as such is affectionately named by local people as "Learners Mile".

The road from Lydiate Ash to [[Longbridge]] was laid out as a new road in the early 1960s to collaborate with the construction of the M5 motorway which opened in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Worcestershire Record Office, Quarter Sessions papers, deposited plans.&lt;/ref&gt; The road passed through the centre of [[Rubery]] until the £770,000 (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|770000|1965|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Rubery Bypass opened in December 1965.

Lydiate Ash was the northern end of the M5 for many years in the 1960s, with traffic transferring onto the A38, which was diverted at this point to link with the M5.

===Birmingham===

At Longbridge, new turnpike joined the Roman road and the original turnpike, and runs straight towards the city centre. Hutton, the Birmingham historian described the road:&lt;ref&gt;A. Cossons, 'Worcestershire turnpikes', ''Transactions of Birmingham Archaeological Society'' 64 (1946 for 1942-3), 65-66, quoting W. Hutton, ''History of Birmingham'' (2nd edition), 263-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Birmingham] to Bromsgrove 13&amp;nbsp;miles [is] made extremely commodious for the first four miles under the patronage of John Kettle esq in 1772 at an expense of £5000, but afterwards is so confined that two horses cannot pass without danger; the sun and winds are excluded, and the rivers lie open to the stranger and he travels through dirt at midsummer. &lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[Northfield, Birmingham|Northfield]] bypass, taking traffic away from the congested town centre opened on 11 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Dayani |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/birmingham-news/2007/04/13/relief-for-drivers-as-city-by-pass-opens-97319-18899329/ |title=Relief for drivers as city by-pass opens |publisher=Birmingham Mail |date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between Northfield and [[Selly Oak]], the road is likely to have been in use in the medieval period as the road approximately follows the boundary of the former Weoley Park, the great park belonging to [[Weoley Castle (house)|Weoley Castle]].&lt;ref name="King06"/&gt; A {{Convert|2.4|km|mi}} dual carriageway bypass ({{Coord|52.44696|-1.93923|region:GB-BIR}}) of the narrow section from Selly Oak to [[Bournbrook]] opened in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/a38-selly-oak-bypass/ CBRD » Futures » A38 Selly Oak Bypass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827171832/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/a38-selly-oak-bypass/ |date=27 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SellyOakBypass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=Transportation-Projects-and-Developments%2FPageLayout&amp;cid=1223268050283&amp;pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper|title=Selly Oak New Road and associated Highway Schemes|publisher=[[Birmingham City Council]]|accessdate=4 October 2011}} ''et seq''&lt;/ref&gt; This required new bridges to carry the [[Worcester and Birmingham Canal]] and the [[Cross-City Line|Cross-City railway line]] over the road.&lt;ref name="SellyOakBypass" /&gt; The destination of the Roman road was clearly [[Metchley Fort]],&lt;ref name="Margary287"/&gt; but A38 turns away towards the city centre.

After Selly Oak, the A38 takes the Bristol Road into the city as far as the Belgrave Interchange with the A4540 Middleway ring road. The city centre section takes a novel line, laid out as part of extensive reconstruction works in the 1960s, and is one of the few remaining pieces of the original "concrete collar" inner ring road. Thanks to being mostly underground, travelling through an underpass at Holloway Head and the two Queensway tunnels at Paradise Circus and Snow Hill, plus a flyover at Lancaster Circus, the A38 is able to travel straight through the city centre uninterrupted, eventually meeting, at a final underpass beneath Dartmouth Circus, the A38(M) Aston Expressway. The old road took a largely similar line as far as what is now Paradise Circus, before zig-zagging in a less direct and much slower route through the city centre, taking in the north side of New Street Station and then travelling along Corporation street to briefly rejoin its modern alignment.

Between exiting the city centre and the M6 junction 6 ("[[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]]") at Salford (on the border between Aston and Erdington), the modern route follows the [[A38(M)]] Aston Expressway, an unusual 7-lane, single carriageway (and speed limited to 50&amp;nbsp;mph) urban motorway which uses an electronic signage-controlled tidal flow system to provide 3 lanes each way off-peak, and a 4/2 lane split at peak times (prioritising citybound traffic in the morning, and outbound traffic at night). This merges directly onto the M6 in both directions, as well as the A5127 and A38 surface streets, via an intertwined series of flyovers, meaning there is an uninterrupted run from the motorway and these suburban feeder roads all the way to the southern ring road junction. The original route is now taken by the A5127, starting and terminating at the same points but providing a somewhat slower ride through mixed industrial and residential areas with several roundabout and traffic light controlled at-grade crossings, and since signed and re-engineered with a focus on local access, public transport and non-motorway traffic.

Beyond Salford, the A38 used to pass through [[Erdington]], [[Wylde Green]] and particularly [[Sutton Coldfield]] town centres (and then Four Oaks, Mere Green and Shenstone) on its way towards Lichfield, before the extensive Sutton Coldfield Bypass was built. This passes far to the east of its namesake town, as well as many other north Birmingham suburbs from Erdington through to Four Oaks, requiring an extensive diversion and use of redesignated link roads to access. The old route between Salford and Lichfield is now the A5127, with the A38 designation being transferred to the Kingsbury/Tyburn Roads (former A4097)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M6 Junction 6|url=http://www.route6.co.uk/m6junction6.html|website=Route 6|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the south end between Aston and the bypass origin at Minworth, and the London Road (former A446)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A446|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A446|website=Sabre}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the north end between its terminus at Bassett's Pole and the Lichfield turn, where it (and, via the A5148 link road, the A5127, A5, and now M6 Toll) joins the A38 Lichfield bypass, with the old London road continuing into Lichfield as the A5206. Along the way, it has large roundabout interchanges with the [[A453]] (Sutton-Tamworth, locally) and [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] roads, the latter having been upgraded with a free-flow underpass for the A38 to ease congestion, in concert with the former A5 through Hints being superseded by a dual carriageway bypass starting at the A38.

The bypass is 2-lane dual carriageway throughout, offers a 40&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit from Salford to Minworth, and is national speed limit (70&amp;nbsp;mph for light vehicles) for most of the rest of its run. It is not, however, well-grade separated; all junctions as far as Minworth are at-grade, and although most minor local roads pass over or under the rural section without interacting with it at all (or at least are limited to left-in/left-out access only), a new underpass has been built at Weeford, and many gaps have been stopped up, there still remains some flat junctions with major cross-roads and right-turn gaps in the central reservation even as far as the Lichfield junction itself (beyond which, the road is of a somewhat higher standard).

In Erdington and Sutton Coldfield, the original A5127 has been bypassed a second time by more minor urban relief roads, easing congestion in and allowing partial pedestrianisation of their respective town centre shopping areas. A further bypass between Sutton centre and the northern junction with the A453 Tamworth Road has long been under consideration to remove pressure from the narrow, mediaeval "high street" section (that features a pair of historic coaching inns and was, originally, part of the A38), but no actual plans have yet been confirmed even after many decades of discussion.

The bypass itself has been partly superseded, initially by the M42 further to the east, and in more recent years by the [[M6 Toll]], which intersects it at junction T3, runs directly alongside part of the former A446 section between Bassett's Pole and Weeford Island, where it veers off (and has a further junction, T4) to shadow the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] instead, also crossing the A5127 (at the limited-access junction T5) a few miles later on. The bypass has been effectively slightly downgraded as a result, first with the at-grade, signalised roundabouts of junction T3 interrupting traffic flow, and soon after by the imposition of a 60&amp;nbsp;mph, SPECS-enforced average speed limit (ostensibly because of a substandard alignment - parts of the southbound carriageway were formed directly from the old A446 - and in order to discourage illegal car and motorcycle racing) on the A453-to-A5 section, making the toll road a slightly faster option even during off-peak hours.

Historically, it is not clear which turnpike trust was responsible for the section of road from Birmingham to Lichfield, or even whether it ''was'' a turnpike. Also, the A5127 out of Sutton picks up the Roman road route a little north of Mere Green (having itself diverted via Metchley Fort, the modern suburbs of Perry Barr and Kingstanding, then Sutton Park and Four Oaks/Little Aston), and follows it to Lichfield. The point south of Lichfield where it interchanges with the A5 (once a staggered junction, altered to a simpler crossroads roundabout by the Wall Bypass, then complicated once more by the coming of the A38/A5148 and M6 Toll) marks the crossing of two Roman streets, with the old A5 continuing to the historic fort of Wall, a mile or so after branching off to the west.

===Staffordshire===
The road (now [[A5127 road|A5127]]) from the county boundary at Shenstone Woodend, through [[Shenstone, Staffordshire|Shenstone]] to Lichfield was one of the roads of the [[Lichfield Turnpike Trust]], established in 1729.&lt;ref name="LichAct"&gt;Local Act, 2 Geo. II, c.5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this section of the old A38 has been replaced by new dual carriageways.

Beyond Lichfield, the old A38 (now A5127) joins the Roman [[Ryknild Street]] at [[Streethay]]&lt;ref name="Margary305"&gt;Margary (1967), 305-6.&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately after that A5127 joins the present A38. Ryknild Street had to that point run roughly parallel to A38, but following a different line from [[Metchley Fort|Metchley]] through [[Wall, Staffordshire|Wall]], its line sometimes being used by modern roads (including [[B4138 road|B4138]]).&lt;ref name="Margary305"/&gt;

The section from Lichfield to [[Alrewas]] was dualled in 1958. The £500,000 (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|500000|1962|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} section from Alrewas to Wychnor Farm near [[Wychnor Hall]], and the £150,000 (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|150000|1962|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}section from Wychnor Farm to Barton Turn both opened in 1962. The further section of the route was improved to dual carriageway standard, including the £350,000 {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} section from [[Barton Turn]] (near [[Barton-under-Needwood]]) to [[Branston, Staffordshire|Branston]] in February 1964, bypassing [[Burton upon Trent]] in June 1967 (costing £2.6M (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|2600000|1967|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}), which stretched from Branston to Clay Mills and actually shortened the route&amp;nbsp;– now the A5121 - by {{convert|1|mi}}), and in recent years many of the [[At-grade intersection|at-grade junctions]] have been upgraded or stopped-up.

This long stretch of road closely follows Ryknild Street (whose destination was the Roman fort at [[Little Chester]]) until just short of Branston where A38 swings west, perhaps to avoid low ground. The Roman road is used by minor roads through the suburbs of Burton upon Trent and then [[A5121 road|A5121]] to rejoin the present A38 beyond the [[River Dove, Central England|river Dove]] near Clay Mills.&lt;ref name="Margary305"/&gt; The road from Lichfield to Burton upon Trent was another of the roads maintained by the Lichfield Turnpike Trust from 1729. This diverged from the present line at Branston, taking the road through the town centre, and is now classified as A5121.&lt;ref name="LichAct"/&gt; The road from Burton to [[Derby]] was turpiked in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;Local Act, 26 Geo. II, c.59.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the start of the Derby bypass, the old A38 has been reclassified as [[A5250 road|A5250]]. This follows Ryknild Street as far as Littleover.&lt;ref name="Margary305"/&gt;

===Derbyshire===
In March 1969, the 'Allestree Link Road', from the A6 at [[Allestree]] to the former A61 was opened, crossing the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] and Midland Main Line.

Further improvements in the late 1960s and 1970s saw construction of the £5.2 million (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|5200000|1975|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} [[Mickleover]] bypass to the south-west of Derby opened on 19 February 1975. Although the government had approved the section through Allestree as early as 1974, before the Mickleover bypass had been completed, this section had many objections from nearby residents, delaying its construction (from the A52 to the A6). It was opposed directly by Derby Borough Council and the former [[University of Derby|Derby Higher Education College]]. The £17 million (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|17000000|1983|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} road was eventually opened on 7 September 1983, known as ''Queensway''. An extension of the A38 northwards, crossing the [[M1 motorway|M1]] at Junction 28, and ending in Mansfield was built. The £3 million (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|3000000|1977|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Little Eaton-[[Holbrook, Derbyshire|Holbrook]] Improvement opened on 3 October 1977.

The £12 million (£{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|12000000|1977|{{inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} {{convert|10|mi|adj=on}} [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]]-[[Swanwick, Derbyshire|Swanwick]] Bypass was opened by [[Eric Varley]] (MP for Chesterfield) on 21 October 1977, although the section from Alfreton to the Hartshay Hill roundabout with the [[A610 road|A610]] had been open to traffic since 5 September 1977.

===Nottinghamshire===
To the east of Junction 28 of the M1, the road used to be the A615 until October 1977. The alignment of this road is relatively modern as the dangerous junction with Berristow Lane was improved to grade-separated in the late 1990s, incorporating access to a busy shopping centre.

Between 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled extensively in the [[Americas]], exploring and describing it for the first time from a modern scientific [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]. His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years. Humboldt was one of the first people to propose that the lands bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]] were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). Humboldt resurrected the use of the word ''cosmos'' from the ancient Greek and assigned it to his multi-volume treatise, ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', in which he sought to unify diverse branches of scientific knowledge and culture. This important work also motivated a holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity.&lt;ref name="Walls 2009 3–15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walls|first=L.D.|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos|journal=Minding Nature|volume=August 2009|pages=3–15|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person to describe the phenomenon and cause of [[Climate change#Human influences|human-induced climate change]], in 1800 and again in 1831, based on observations generated during his travels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Early life and education===
[[File:Alexander von Humboldt and Mother.jpg|thumb|left|Humboldt as a boy with his widowed mother, Maria Elisabeth (Colomb) von Humboldt]]
Alexander von Humboldt was born in Berlin in [[Prussia]] on 14 September 1769.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hermann Klencke, Gustav Schlesier, ''Lives of the brothers Humboldt, Alexander and William'' New York (1853), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized as a baby in the Lutheran faith, with the Duke of Brunswick serving as godfather.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=3}}

Humboldt's father, Alexander Georg von Humboldt, belonged to a prominent [[Pomerania]]n family, although not one of the titled gentry; a major in the [[Prussian Army]], who had served with the Duke of Brunswick.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=4-5}} At age 42, Alexander Georg was rewarded for his services in the [[Seven Years' War]] with the post of Royal [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Humboldt, Friedrich Heinrich Alexander von |volume=13 |pages=873-875 |first=Agnes Mary |last=Clerke |authorlink=Agnes Mary Clerke}}&lt;/ref&gt; He profited from the contract to lease state lotteries and tobacco sales.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=5}} He first married the daughter of Prussian General Adjutant Schweder.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1766, Alexander Georg married Maria Elisabeth Colomb, a well-educated woman and widow of Baron Hollwede, with whom she had a son. Alexander Georg and Maria Elisabeth had three children, a daughter, who died young, and then two sons, Wilhelm and Alexander. Her first-born son, Wilhelm's and Alexander's half-brother, was something of a ne'er do well, not often mentioned in the family history.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=6-7}}

Alexander Georg died in 1779, leaving the brothers Humboldt in the care of their emotionally distant mother. She did have high ambitions for Alexander and his older brother Wilhelm, hiring excellent tutors, who were [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, including Kantian physician [[Marcus Herz]] and botanist [[Karl Ludwig Willdenow]], who became one of the most important botanists in Germany.{{sfn|Nicolson|1995|p=xvi}} Humboldt's mother expected them to become civil servants of the Prussian state.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=13, 17}} The money Baron Holwede left to Alexander's mother became, after her death, instrumental in funding Alexander's explorations, contributing more than 70% of his private income.{{clarify|date=January 2016}}

Due to his youthful penchant for collecting and labeling plants, shells and insects, Alexander received the playful title of "the little apothecary".&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Marked for a political career, Alexander studied [[finance]] for six months in 1787 at the [[Viadrina European University|University of Frankfurt (Oder)]], which his mother might have chosen less for its academic excellence than its closeness to their home in Berlin.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=17}} On 25 April 1789 he matriculated at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], then known for the lectures of [[Christian Gottlob Heine|C. G. Heyne]] and anatomist [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|J. F. Blumenbach]].{{sfn|Nicolson|1995|p=xvi}} His brother Wilhelm was already a student at Göttingen, but they did not interact much since their intellectual interests were quite different.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=18}} His vast and varied interests were by this time fully developed.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

At Göttingen he met [[Georg Forster]], a naturalist who had been with Captain [[James Cook]] on his second voyage.{{sfn|Nicolson|1995|pp=xvi-xv}} Humboldt traveled with Forster in Europe. The two traveled to England, Humboldt's first sea voyage, The Netherlands, and France.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=18}}{{sfn|Nicolson|1995|p=xv}} In England, he met Sir [[Joseph Banks]], President of the [[Royal Society]], who had traveled with Captain Cook; Banks showed Humboldt his huge herbarium, with specimens of the South Sea tropics.{{sfn|Nicolson|1995|p=xv}} The scientific friendship between Banks and Humboldt lasted until Banks's death in 1820, and the two shared botanical specimens for study. Banks also mobilized his scientific contacts in later years to aid Humboldt's work.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=76, 136}}

Humboldt's scientific excursion up the [[Rhine]] resulted in his 1790 treatise ''Mineralogische Beobachtungen über einige Basalte am Rhein'' (Brunswick, 1790)&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; (''Mineralogic Observations on Several Basalts on the River Rhine'').

[[File:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Alexander von Humboldt by [[Friedrich Georg Weitsch]], 1806]]
Humboldt's passion for travel was of long standing. Humboldt's talents were devoted to the purpose of preparing himself as a scientific explorer. With this emphasis, he studied commerce and foreign languages at [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]], geology at [[Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg]] in 1791 under [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|A.G. Werner]], leader of the [[Neptunist]] school of geology;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Wilson, "Alexander von Humboldt: A Chronology from 1769 to 1859" in ''Personal Narrative of A Journey to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent'' by Alexander von Humboldt. London: Penguin Books 1995, p. lxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; from anatomy at [[University of Jena|Jena]] under [[Justus Christian Loder|J.C. Loder]]; and astronomy and the use of scientific instruments under [[Franz Xaver von Zach|F.X. von Zach]] and [[Johann Gottfried Koehler|J.G. Köhler]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; At Freiberg, he met a number of men who were to prove important to him in his later career, including Spaniard Manuel del Rio, who became director of the School of Mines the crown established in Mexico; [[Christian Leopold von Buch]], who became a regional geologist; and, most importantly, Karl Freiesleben, who became Humboldt's tutor and close friend. During this period, his brother Wilhelm married, but Alexander did not attend the nuptials.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=51}}

===Travels and work in Europe===
Humboldt graduated from the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Freiberg School of Mines]] in 1792 and was appointed to a Prussian government position in the Department of Mines as an inspector in Bayreuth and the Fichtel mountains. Humboldt was excellent at his job, with production of gold ore in his first year outstripping the previous eight years.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=53}} During his period as a mine inspector, Humboldt demonstrated his deep concern for the men laboring in the mines. He opened a free school for miners, paid for out of his own pocket, which became an unchartered government training school for labor. He also sought to establish an emergency relief fund for miners, aiding them following accidents.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=54-55}}

Humboldt's researches into the vegetation of the mines of [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] led to the publication in Latin (1793) of his ''Florae Fribergensis, accedunt Aphorismi ex Doctrina, Physiologiae Chemicae Plantarum'', which was a compendium of his botantical researches.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, "Alexander von Humboldt: A Chronology", p. lxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; That publication brought him to the attention of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who had met Humboldt at the family home when Alexander was a boy, but Goethe was now interested in meeting the young scientist in order to discuss metamorphism of plants.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=18, 57}} An introduction was arranged by Humboldt's brother who lived in the university town of Jena, not far from Goethe. Goethe had developed his own extensive theories on comparative anatomy. Working before Darwin, he believed that animals had an internal force, an ''urform'', that gave them a basic shape and then they were further adapted to their environment by an external force. Humboldt urged him to publish his theories. Together the two discussed and expanded these ideas. Goethe and Humboldt soon became close friends.

Humboldt would often return to Jena in the years that followed. Goethe remarked about Humboldt to friends that he had never met anyone so versatile. Humboldt's drive served as an inspiration for Goethe. In 1797, Humboldt returned to Jena for three months. During this time Goethe moved from his residence in Weimar to reside in Jena. Together Humboldt and Goethe would attend university lectures on anatomy and conduct their own experiments. One experiment involved hooking up a frog leg to various metals. They found no effect until the moisture of Humboldt's breath triggered a reaction that caused the frog leg to leap off the table. Humboldt would describe this as one of his favorite experiments because it was as if he was "breathing life into" the leg.{{sfn|Wulf|2015}}

During this visit, a thunderstorm killed a farmer and his wife. Humboldt obtained their corpses and analyzed them in the anatomy tower of the university.{{sfn|Wulf|2015}}

[[File:Weimarer Klassik.jpg|thumb|left|Schiller, Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt with Goethe in [[Jena]]]]
In 1794 Humboldt was admitted to the famous group of intellectuals and cultural leaders of [[Weimar Classicism]]. Goethe and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] were the key figures at the time. Humboldt contributed (7 June 1795) to Schiller's new periodical, ''Die Horen'', a philosophical [[allegory]] entitled ''Die Lebenskraft, oder der rhodische Genius''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1792 and 1797 Humboldt was in [[Vienna]]; in 1795 he made a geological and botanical tour through Switzerland and Italy. Although this service to the state was regarded by him as only an apprenticeship to the service of science, he fulfilled its duties with such conspicuous ability that not only did he rise rapidly to the highest post in his department, but he was also entrusted with several important diplomatic missions.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The death of his stern mother, on 19 November 1796 after a year's suffering with cancer, set him free. Neither brother attended the funeral.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=39}} Humboldt had not hidden his aversion to his mother, with one correspondent writing him after her death, "her death...must be particularly welcomed by you."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Freiesleben quoted in {{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After severing his official connections, he awaited an opportunity to fulfill his long-cherished dream of travel.

Humboldt was able to spend more time on writing up his research. He had used his own body for experimentation on muscular irritability, recently discovered by [[Luigi Galvani]] and published his results, ''Versuche über die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser'' (Berlin, 1797) (''Experiments on Stimulated Muscle and Nerve Fibres''), enriched in the French translation with notes by Blumenbach.

==Spanish American expedition, 1799–1804==
[[File:Map Alexander von Humboldt expedition-en.svg|thumb|Alexander von Humboldt's Latin American expedition]]

===Seeking a foreign expedition===
With the financial resources to finance his scientific travels, he sought a ship on a major expedition. Meantime, he went to Paris where his brother Wilhelm was now living. Paris was a great center of scientific learning and his brother and sister-in-law Caroline were well connected in those circles. [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] urged Humboldt to accompany him on a major expedition, likely to last five years, but the French revolutionary [[Directoire]] placed [[Nicolas Baudin]] at the head of it rather than the aging scientific traveler.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=80}} On the postponement of Captain Baudin's proposed voyage of [[circumnavigation]] due to continuing warfare in Europe, which Humboldt had been officially invited to accompany, Humboldt was deeply disappointed. He had already selected scientific instruments for his voyage. He did, however, have a stroke of luck with meeting [[Aimé Bonpland]], the botanist and physician for the voyage. Discouraged, the two left Paris for [[Marseilles]], where they hoped to join [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in Egypt. But North Africans were in revolt against the French invasion in Egypt and French authorities refused permission to travel. Humboldt and Bonpland eventually found their way to [[Madrid]], where their luck changed spectacularly.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=83}}

===Spanish royal authorization 1799===
[[File:Carlos IV de rojo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles IV of Spain]] who authorized Humboldt's travels and research in Spanish America]]
In Madrid, Humboldt sought authorization to travel to Spain's realms in the Americas; he was aided in obtaining it by the German representative of Saxony at the royal Bourbon court. Baron Forell had an interest in mineralogy and science endeavors and inclined to help Humboldt.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=83}} Humboldt's timing could not have been better to interest the Spanish crown in an extended scientific expedition to their possessions in the New World. With the accession of the [[House of Bourbon]] to the Spanish throne following the death of the last Habsburg king, Charles II (died 1700), and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which the House of Bourbon won, the Spanish Bourbons embarked on a program of reform in Spain and then Spanish America. The [[Bourbon Reforms]] sought to reform administration of the realms and revitalize their economies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ida Altman]], Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Prentice Hall, 2003, pp. 300-317.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as the Bourbon reforms, the [[Spanish Enlightenment]] was in florescence. For Humboldt, "the confluent effect of the Bourbon revolution in government and the Spanish Enlightenment had created ideal conditions for his venture."{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=517}}

The Bourbon monarchy had already authorized and funded expeditions, with the [[Botanical Expedition to the Viceroyalty of Peru]] to Chile and Peru (1777–88), New Granada (1783–1816), New Spain (Mexico) (1787–1803), and the [[Malaspina Expedition]] (1789–94). These were lengthy, state-sponsored enterprises to gather information about plants and animals from the Spanish realms, assess economic possibilities, and provide plants and seeds for the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid (founded 1755).{{sfn|Bleichmar|2012|p=5}} These expeditions took naturalists and artists, who created visual images as well as careful written observations as well as collecting seeds and plants themselves.{{sfn|Bleichmar|2012|p=19}} Crown officials as early as 1779 issued and systematically distributed ''Instructions concerning the most secure and economic means to transport live plants by land and sea from the most distant countries'', with illustrations, including one for the crates to transport seeds and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Casimiro Gómez Ortega, ''Instrucción sobre el modo más seguro y económico de transportar plantas vivas por mar y tierra a los países más distantes ilustrada con láminas. Añadese el método de desacar las plants para formar herbarios'' (Madrid 1779). Biblioteca del Real Jardín Botánico, Madrid, cited in {{harvnb|Bleichmar|2012|pp=26–27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Humboldt requested authorization from the crown to travel to Spanish America, most importantly, with his own financing, it was given positive response. Spain under the Hapsburg monarchy had guarded its realms against foreigner travelers and intruders. The Bourbon monarch was open to Humboldt's proposal. Spanish Foreign Minister Don [[Mariano Luis de Urquijo]] received the formal proposal and Humboldt was presented to the monarch in March 1799.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=83}} Humboldt was granted access to crown officials and written documentation on Spain's empire. With Humboldt's experience working for the absolutist Prussian monarchy as a government mining official, Humboldt had both the academic training and experience of working well within a bureaucratic structure.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=517}}

Before leaving Madrid in 1799, Humboldt and Bonpland visited the Natural History Museum which held results of [[Martín de Sessé y Lacasta]] and [[José Mariano Mociño]]'s botanical expedition to [[New Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen T. Jackson, "Biographical Sketches" in ''Essay on the Geography of Plants'' by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland. Edited by Stephen T. Jackson, translated by Sylvie Romanowski. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2009, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt and Bonpland met [[Hipólito Ruiz López]] and [[José Antonio Pavón y Jiménez]] of the royal expedition to Peru and Chile in person in Madrid and examined their botanical collections.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, "Biographical Sketches" pp. 245, 246-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela 1799–1800===

[[Image:Canal do Cassiquiare.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Map of the Cassiquiare canal based on Humboldt's 1799 observations]]
Armed with authorization from the King of Spain, Humboldt and Bonpland made haste to sail, taking the ship ''Pizarro'' from [[A Coruña]], on 5 June 1799. The ship stopped six days on the island of [[Tenerife]], where Humboldt climbed the volcano [[Teide]], and then sailed on to the New World, landing at [[Cumaná]], [[Venezuela]], on 16 July.

The ship's destination was not originally Cumaná, but an outbreak of typhoid on board meant that the captain changed course from [[Havana]] to land in northern South America. Humboldt had not mapped out a specific plan of exploration, so that the change did not upend a fixed itinerary. He later wrote that the diversion to Venezuela made possible his explorations along the Orinoco River to the border of Portuguese Brazil. With the diversion, the ''Pizarro'' encountered two large dugout canoes each carrying 18 Guayaqui Indians. The ''Pizarro''{{'}}s captain accepted the offer of one of them to serve as pilot. Humboldt hired this Indian, named Carlos del Pino, as a guide.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=91-92}}

Venezuela from the sixteenth century to the eighteenth was a relative backwater compared to the seats of the Spanish viceroyalties based in New Spain (Mexico) and Peru, but during the Bourbon reforms, the northern portion of Spanish South America was reorganized administratively, with the 1777 establishment of a Captaincy-General based at Caracas. A great deal of information on the new jurisdiction had already been compiled by [[François de Pons]] but was not published until 1806.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=517}}&lt;ref&gt;F.J. de Pons. ''Voyage à la partie orientale de la Terre-Ferme, dans l'Amérique Méridionale, fait pendant les années 1801, 1802, 1803 et 1804 : contenant la description de la capitainerie générale de Carácas, composée des provinces de Vénézuéla, Maracaïbo, Varinas, la Guiane Espagnole, Cumana, et de l'île de la Marguerite ....'' Paris: Colnet 1806. It was also published in English the same year.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than describe the administrative center of Caracas, Humboldt started his researches with the valley of Aragua where export crops of sugar, coffee, cacao, and cotton were cultivated. Cacao plantations were the most profitable as world demand for chocolate rose.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=518}}

Humboldt visited the mission at [[Caripe]] and explored the [[Cueva del Guácharo National Park|Guácharo cavern]], where he found the [[oilbird]], which he was to make known to science as ''Steatornis caripensis''. Also described the [[Lake Bermudez|Guanoco]] asphalt lake as "The spring of the good priest" ("''Quelle des guten Priesters''").&lt;ref name=G&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inveas.org.ve/noticias.asp?id=20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310235811/http://www.inveas.org.ve/noticias.asp?id=20 |archivedate=2012-03-10 }}, Instituto Venezolano del Asfalto INVEAS.org, accessdate=2010-08-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H&gt;[http://www.parianatours.com/regionen/paria.html], PariaTours.de (in German), accessdate=2010-08-28&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Cumaná, Humboldt observed, on the night of 11–12 November, a remarkable [[meteor shower]] (the [[Leonids]]). He proceeded with Bonpland to [[Caracas]] where he climbed the [[El Ávila National Park|Avila mount]] with the young poet [[Andrés Bello]], the former tutor of [[Simón Bolívar]], who later became the leader of independence in northern South America. Humboldt met the Venezuelan Bolívar himself in 1804 in Paris and spent time with him in Rome. The documentary record does not support the supposition that Humboldt inspired Bolívar to participate in the struggle for independence, but it does indicate Bolívar's admiration for Humboldt's production of new knowledge on Spanish America.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=232-33}}

In February 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland left the coast with the purpose of exploring the course of the [[Orinoco River]] and its tributaries. This trip, which lasted four months and covered {{convert|1725|mi|km}} of wild and largely uninhabited country, had the important result of establishing the existence of the [[Casiquiare canal]] (a communication between the water-systems of the rivers Orinoco and [[Amazon River|Amazon]]), and of determining the exact position of the [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; as well as documenting the life of several native tribes such as the [[Maypure|Maipure]]s and their extinct rivals the Atures (several words of the latter tribe were transferred to Humboldt by one parrot&lt;ref&gt;Mark Forsyth. The etymologicon. Icon Books Ltd. London N79DP, (2011), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;). Around 19 March 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland discovered dangerous [[electric eel]]s, whose shock could kill a man. To catch them, locals suggested they drive wild horses into the river, which brought the eels out from the river mud, and resulted in a violent confrontation of eels and horses, some of which died. Humboldt and Bonpland captured and dissected some eels, which retained their ability to shock; both received potentially dangerous electric shocks during their investigations. The encounter made Humboldt think more deeply about electricity and magnetism, typical of his ability to extrapolate from an observation to more general principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wulf|2015|pp=62–63}}. Wulf's book includes a picture of the encounter (p. 63); she captions it "The battle between horses and electric eels."&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt returned to the incident in several of his later writings, including his travelogue ''Personal Narrative'' (1814–29), ''Views of Nature'' (1807), and ''Aspects of Nature'' (1849).&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=362}}, n. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later they explored the territory of the Maypures and that of the then recently extinct Aturès Indians. Humboldt laid to rest the persistent myth of [[Walter Raleigh]]'s [[Lake Parime]] by proposing that the seasonal flooding of the [[Rupununi savannah]] had been misidentified as a lake.&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, Alexander von. [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/humboldt/alexander/travels/chapter25.html ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America During the Years 1799-1804'', Chapter 25. Henry G. Bohn, London, 1853.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba 1800, 1804===
[[File:Chiranthodendron_pentadactylon_monochrome.jpeg|thumb|right|Humboldt botanical drawing published in his work on Cuba]]
On 24 November 1800, the two friends set sail for Cuba, landing on 19 December,&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander von Humboldt Chronology", in ''Personal Narrative of A Journey to the Equinocital Regions of the New Continent'' by Alexander von Humboldt. New York: Penguin Classics 1995, lxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; where they met fellow botanist and [[plant collector]] [[John Fraser (botanist)|John Fraser]].&lt;ref name="Brendel"&gt;Brendel, Frederick, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2449332 Historical Sketch of the Science of Botany in North America from 1635 to 1840], ''The American Naturalist'', 13:12 (December 1879), pp. 754–71, ''The University of Chicago Press''; accessed 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser and his son had been shipwrecked off the Cuban coast, and did not have a license to be in the Spanish Indies. Humboldt, who was already in Cuba, interceded with crown officials in Havana, as well as giving them money and clothing. Fraser obtained permission to remain in Cuba and explore. Humboldt entrusted Fraser with taking two cases of Humboldt and Bonpland's botanical specimens to England when he returned, for eventual conveyance to the German botantist Willdenow in Berlin.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=116-17}} Humboldt and Bonpland stayed in Cuba until 5 March 1801, when they left for the mainland of northern South America again, arriving there on 30 March.

Humboldt is considered to be the "second discoverer of Cuba" due to the scientific and social research he conducted on this Spanish colony. During an initial three-month stay at [[Havana]], his first tasks were to properly survey that city and the nearby towns of [[Guanabacoa]], [[Regla]] and [[Bejucal]]. He befriended Cuban landowner and thinker [[Francisco de Arango y Parreño]]; together they visited the {{lang|es|Guines}} area in south Havana, the valleys of [[Matanzas]] Province and the [[Valley of the Sugar Mills]] in [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]]. Those three areas were, at the time, the first frontier of sugar production in the island. During those trips, Humboldt collected statistical information on Cuba's population, production, technology and trade, and with Arango, made suggestions for enhancing them. He predicted that the agricultural and commercial potential of Cuba was huge and could be vastly improved with proper leadership in the future.

On their way back to Europe from Mexico on their way to the United States, Humboldt and Bonpland stopped again in Cuba, leaving from the port of Veracruz and arriving in Cuba on 7 January 1804, staying until 29 April 1804. In Cuba, he collected plant material and made extensive notes. During his time he socialized with his scientific and landowner friends, conducted mineralogical surveys and finished his vast collection of the island's flora and fauna that he eventually published as ''Essai politique sur l'îsle de Cuba''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Alexander von Humboldt Chronology", p. lxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Andes 1801–1803===
[[File:Humboldt-Bonpland Chimborazo.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Humboldt and his fellow scientist Aimé Bonpland at the foot of the Chimborazo volcano, painting by [[Friedrich Georg Weitsch]] (1810)]]

After their first stay in Cuba of three months they returned the mainland at [[Cartagena de Indias]] (now in Colombia), a major center of trade in northern South America. Ascending the swollen stream of the [[Magdalena River]] to Honda and arrived in Bogotá on 6 July 1801 where they met the Spanish botanist [[José Celestino Mutis]], head of the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada, staying there until 8 September 1801. Mutis was generous with his time and gave Humboldt access to the huge pictorial record he had compiled since 1783. Mutis was based in Bogotá, but as with other Spanish expeditions, he had access to local knowledge and a workshop of artists, who created highly accurate and detailed images. This type of careful recording meant that even if specimens were not available to study at a distance, "because the images traveled, the botanists did not have to."{{sfn|Bleichmar|2012|p=190}} Humboldt was astounded at Mutis's accomplishment; when Humboldt published his first volume on botany, he dedicated it to Mutis, "as a simply mark of our admiration and acknowledgement."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland, ''Plantes équinoxiles, in ''Voyage de Humboldt et Bonpland, Sixième Partie, Botanique, vo. 1 Paris 1808.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ilustraciones_José_Celestino_Mutis.jpg|thumb|Illustrations from Spanish botanist [[José Celestino Mutis]]'s work in Colombia]]

Humboldt had hopes of connecting with the French sailing expedition of Baudin, now finally underway, so Bonpland and Humboldt hurried to Ecuador.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; They crossed the frozen ridges of the [[Cordillera Real (Ecuador)|Cordillera Real]], they reached [[Quito]] on 6 January 1802, after a tedious and difficult journey.

Their stay in Ecuador was marked by the ascent of [[Pichincha (volcano)|Pichincha]] and their climb of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]], where Humboldt and his party reached an altitude of {{convert|19286|ft|m}}. This was a world record at the time, but a thousand feet short of the summit.&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt's claim was disputed by mountaineer [[Edward Whymper]] when he made the first ascent of Chimborazo in 1880.{{cite book |last=Whymper |first=Edward |title=Travels amongst the Great Andes of the Equator |publisher=John Murray |year=1892 |pages=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt's journey concluded with an expedition to the sources of the Amazon ''en route'' for [[Lima, Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muratta Bunsen | first1 = Eduardo | year = 2010 | title = El conflicto entre eurocentrismo y empatía en la literatura de viajes de Humboldt | url = | journal = Revista Andina | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 247–262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Callao]], the main port for Peru, Humboldt observed the [[transit of Mercury]] on 9 November and studied the fertilizing properties of [[guano]], rich in nitrogen, the subsequent introduction of which into Europe was due mainly to his writings.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Humboldt and Bonpland had not intended to go to New Spain, but when they were unable to join a voyage to the Pacific, they left the Ecuadorian port of Guayaquil and headed for [[Acapulco]] on Mexico's west coast, landing there on 15 February 1803.&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander von Humboldt Chronology," p. lxviii-lxvix.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Humboldt and Bonpland started on their way to New Spain's [[Mexico City|capital]] on Mexico's central plateau, Humboldt realized the captain of the vessel that brought them to Acapulco had reckoned its location incorrectly. Since Acapulco was the main west coast port and the terminus of the [[Manila Galleon|Asian trade]] from the Spanish Philippines, having accurate maps of its location was extremely important. Humboldt set up his instruments, surveying the deep water bay of Acapulco, to determine its longitude.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=149-150}}

Humboldt and Bonpland arrived in Mexico City, having been officially welcomed via a letter from the king's representative in New Spain, Viceroy Don [[José de Iturrigaray]]. Humboldt was also given a special passport to travel throughout New Spain and letters of introduction to intendants, the highest officials in New Spain's administrative districts (intendancies). This official aid to Humboldt allowed him to have access to crown records, mines, landed estates, canals, and Mexican antiquities from the prehispanic era.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=156}} Humboldt read the writings of Bishop-elect of the important diocese of Michoacan [[Manuel Abad y Queipo]], a [[classical liberal]], that were directed to the crown for the improvement of New Spain.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}

They spent the year in the viceroyalty, traveling to different Mexican cities in the central plateau and the northern mining region. The first journey was from Acapulco to Mexico City, through what is now the Mexican state of [[Guerrero]]. The route was suitable only for mule train, and all along the way Humboldt took measurements of elevation. When he left Mexico a year later in 1804, from the east coast port of Veracruz, he took a similar set of measures, which resulted in a chart in the ''Political Essay'', the physical plan of Mexico with the dangers of the road from Acapulco to Mexico City, and from Mexico City to Veracruz.&lt;ref&gt;''Plano físico de la Nueva España, Perfil del Camino de Acapulco a Mégico [sic], y de Mégico a Veracruz''. Chart is published in Magali M. Carrera, ''Traveling from New Spain to Mexico: Mapping Practices of Nineteenth-century Mexico'', Durham: Duke University Press 2011, p.70, plate 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This visual depiction of elevation was part of Humboldt's general insistence that the data he collected be presented in a way more easily understood than statistical charts. A great deal of his success in gaining a more general readership for his works was his understanding that "anything that has to do with extent or quantity can be represented geometrically. Statistical projections [charts and graphs], which speak to the senses without tiring the intellect have the advantage of bringing attention to a large number of important facts."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Atlás géographique et physique du Royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne'', lxxxiii-lxxiv, quoted in Anne Godlewska, ''Geography Unbound: French Geographic Science from Cassini to Humboldt''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1999, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt was impressed with Mexico City, which at the time was the largest city in the Americas, and one that could be counted as modern. He declared "no city of the new continent, without even excepting those of the United States, can display such great and solid scientific establishments as the capital of Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, ''Political essay'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed to the [[Palacio de Minería#History|Royal College of Mines]], the [[National Palace (Mexico)#Viceroy palace|Royal Botanical Garden]] and the [[Academy of San Carlos|Royal Academy of San Carlos]] as exemplars of a metropolitan capital in touch with the latest developments on the continent and insisting on its modernity.{{sfn|Brading|1991|pp=526-27}} He also recognized important creole savants in Mexico, including [[José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez]], who died in 1799, just before Humboldt's visit; Miguel Velásquez de León; and [[Antonio de León y Gama]].{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}

Humboldt spent time at the Valenciana silver mine in [[Guanajuato]], central New Spain, at the time the most important in the Spanish empire.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=525}} The bicentennial of his visit in Guanajuato was celebrated with a conference at the [[University of Guanajuato]], with Mexican academics highlighting various aspects of his impact on the city.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Lara Valdés, ''Bicentenario de Humboldt en Guanajuato (1803–2003)''. Guanajuato: Ediciones La Rana 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt could have simply examined the geology of the fabulously rich mine, but he took the opportunity to study the entire mining complex as well as analyze mining statistics of its output. His report on silver mining is a major contribution, and considered the strongest and best informed section of his ''Political Essay''. Although Humboldt was himself a trained geologist and mining inspector, he drew on mining experts in Mexico. One was [[Fausto Elhuyar]], then head of the General Mining Court in Mexico City, who, like Humboldt was trained in Freiberg. Another was [[Andrés Manuel del Río]], director of Royal College of Mines, whom Humboldt knew when they were both students in Freiberg.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=51, 156}} The Bourbon monarchs had established the mining court and the college to elevate mining as a profession, since revenues from silver constituted the crown's largest source of income. Humboldt also consulted other German mining experts, who were already in Mexico.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}} While Humboldt was a welcome foreign scientist and mining expert, the Spanish crown had established fertile ground for Humboldt's investigations into mining.

Spanish America's ancient civilizations were a source of interest for Humboldt, who included images of Mexican manuscripts (or codices) and Inca ruins in his richly illustrated ''Vues des cordillères et monuments des peuples indigènes de l'Amerique'' (1810–1813), the most experimental of Humboldt's publications, since it does not have "a single ordering principle" but his opinions and contentions based on observation.&lt;ref&gt;Vera M. Kutzinski and Ottmar Ette, "Introduction" to ''Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas, A Critical Edition''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2012, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; For Humboldt, a key question was the influence of climate on the development of these civilizations.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=523}} When he published his ''Vues des cordillères'', he included a color image of the [[Aztec calendar stone]], which had been discovered buried in the [[Zócalo|main plaza]] of Mexico City in 1790, along with select drawings of the [[Dresden codex]] and others he sought out later in European collections. His aim was to muster evidence that these pictorial and sculptural images could allow the reconstruction of prehispanic history. He sought out Mexican experts in the interpretation of sources from there, especially Antonio Pichardo, who was the literary executor of [[Antonio de León y Gama]]'s work. For American-born Spaniards (creoles) who were seeking sources of pride in Mexico's ancient past, Humboldt's recognition of these ancient works and dissemination in his publications was a boon. He read the work of exiled Jesuit [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]], which celebrated Mexico's prehispanic civilization, and which Humboldt invoked to counter the pejorative assertions about the new world by Buffon, de Pauw, and Raynal.&lt;ref&gt;Vera M. Kutzinski and Ottmar Ette, "Introduction", p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt ultimately viewed both the prehispanic realms of Mexico and Peru as despotic and barbaric.{{sfn|Brading|1991|pp=523-525}} However, he also drew attention to indigenous monuments and artifacts as cultural productions that had "both ... historical ''and'' artistic significance."&lt;ref&gt;Vera M. Kutzinski and Ottmar Ette, "Introduction", p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his most widely read publications resulting from his travels and investigations in Spanish America was the ''Essai politique sur le royaum de la Nouvelle Espagne'', quickly translated to English as ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' (1811).&lt;ref&gt;''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'', (four volumes) translator John Black, London/Edinburgh: Longman, Hurst, Rees Orme and brown; and H. Colborn and W. Blackwood, and Brown and Crombie, Edinburgh 1811.&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise was the result of Humboldt's own investigations as well as the generosity of Spanish colonial officials for statistical data.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Keen, "Alexander von Humboldt" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United States 1804===
[[File:Louisiana1804a.jpg|thumb|left|1804 Map of the Louisiana Territory. Jefferson and his cabinet sought information from Humboldt when he visited Washington, D.C., about Spain's territory in Mexico, now bordering the U.S.]]

Leaving from Cuba, Humboldt decided to take an unplanned short visit to the United States. Knowing that the current U.S. president, [[Thomas Jefferson]], was himself a scientist, Humboldt wrote to him saying that he would be in the United States. Jefferson warmly replied, inviting him to visit the [[White House]] in the nation's new capital. In his letter Humboldt had gained Jefferson's interest by mentioning that he had discovered [[mammoth]] teeth near the Equator. Jefferson had previously written that he believed mammoths had never lived so far south. Humboldt had also hinted at his knowledge of New Spain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Schwarz, Ingo (2001-01-01). "Alexander von Humboldt's Visit to Washington and Philadelphia, His Friendship with Jefferson, and His Fascination with the United States". Northeastern Naturalist 8: 43–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in [[Philadelphia]], which was a center of learning in the U.S., Humboldt met with some of the major scientific figures of the era, including chemist and anatomist [[Caspar Wistar (physician)|Caspar Wistar]], who pushed for compulsory smallpox vaccination, and botanist [[Benjamin Smith Barton]], as well as physician [[Benjamin Rush]], a signer of the Declaration of Independence, who wished to hear about [[cinchona]] bark from a South American tree, which cured fevers.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=175-76}} Humboldt later published a treatise in English on cinchona.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt,[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14437 ''An illustration of the genus Cinchona :comprising descriptions of all the officinal Peruvian barks, including several new species, Baron de Humboldt's Account of the Cinchona forests of South America, and Laubert's Memoir on the different species of quinquina: to which are added several dissertations of Don Hippolito Ruiz on various medicinal plants of South America '']&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving in Washington D.C, Humboldt held numerous intense discussions with Jefferson on both scientific matters and also his year-long stay in New Spain. Jefferson had only recently concluded the [[Louisiana Purchase]], which now placed New Spain on the southwest border of the United States. The Spanish minister in Washington, D.C. had declined to furnish the U.S. government with information about Spanish territories, and access to the territories was strictly controlled. Humboldt was able to supply Jefferson with the latest information on the population, trade agriculture and military of New Spain. This information would later be the basis for his ''Essay on the Political Kingdom of New Spain'' (1810). Jefferson was unsure of where the border of the newly-purchased [[Louisiana]] was precisely, and Humboldt wrote him a two-page report on the matter. Jefferson would later refer to Humboldt as "the most scientific man of the age". Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury, said of Humboldt, "I was delighted and swallowed more information of various kinds in less than two hours than I had for two years past in all I had read or heard." Gallatin, in turn, supplied Humboldt with information he sought on the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

After six weeks, Humboldt set sail for Europe from the mouth of the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and landed at [[Bordeaux]] on 3 August 1804.

===Travel diaries===
Humboldt kept a detailed diary of his sojourn to Spanish America, running some 4,000 pages, which he drew on directly for his multiple publications following the expedition. The leather-bound diaries themselves are now in Germany, having been returned from Russia to East Germany, where they were taken by the Red Army after World War II. Following German reunification, the diaries were returned to a descendant of Humboldt. For a time, there was concern about their being sold, but that was averted.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.dw.com/en/humboldt-america-diaries-to-stay-in-germany/a-17271671, accessed 1 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; A government-funded project to digitize the Spanish American expedition as well as his later Russian expedition has been undertaken (2014-2017) by the University of Potsdam and the German State Library - Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/?p=1654 accessed 1 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achievements of the Latin American expedition===
{{see also|Humboldtian science}}
Humboldt's decades' long endeavor to publish the results of this expedition not only resulted in multiple volumes, but also made his international reputation in scientific circles. Humboldt came to be well-known with the reading public as well, with popular, densely illustrated, condensed versions of his work in multiple languages. Bonpland, his fellow scientist and collaborator on the expedition, collected botanical specimens and preserved them, but unlike Humboldt who had a passion to publish, Bonpland had to be prodded to do the formal descriptions. Many scientific travelers and explorers produced huge visual records, which remained unseen by the general public until the late nineteenth century, in the case of the Malaspina Expedition, and even the late twentieth century, when Mutis's botanical, some 12,000 drawings from New Granada, was published. Humboldt, by contrast, published immediately and continuously, using and ultimately exhausting his personal fortune, to produce both scientific and popular texts. Humboldt's name and fame were made by his travels to Spanish America, particularly his publication of the ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain''. His image as the premier European scientist was a later development.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas Rupke, "A Geography of Enlightenment: The Critical Reception of Alexander von Humboldt's Mexico Work." In ''Geography and Enlightenment'', edited by David N. Livingstone an Charles W.J. Withers, 319-39. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Bourbon crown, which had authorized the expedition, the returns were not only tremendous in terms of sheer volume of data on their New World realms, but in dispelling the vague and pejorative assessments of the New World by [[Guillaume-Thomas Raynal]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. The achievements of the Bourbon regime, especially in New Spain, were evident in the precise data Humboldt systematized and published.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}

This memorable expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of [[physical geography]], [[plant geography]], and [[meteorology]]. Key to that was Humboldt's meticulous and systematic measurement of phenomena with the most advanced instruments then available. He closely observed plant and animal species in situ, not just in isolation, noting all elements in relation to one other. He collected specimens of plants and animals, dividing the growing collection so that if a portion was lost, other parts might survive.

[[File:Frederich heinrich baron von humboldt-charles wilson peale.JPG|thumb|upright|Humboldt depicted by American artist [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1805, who met Humboldt when he visited the U.S. in 1804]]

Humboldt saw the need for an approach to science that could account for the harmony of nature among the diversity of the physical world. For Humboldt, "the unity of nature" meant that it was the interrelation of all [[physical sciences]]—such as the conjoining between [[biology]], [[meteorology]] and [[geology]]—that determined where specific plants grew. He found these relationships by unraveling myriad, painstakingly collected data,{{sfn|Helferich|2004|p=25}} data extensive enough that it became an enduring foundation upon which others could base their work. Humboldt viewed nature [[holism|holistically]], and tried to explain natural phenomena without the appeal to religious dogma. He believed in the central importance of observation, and as a consequence had amassed a vast array of the most sophisticated scientific instruments then available. Each had its own velvet lined box and was the most accurate and portable of its time; nothing quantifiable escaped measurement. According to Humboldt, everything should be measured with the finest and most modern instruments and sophisticated techniques available, for that collected data was the basis of all scientific understanding.

This quantitative methodology would become known as [[Humboldtian science]]. Humboldt wrote "Nature herself is sublimely eloquent. The stars as they sparkle in firmament fill us with delight and ecstasy, and yet they all move in orbit marked out with mathematical precision."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Personal Narrative of Travels of the Equinocial Regions of the New Continent during Years 1799–1804'' (London, 1814), Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Ideen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen nebst einem Naturgemälde der Tropenländer - 000012142.jpg|thumb|right|Humboldt's ''Naturgemälde'', also known as the Chimborazo Map, is his depiction of the volcano in cross section, with detailed information about plant geography. The illustration was published in ''The Geography of Plants'', 1807, in a large format (54 cm x 84 cm.)]]
His ''Essay on the Geography of Plants'' (published first in French and then German, both in 1807) was based on the then novel idea of studying the distribution of organic life as affected by varying physical conditions.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; This was most famously depicted in his published cross-section of Chimborazo, approximately two feet by three feet (54&amp;nbsp;cm x 84&amp;nbsp;cm) color pictorial, he called ''Ein Naturgemälde der Anden'' and what is also called the Chimborazo Map. It was a fold-out at the back of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Karl S. Zimmerer, "Mapping Mountains" in ''Mapping Latin America: a Cartographic Reader'', Jordana Dym and Karl Offen, eds. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2011, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt first sketched the map when he was in South America, which included written descriptions on either side of the cross-section of Chimborazo. These detailed the information on temperature, altitude, humidity, atmosphere pressure, and the animal and plants (with their scientific names) found at each elevation. Plants from the same genus appear at different elevations. The depiction is on an east-west axis going from the Pacific coast lowlands to the Andean range of which Chimborazo was a part, and the eastern Amazonian basin. Humboldt showed the three zones of coast, mountains, and Amazonia, based on his own observations, but he also drew on existing Spanish sources, particularly [[Pedro Cieza de León]], which he explicitly referred to. The Spanish American scientist [[Francisco José de Caldas]] had also measured and observed mountain environments and had earlier come to similar ideas about environmental factors in the distribution of life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerer, "Mapping Mountains", p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt was thus not putting forward something entirely new, but it is argued that his finding is not derivative either.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra, ''How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chimborazo map displayed complex information in an accessible fashion. The map was the basis for comparison with other major peaks. "The Naturgemälde showed for the first time that nature was a global force with corresponding climate zones across continents."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=89}}. This publication includes Humboldt's first sketch of the ''Naturgemälde''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another assessment of the map is that it "marked the beginning of a new era of environmental science, not only of mountain ecology but also of global-scale biogeophysical patterns and processes."&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerer, "Mapping Mountains", p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woodbridge_isothermal_chart3.jpg|thumb|right|Isothermal map of the world using Humboldt's data by [[William Channing Woodbridge]]]]

By his delineation (in 1817) of [[isothermal]] lines, he at once suggested the idea and devised the means of comparing the climatic conditions of various countries. He first investigated the rate of decrease in mean temperature with the increase in elevation above sea level, and afforded, by his inquiries regarding the origin of tropical storms, the earliest clue to the detection of the more complicated law governing atmospheric disturbances in higher latitudes.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Des lignes isothermes et de la distribution de la châleur sur le globe''. Paris 1817.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major contribution to climatology.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=380}}&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Robinson and Helen M. Wallis. "Humboldt's Map of Isothermal Lines: a Milestone in Thematic Cartography." ''Cartographic Journal'' 4 (1967) 119-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

His discovery of the decrease in intensity of Earth's [[magnetic field]] from the poles to the equator was communicated to the Paris Institute in a memoir read by him on 7 December 1804. Its importance was attested by the speedy emergence of rival claims.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His services to geology were based on his attentive study of the [[volcano]]es of the Andes and Mexico, which he observed and sketched, climbed, and measured with a variety of instruments. By climbing Chimborazo, he established an altitude record which became the basis for measurement of other volcanoes in the Andes and the Himalayas. As with other aspects of his investigations, he developed methods to show his synthesized results visually, using the graphic method of geologic-cross sections.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=375-76}} He showed that volcanoes fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures; and by his demonstration of the [[igneous rock|igneous]] origin of rocks previously held to be of aqueous formation, he contributed largely to the elimination of erroneous views, such as [[Neptunism]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Humboldt was a significant contributor to cartography, creating maps, particularly of New Spain, that became the template for later mapmakers in Mexico. His careful recording of latitude and longitude led to accurate maps of Mexico, the port of Acapulco, the port of Veracruz, and the Valley of Mexico, and a map showing trade patterns among continents. His maps also included schematic information on geography, converting areas of administrative districts (intendancies) using proportional squares.&lt;ref&gt;Magali M. Carrera, ''Traveling from New Spain to Mexico: Mapping Practices of Nineteenth-century Mexico''. Durham: Duke University Press 2011, pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. was keen to see his maps and statistics on New Spain, since they had implication for territorial claims following the Louisiana Purchase.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=177-78}} Later in life, Humboldt published three volumes (1836–39) examining sources that dealt with the early voyages to the Americas, pursuing his interest in nautical astronomy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His research yielded the origin of the name "America", put on a map of the Americas by [[Martin Waldseemüller]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Examen critique de l'histoire de la géographie du Nouveau Continent et des progrès de l'astronomie nautique au 15e et 16e siècles''. Paris, 1836-39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Head-claw-Vultur-gryphus-Humboldt-Zoologie-T09p170.png|thumb|right|Humboldt's depiction of an [[Andean condor]], an example of his detailed drawing]]

Humboldt conducted a census of the indigenous and European inhabitants in [[New Spain]], publishing a schematized drawing of racial types and populations distribution, grouping them by region and social characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Carrera, ''Mapping New Spain'', p. 76, reproducing the chart, illustration 23, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated the population to be six million individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|title=Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain|year=1811|publisher=F.

He presented these data in chart form, for easier understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, ''Political essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'', chapter entitled "Indians".&lt;/ref&gt; He also surveyed the non-Indian population, categorized as Whites (Spaniards), ''Negroes'', and castes (''[[castas]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, ''Political essay'', chapter entitled "Whites, Negroes, Castes".&lt;/ref&gt; American-born Spaniards, so-called ''creoles'' had been painting depictions of mixed-race family groupings in the eighteenth century, showing father of one racial category, mother of another, and the offspring in a third category in hierarchical order, so racial hierarchy was an essential way elites viewed Mexican society.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, ''Casta Painting''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although American-born Spaniards were legally racial equals of those born in Spain, crown policy since the Bourbons took the Spanish throne privileged those born in Iberia. Humboldt observed that "the most miserable European, without education and without intellectual cultivation, thinks himself superior to whites born in the new continent."&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, ''Political essay'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The enmity between the creoles and the peninsular-born whites increasingly became an issue in the late period of Spanish rule, with creoles increasingly alienated from the crown. Humboldt's assessment was that abuses royal government and the example of a new model of rule in the United States were eroded the unity of whites in New Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, ''Political essay'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt's writings on race in New Spain were shaped by the memorials of the [[classical liberal]], enlightened Bishop-elect of Michoacán, [[Manuel Abad y Queipo]], who personally presented Humboldt with his printed memorials to the Spanish crown critiquing social and economic conditions and his recommendations for eliminating them.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Brading, ''Church and State in Bourbon Mexico: The Diocese of Michoacán 1749-1810''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1994, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar says that his writings contain fantastical descriptions of America, while leaving out its inhabitants, stating that Humboldt, coming from the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] school of thought, believed '...&amp;nbsp;nature is perfect till man deforms it with care.'&lt;ref name="Pratt 1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pratt|first=Mary Louise|title=Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415060958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The further assessment is that he largely neglected the human societies amidst nature. Views of indigenous peoples as 'savage' or 'unimportant' leaves them out of the historical picture.&lt;ref name="Pratt 1997"/&gt; Other scholars counter that Humboldt dedicated large parts of his work to describing the conditions of slaves, indigenous peoples, mixed-race [[castas]], and society in general. He often showed his disgust for the slavery&lt;ref name=mcc&gt;{{cite book|last=McCullough |first=David |authorlink=David McCullough |title=Brave Companions. Portraits of History|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|date=1992|page=3ff|isbn=0-6717-9276-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inhumane conditions in which indigenous peoples and others were treated and he often criticized Spanish colonial policies.{{sfn|Rupke|2008|p=138}}

Humboldt was not primarily an artist, but he could draw well, allowing him to record a visual record of particular places and their natural environment. Many of his drawings became the basis for illustrations of his many scientific and general publications. Artists whom Humboldt influenced, such as [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], followed in his path and painted the same places Humboldt had visited and recorded, such as the basalt formations in Mexico, which was an illustration in his ''Vues des Cordillères''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Vues des Cordillères et monumens des peuples indigènes de l'Amerique''. Paris: F. Schoell, 180-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigrid Achenbach, ''Kunst um Humboldt: Reisestudien aus Mittel- un Südamerika von Rugendas, Bellermann un Hildebrandt im Berliner Kupferstichkabinett''. Munich: Hirmer Verlag München 2009, 105, catalog 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The editing and publication of the encyclopedic mass of scientific, political and archaeological material that had been collected by him during his absence from Europe was now Humboldt's most urgent desire. After a short trip to Italy with [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] for the purpose of investigating the law of [[magnetic declination]] and a stay of two and a half years in Berlin, in the spring of 1808, he settled in Paris. His purpose for being located there was to secure the scientific cooperation required for bringing his great work through the press. This colossal task, which he at first hoped would occupy but two years, eventually cost him twenty-one, and even then it remained incomplete.

During his lifetime Humboldt became one of the most famous men in Europe.{{sfn|Sachs|2006|p=1}} Academies, both native and foreign, were eager to elect him to their membership, the first being The [[American Philosophical Society]] in Philadelphia, which he visited at the tail end of his travel through the Americas. He was elected to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in 1805.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=204}} Over the years other learned societies in the U.S. elected him a member, including the [[American Antiquarian Society]] (Worcester, MA) in 1816;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlisth|title=MemberListH|website=Americanantiquarian.org|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[New York Historical Society]] in 1820; a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1822.;&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Ethnological Society]] (New York) in 1843; and the American Geographical and Statistical Society, (New York) in 1856.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=377}} He was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1810. The [[Royal Society]], whose president Sir Joseph Banks had aided Humboldt as a young man, now welcomed him as a foreign member.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=166}}

After Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government recognized him with high honors for his services to the nation. In 1827, the first [[President of Mexico]], [[Guadalupe Victoria]] granted Humboldt Mexican citizenship&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Labastida. ''Humboldt: ciudadano universal''. Editorial Siglo XXI. México. 1999. Pg.XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1859, the President of Mexico, [[Benito Juárez]], named Humboldt a hero of the nation (''benemérito de la nación'').&lt;ref&gt;Labastida, ''Humboldt'', p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; The gestures were purely honorary; he never returned to the Americas following his expedition.

Importantly for Humboldt's long term financial stability, King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] conferred upon him the honor of the post of royal chamberlain, without at the time exacting the duties. The appointment had a pension of 2,500 [[thaler]]s, afterwards doubled. This official stipend became his main source of income in later years when he exhausted his fortune on the publications of his research. Financial necessity forced his permanent relocation to Berlin in 1827 from Paris. In Paris he found not only scientific sympathy, but the social stimulus which his vigorous and healthy mind eagerly craved. He was equally in his element as the lion of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]s and as the savant of the [[Institut de France]] and the observatory.

On 12 May 1827 he settled permanently in Berlin, where his first efforts were directed towards the furtherance of the science of terrestrial magnetism. In 1827, he began giving public lectures in Berlin, which became the basis for his last major publication, [[Kosmos (Humboldt)|''Kosmos'']] (1845–62).&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander von Humboldt Chronology," p. lxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, it had been one of his favorite schemes to secure, by means of simultaneous observations at distant points, a thorough investigation of the nature and law of "[[magnetic storm]]s" (a term invented by him to designate abnormal disturbances of [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's magnetism]]). The meeting at Berlin, on 18 September 1828, of a newly formed scientific association, of which he was elected president, gave him the opportunity of setting on foot an extensive system of research in combination with his diligent personal observations. His appeal to the Russian government, in 1829, led to the establishment of a line of magnetic and meteorological stations across northern Asia. Meanwhile, his letter to the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], then (April 1836) president of the [[Royal Society]], secured for the undertaking, the wide basis of the [[British Empire|British dominions]].

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition]], observes, "Thus that scientific conspiracy of nations which is one of the noblest fruits of modern civilization was by his exertions first successfully organized".{{sfn|Clerke|1911|p=874}} However, earlier examples of international scientific cooperation exist, notably the 18th-century observations of the [[Transit of Venus|transits of Venus]].

In 1869, the 100th year of his birth, Humboldt's fame was so great that cities all over America celebrated his birth with large festivals. In New York City, a bust of his head was unveiled in Central Park.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Sandra 2006"&gt;Nichols, Sandra. "Why Was Humboldt Forgotten in the United States?" Geographical Review 96, no. 3 (July 2006): 399-415. Accessed July 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have speculated about the reasons for Humboldt's declining renown among the public. Sandra Nichols has argued that there are three reasons for this. First, a trend towards specialization in scholarship. Humboldt was a generalist who connected many disciplines in his work. Today, academics have become more and more focused on narrow fields of work. Humboldt combined [[ecology]], geography and even social sciences. Second, a change in writing style. Humboldt's works, which were considered essential to a library in 1869, had flowery prose that fell out of fashion. One critic said they had a "laborious picturesqueness". Humboldt himself said that, "If I only knew how to describe adequately how and what I felt, I might, after this long journey of mine, really be able to give happiness to people. The disjointed life I lead makes me hardly certain of my way of writing". Third, a rising anti-German sentiment in the late 1800s and the early 1900s due to heavy German immigration to the United States and later World War 1.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Sandra 2006"/&gt; On the eve of the 1959 hundredth anniversary of the death of Humboldt, the government of West Germany planned significant celebrations in conjunction with nations that Humboldt visited.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Meyer Abich, "The Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of Alexander von Humboldt," [[The Hispanic American Historical Review]], vol. 38, No. 3, (August 1958), pp. 394-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expedition in Russia, 1829==

[[File:Pickersgill humboldt.jpg|thumb|Alexander von Humboldt, portrait by W. Pickersgill (1831)]]
In 1811, and again in 1818, projects of Asiatic exploration were proposed to Humboldt, first by Czar [[Nicolas I]]'s Russian government, and afterwards by the Prussian government; but on each occasion, untoward circumstances interposed. It was not until he had begun his sixtieth year that he resumed his early role of traveler in the interests of science.

The Russian Foreign Minister, Count [[Georg von Cancrin]] contacted Humboldt about whether a platinum-based currency was possible in Russia and invited him to visit the Ural Mountains. Humboldt was not encouraging about a [[platinum]]-based currency, when silver was the standard as a world currency. But the invitation to visit the Urals was intriguing, especially since Humboldt had long dreamed of going to Asia. He had wanted to travel to India and made considerable efforts to persuade the [[British East India Company]] to authorize a trip, but those efforts were fruitless.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=171-74, 199-200}} When Russia renewed its earlier invitation to Humboldt, Humboldt accepted.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=199-200}} The Russians sought to entice Humboldt by engaging his enduring interest in mining sites, for comparative scientific purposes for Humboldt, but for the Russians to gain expert knowledge about their resources. For Humboldt, the Russian monarch's promise to fund the trip was extremely important, since Humboldt's inherited 100,000 thaler fortune was gone and he lived on the Prussian government pension of 2,500-3,000 thalers as the monarch's chamberlain. The Russian government gave an advance of 1200 ''chervontsev'' in Berlin and another 20,000 when he arrived in St Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Engel'gardt, ''A Gumbol'dt: Ego zhizn', puteshestviia i nauchnaia d"iatel'nost''. Saint Petersburg: Tip. Tovarishchestva "obshchestvennaia Pol'za 1900, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt was eager to travel not just to the Urals, but also across the steppes of Siberia to Russia's border with China. Humboldt wrote Cancrin saying that he intended to learn Russian to read mining journals in the language.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=283-85}} As the details of the expedition were worked out, Humboldt said that he would travel to Russia in his own French coach, with a German servant, as well as [[Gustav Rose]], a professor of chemistry and mineralogy. He also invited [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] to join the expedition, to study water micro-organisms in [[Lake Baikal]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Humboldt himself was keen to continue his studies of magnetism of mountains and mineral deposits. As was usual for his research, he brought scientific instruments to take the most accurate measurements.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=287}} The Russians organized the local arrangements, including lodging, horses, accompanying crew. Humboldt's title for the expedition was as an official of the Department of Mines. As the expedition neared dangerous areas, he had to travel in a convoy with an escort.&lt;ref&gt;Engel'gardt, ''A. Gumbol'dt'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically Humboldt was in good condition, despite his advancing years, writing to Cancrin "I still walk very lightly on foot, nine to ten hours without resting, despite my age and my white hair."&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt to Cancrin, quoted in {{harvnb|De Terra|1955|p=286}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between May and November 1829 he and the growing expedition traversed the wide expanse of the Russian empire from the Neva to the Yenisei, accomplishing in twenty-five weeks a distance of {{convert|9614|mi|km}}. Humboldt and the expedition party traveled by coach on well maintained roads, with rapid progress being made because of changes of horses at way stations. The party had grown, with Johann Seifert, who was a huntsman and collector of animal specimens; a Russian mining official; Count Adolphe Polier, one of Humboldt's friends from Paris; a cook; plus a contingent of [[Cossacks]] for security. Three carriages were filled with people, supplies, and scientific instruments. For Humboldt's magnetic readings to be accurate, they carried an iron-free tent.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=201-202}} This expedition was unlike his Spanish American travels with Bonpland, with the two alone and sometimes accompanied by local guides.

The Russian government was interested in Humboldt finding prospects for mining and commercial advancement of the realm and made it clear that Humboldt was not to investigate social issues, nor criticize social conditions of Russian [[serfs]]. In his publications on Spanish America, he did comment on the conditions of the indigenous populations, and deplored black slavery, but well after he had left those territories.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=205}} As Humboldt discovered, the government kept tight control of the expedition, even when it was {{convert|1000|mi}} from Moscow, with local government officials greeting the expedition at every stop. The itinerary was planned with Tobolsk the farthest destination, then a return to St Petersburg.

Humboldt wrote to the Russian Minister Cancrin that he was extending his travel, knowing that the missive would not reach him in time to scuttle the plan. The further east he journeyed into wilder territory, the more Humboldt enjoyed it. They still followed the Siberian Highway and made excellent progress, sometimes a hundred miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) in a day.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=206-207}} Although they were halted at the end of July and warned of an [[anthrax]] outbreak, Humboldt decided to continue despite the danger. "At my age, nothing should be postponed."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journey though carried out with all the advantages afforded by the immediate patronage of the Russian government, was too rapid to be profitable scientifically. The correction of the prevalent exaggerated estimate of the height of the Central Asian plateau, and the prediction of the discovery of diamonds in the gold-washings of the Urals, were important aspects of these travels. In the end, the expedition took 8 months, traveled 15,500&amp;nbsp;km, stopped at 658 post stations, and used 12,244 horses.&lt;ref&gt;Engel'gardt, ''A. Gumbol'dt'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

One writer claims that "Nothing was quite as Humboldt wanted it. The entire expedition was a compromise.".{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=203}} The Russian emperor offered Humboldt an invitation to return to Russia, but Humboldt declined, due to his disapproval of Nicholas's restrictions on his freedom of movement during the expedition and his ability to freely report on it.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=306}} Humboldt published two works on the Russian expedition, first ''Fragmens de géologie et de la climatologie asiastique'' in 1831, based on lectures he gave on the topic. In 1843, he completed the three-volume ''Asie Centrale'',&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Asie centrale, recherches sur les chaînes des montagnes et la climotologie comparée''. 3 vols. 1843.&lt;/ref&gt; which he dedicated to Czar Nicholas, which he called "an unavoidable step, as the expedition was accomplished at his expense."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvnb|De Terra|1955|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, these works have not been translated to English.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=433}} His 1829 expedition to Russia when he was an old man is much less known than his five-year travels in Spanish America, which had resulted in many published volumes over the decades since his 1804 return. Nevertheless, it gave Humboldt comparative data for his various later scientific publications.

==Publications==
===''Cosmos''===
{{see also|Kosmos (Humboldt)}}
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Alexander von Humboldt photo 1857.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Photograph of Humboldt in his later years]]

[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|''Kosmos'']] was Humboldt's multi-volume effort in his later years to write a work bringing together all the research from his long career. The writing took shape in [[public lecture|lecture]]s he delivered before the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] in the winter of 1827–28. These lectures would form "the [[cartoon]] for the great fresco of the ''[K]osmos''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Dickinson|Howarth|1933|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1829 expedition to Russia supplied him with data comparative to his Latin American expedition.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=235}}

The first two volumes of the ''Kosmos'' were published between the years 1845 and 1847 were intended to comprise the entire work, but Humboldt published three more volumes, one of which was posthumous. Humboldt had long aimed to write a comprehensive work about geography and the natural sciences. The work attempted to unify the sciences then known in a Kantian framework. With inspiration from [[German Romanticism]], Humboldt sought to create a compendium of the world's environment.&lt;ref name="Walls 2009 3–15"/&gt; He spent the last decade of his long life — as he called them, his "improbable" years — continuing this work. The third and fourth volumes were published in 1850–58; a fragment of a fifth appeared posthumously in 1862.

His reputation had long since been made with his publications on the Latin American expedition. There is not a consensus on the importance of ''Kosmos''. One scholar, who stresses the importance of Humboldt's ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' as essential reading, dismisses ''Kosmos'' as "little more than an academic curiosity."{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=534}} A different opinion is that ''Kosmos'' was his "most influential book."{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=235}}

As with most of Humboldt's works, ''Kosmos'' was also translated into multiple languages in editions of uneven quality. It was very popular in Britain and America. In 1849 a German newspaper commented that in England two of the three different translations were made by women, "while in Germany most of the men do not understand it."&lt;ref&gt;Beilage zu No. 102 der (Augsburger) Allgemeinen Zeitung, 12 April 1849.&lt;/ref&gt; The first translation by Augustin Pritchard — published anonymously by Mr. Baillière (volume I in 1845 and volume II in 1848) — suffered from being hurriedly made. In a letter Humboldt said of it: "It will damage my reputation. All the charm of my description is destroyed by an English sounding like Sanskrit."{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The other two translations were made by [[Elizabeth Juliana Leeves Sabine]] under the superintendence of her husband Col. [[Edward Sabine]] (4 volumes 1846–1858), and by [[Elise Otté]] (5 volumes 1849–1858, the only complete translation of the 4 German volumes). These three translations were also published in the United States. The numbering of the volumes differs between the German and the English editions. Volume 3 of the German edition corresponds to the volumes 3 and 4 of the English translation, as the German volume appeared in 2 parts in 1850 and 1851. Volume 5 of the German edition was not translated until 1981, again by a woman.&lt;ref name=Bowen1981&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Margarita |last=Bowen|title=Empiricism and Geographical Thought: From Francis Bacon to Alexander von Humboldt|series=Cambridge Geographical Studies (No. 15)|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=978-0-521-10559-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otté's translation benefited from a detailed table of contents, and an index for every volume; of the German edition only volumes 4 and 5 had (extremely short) tables of contents, and the index to the whole work only appeared with volume 5 in 1862. Less well known in Germany is the atlas belonging to the German edition of the Cosmos ''"Berghaus' Physikalischer Atlas"'', better known as the pirated version by Traugott Bromme under the title ''"Atlas zu Alexander von Humboldt's Kosmos"'' (Stuttgart 1861).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In Britain, [[Heinrich Berghaus]] planned to publish together with [[Alexander Keith Johnston (1804-1871)|Alexander Keith Johnston]] a ''"Physical Atlas"''. But later Johnston published it alone under the title ''"The Physical Atlas of Natural Phenomena"''. In Britain its connection to the ''Cosmos'' seems not have been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;all information from Wolf-Dieter Grün: The English editions of the ''Kosmos''.

Alexander von Humboldt published prolifically throughout his life. Many works were published originally in French or German, then translated to other languages, sometimes with competing translation editions. Humboldt himself did not keep track of all the various editions.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=413}} He wrote specialized works on particular topics of botany, zoology, astronomy, mineralogy, among others, but he also wrote general works that attracted a wide readership, especially his ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent during the years 1799-1804''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/23548 ''Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America, during the years 1799–1804/ by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland; translated from the French of Alexander von Humboldt and edited by Thomasina Ross'' (vols 2 &amp; 3)], biodiversitylibrary.org&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' was widely read in Mexico itself, the United States, as well as in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/85282#page/12/mode/1up ''Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain containing researches relative to the geography of Mexico''], biodiversitylibrary.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on scientists and artists==
Humboldt was generous toward his friends and mentored young scientists. He and Bonpland parted ways after their return to Europe, and Humboldt largely took on the task of publishing the results of their Latin American expedition at Humboldt's expense, but he included Bonpland as co-author on the nearly published 30 volumes. Bonpland returned to Latin America, settling in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then moved to the countryside near the border with Paraguay. The forces of Dr. [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], the strong man of Paraguay, abducted Bonpland after killing Bonpland's estate workers. Bonpland was accused of "agricultural espionage" and of threatening Paraguay's virtual monopoly on the cultivation of [[yerba mate]]. Despite international pressure, including the British government and Simón Bolívar's, along with European scientists including Humboldt, Francia kept Bonpland prisoner until 1831. He was released after nearly 10 years in Paraguay. Humboldt and Bonpland maintained a warm correspondence about science and politics until Bonpland's death in 1858.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=272}}

During Humboldt's time in Paris, he met in 1818 the young and brilliant Peruvian student of the Royal Mining School of Paris, [[Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz]]. Subsequently, Humboldt acted as a mentor of the career of this promising Peruvian scientist. Another recipient of Humboldt's aid was [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807–1873), who was directly aided with needed cash from Humboldt, assistance in securing an academic position, and help with getting his research on zoology published. Agassiz sent him copies of his publications and went on to gain considerable scientific recognition as a professor at Harvard.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=326-27}} Agassiz delivered an address to the Boston Society of Natural History in 1869, on the centenary of his patron's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Agassiz, ''Address delivered on the Centennial Anniversary of the Birth of Alexander von Humboldt, under the auspices of the Boston Society of Natural History''. Boston 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; When Humboldt was an elderly man, he aided another young scholar, [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], a brilliant, young, Jewish mathematician in Berlin, for whom he obtained a small crown pension and whom he nominated for the Academy of Science.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=334-36}}

Humboldt's popular writings inspired many scientists and naturalists, including [[Charles Darwin]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[John Muir]], [[George Perkins Marsh]], [[Ernst Haeckel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wulf|2015}}, chapters 17, 19, 21, 22, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as brothers [[Richard Schomburgk]] and [[Robert Schomburgk]].&lt;ref&gt;Vera M. Kutzinski and Ottmar Ette, "The Art of Science: Alexander von Humboldt's Views of the Cultures of the World" in ''Views of the Codilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the America: A Critical edition'' by Alexander von Humboldt. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2014, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt carried on correspondence with many contemporaries and two volumes of letters to [[Karl August Varnhagen von Ense]] have been published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/79321 ''Letters of Alexander von Humboldt to Varnhagen von Ense.

Charles Darwin made frequent reference to Humboldt's work in his ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]]'', where Darwin described his own scientific exploration of the Americas. In one note, he placed Humboldt first on the "list of American travellers".&lt;ref name="Darjournal"&gt;Darwin, C. R. 1839. Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe. ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and remarks]]''. 1832–1836. London: Henry Colburn. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.3&amp;pageseq=129 p. 110]&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's work was influenced by Humboldt's writing style as well. Darwin's sister remarked to him "you had, probably from reading so much of Humboldt, got his phraseology and the kind of flower French expressions he uses."{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=226}}

When Darwin's ''Journal'' was published, he sent a copy to Humboldt, who responded, "You told me in your kind letter that, when you were young, the manner in which I studied and depicted nature in the torrid zones contributed toward exciting in you the ardour and desire to travel in distant lands. Considering the importance of your work, Sir, this may be the greatest success that my humble work could bring."{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In his autobiography, Darwin recalled, reading "with care and profound interest Humboldt's ''Personal Narrative''" and finding it one of the two most influential books on his work, which stirred in him "a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science."&lt;ref name="Darbio"&gt;Barlow, Nora ed. 1958. The autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809–1882. With the original omissions restored. Edited and with appendix and notes by his granddaughter Nora Barlow. London: Collins. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=69 pp. 67–68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt would later reveal to Darwin in the 1840s that he had been a fan of Darwin's grandfather's poetry. Erasmus Darwin had published the poem "Loves of the Plants" in the early 1800s. Humboldt praised the poem for combing nature and imagination, a theme that permeated Humboldt's own work.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=37}}

[[File:Church Heart of the Andes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[The Heart of the Andes]] (1859)]]
A number of nineteenth-century artists traveled to Latin America, following in the footsteps of Humboldt, painting landscapes and scenes of everyday life. [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], [[Ferdinand Bellermann]], and [[Eduard Hildebrandt]] were three important European painters.&lt;ref&gt;Sigrid Achenbach. ''Kunst um Humboldt: Reisestudiern aus Mittel- un Südamerika von Rugendas, Bellerman un Hildebrandt im Berliner Kupferstichkabinett''. Berlin: Kupferstichkabinett Statliche Musee 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Edwin Church]] was the most famous landscape painter in the U.S. in the nineteenth century. His paintings of Andean volcanoes that Humboldt climbed helped make Church's reputation. His 5 foot by 10 foot painting entitled [[Heart of the Andes]] "caused a sensation" when it was completed. Church had hoped to ship the painting to Berlin to show the painting to Humboldt, but Humboldt died a few days after Church's letter was written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wulf|2015}}, caption, [plate 11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Baron, "From Alexander von Humboldt to Frederic Edwin Church: Voyages of Scientific Exploration and Artistic Creativity".

New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Church painted Cotopaxi three times, twice in 1855 and then in 1859 in eruption.

[[George Catlin]], most famous for his portraits of North American Indians and paintings of life among various North American tribes also traveled to South America, producing a number of paintings. He wrote to Humboldt in 1855, sending him his proposal for South American travels. Humboldt replied, thanking him and sending a memorandum helping guide his travels.&lt;ref&gt;George Catlin, ''Last Rambles Amongst the Indians of the Rocky Mountains and the Andes''. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1867, pp. 332-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''South American Indian paintings by George Catlin''. Washington, D.C.: National Gallery of Art (U.S.) 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other aspects of Humboldt's life and career==

===Humboldt and the Prussian monarchy===
[[File:AlexanderVonHumboldtBriefsiegel.jpg|thumb|upright|Humboldt's [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] on a private letter]]

In the Napoleonic wars, Prussia had capitulated to France, signing the [[Treaty of Tilsit]]. The Prussian royal family returned to Berlin, but sought better terms of the treaty and Friedrich Wilhelm III commissioned his younger brother Prince Wilhelm with this. Friedrich Wilhelm III asked Alexander to be part of the mission, charged with introducing the prince to Paris society. This turn of events for Humboldt could not have been better, since he desired to live in Paris rather than Berlin.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=210}}

In 1814 Humboldt accompanied the allied sovereigns to London. Three years later he was summoned by the king of Prussia to attend him at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|congress of Aachen]]. Again in the autumn of 1822 he accompanied the same monarch to the [[Congress of Verona]], proceeded thence with the royal party to Rome and Naples and returned to Paris in the spring of 1823. Humboldt had long regarded Paris as his true home. Thus, when at last he received from his sovereign a summons to join his court at Berlin, he obeyed reluctantly.

Between 1830 and 1848 Humboldt was frequently employed in diplomatic missions to the court of [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis Philippe]] of France, with whom he always maintained the most cordial personal relations. Charles X of France had been overthrown, with Louis-Philippe of the house of Orléans becoming king. Humboldt knew the family, and he was sent by the Prussian monarch to Paris to report on events to his monarch. He spent three years in France, from 1830 to 1833. His friends [[François Arago]] and [[François Guizot]], who were appointed to posts in Louis-Philippe's government.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=311}}

Humboldt's brother, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Wilhelm]], died on 8 April 1835. Alexander lamented that he had lost half of himself with the death of his brother. Upon the accession of the crown prince [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] in June 1840, Humboldt's favor at court increased. Indeed, the new king's craving for Humboldt's company became at times so importunate as to leave him only a few waking hours to work on his writing.

===Religion===
Because Humboldt did not mention God in his work ''Cosmos'', and sometimes spoke unfavourably of hypocritical religious attitudes, it was occasionally speculated that he was a [[materialism|materialist]] philosopher, or perhaps an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/alexandlettersof00humbrich#page/n416/mode/1up Humboldt and the New Infidelity]'', article found in [[Friedrich Kapp]]'s ''[https://archive.org/details/alexandlettersof00humbrich Letters of Alexander von Humboldt to Varnhagen von Ense. From 1827 to 1858. With extracts from Varnhagen's diaries, and letters of Varnhagen and others to Humboldt]'' (1860).&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike irreligious figures such as [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], who went so far as to use Humboldtian science to campaign against religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|2006|loc=Ch. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt himself denied imputations of atheism. In a letter to [[Karl August Varnhagen von Ense|Varnhagen von Ense]] he emphasized that he believed the world had indeed been created, writing of ''Cosmos'': "...'creation' and the 'created world' are never lost sight of in the book. And did I not, only eight months ago, in the French translation, say, in the plainest terms: 'It is this necessity of things, this occult but permanent connection, this periodical return in the progress, development of formation, phenomena, and events which constitute 'Nature' submissive to a controlling power?'"&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt, Alexander von. 1860. ''Letters of Alexander von Humboldt to Varnhagen von Ense''. Rudd &amp; Carleton. p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that "although Humboldt emphasizes the basis of morality in the nature of man, he does acknowledge that a belief in God is linked directly to acts of virtue" and therefore "the dignity of man lies at the centre of Humboldt's religious thought."&lt;ref&gt;Garbooshian, Adrina Michelle. 2006. ''The Concept of Human Dignity in the French and American Enlightenments: Religion, Virtue, Liberty''. ProQuest, p. 305.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt also believed firmly in an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Helen Dickson (1913). Humboldt's ideal of humanity. Chapter IV: "The Foundations and Expressions of Humboldt's ideal"; pp. 56-60&lt;/ref&gt; A letter he wrote to his friend Charlotte Hildebrand Diede states: "God constantly appoints the course of nature and of circumstances; so that, including his existence in an eternal future, the happiness of the individual does not perish, but on the contrary grows and increases."&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr von), Charlotte Hildebrand Diede, Catharine M. A. Couper (1849). ''[https://archive.org/stream/lettersofwilliam02humbuoft#page/n35/mode/2up Letters to a female friend: A complete ed., translated from the 2d German ed, Volume 2]''. J. Chapman, pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt remained distant of organized religion: he did not believe in the Bible as an [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] document,{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} nor in the divinity of Jesus;{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} yet, Humboldt still held deep respect for the ideal side of religious belief and church life within human communities.&lt;ref&gt;James, 1913; pp. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt; He differentiated between "negative" religions, and those "all positive religions [which] consist of three distinct parts — a code of morals which is nearly the same in all of them, and generally very pure; a geological chimera, and a myth or a little historical novel."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Kapp]]'s [https://archive.org/details/alexandlettersof00humbrich ''Letters of Alexander von Humboldt to Varnhagen von Ense. From 1827 to 1858. With extracts from Varnhagen's diaries, and letters of Varnhagen and others to Humboldt''] (1860). Cambridge University Press. pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Cosmos'', he wrote about how rich geological descriptions were found in different religious traditions, and stated:"Christianity gradually diffused itself, and, wherever it was adopted as the religion of the state, it not only exercised a beneficial condition on the lower classes by inculcating the social freedom of mankind, but also expanded the views of men in their communion with Nature...this tendency to glorify the Deity in his works gave rise to a taste for natural observation."&lt;ref&gt;Wikisource. ''[[s:Page:Popular Science Monthly Volume 9.djvu/727|Popular Science Monthly Volume 9]]''. "Science and Religion as Allies"&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt showed [[religious tolerance]] towards Judaism, and he criticized the political ''Jews Bill'', which was an initiative intended to establish legal discrimination against Jews. He called this an "abominable" law, since he hoped to see Jews being treated equally in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|2006|loc="Notes", p. 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
[[File:Arbeitszimmer_des_Alexander_von_Humboldt_in_Berlin,_Oranienburger_Str._67_(Gemälde).jpg|thumb|left|Alexander von Humboldt in his library in his Oranienburger Strasse, Berlin apartment, by [[Eduard Hildebrandt]]]]
[[File:Baron Alexander von Humboldt by Julius Schrader 1859.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Humboldt by [[Julius Schrader]], 1859. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]

Much of Humboldt's private life remains a mystery because he destroyed his private letters. While a gregarious personality, he may have harbored a sense of social alienation, which drove his passion for escape through travel.{{sfn|Sachs|2007|p=64}}

Humboldt never married: while he was charmed by a number of attractive women, including [[Henriette Herz|Henriette]], the wife of his mentor Marcus Herz, his sister-in-law Caroline von Humboldt stated "nothing will ever have a great influence on Alexander that doesn't come through men."{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=71}} He had many strong male friendships, and at times had romances with men.{{sfn|Sachs|2007|p=65}}

As a student he became infatuated with Wilhelm Gabriel Wegener, a theology student, penning a succession of letters expressing his "fervent love".{{sfn|Helferich|2004|p=8}} At 25 he met Reinhardt von Haeften (19 May 1772 – 20 October 1803), a 21-year-old lieutenant, with whom he lived and travelled for two years, and to whom he wrote in 1794: "I only live through you, my good precious Reinhardt." When von Haeften became engaged, Humboldt begged to remain living with him and his wife: "Even if you must refuse me, treat me coldly with disdain, I should still want to be with you...the love I have for you is not just friendship or brotherly love, it is veneration."{{sfn|Rupke|2008|pp=187-200}}

A travelling companion in the Americas for five years was Aimé Bonpland, and in [[Quito]] in 1802 he met the Ecuadorian aristocrat Don Carlos Montúfar, who travelled with Humboldt to Europe and lived with him. In France, Humboldt travelled and lived with the physicist and balloonist [[Joseph Louis Gay Lussac]]. Later he had a deep friendship with the married French astronomer [[François Arago]], whom he met daily for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Mary Louise ''Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation'', Routledge, New York, 1992, {{ISBN|0415438160}}, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt once wrote, "I don't know sensual needs."{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=71}} However, a pious travelling companion, [[Francisco José de Caldas]], accused him of frequenting houses in Quito where "impure love reigned", of making friends with "obscene dissolute youths", of giving vent to "shameful passions of his heart", and dropping him to travel with "Bonpland and his Adonis"[Monúfar].&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Robert F. ''Colonialism and Homosexuality'', Routledge, London, 2003, {{ISBN|0415196159}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt inherited a significant fortune, but the expense of his travels, and most especially of publishing (thirty volumes in all), had by 1834 made him totally reliant on the pension of King Frederick William III.{{sfn|Walls|2009|p=109}} Although he preferred living in Paris, by 1836 the King had insisted he return to Germany. He lived with the Court at [[Sanssouci]], and latterly in Berlin, with his valet Seifert, who had accompanied him to Russia in 1829.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=363}}
[[File:SignaturAlexanderVonHumboldt.svg|thumb|right|Signature of Humboldt late in life, when his handwriting became increasingly difficult to read]]
Four years before his death, Humboldt executed a deed of gift transferring his entire estate to the dominating Seifert,{{sfn|Walls|2009|p=367}}{{sfn|Helferich|2004|p=312}} who had by then married and set up a household near Humboldt's apartment. Humboldt had become godfather to his daughter.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|p=317}} The scale of the bequest has always drawn speculation, especially as Seifert was some thirty years younger, and introducing lower class partners into households under the guise of servants was then a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, Magnus ''Die Homosexualitat des Mannes und des Webies'', Louis Marcus, Berlin, 1914, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the sexual researcher [[w:de:Paul Näcke|Paul Näcke]] gathered reminiscences from homosexuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Havelock Henry |last=Ellis |year=1927 |title=Sexual Inversion|journal=Studies in the Psychology of Sex|volume=2|page=39|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13611/13611-h/13611-h.htm#2_Page_39}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Humboldt's friend the botanist Karl Bolle, then 90 years old: some of the material was incorporated by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] into his 1914 study ''Homosexuality in Men and Women.''&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, Magnus ''Die Homosexualitat des Mannes und des Webies'', Louis Marcus, Berlin, 1914, p. 681&lt;/ref&gt; However, speculations about Humboldt's private life and possible [[homosexuality]] continue to remain a fractious issue amongst scholars, particularly as earlier biographers had portrayed him as "a largely asexual, Christ-like Humboldt figure...suitable as a national idol."{{sfn|Rupke|2008|pp=195-7}}

===Illness and death===

On 24 February 1857, Humboldt suffered a minor [[stroke]], which passed without perceptible symptoms.{{sfn|Clerke|1911}} It was not until the winter of 1858–1859 that his strength began to decline; on 6 May 1859, he died peacefully in Berlin, aged 89. His last words were reported to be "How glorious these sunbeams are! They seem to call Earth to the Heavens!"&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were conveyed in state through the streets of Berlin, in a hearse drawn by six horses. Royal chamberlains led the cortège, each charged with carrying a pillow with Humboldt's medals and other decorations of honor. Humboldt's extended family, descendants of his brother Wilhelm, walked in the procession. Humboldt's coffin was received by the prince-regent at the door of the cathedral. He was interred at the family resting-place at [[Tegel]], alongside his brother Wilhelm and sister-in-law Caroline.{{sfn|De Terra|1955|pp=368-69}}

==Honours and namesakes==
The honours which had been showered on Humboldt during life continued after his death. More places and species are named after Humboldt than after any other human being.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973159818|title=Drawdown : the most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming|last=Paul|first=Hawken|publisher=Worldcat.org|year=|isbn=9781524704650|location=|pages=24|oclc=973159818}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The first centenary of Humboldt's birth was celebrated on 14 September 1869, with great enthusiasm in both the New and Old Worlds. Numerous monuments were constructed in his honour, such as [[Humboldt Park (Chicago park)|Humboldt Park in Chicago]], planned that year and constructed shortly after the [[Great Chicago Fire|Chicago fire]]. Newly explored regions and species named after Humboldt, as discussed below, also stand as a measure of his wide fame and popularity.

===Lecture series===
Alexander von Humboldt also lends his name to a prominent lecture series in [[Human geography]] in the Netherlands (hosted by the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]]). It is the Dutch equivalent of the widely known annual [[Alfred Hettner|Hettner]] lectures at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

===The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation===
After his death, Humboldt's friends and colleagues created the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] (''Stiftung'' in German) to continue his generous support of young academics. Although the original endowment was lost in the [[German hyperinflation of the 1920s]], and again as a result of World War II, the Foundation has been re-endowed by the German government to award young academics and distinguished senior academics from abroad. It plays an important role in attracting foreign researchers to work in Germany and enabling German researchers to work abroad for a period.

===Dedications===
[[Edgar Allan Poe]] dedicated his last major work, ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]'', to Humboldt, "With Very Profound Respect". Humboldt's attempt to unify the sciences in his ''Kosmos'' was a big inspiration for Poe's project.

===Ship===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
''[[Alexander von Humboldt (ship)|Alexander von Humboldt]]'' is also a German ship named after the scientist originally built in 1906 by the German shipyard AG Weser at [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] as '''''Reserve Sonderburg'''''. She was operated throughout the North and Baltic Seas until being retired in 1986. Subsequently, she was converted into a three masted [[barque]] by the German shipyard Motorwerke Bremerhaven and was re-launched in 1988 as ''Alexander von Humboldt''.

===Recognitions by contemporaries===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}

[[Simón Bolívar]] wrote that "The real discoverer of South America was Humboldt, since his work was more useful for our people than the work of all conquerors."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Erickson, Mauricio A. Font, Brian Schwartz. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283269427_Alexander_von_Humboldt_From_the_Americas_to_the_Cosmos ''Alexander von Humboldt. From the Americas to the Cosmos''] p. xvi. Bildner Center for Western Hemisphere Studies, The Graduate Center, The City University of New York&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] expressed his debt to Humboldt, and admiration for his work,&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Correspondence Project " [http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-9601 Letter 9601] — Darwin, C. R. to secretary of New York Liberal Club, [after 13 Aug 1874]&lt;/ref&gt; writing to [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] that Humboldt was the "''greatest scientific traveller who ever lived''".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Correspondence Project " [http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-13277 Letter 13277] — Darwin, C. R. to Hooker, J. D., 6 Aug 1881&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- source needed, possibly in Letter 9601? – "''I have always admired him; now I worship him.''"--&gt; [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] wrote that "Alexander is destined to combine ideas and follow chains of thoughts which would otherwise have remained unknown for ages. His depth, his sharp mind and his incredible speed are a rare combination." [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] observed that "Humboldt showers us with true treasures." [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote that "Alexander impresses many, particularly when compared to his brother - because he shows off more!" [[José de la Luz y Caballero]] wrote that "Columbus gave Europe a New World; Humboldt made it known in its physical, material, intellectual, and moral aspects." [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] remarked "You have been studying Botanics? Just like my wife!" [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] said "This man is as knowledgeable as a whole academy." [[Thomas Jefferson]] remarked "I consider him the most important scientist whom I have met." [[Emil Du Bois-Reymond]] wrote that "Every scientist is a descendant of Humboldt. We are all his family." [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] wrote that "He was to science what Shakespeare was to the drama."&lt;ref&gt;The Writings of Robert G Ingersoll (Dresden Edition) - C P Farrell (1900)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann von Helmholtz]] wrote that "During the first half of the present century we had an Alexander von Humboldt, who was able to scan the scientific knowledge of his time in its details, and to bring it within one vast generalization. At the present juncture, it is obviously very doubtful whether this task could be accomplished in a similar way, even by a mind with gifts so peculiarly suited for the purpose as Humboldt's was, and if all his time and work were devoted to the purpose."&lt;ref&gt;H. Helmholtz (1869), translated by E. Atkinson, ''The aim and progress of physical science'', in Popular Lectures on Scientific Subjects, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beeron National Park''' is a national park at [[Beeron, Queensland|Beeron]] in the [[Wide Bay–Burnett]] region of [[Queensland]], Australia.  The 7050-hectare park preserves plant species of high conservation value.&lt;ref name="bnpms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/managing/plans-strategies/statements/beeron.html |title=Beeron National Park Management Statement 2013 |date=11 November 2013 |publisher=Department of National Parks, Recreation, Sport and Racing |accessdate=19 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of both the [[North Burnett Region]] and [[South Burnett Region]] local government areas and the [[Brigalow Belt]] bioregion.&lt;ref name="bnpwet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wetlandinfo.ehp.qld.gov.au/wetlands/facts-maps/national-park-beeron/ |title=Beeron National Park |work=WetlandInfo |publisher=Department of Environment and Heritage Protection |accessdate=19 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park lies within the catchment area of the [[Boyne River (Wide Bay–Burnett)|Boyne River]], a tributary of the [[Burnett River]].

Beeron National Park is home to six endemic species and three plants with conservation significance.&lt;ref name="bnpms"/&gt;

In 2010, an extra 7,000 hectares significantly extended the size of the park.&lt;ref name="pepc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/30/2860304.htm?site=southqld |title=Park expansion prompts call for more rangers |author=Sam Burgess |accessdate=19 August 2014 |date=30 March 2010 |work=ABC Southern Queensland |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The addition was made possible by the cooperation of two mining companies who relinquished their mining permits.&lt;ref name="bgenp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media-newswire.com/release_1115426.html |title=Bligh Government Expands National Parks By 60,000 Hectares To Protect Rare Plants And Animals |date=28 March 2010 |publisher=Media-Newswire.com |accessdate=19 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South and west of the national park is Allies Creek State Forest.  It is undeveloped with no visitor facilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2151">'''Boris Karlovich Stegmann''' (25 December 1898-28 December 1975) was a Russian [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] of German descent who worked on [[zoogeography]]. 

Stegmann was born in [[Pskov]], Russia. He worked at the Russian Academy of Sciences from 1921 in the ornithology department. He became a research assistant in 1928 and worked on various bird groups. In 1938 he published his ideas on nine avifaunal centres within the Old World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stegmann, B.|year=1938| chapter=Principes généraux  des subdivisions ornitho-geographiques de la region palearctique |title=Faune de l'URSS.

In 1941, his German ancestry led to his removal from work in Russia and deportation to [[Kazakhstan]]. Exiled in central Asia, he continued his research on birds in the region until 1954. In 1964 he published a volume on the birds of the [[Soviet Union]] along with Aleksandr Ivanovich Ivanov. He also worked on molluscs and on the evolution of birds. In 1978 his work on the comparative anatomy of the avian forelimb was published posthumously with a preface by [[Walter Bock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Raikow, Robert J. |pages=135–137| title=Review: Relationships of the Superorders Alectoromorphae and Charadromorphae (Aves): A comparative study of the avian hand| journal=Wilson Bulletin| volume=92| issue=1| year=1980|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v092n01/p0131-p0139.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01640496|title=Persönliches: Boris Karlowitsch Stegmann 1898-1975 |author=Kumari, Eerik |journal=Journal of Ornithology|volume=117|issue=3|pages=395-396|year=1976|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Calakmul Biosphere Reserve''' (''Reserva de la Biosfera de Calakmul'') is located at the base of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]], in [[Calakmul Municipality]] in the state of [[Campeche]], bordering the [[Departments of Guatemala|Guatemalan department]] of [[El Petén]] to the south. It occupies {{Convert|7231|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and includes about 12% of the subperennial jungles of Mexico. The Reserve, which was established in 1989, is one of the largest protected areas in Mexico, covering more than 14% of the state.&lt;ref name=Planeta&gt;{{cite web|last=Mader|first=Ron|title=Planeta-Calakmul|url=http://www.planeta.com/ecotravel/mexico/yucatan/calakmul.html|access-date=2012-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041116210759/http://www.planeta.com/ecotravel/mexico/yucatan/calakmul.html#|archive-date=2004-11-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The important [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] archaeological site of [[Calakmul]], one of the largest-known [[List of Maya sites|Maya sites]], is located in the Biosphere Reserve.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Maya City of Calakmul, Campeche|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1061|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The Reserve and the contiguous forested areas of the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] ''(Reserva de la Biosfera Maya)'' in the Guatemalan department of El Petén form one of the largest and least disturbed tracts of [[rainforest]] in the Americas north of Colombia. The forest is classified as dry forest to the west and tall and medium-height [[Petén-Veracruz moist forests|subperennial rainforest]] to the east. Among the trees, there are [[ceiba]]s, Honduras mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), [[strangler fig]]s (''[[Ficus]]''), chaká (''[[Bursera simaruba]]''), and chicle or chicozapote (''[[Manilkara chicle]]'').

The biosphere is home to 86 species of mammals, 18 of which can be found in the Official Registry of Mexican Ecology, a resource that outlines flora and fauna that are in danger of extinction, rare, threatened or are under protection. The area is home to 5 of the 6 large cats that are native to Mexico.&lt;ref name=ParksWatch&gt;{{cite web|title=Calakmul Biosphere Reserve|url=http://www.parkswatch.org/parkprofile.php?l=eng&amp;country=mex&amp;park=ckbr&amp;page=rec|publisher=Parks Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This includes its small but healthy population of [[jaguar]]s as well as [[jaguarundi]]s, [[ocelot]]s, [[puma (genus)|puma]]s and [[margay]]s.  The fauna also includes [[Central American agouti]]s, [[Geoffroy's spider monkey]]s, [[Guatemalan black howler]]s, [[Baird's tapir]], [[white-nosed coati]]s, [[ocellated turkey]]s, [[crested guan]]s, [[toucan]]s, and green [[parrot]]s.

==Threats==
The reserve has been given a critically threatened designation, which means that prompt measures must be taken to continue to protect and conserve its biodiversity.&lt;ref name=ParksWatch /&gt; These threats include: Population growth, subsistence hunting and poaching, tourist infrastructure, and the emergence of highways and roads.

Human population within the reserve has been rapidly increasing since the 1980s due to increased migration as well as high birthrates. This has put increasing strain on natural resources due to the locals' agricultural and ranching subsistence.

Although 80% of the hunting in the reserve is done for personal consumption among the local people, this subsistence hunting has had an increasingly drastic impact on the wildlife populations. These animals are also being poached by military units that are in active duty within the area.&lt;ref name=ParksWatch /&gt;

There has been an increasing amount of tourist activity, since the reserve was given [[UNESCO]] designation, which has created several problems. Although water is scarce in the region, the consumable water near villages or towns is reserved for tourists, creating a water shortage among the locals. There is growing awareness of a possible water crisis due to the inability to meet the needs of the locals and the tourism industry.

Due to problems with the design of the reserve, two main roads have been built that cross through two of the core, important areas of the reserve. There have been proposals of a tourism destination called Maya World &lt;ref name=ParksWatch /&gt; which would involve a highway connecting different areas of the biosphere reserve. Although the plans for the highway have been  put aside for the time being, hotel construction continues in those areas.

== Political Issues ==
The area was declared a biosphere reserve by Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 1989. The cited reasons for the designation were protection of biological diversity, as well as protection of the numerous ancient Mayan ruins that are within the limits of the reserve. Since then there has been disparity between the views and philosophies of the local people who live on the land and those government officials and urban environmentalists who wish to protect its resources .&lt;ref name=Locals&gt;{{cite web|last=1-Iaenn'|first=Nora|title=The Power of Environmental Knowledge: Ethnoecology and Environmental Conflicts in Mexican Conservation|url=http://www.parkswatch.org/parkprofile.php?l=eng&amp;country=mex&amp;park=ckbr&amp;page=rec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people who live on the land are migrants representing 23 of the 32 states of Mexico that were drawn to the land in the 1960s when the Mexican government put land distribution projects in place. Although their cultures may differ, they share the common identity of [[Peasant|Campesinos]] (meaning people who farm) and of subsistence farmers who live off the land. As subsistence farmers they all share the common belief that the environment is a place to work, which contrasts with the agendas of environmentalists and government official who believe that an "ideal environment is one devoid of human presence".&lt;ref name=Locals /&gt; These outside parties have the "do not touch" mentality. Thus the Campesinos have created a united front in pushing for access to important resources that enable them to farm and provide for themselves.

In 1991 the Mexican president gave the Campesinos "care for the reserve"&lt;ref name=Locals /&gt;  which provided funding to aid in the protection of the remaining forests while encouraging self-sufficiency in the local farming sector. This has been in line with the philosophy that biodiversity is "diversity in use".&lt;ref name=Locals /&gt;

These issues of debate has led to a resistance movement from the local farmers. Due to their beliefs surrounding the uses of the environment and work, many believe that those on the other side of the debate (government officials and urban environmentalists) wish to use the land for their own profitable means. Many farmers recognize the difference between symbolic and actual land ownership and feel as though the government is undermining their subsistence practices.&lt;ref name=Locals /&gt; Whereas the Campesinos practice subsistence farming and therefore do not receive a salary, there is a high vulnerability that they face from others implementing regulations.

[[Image:Tide legal use.gif|thumb|right|350px|US civil and maritime uses of tidal data]]
A '''chart datum''' is the level of water that charted depths displayed on a [[nautical chart]] are measured from. A chart datum is generally a tidal datum; that is, a [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] derived from some phase of the [[tide]].&lt;ref name="bom" /&gt;  Common chart datums are ''lowest astronomical tide''&lt;ref name='bom'&gt;Australian Bureau of Meteorology National Tide Centre Glossary ''http://www.bom.gov.au/oceanography/projects/ntc/NTC_glossary.pdf''{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (retrieved 30 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''mean lower low water''. In non-tidal areas, e.g., the [[Baltic sea]], [[Mean Sea Level]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sjofartsverket.se/en/Maritime-services/Hydrographic-Information/Charts/Reference-Levels/Mean-Sea-Level/ Sjofartsverket: Mean Sea Level]&lt;/ref&gt; (MSL) is used.

A chart datum is a [[Geodetic datum#Vertical datum|vertical datum]] and must not be confused with the [[Geodetic datum#Horizontal datum|horizontal datum]] for the chart.

==Lowest astronomical tide==
Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) is defined as the lowest tide level which can be predicted to occur under average meteorological conditions and under any combination of astronomical conditions.&lt;ref&gt; RESOLUTIONS of the INTERNATIONAL HYDROGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION Publication M-3 2nd Edition - 2010 Updated to December 2016. SECTION 2.2 – TIDES AND WATER LEVELS para 2 note (i)&lt;/ref&gt;
Many national charting agencies, including the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service|Australian Hydrographic Service]]
&lt;ref name=aus&gt;Australian Tides Manual SP9 V4.1, Australian Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping, Permanent Committee on Tides and Mean Sea Level ''http://www.icsm.gov.au/tides/SP9_Australian_Tides_Manual_V4.1.pdf''{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;, use the LAT to define chart datums. 

One advantage of using LAT for chart datums is that all predicted tidal heights must then be positive (or zero) avoiding possible ambiguity and the need to explicitly state sign. Calculation of the LAT only allows for gravitational effects so lower tides may occur in practice due to other factors (e.g. meteorological effects such as high pressure systems).

==Mean lower low water==
The United States' [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] uses mean lower low water (MLLW), which is the average height of the lowest tide recorded at a tide station each day during a 19-year recording period, known as the National Tidal Datum Epoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datum_options.html |title=Tidal Datums |publisher=tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt; MLLW is only a mean, so some tidal levels may be negative relative to MLLW; see also [[mean low water spring]]. The 19-year recording period is the nearest full year count to the 18.6-year cycle of the [[lunar node]] regression, which has an effect on tides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/tidal_datums_and_their_applications.pdf Tidal Datums And Their Applications], NOAA Special Publication NOS CO-OPS 1, Silver Spring MD, June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mean higher high water==
Similarly, the mean higher high water (MHHW), is the average height of the highest tide recorded at a tide station each day during the recording period. It is used, among other things as a datum from which to measure the navigational clearance, or [[air draft]], under bridges,

==Charts and tables==
Charted depths and [[drying height]]s on [[nautical chart]]s are given relative to chart datum. Some height values on charts, such as [[air draft|vertical clearances]] under bridges or overhead wires, may be referenced to a different vertical datum, such as [[Mean high water spring|Mean High Water Springs]] or Highest Astronomical Tide (for "HAT" see "[[tidal range]]").

[[Tide table]]s give the height of the tide above a chart datum making it feasible to calculate the depth of water at a given point ''and'' at a given time by adding the charted depth to the height of the tide. One may calculate whether an area that dries is under water by subtracting the drying height from the [given] height calculated from the [[Tide table]].

Using charts and tables not based on the same [[Geodetic datum|datum]] can result in incorrect calculation of water depths. Be wary. Always confirm compatibility.

==Chart Datum and GNSS==
In recent years national hydrographic agencies have spearheaded developments to establish Chart Datum with respect to the [[GRS 80]] reference ellipsoid, thus enabling direct compatibility with [[GNSS]] positioning.  Examples of this include [[VORF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vertical Offshore Reference Frames (VORF)|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/vorf|publisher=UCL|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[UKHO]] and Bathyelli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHOM BATHYELLI : le nouveau produit du zéro hydrographique référencé à l'ellipsoïde sur data.shom.fr|url=http://refmar.shom.fr/sea_level_news_2013/2013_t4/shom-bathyelli-produit-zero-hydrographique-reference-ellipsoide-sur-data.shom.fr|publisher=SHOM|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[SHOM]].

'''Chryse'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} and '''Argyre'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} were a pair of legendary islands, located in the Indian Ocean and said to be made of gold (''chrysos'' in Greek) and silver (''argyros'').

In Book 6, chapter 23 of his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', concerning the regions near the [[Indus River]], [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79&amp;nbsp;CE) wrote that "Beyond the mouth of the Indus are the islands of Chryse and Argyre, abounding in metals, I believe; but as to what some persons have stated, that their soil consists of gold and silver, I am not so willing to believe that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some five or six centuries later, in section XIV.vi.11 of his encyclopedic ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'', [[Isidore of Seville]] (c.&amp;nbsp;560–636) repeated much the same information: "Chryse and Argyre are islands situated in the Indian Ocean, so rich in metal that many people maintain these islands have a surface of gold and silver; whence their names are derived."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost certainly taken—like much else in the ''Etymologies'', as Isidore freely admitted—directly from the ''Natural History''. Both of these Latin works, the ''Naturalis Historia'' and especially the ''Etymologiae'', were widely read in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, and this ensured the survival of the legend of the Gold and Silver Islands until the beginning of the [[Age of Discovery]].

[[File:RavensteinBehaim.jpg|thumb|400px|A modern facsimile of Martin Behaim's 1492 [[Erdapfel]] map.  Chryse and Argyre are in the same map section as Cipangu (Japan) on the right, with Chryse just to the west of its southern tip, labelled ''Crisis'' and coloured yellow-brown;  Argyre is to the southwest of Chryse,  labelled ''Argire'' and coloured white. Note the absence of the Americas.]]As European geographers gathered more reliable information about the Indian Ocean, the purported location of Chryse and Argyre shifted farther and farther east to the fringes of the known world.  By the time [[Martin Behaim]] created his [[Erdapfel]] globe in 1492, the islands were though to be near Japan, possibly because [[Marco Polo]] had claimed Japan itself (which he called ''[[Names of Japan|Cipangu]]'') to be rich in gold and silver; Behaim is known to have used both Pliny and Marco Polo as sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The discovery of the Americas changed everything. European explorers in search of fabled lands of gold now sailed west for [[El Dorado]], instead of east to Cipangu.  The works of Isidore of Seville fell out of fashion, and the islands of Chryse and Argyre slowly faded from the popular imagination.

[[File:Schiaparelli versus Mars.jpg|thumb|400px|Schiaparelli's 1877 map matched with the actual surface of Mars as seen from orbit by Mariner 9. Chryse and Argyre are left of centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1974/JB079i026p03907.shtml|title=Surface Features on Mars: Ground-Based Albedo and Radar Compared With Mariner 9 Topography|publisher=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=79|number=26|pages=3907–3916|year=1974|doi=10.1029/JB079i026p03907|bibcode = 1974JGR....79.3907F }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1877, however, they were recalled to life by the astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]], who used the planetary opposition of that year to begin mapping the planet Mars. As an expert in ancient astronomy and geography he was very familiar with classical legends and fabled lands, and used them to name the features he could see through the telescope.  He assumed that dark areas might be low flat "seas", as they are on the Moon, while "land" would be lighter. In particular he noted several light patches that he took to be islands; he named the most striking circular one Hellas (for Greece), and two others Chryse and Argyre.

It was only with the observations made from Martian orbit by [[Mariner 9]] in 1972 that it became clear that these light areas were not islands at all, but depressions carpeted with light windblown dust.  Chryse is really a low flat plain, but the name has been kept, and it is now known as [[Chryse Planitia]], "Chryse Plain".  Argyre (like Hellas) is in fact a broad impact crater, and is now [[Argyre Planitia]], "Argyre Plain", which in turn has given its name to one of the [[List of quadrangles on Mars|cartographic quadrangles]] of the Martian atlas.

'''Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve''', ''Reserva Ecológica de Buenos Aires'', also known as Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve, ''Reserva Ecológica Costanera Sur'', is a {{convert|865|acre|km2|sing=on}} tract of low land on the [[Río de la Plata]] riverbank located on the east side of the [[Barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|district]] of [[Puerto Madero]] in [[Buenos Aires central business district|Buenos Aires CBD]], [[Argentina]].

==History==
[[File:Incendio de la Reserva Ecológica.jpg|thumb|Wildfire in the reserve on July 2013.]]
After opening in 1918, the Municipal Riverside resort was witness to the splendour and decadence of the “Costanera Sur” promenade. On foot, by car or tram, thousands of [[porteños]] came to this place in search of fresh air in summer afternoons, or to bathe in the river, smartly clad in their one piece bathing costume and carrying a towel. In accordance to the 1923 Regulations, men and women bathed in the river separated by the long pier.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/med_ambiente/reserva/resenia.php Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001130845/http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/med_ambiente/reserva/resenia.php |date=2011-10-01 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, the promenade became prosperous with the setting up of bars and coffee shops which added their architectural beauty to the Nereids Fountain built by sculptor [[Lola Mora]], the [[art deco]]-styled statue in honor to the [[Plus Ultra (flying boat)|Plus Ultra]] airmen, the bronze lamposts and the Monument in honor to the [[Monarch of Spain|King and Queen of Spain]]. The resort became one of the porteños favorite promenades not only during the day but also at night due to the music and variety shows performed in the coffee shops. The decline of the resort started at the end of the 1950s. Facilities began to deteriorate, many coffee shops were demolished and bathing started to be forbidden due to river contamination.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

In the early 1970s, a new project was created in addition to those that had been developed in the northern city areas which consisted of reclaiming land from the river in front of the old “Costanera Sur” Riverside Resort. The land-filling started in 1978 using the Dutch “polder” system; [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]]s were built using debris from demolitions carried out to construct urban motorways. As the zone within the embankments filled with silt from the river, the water confined inside was [[drained]], though this work was not fully completed.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The initial project, which included the creation of green areas and the construction of a “Government Building Area” was abandoned, although land-filling and debris dumping went on discontinuously until 1984, when works were finally ended. Since then, different plant communities developed spontaneously from seeds present in the silt, windborne or dispersed by the animals. By providing refuge and food, plants helped animal populations to settle in. From the beginning, the newly formed [[ponds]] and [[grasslands]] attracted the attention of nature lovers and bird watchers who thus started to visit them regularly. As the biological diversity increased, woods and a variety of animal species appeared. This place became a meeting point for joggers, cyclists, students, naturalists and even foreign bird watchers passing through [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The official recognition occurred on June 5, 1986, when the [[Buenos Aires#Government and politics|Buenos Aires City Council]] voted unanimously the Ordinance 41,247 granting protection to the area, thus echoing the claims of the Non-Governmental Organizations.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

On January 9, 2009, the Ecological Reserve caught fire. The large cloud of smoke persisted over Puerto Madero for nearly 24 hours, and was eventually put out by the fire department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1088675&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature trails==
Being adjacent to the city, a visit to the Ecological Reserve is an escape from the hustle and bustle of the metropolis. A number of trails leading to the river are perfect for [[birdwatching]], strolling, cycling and nature lovers.

'''Deliblato Sands''' ({{lang-sr|Делиблатска пешчара / Deliblatska peščara}}) is a large [[sand]] area covering around 300&amp;nbsp;km² of ground in [[Vojvodina]] province, [[Serbia]]. It is located in southern [[Banat]], situated between the river [[Danube]] and the southwestern slopes of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The sands are named after the village of [[Deliblato]], in the municipality of [[Kovin]]. Its main masses are elliptical shaped hills with [[steppe|steppe grassland plains]] and [[Forest steppe|steppe forests]]. 

The Deliblato Sands is the largest sandy terrain in [[Europe]], once part of a vast prehistoric [[desert]], having originated from the withdrawal of the [[Pannonian Sea]]. They are home to many [[endemic]] species of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s which are rare or [[endangered]] in [[Europe]] and globally. Due to its forest and surroundings, it was declared a Special Nature Reserve. On a national level, it represents a natural asset of special importance falling under protection category I.

==Wildlife of Deliblato sands==
The Deliblato Sands is rich in [[flora]]l diversity, it is home to 900 different species of [[plants]] which many are considered by international standards rare or [[endemic]] to the [[Pannonian Basin]]. Regions of similar terrain across [[Europe]] have been [[tillage|cultivated]], [[forest]]ed or otherwise altered, while Deliblato Sands has largely remained untouched. Some of the endangered and endemic species of flora include the [[Banat peony]], [[steppe peony]], [[Pančić wormwood]], [[bulrush]] and [[dwarf-steppe almond]]. Twenty different species of [[Orchidaceae]] grow in this area. Rare [[fauna]] include the [[mole rat]], [[steppe polecat]], [[desert ant]] and [[steppe gerbil]]. The main source of food for some endangered birds of prey, such as the [[saker falcon]], [[eastern imperial eagle]] and [[lesser spotted eagle]], are [[ground squirrel]]s that live in large open grass fields; hence such areas are necessary for their survival. Other noted animals are the [[wolf]], [[deer]], [[roe deer]] and [[boar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.serbia.travel/nature/nature-reserves/deliblato-sands/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930222515/http://www.serbia.travel/nature/nature-reserves/deliblato-sands/ |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The Serbian cult movie "''[[Who's Singin' Over There?]]''" (''Ko to tamo peva'', [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] ''Ко то тамо пева'') was mainly shot at the Deliblato Sands.

The ''' ''Earth Negotiations Bulletin'' ''' ''('''ENB''')'' is a periodic internet news publication covering negotiations, workshops and conferences on a variety of subjects in environmental policy and international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chasek|first1=Pamela S.|title=NGOs and State Capacity in International Environmental Negotiations: The Experience of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin|journal=Review of European Community and International Environmental Law|volume=10|issue=2|year=2001|pages=168–176|issn=0962-8797|doi=10.1111/1467-9388.00273}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published daily in print and online forms, and with email, Facebook and Twitter feeds, during [[conference of the parties|conferences of the parties]] to [[multilateral environmental agreement]]s; and is a publication of the Reporting Services division of the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]. The publication and division are based in New York City.

== History ==

During the 1992 [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in Rio de Janeiro, a small group of environmental journalists published a daily bulletin describing the proceedings. The publication caught the attention of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, a sustainability think tank based in Winnipeg, Canada, which proposed that a team be assembled to provide ongoing coverage of follow-up meetings and processes launched in Rio.

== Personnel ==
Bulletins for each workshop or conference are written and edited by a small team of consultants selected from several dozen located around the world, drawn primarily from academia and international affairs.  Many writers join the team while in graduate school and eventually move on to careers in international organizations.  Conversely, retired career diplomats from the United States, Russia and China have also brought their experience to the team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisd.ca/about/team/ Current ENB Team], IISD Reporting Services&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisd.ca/about/team/former-enb.html Former ENB Team], IISD Reporting Services&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coverage ==

The ''ENB'' covers a range of topics in sustainability.  Core coverage areas include:

* [[Sustainable Development]], including the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]]
* [[Biodiversity]] and [[Wildlife]], including the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]], [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]], [[Convention on Migratory Species]], and [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]] (formerly the [[International Mechanism of Scientific Expertise on Biodiversity]])
* Chemicals Management, including the [[Basel Convention]], [[Rotterdam Convention]] and [[Stockholm Convention]]
* [[Climate]] and [[Atmosphere]], including the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and [[Montreal Protocol]]
* [[Forests]], [[Deserts]] and [[Land (disambiguation)|Land]], including the [[United Nations Forum on Forests]], [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] Council, and [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] Committee on Forestry
* [[Developmental psychology|Human Development]], including [[UN-HABITAT]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26863">{{Geodesy}}
A '''geodetic datum''' or '''geodetic system''' is a [[coordinate system]], and a set of reference points, used to locate places on the [[Earth]] (or similar objects).  An approximate definition of [[sea level]] is the datum [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]], an [[reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], whereas a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), using at least 2,159 [[spherical harmonics]]. Other datums are defined for other areas or at other times; [[ED50]] was defined in 1950 over Europe and differs from WGS 84 by a few hundred meters depending on where in Europe you look. 
[[Mars]] has no [[oceans]] and so no sea level, but at least two [[Geography of Mars#Zero elevation|martian datums]] have been used to locate places there.

Datums are used in [[geodesy]], [[navigation]], and [[surveying]] by [[cartographer]]s and [[satellite navigation system]]s to translate positions indicated on [[map]]s (paper or digital) to their real position on [[Earth]]. Each starts with an [[ellipsoid]] (stretched sphere), and then defines [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[altitude]] coordinates.  One or more locations on the Earth's surface are chosen as anchor "base-points".

The difference in co-ordinates between datums is commonly referred to as ''datum shift''. The datum shift between two particular datums can vary from one place to another within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands). The [[North Pole]], [[South Pole]] and [[Equator]] will be in different positions on different datums, so [[True North]] will be slightly different. Different datums use different interpolations for the precise shape and size of the Earth ([[reference ellipsoid]]s).

Because the Earth is an imperfect ellipsoid, localised datums can give a more accurate representation of the area of coverage than WGS 84. [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB36]], for example, is a better approximation to the [[geoid]] covering the British Isles than the global WGS 84 ellipsoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|title=Geoid—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054013/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the benefits of a global system outweigh the greater accuracy, the global WGS 84 datum is becoming increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|title=Datums—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202052131/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums  measure elevations or depths.

== Definition ==

In [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]], a ''datum'' is a reference system or an approximation of the Earth's surface against which positional measurements are made for computing locations. Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums are used to measure elevations or underwater depths.

=== Horizontal datum ===
The horizontal datum is the model used to measure positions on the Earth. A specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates, depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of local horizontal datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The [[WGS 84]] datum, which is almost identical to the [[NAD83]] datum used in North America and the [[ETRS89]] datum used in Europe, is a common standard datum.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

For example, in Sydney there is a 200 metres (700&amp;nbsp;feet) difference between GPS coordinates configured in GDA (based on global standard WGS 84) and AGD (used for most local maps), which is an unacceptably large error for some applications, such as [[surveying]] or site location for [[scuba diving]].&lt;ref&gt;McFadyen, [http://www.michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 GPS and Diving] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819064902/http://michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical datum ===
{{further|Chart datum}}

[[File:Vertical references in Europe.svg|thumbnail|Vertical datums in Europe]]
A vertical datum is used as a reference point for [[elevation]]s of surfaces and features on the Earth including terrain, bathymetry, water levels, and man-made structures. Vertical datums are either: tidal, based on [[sea level]]s; gravimetric, based on a [[geoid]]; or geodetic, based on the same ellipsoid models of the Earth used for computing horizontal datums.

In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above [[sea level]], although what “sea level” actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, [[tide]]s, topography, and even differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of mountains etc.

For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is [[mean sea level]] (MSL).  This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard “sea level” for all mapping and surveying in that country.  (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at [[Newlyn]] in [[Cornwall]] between 1915 and 1921).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, zero elevation as defined by one country is not the same as zero elevation defined by another (because MSL is not the same everywhere), which is why locally defined vertical datums differ from one another.

A different principle is used when choosing a datum for [[nautical charts]].  For safety reasons, a mariner must be able to know the minimum depth of water that could occur at any point.  For this reason, depths and tides on a nautical chart are measured relative to [[chart datum]], which is defined to be a level below which tide rarely falls.  Exactly how this is chosen depends on the tidal regime in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is Lowest Astronomical Tide (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges.

Conversely, if a ship is to safely pass under a low bridge or overhead power cable, the mariner must know the minimum clearance between the masthead and the obstruction, which will occur at high tide.  Consequently, bridge clearances etc. are given relative to a datum based on high tide, such as Highest Astronomical Tide or Mean High Water Springs.

Sea level does not remain constant throughout [[geological time]], and so tidal datums are less useful when studying very long-term processes. In some situations sea level does not apply at all — for instance for [[Geography of Mars|mapping Mars' surface]] — forcing the use of a different "zero elevation", such as mean radius.

A geodetic vertical datum takes some specific zero point, and computes elevations based on the geodetic model being used, without further reference to sea levels. Usually, the starting reference point is a tide gauge, so at that point the geodetic and tidal datums might match, but due to sea level variations, the two scales may not match elsewhere.  An example of a gravity-based geodetic datum is [[NAVD88]], used in North America, which is referenced to a point in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].  Ellipsoid-based datums such as [[WGS 84]], [[GRS80]] or [[NAD83]] use a theoretical surface that may differ significantly from the [[geoid]].

== Geodetic coordinates ==
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Coordinates}}
[[File:Geocentric vs geodetic latitude.svg|thumb|right|300px|The same position on a [[spheroid]] has a different angle for latitude depending on whether the angle is measured from the normal line segment ''CP'' of the [[ellipsoid]] (angle ''α'') or the line segment ''AP'' from the center (angle ''β''). Note that the "[[flatness]]" of the spheroid (orange) in the image is greater than that of the Earth; as a result, the corresponding difference between the "geodetic" and "geocentric" latitudes is also exaggerated.]]

In geodetic coordinates, the Earth's surface is approximated by an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and locations near the surface are described in terms of [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), [[longitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), and height (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref group="footnotes"&gt;About the right/left-handed order of the coordinates, i.e., &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\phi, \lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, see [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geodetic versus geocentric latitude ===
Geodetic [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), resp. [[altitude]], is different from geocentric latitude (&lt;math&gt;\phi'&lt;/math&gt;), resp. altitude. Geodetic latitude is determined by the angle between the [[equator]]ial plane and [[surface normal|normal]] to the ellipsoid, whereas geocentric latitude is determined by the angle between the equatorial plane and line joining the point to the centre of the ellipsoid (see figure). Unless otherwise specified, latitude is geodetic latitude.

== Earth reference ellipsoid ==

=== Defining and derived parameters ===
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Ellipsoid parameters}}

The ellipsoid is completely parameterised by the semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the flattening &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{f}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

From &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to derive the semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, first eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and second eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt; of the ellipsoid

|-
| Second eccentricity squared
| &lt;math&gt;{e'}^2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2} - 1 = \frac{f(2 - f)}{(1 - f)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Conversion calculations ==
{{further|Geographic coordinate conversion}}

Datum conversion is the process of converting the coordinates of a point from one datum system to another. Datum conversion may frequently be accompanied by a change of [[Map projection|grid projection]].

== Reference datums ==
{{see also|Reference ellipsoid}}

A reference datum is a known and constant surface which is used to describe the location of unknown points on the Earth. Since reference datums can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed reference datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common reference Datums in use in [[North America]] are NAD27, NAD83, and [[WGS 84]].

The [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD 27) is "the horizontal control datum for the United States that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with origin at (the survey station) [[Meades Ranch Triangulation Station|Meades Ranch (Kansas)]]." ... The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero, as sufficient gravity data was not available, and this was needed to relate surface measurements to the datum. "Geodetic positions on the North American Datum of 1927 were derived from the (coordinates of and an azimuth at Meades Ranch) through a readjustment of the triangulation of the entire network in which Laplace azimuths were introduced, and the Bowie method was used." (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatDatum )  NAD27 is a local referencing system covering North America.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) is "The horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America, based on a geocentric origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980 ([[GRS80]]). "This datum, designated as NAD 83 ...is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin." NAD83 may be considered a local referencing system.

WGS 84 is the [[World Geodetic System]] of 1984. It is the reference frame used by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) and is defined by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency, then the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). WGS 84 is used by DoD for all its mapping, charting, surveying, and navigation needs, including its [[GPS]] "broadcast" and "precise" orbits. WGS 84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite surveying techniques. It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) beginning January 23, 1987. At 0000 GMT January 2, 1994, WGS 84 was upgraded in accuracy using GPS measurements. The formal name then became WGS 84 (G730), since the upgrade date coincided with the start of GPS Week 730. It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994. At 0000 GMT September 30, 1996 (the start of GPS Week 873), WGS 84 was redefined again and was more closely aligned with [[International Earth Rotation Service]] (IERS) frame [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] 94. It was then formally called WGS 84 (G873). WGS 84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|title=National Geodetic Survey - Frequently Asked Questions FAQ|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Geodetic|last=Survey|date=|website=www.ngs.noaa.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019024226/https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|archivedate=2011-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another update brought it to WGS84(G1674).

The WGS 84 datum, within two meters of the NAD83 datum used in North America, is the only world referencing system in place today. WGS 84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.

Users of GPS are cautioned that they must always check the datum of the maps they are using. To correctly enter, display, and to store map related map coordinates, the datum of the map must be entered into the GPS map datum field.

'''[[Kuwait]]''' is situated in [[Southwest Asia]], bordering the [[Persian Gulf]], between [[Iraq]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. A prosperous trade center for many centuries, Kuwait came to greater international prominence in the post-[[World War II]] era largely because of its strategic location at the head of the Persian Gulf and [[petroleum|oil]] revenues.

Since 2006, Kuwait has been partially governed by [[Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] and his designated successor, [[Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]], the Prime Minister and Crown Prince. In the postwar period, these men have supported the strengthening of democratic participation in decision making, as provided for in the [[Constitution of Kuwait|Constitution]].

Kuwait is located at the far northwestern corner of the Persian Gulf. Kuwait is 17,820 square kilometres in size. At its most distant points, it is about 200 kilometres north to south, and 170 kilometres east to west. Kuwait is mostly desert.

==Boundaries==
[[File:Kuwait pol 06.jpg|thumb|450px|A map of Kuwait.]]

As previously mentioned, Kuwait borders the [[Persian Gulf]] with 195 kilometers of coast. Within its territory are nine islands, two of which, [[Bubiyan]] (the largest) and [[Warbah Island|Warbah]], are largely uninhabited but strategically important. Due to the Iraq-Kuwait war (see [[Invasion of Kuwait]]), many people left their homes on islands, like [[Faylakah]] but ((Faylakah)) Is now old by China for protection reasons, and have since not returned to their homes.

Kuwait's most prominent geographic feature is Kuwait Bay ([[Kuwait Bay|Jun al Kuwayt]]), which indents the shoreline for about forty kilometers, providing natural protection for the port of Kuwait, and accounts for nearly one half the country's shoreline.

To the south and west, Kuwait shares a long border of 250 kilometers with [[Saudi Arabia]]. The boundary between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia was set by the Treaty of Al Uqayr in 1922, which also established the [[Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone]] of 5,700 square kilometers between the two nations. In 1966, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia agreed to divide the neutral zone; the partitioning agreement making each country responsible for administration in its portion was signed in December 1969. The resources in the area, now known as the Divided Zone, are not affected by the agreement. The oil from onshore and offshore fields continues to be shared equally between the two countries.

The third side of the triangle-shaped nation is the 240 kilometers of historically contested border between Kuwait and Iraq. Although the Iraqi government, which had first asserted a claim to rule Kuwait in 1938, recognized the borders with Kuwait in 1963 (based on agreements made earlier in the century), it continued to press Kuwait for control over Bubiyan and Warbah islands through the 1960s and 1970s. 

In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and, shortly thereafter, formally incorporated the entire country into Iraq. Under [[United Nations]] (UN) Security Council Resolution 687, after the restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty in 1991, a UN commission undertook formal demarcation of the borders on the basis of those agreed to in 1963. The boundary was demarcated in 1992, but Iraq refuses to accept the commission's findings.

Recent events from 2008 to the present day have seen the positive advancement of maritime border relations with Iraq with the development of the Khawr Abd Allah (KAA) Protocols. The non-legally binding KAA Protocols were developed and mediated between the heads of the Kuwaiti and Iraqi navies by Major David Hammond Royal Marines, the British naval lawyer and legal advisor to [[Combined Task Force 158]]. This included the production of the KAA Interoperability Admiralty Chart by Major Hammond and which was subsequently distributed to both countries, having been produced by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office.

In November 2008, the KAA Protocols were historically signed at Kuwait Naval Base having been verbally agreed on board {{HMS|Chatham|F87}} in May 2008. The signing meeting saw the first formal meeting of the heads of respective navies since before the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. Subsequently, the success of the non-legally binding protocols was reported to the US Congress on January 9, 2009 in the Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq Report. However big however small let me be part of it all

[[Image:Kuwait.A2003106.0805.250m.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dust storm over Kuwait and Southern Iraq, April 16, 2003]]
Kuwait has an arid climate. Kuwait has a huge temperature difference between winter and summer. [[Rainfall]] in the nation varies from {{convert|75|to|150|mm|in|2|sp=us}} a [[year]]. Actual rainfall has ranged from {{convert|120|mm|in|2|sp=us}} a year to as much as {{convert|600|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. In [[summer]], average daily high [[temperatures]] range from {{convert|42|to|48|°C|°F}}; the highest ever temperature recorded in Kuwait was {{convert|54.0|°C}} at [[Mitribah]] on 21 July, 2016 which is the highest recorded temperature in Asia and also the third highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upgraded HWRF and GFDL Hurricane Models Excelled During Hurricane Arthur |url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html |website=Weather Underground |publisher=Dr. Jeff Masters |accessdate=13 July 2014 |location=USA |date=11 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117064246/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitribah temperatures until mid 2010 were affected by overexposure conditions and the [[Weather station|station]] was later fixed.

The summers are quite long, punctuated mainly by dramatic [[dust storms]] in March and April when northwesterly winds cover the cities in sand. In the late summer, which is more humid. By the end of October all of the hot weather is over, and colder winter weather sets in, dropping temperatures to as low as {{convert|-6|°C}} at night. On the other hand, daytime temperature is between {{convert|10|-|17|°C|°F}}. In this time, there are brief but strong [[thunderstorms]]. Frost occurs when the temperatures drop below {{convert|5|°C}}. 

Kuwait's winter is colder than in other [[Persian Gulf]] countries, such as [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]] or [[United Arab Emirates]]. Kuwait experiences colder weather because it is situated farther north, and because of cold [[winds]] blowing from upper [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]]. In Kuwait, [[precipitation]] usually occurs from October until April (mostly in November).

'''Henricus Martellus Germanus''' is the [[latinized name]] of '''Heinrich Hammer''' ({{lang-it|Enrico Martello}}), a [[Geography|geographer]] and [[cartographer]] from [[Nuremberg]] who lived and worked in [[Florence]] from 1480 to 1496.

Between around 1489 and 1491, he produced at least one world map which is remarkably similar to the terrestrial [[globe]] produced by [[Martin Behaim]] around 1492, the ''[[Erdapfel]]''. Both show novel adaptions of the existing [[Ptolemy's Geography|Ptolemaic]] model, opening a passage south of Africa and creating [[Dragon's Tail (peninsula)|an enormous new peninsula]] east of the [[Golden Chersonese]] ([[Malay Peninsula|Malaysia]]). Both possibly derive from maps created around 1485 in Lisbon by [[Bartolomeo Columbus]].{{citation required|date=August 2015}}

Martellus’ map served as an inspiration for the [[Waldseemüller map]] of 1507. The overall layout was similar, and [[Martin Waldseemüller]] used the same projection as Martellus, the pseudo-cordiform projection. Both cartographers added decorative wind-heads in the borders of their maps, and both also took advantage of the extra space in the lower corners of the maps created by the swooping lines of the projection to add text blocks in those corners. The shape of northern Africa is the same on both maps, that is, it is Ptolemaic with a sharp northwestern corner. The shape of eastern Asia is similar on the two maps, with a huge peninsula jutting southwestward into the Indian Ocean, and Japan is in precisely the same position on the two maps, at the eastern edge.&lt;ref&gt;Chet Van Duzer, “Waldseemüller's World Maps of 1507 and 1516: Sources and Development”, ''The Portolan,'' No.1, Winter 2012, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martellus also produced an ''Insularium Illustratum'' ("Illustrated Book of Islands") of which four manuscripts are extant, plus one draft in [[Biblioteca Laurentiana]]. It contains an illustrated description of islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], mostly copied from a previous work by [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]], plus maps from other islands, several regional maps and a [[world map]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bouloux|first1=Nathalie|title=L'Insularium Illustratum d'Henricus Martellus|journal=The Historical Review / La Revue Historique|date=2012|volume=IX|pages=77-94|url=http://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/historicalReview/article/view/4071/3857|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been identified with an Arrigho di Federigho who authored the first translation into [[German (language)|German]] of Bocaccio's ''[[Decamerone]]''. According to this theory, the surname Martellus would come from the Martelli family, to which Henricus / Arrigho was linked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsozkult.de/publicationreview/id/rezbuecher-8568 Rezension von L. Böninger: Die deutsche Einwanderung nach Florenz] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:BO''' is the entry for the [[Bolivia|Plurinational State of Bolivia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Bolivia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[departments of Bolivia|9 departments]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BO}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. The second part is a letter, currently used in [[vehicle registration plates of Bolivia|vehicle registration plates]].

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

Subdivision names are sorted in traditional [[Spanish alphabet]]ical order: a-c, ch, d-l, ll, m-n, ñ, o-z.

'''ISO 3166-2:GN''' is the entry for [[Guinea]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Guinea, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[regions of Guinea|7 administrative regions and 1 governorate]]
* [[prefectures of Guinea|33 prefectures]]

The governorate [[Conakry]] is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the administrative regions.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GN}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Guinea. The second part is either of the following:
* one letter: administrative regions and governorate
* two letters: prefectures

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''Johannes "Jan" Kip''' (1652/53, [[Amsterdam]] – 1722, [[Westminster]]) was a Dutch draftsman, [[engraving|engraver]] and print dealer. Together with [[Leonard Knyff]], he made a speciality of engraved views of [[English country house]]s.

==Life==
Kip was a pupil of Bastiaen Stopendaal (1636–1707), from 1668 to 1670, before setting up on his own; his earliest dated engravings are from 1672. In April 1680, at the age of 27, he married Elisabeth Breda in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/44448 Johannes Kip] at the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; After producing works for the court of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] in [[Amsterdam]], Kip followed William and Mary to London and settled in [[St John Street, London|St. John Street]] in [[Farringdon, London|Farringdon]], where he conducted a thriving printselling business. He also worked for various London publishers producing engravings after such artists as [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow]] (c. 1626–1704) and [[Caius Gabriel Cibber]] (1630–1700), largely for book illustrations. He made several engraved plates for [[Awnsham Churchill|Awnsham]] &amp; John Churchill's ''A Collection of Voyages &amp; Travels'' (first published 1704). He signed the African scenes in volume V of the 1732 edition as "J. Kip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johannes Kip Engravings|url=http://mazzaforte.com/JohannesKipEngravings.html|publisher=mazzaforte.com|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most important works were the large fold-out folio illustrations for ''[[Britannia Illustrata]]'', 1708; for the 65 folio plates he engraved for the antiquary Sir [[Robert Atkyns (topographer)|Robert Atkyns]], ''The Ancient and Present State of Glostershire,'' 1712 (1st edition); and for ''Le Nouveau Théâtre de la Grande Bretagne ou description exacte des palais de la Reine, et des Maisons les plus considerables des des Seigneurs &amp; des Gentilshommes de la Grande Bretagne,'' 1715, an extended reprint in collaboration with other artists.

==Partnership with Leonard Knyff==

[[File:An engraving of Chevening by Johannes Kip (d.1722) after Thomas Badeslade (d.1742), published (in History of Kent) 1719 by John Harris.jpg|thumb|Kip's engraving of [[Chevening]] published in 1719.]]
The linked careers of Jan Kip and [[Leonard Knyff]] made a specialty of engraved views of [[English country house]]s, represented in detail from the bird's-eye view, a pictorial convention for [[topography]]. Their major work was ''Britannia Illustrata: Or Views of Several of the Queens Palaces, as Also of the Principal seats of the Nobility and Gentry of Great Britain, Curiously Engraven on 80 Copper Plates,'' London (1707, published in the winter of 1708–9). The volume is among the most important English topographical publications of the 18th century. [[Architecture]] is rendered with care, and the settings of [[parterre]]s and radiating [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] driven through woods or planted across fields, garden paths, gates and toolsheds are illustrated in detail. The images are staffed with figures and horses, coaches pulling into forecourts, water-craft on rivers, in line with the traditions of the [[Netherlands|Low Countries]]. Some of the plates are in the [[Siena|Siennese]] "map perspective".

'''José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez''' (20 November 1737 – 2 February 1799&lt;ref name="Elem"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.elem.mx/autor/datos/107001 |title=José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez |encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de la literatura en México |publisher=Secretary of Culture, Government of Mexico |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a priest in [[New Spain]], scientist, historian, cartographer, and journalist.&lt;ref&gt;J. Benedict Warren, "An Introductory Survey of Secular Writings in the European Tradition on Colonial Middle America, 1503-1818, item 97, "José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez, (1737-96)" in Handbook of Middle American Indians, vol. 13. Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, Howard F. Cline, volume editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Ozumba]] in 1737, the child of Felipe de Alzate and María Josefa Ramírez, a descendant of [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]]. He studied in the Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City, graduating as a bachelor in theology in 1756.&lt;ref name="gob"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edomex.gob.mx/principales |title=José Antonio Alzate |language=es |publisher=Government of the State of Mexico |access-date=2018-11-19 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A priest from the age of 20,&lt;ref name="larramendi"&gt;"[http://www.larramendi.es/Poligrafos/jose_antonio_alzate_ramirez.htm Jose Antonio de Alzate and Ramirez] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117040623/http://www.larramendi.es/Poligrafos/jose_antonio_alzate_ramirez.htm |date=2006-01-17 |df=dmy-all }}". ''Biblioteca Virtual Ignacio Larramendi: Colección de Polígrafos Hispanoamericanos''. Fundación Ignacio Larramendi. URL accessed 2006-09-27. {{Es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also a corresponding member of the French and Spanish academies of science, and one of the earliest trustworthy observers of Mexican [[meteorology]]. He attained a high reputation as a zoologist and botanist, and his researches led the way for modern exploration of Mexican antiquities. He published the ''Gaceta de Literatura'', and an essay titled ''La limite des niéges perpetuelles en Volcan Popocatepetl.''

The natural sciences, physics, astronomy and mathematics were for him subjects that deserved great attention. He conducted several scientific experiments, and wrote numerous articles that were published in science journals.&lt;ref name="larramendi"/&gt;

Inaugurated in 1768, his ''Diario literario de Méjico'' [Literary Newspaper of Mexico] was suspended after only three months. He later created, in 1788, the ''Gaceta de Literatura'' [Newspaper of Literature], that was published until 1795 (115 issues).&lt;ref name="larramendi"/&gt; This periodical inspired many of his countrymen to follow his example.&lt;ref name="ngb"&gt;{{Cite Newgenbio |title=Alzate, Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; His account of [[Xochicalco]] was the first published description of these interesting ruins.&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{CatholicEncyclopedia|wstitle=José Antonio Alzate |volume=1 |first=Adolph Francis Alphonse |last=Bandelier |prescript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than thirty treatises on various subjects are due to his pen.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; Among other works, he wrote ''Observaciones meteorológicas'' [Weather observations] (1769), ''Observación del paso de Venus por el disco del Sol'' [Observation of the passage of Venus by the disc of the Sun] (1770), ''Modelo y descripción de los hornos de Almadén'' [Model and description of the furnaces of Almadén], notes, additions and maps for the ''Historia Antigua de México'' [Ancient History of Mexico], written by [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]], and a ''Mapa de la América del Norte'' [Map of North America].&lt;ref name="larramendi"/&gt;

Astronomy, physics, meteorology, antiquities, and metallurgy, were among the topics on which he wrote, but he also devoted serious attention to certain industries. Thus the growing of [[silk]] in Mexico was the subject of several of his papers. He wrote a dissertation on the use of [[ammonia]] in combating [[mephitic]] gases in abandoned [[Mining|mine]]s, and also prepared maps of [[New Spain]] (Mexico).&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; In 1772, he published work that showed that the well-known psychedelic effects of [[pipiltzintzintli]] were due to natural causes and not the work of the [[devil]] (''Memoria del uso que hacen los indios de los pipiltzintzintlis''; México, D.F.: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México).&lt;ref&gt;Brad Richard Huber, Alan R. Sandstrom. ''Mesoamerican Healers''. University of Texas Press. {{ISBN|0-292-73456-5}}. p 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He was frequently opposed, even reviled, at home, but the [[French Academy of Sciences]] made him a corresponding member, and the [[viceroy]]s of Mexico and the [[archbishop]]s entrusted him with sundry scientific missions.&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt;

He was a member of the [[Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid|Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid]].&lt;ref name="larramendi"/&gt; He died in [[Mexico City]] in 1799.&lt;ref name="Elem"/&gt;

In his honor, the Sociedad Científica Antonio Alzate [Antonio Alzate Scientific Society] was created in 1884. In 1935, this society became the [[Mexican Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="larramendi"/&gt; A dam and reservoir are named in his honor in the State of Mexico, north of [[Toluca]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?fid=45 Opportunities and Challenges for Sustainable Urban Water Management in Mexico City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902144818/http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?fid=45 |date=2006-09-02 }}.

The [[Isle of Man]] is a self-governing [[crown dependencies|crown dependency]] in the [[Irish Sea]] between [[England]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[head of state]] is [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], who holds the title of [[Lord of Mann]]. The Lord of Mann is represented by a [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|lieutenant governor]]. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.

The Isle of Man is a low-tax economy with no [[capital gains tax]], [[wealth tax]], [[stamp duty]], or [[inheritance tax]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/iomfinance/tax/directtax.xml|title=Financial Services Sector - Isle of Man.

[[Offshore bank]]ing, manufacturing, and tourism form key sectors of the economy. Agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, now make declining contributions to the island's [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP).

'''Martuni District''' was one of the five ([[raion]]s) or administrative districts of the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] (AzSSR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elibrary.az/docs/azerbaijan/rus/gl2.pdf Управление делами Президента Азербайджанской Республики. Административно-территориальное деление.]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the parliament of the newly established Republic of [[Azerbaijan]] abolished passed the [[Law on Abolishment of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] which had the effect of also abolishing Martuni District. The district's territory was incorporated into the neighbouring [[Azerbaijan]]i [[Khojavend District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%85%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C/ Большая Советская Энциклопедия. Нагорно-Карабахская автономная область]&lt;/ref&gt;
This abolition was not recognised by the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]. Today, the majority of Martuni District is under the ''de facto'' control of the [[Artsakh Defense Army]]. The [[Republic of Artsakh]] has renamed the district as [[Martuni Province]] and has added some territory land captured during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] to the province. The eastern part of Martuni District remains in Azerbaijani control.

[[File:Commonwealth of Nations.svg|thumb|right|350px|Current Commonwealth members (dark blue), former members (orange), and [[British Overseas Territories]] and Crown Dependencies (light blue)]]
The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] is a [[voluntary association]] of 53 sovereign states. Nearly all of them are former [[British colony|British colonies]] or dependencies of those colonies.

No one government in the Commonwealth exercises power over the others, as is the case in a [[political union]]. Rather, the Commonwealth is an [[international organization|international organisation]] in which countries with diverse social, political, and economic backgrounds are regarded as equal in status, and cooperate within a framework of common values and goals, as outlined in the [[Singapore Declaration]] issued in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/FAQs/20706/faqs|title=FAQs|accessdate=16 June 2008|publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514162902/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/FAQs/20706/faqs/|archivedate=14 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such common values and goals include the promotion of [[democracy]], [[human rights]], [[good governance]], the [[rule of law]], [[individual liberty]], [[egalitarianism]], [[free trade]], [[multilateralism]], and [[world peace]], which are promoted through multilateral projects and meetings, such as the [[Commonwealth Games]], held once every four years.&lt;ref name="Singapore Declaration text"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/32987/singapore_declaration_of_commonwealth_principles|title=Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles 1971|accessdate=12 June 2008|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511174313/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/32987/singapore_declaration_of_commonwealth_principles/|archivedate=11 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol of this free association is [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], who serves as the [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. This position, however, does not imbue her with any political or executive power over any Commonwealth member states; the position is purely symbolic, and it is the [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]] who is the chief executive of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth |title=Head of the Commonwealth |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930063803/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/150757/head_of_the_commonwealth/ |archivedate=30 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commonwealth was first officially formed in 1931 when the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] gave legal recognition to the sovereignty of dominions. Known as the "British Commonwealth", the original members were the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Irish Free State]], and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], although Australia and New Zealand did not adopt the statute until 1942 and 1947 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealth-of-nations.org/article.php?&amp;id=4&amp;subsection=3&amp;page=3|title=The Commonwealth–History–Dominion Status|accessdate=16 June 2008|publisher=Commonwealth of Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the [[London Declaration]] was signed and marked the birth of the modern Commonwealth and the adoption of its present name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/34493/38150/modern_commonwealth|title=The Commonwealth–History–Modern Commonwealth|accessdate=16 June 2008|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511161917/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/34493/38150/modern_commonwealth/|archivedate=11 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest member is [[Rwanda]], which joined on 29 November 2009.&lt;ref name="rwanda"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/world/africa/29rwanda.html|title=Rwanda Joins British Commonwealth|author=Josh Kron|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=29 November 2009|accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent departure was the [[Maldives]], which severed its connection with the Commonwealth on 13 October 2016.

As of April 2017, of the states that are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, three are in [[Europe]], twelve in [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], one in [[South America]], nineteen in [[Africa]], seven in [[Asia]], and eleven in [[Oceania]]. There are seven former members, four of which no longer exist as independent entities (but form part of current member states). The members have a combined population of 2.4 billion, almost a third of the world population, of whom 1.21 billion live in India, and 95% live in Asia and Africa combined.&lt;ref name="CIA World Factbook population"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html|title=Country Comparisons – Population|accessdate=22 March 2009|date=19 March 2009|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently sixteen of the member states are [[Commonwealth realm]]s, with the [[Head of the Commonwealth]] as their head of state. Five others are [[monarchy|monarchies]] with their own individual monarchs ([[Brunei]], [[Eswatini]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tonga]]) and the rest are republics. [[Republic of Ireland]] (from 1949 according to the Commonwealth; 1936 according to Irish government), [[Zimbabwe]] (2003), and [[Maldives]] (2016) are former members of the Commonwealth. [[South Africa]], [[Pakistan]] and [[The Gambia]] left and later rejoined the Commonwealth.

Nonetheless, the Queen could still exercise any of her powers with respect to the State if she was "personally present" in the State.&lt;ref&gt;There is no equivalent provision as to the Commonwealth. However, for both the Commonwealth and the States, constitutional convention effectively excludes the monarch from any personal exercise of governmental power. The 1986 proclamation was an exception, approved by Australian ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian''. 13 October 2016. ''"The Maldives has announced it will leave the Commonwealth after mounting pressure from the 53-nation group over corruption and deteriorating human rights in the Indian Ocean state. The country’s government, which has been fending off rumours of an impending coup and allegations of money laundering, said the decision on Thursday to cancel its membership was 'difficult but inevitable'. Its foreign ministry said in a statement it had been treated 'unjustly and unfairly' by the organisation’s Commonwealth ministerial action group (CMAG), which has been scrutinising the government since the former president, Mohamed Nasheed, was ousted in 2012 in what his supporters say was a coup. 'The CMAG and the Commonwealth secretariat seem to be convinced that the Maldives, because of the high and favourable reputation that the country enjoys internationally, and also perhaps because it is a small state that lacks material power, would be an easy object that can be used,' the statement said. It added that it was being targeted 'in the name of democracy promotion, to increase the [Commonwealth’s] own relevance and leverage in international politics'."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The cabinet of [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] has announced that the Maldives is to return to its status as a [[Commonwealth republic]]&lt;ref&gt;https://presidency.gov.mv/presidentNews/news/10346&lt;/ref&gt;

|In recent years, under the presidency of [[Robert Mugabe]], Zimbabwe has dominated Commonwealth affairs, creating acrimonious splits in the organisation.  Zimbabwe was suspended in 2002 for breaching the [[Harare Declaration]].  In 2003, when the Commonwealth refused to lift the suspension, Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth.  Since then, the Commonwealth has played a major part in trying to end the political impasse and return Zimbabwe to a state of normality.

The '''United Nations member states''' are the {{UNnum}} [[sovereign state]]s that are members of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and have equal representation in the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unms/whatisms.shtml| title=What are Member States?| publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN is the world's largest [[intergovernmental organization]].

{{Anchor|Membership terms}}
The criteria for admission of new members to the UN are set out in [[Chapter II of the United Nations Charter|Chapter II]], Article 4 of the [[UN Charter]]:&lt;ref name="charter ch2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-ii/index.html |title=Charter of the United Nations, Chapter II: Membership |publisher=United Nations|date=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Membership in the United Nations is open to all peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgement of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations.
# The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].

A recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the council's fifteen members, with none of the five [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] using their [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]]. The Security Council's recommendation must then be approved in the General Assembly by a two-thirds majority vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/member-states/about-un-membership/index.html |title=About UN Membership |publisher=United Nations|date=2015-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, only [[sovereign state]]s can become UN members, and currently all UN members are sovereign states. Although five members were not sovereign when they joined the UN, all subsequently became fully independent between 1946 and 1991. Because a state can only be admitted to membership in the UN by the approval of the Security Council and the General Assembly, [[List of states with limited recognition|a number of states that are considered sovereign]] according to the [[Montevideo Convention]] are not members of the UN. This is because the UN does not consider them to possess [[sovereignty]], mainly due to the lack of [[diplomatic recognition|international recognition]] or due to opposition from one of the permanent members.

In addition to the member states, the UN also invites non-member states to become [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observers at the UN General Assembly]] (currently two: the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]), allowing them to participate and speak in General Assembly meetings, but not vote. Observers are generally [[intergovernmental organization]]s and international organizations and entities whose statehood or sovereignty is not precisely defined.

{{Further|History of the United Nations}}

The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]] by the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] (the [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) and a majority of the other signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/history/history-united-nations/index.html |title=History of the United Nations |publisher=United Nations |date=2015-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 51 original members (or founding members) joined that year; 50 of them signed the Charter at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] in [[San Francisco]] on 26 June 1945, while [[Poland]], which was not represented at the conference, signed it on 15 October 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unms/founders.shtml| title=Founding Member States| publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=originalmembers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=I-1&amp;chapter=1&amp;clang=_en|title=
CHAPTER I – CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE|accessdate=2015-10-07|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original members of the United Nations were: [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]], the [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Vargas Era|Brazil]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]], [[Canada]], [[Presidential Republic (1925–73)|Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|Cuba]], [[Third Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[El Salvador]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[British Raj|India]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Liberia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Mexico]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=originalmembers/&gt;

Among the original members, 49 are either still UN members or had their memberships in the UN continued by a [[succession of states|successor state]] ''(see table below)''; for example, the membership of the [[Soviet Union]] was continued by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] after its dissolution ''(see the section [[#Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Former members: Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]])''. The other two original members, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (i.e., the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), had been dissolved and their memberships in the UN not continued from 1992 by any one successor state ''(see the sections [[#Czechoslovakia|Former members: Czechoslovakia]] and [[#Yugoslavia|Former members: Yugoslavia]])''.&lt;ref name=originalmembers/&gt;

At the time of UN's founding, the [[China and the United Nations|seat of China in the UN]] was held by the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], but as a result of [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]] in 1971, it is now held by the [[China|People's Republic of China]] ''(see the section [[#Republic of China (Taiwan)|Former members: Republic of China (Taiwan)]])''.

A number of the original members were not sovereign when they joined the UN, and only gained full independence later:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/world45.pdf| title=The World in 1945| publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Belarus]] (then the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]) and [[Ukraine]] (then the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]) were both [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republics of the Soviet Union]], until gaining full independence in 1991.
* [[India]] (whose territory at that time, before the [[Partition of India]], also included the present-day territories of [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]]) was under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]], until gaining full independence in 1947.
* The [[Philippines]] (then the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]]) was a [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth with the United States]], until gaining full independence in 1946.
* [[New Zealand]], while ''de facto'' sovereign at that time, "only gained full capacity to enter into relations with other states in 1947 when it passed the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|Statute of Westminster Adoption Act]]. This occurred 16 years after the British Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster Act]] in 1931 that recognised New Zealand's autonomy. If judged by the Montevideo Convention criteria, New Zealand did not achieve full ''de jure'' statehood until 1947."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/ParlSupport/ResearchPapers/9/1/8/00PLLawRP07041-New-Zealand-sovereignty-1857-1907-1947-or-1987.htm| title=New Zealand Sovereignty: 1857, 1907, 1947, or 1987?| date=August 2007| publisher=New Zealand Parliament| author=John Wilson| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522195038/http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/ParlSupport/ResearchPapers/9/1/8/00PLLawRP07041-New-Zealand-sovereignty-1857-1907-1947-or-1987.htm| archivedate=22 May 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current members and their dates of admission are listed below with their official designations used by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml| title=Current Member States| publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://protocol.un.org/dgacm/pls/site.nsf/files/BB306/$FILE/bb306.pdf| title=Blue Book "Permanent Missions to the United Nations No.&amp;nbsp;306"| date=June 2016 |publisher=United Nations| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabetical order by the member states' official designations is used to determine the seating arrangement of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] sessions, where a draw is held each year to select a member state as the starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=15263&amp;Cr=general&amp;Cr1=assembly| title=Thailand's name picked to set seating arrangement for General Assembly session| date=2 August 2005| publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members use their full official names in their official designations and thus are sorted out of order from their common names: the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]], [[Republic of Macedonia|The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] (a provisional reference used for all purposes within the UN, and listed under T), and the [[Tanzania|United Republic of Tanzania]].

On 16 September 2011, the UN General Assembly awarded the UN seat to the [[National Transitional Council]], thereby restoring the original name of Libya.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:China map.png|alt=A map of East Asia highlighting the Chinese states|thumb|Areas controlled by the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China]]

The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, and as set out by the [[United Nations Charter]], [[Chapter V of the United Nations Charter|Chapter V]], Article 23, became one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name="charter ch5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-v/index.html |title=Charter of the United Nations, Chapter V: The Security Council |publisher=United Nations|date=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[Kuomintang]]-led ROC government lost effective control of [[mainland China]] and relocated to the [[island of Taiwan]], and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]-led government of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), declared on 1 October 1949, took control of mainland China. The UN was notified on 18 November 1949 of the formation of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China]]; however, the [[Government of the Republic of China]] continued to represent China at the UN, despite the small size of the ROC's jurisdiction of [[List of islands of the Republic of China|Taiwan and a number of smaller islands]] compared to the PRC's jurisdiction of mainland China. As both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of China, proposals to effect a change in the representation of China in the UN were discussed but rejected for the next two decades, as the ROC was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the [[One-China policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/20-taiwan-un-winkler|title=Taiwan's UN Dilemma: To Be or Not To Be|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|first=Sigrid|last=Winkler|date=June 2012|accessdate=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count. On 25 October 1971, the 21st time the [[United Nations General Assembly]] debated on the PRC's admission into the UN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/Red-China-Admitted-to-UN/12295509436546-3/| title=1971 Year in Review: Red China Admitted to UN| agency=United Press International| year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]] was adopted, by which it recognized that "the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations and that the People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council," and decided "to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-2758(XXVI) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=26 |resolution_number=2758 |highlight=rect_485,223_914,684 |page=1 |accessdate=2016-04-24|date=25 October 1971|title=Restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively transferred the seat of China in the UN, including its permanent seat on the Security Council, from the ROC to the PRC, and expelled the ROC from the UN. From the United Nations' perspective the "Republic of China" is not a former member. No UN member was expelled in 1971. Rather, the credentials of one Chinese delegation (from Taipei) were rejected and the credentials of another Chinese delegation (from Beijing) were accepted.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In addition to losing its seat in the UN, the UN Secretary-General concluded from the resolution that the General Assembly considered Taiwan to be a province of China. Consequently, the Secretary-General decided that it was not permitted for the ROC to become a party to treaties deposited with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/publications/FC/English.pdf|title=FINAL CLAUSES OF MULTILATERAL TREATIES|year=2003|accessdate=2016-04-25|publisher=United Nations|quote=Hence, instruments received from the Taiwan Province of China will not be accepted by the Secretary-General in his capacity as depositary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the ROC began campaigning to rejoin the UN separately from the People's Republic of China.

proposals recommended admitting the ROC with parallel representation over China, along with the People's Republic of China, pending eventual reunification, citing examples of other divided countries which had become separate UN member states, such as [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] and [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. Later proposals emphasized that the ROC was a separate state, over which the PRC had no effective sovereignty. These proposed resolutions referred to the ROC under a variety of names: "Republic of China in Taiwan" (1993–94), "Republic of China on Taiwan" (1995–97, 1999–2002), "Republic of China" (1998), "Republic of China (Taiwan)" (2003) and "Taiwan" (2004–06).

However, all fourteen attempts were unsuccessful as the General Assembly's General Committee declined to put the issue on the Assembly's agenda for debate, under strong opposition from the PRC.&lt;ref name=europers&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLcDLDQsgy0C|title=European Perspectives on Taiwan|first1=Jens|last1=Damm|first2=Paul|last2=Lim|year=2012|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|pages=160–63|quote=By mid 2009, 16 applications for membership on behalf of Taiwan had been sent to the UN, but, in each of these cases, the General Assembly's General Committee, which sets the Assembly's agenda, decided against even raising the question during the Assembly's session.|isbn=9783531943039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] stated that:
{{Quote|The position of the United Nations is that the People's Republic of China is representing the whole of China as the sole and legitimate representative Government of China.

Responding to the UN's rejection of its application, the ROC government has stated that Taiwan is not now nor has it ever been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that since General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not clarify the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN, it does not prevent Taiwan's participation in the UN as an independent sovereign nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.tw/webapp/ct.asp?xItem=26680&amp;ctNode=1028&amp;mp=6|title=Talking points for Taiwan's UN Membership Application|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109022444/http://www.mofa.gov.tw/webapp/ct.asp?xItem=26680&amp;ctNode=1028&amp;mp=6|archivedate=9 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC government also criticized Ban for asserting that Taiwan is part of China and returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mofa.gov.tw/webapp/ct.asp?xItem=26682&amp;ctNode=1028&amp;mp=6| title=President Chen Shui-bian's Letters to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and UN Security Council President Wang Guangya on 31 July (Office of the President)| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904110812/http://www.mofa.gov.tw/webapp/ct.asp?xItem=26682&amp;ctNode=1028&amp;mp=6| archivedate=4 September 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to UN's standard procedure (Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council, Chapter X, Rule 59).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/about/rules/ |title=Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the PRC government, which has stated that Taiwan is part of China and firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN either as a member or an observer, praised that UN's decision "was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly, and showed the UN and its member states' universal adherence to the [[One-China policy|one-China principle]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-07/24/content_6425429.htm| title=China praises UN's rejection of Taiwan's application for membership| agency=Xinhua News Agency| date=24 July 2007| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111170303/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-07/24/content_6425429.htm| archivedate=11 January 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of UN member states put forward a draft resolution for that fall's UN General Assembly calling on the Security Council to consider the application.&lt;ref name="A/62/193"/&gt;

This was the ROC's first participation in an event organized by a [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|UN-affiliated agency]] since 1971, as a result of the improved [[cross-strait relations]] since [[Ma Ying-jeou]] became the [[President of the Republic of China]] a year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/05/18/Taiwan-attends-WHA-as-observer/UPI-68411242697115/|title=Taiwan attends WHA as observer|agency=United Press International| date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czechoslovakia===
[[Czechoslovakia]] joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, with its name changed to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 20 April 1990. Upon the imminent [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], in a letter dated 10 December 1992, its Permanent Representative informed the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] that the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic would cease to exist on 31 December 1992 and that the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], as successor states, would apply for membership in the UN. Neither state sought sole successor state status.

===German Democratic Republic===
Both the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (West Germany) and the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) were admitted to the UN on 18 September 1973. Through the [[German reunification|accession of the East German federal states to the Federal Republic of Germany]], effective from 3 October 1990, the territory of the German Democratic Republic became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, today simply known as ''Germany''. Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany continued being a member of the UN while the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist.&lt;ref name="yearbook" /&gt;

===Federation of Malaya===
The [[Federation of Malaya]] joined the United Nations on 17 September 1957. On 16 September 1963, its name was changed to '''[[Malaysia]]''', following the formation of Malaysia from [[Singapore]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] (now [[Sabah]]), [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and the [[Federation of Malaya]]. Singapore became an independent State on 9 August 1965 and a Member of the United Nations on 21 September 1965.

===Tanganyika and Zanzibar===
[[Tanganyika]] was admitted to the UN on 14 December 1961, and [[People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba|Zanzibar]] was admitted to the UN on 16 December 1963. Following the ratification on 26 April 1964 of the Articles of Union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar, the two states merged to form the single member "United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar", with its name changed to the [[Tanzania|United Republic of Tanzania]] on 1 November 1964.&lt;ref name="yearbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="growth" /&gt;

The [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, and as set out by the [[United Nations Charter]], [[Chapter V of the United Nations Charter|Chapter V]], Article 23, became one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name="charter ch5" /&gt; Upon the imminent [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]], in a letter dated 24 December 1991, [[Boris Yeltsin]], the [[President of Russia|President of the Russian Federation]], informed the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] that the membership of the USSR in the Security Council and all other UN organs was being continued by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] with the support of the 11 member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].&lt;ref name="yearbook" /&gt;

The other fourteen independent states established from the former Soviet Republics were all admitted to the UN:
* The [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] joined the UN on 24 October 1945 together with the USSR. After declaring independence, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic changed its name to [[Ukraine]] on 24 August 1991, and on 19 September 1991, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic informed the UN that it had changed its name to [[Belarus]].
* [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] were admitted to the UN on 17 September 1991, after [[State continuity of the Baltic states|regaining independence]] before the dissolution of the USSR.
* [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] were admitted to the UN on 2 March 1992.
* [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was admitted to the UN on 31 July 1992.

Both [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] joined the UN as original members on 24 October 1945. Following a plebiscite on 21 February 1958, the [[United Arab Republic]] was established by a union of Egypt and Syria and continued as a single member. On 13 October 1961, Syria, having resumed its status as an independent state, resumed its separate membership in the UN. Egypt continued as a UN member under the name of the United Arab Republic, until it reverted to its original name on 2 September 1971. Syria changed its name to the Syrian Arab Republic on 14 September 1971.&lt;ref name="yearbook" /&gt;

===Yemen and Democratic Yemen===
[[North Yemen|Yemen]] (i.e., North Yemen) was admitted to the UN on 30 September 1947; [[South Yemen|Southern Yemen]] (i.e., South Yemen) was admitted to the UN on 14 December 1967, with its name changed to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen on 30 November 1970, and was later referred to as Democratic Yemen. On 22 May 1990, [[Yemeni unification|the two states merged]] to form the Republic of Yemen, which continued as a single member under the name [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="yearbook" /&gt;

The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], referred to as Yugoslavia, joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945. By 1992, it had been effectively [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolved]] into five independent states, which were all subsequently admitted to the UN:

* [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] was admitted to the UN on 8 April 1993, being provisionally referred to for all purposes within the UN as "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" pending settlement of the [[Macedonia naming dispute|difference that had arisen over its name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Paul| last=Lewis |title=U.N.

==Suspension, expulsion, and withdrawal of members==
{{See also|Withdrawal from the United Nations}}

A member state may be suspended or expelled from the UN, according to the [[United Nations Charter]]. From [[Chapter II of the United Nations Charter|Chapter II]], Article 5:&lt;ref name="charter ch2" /&gt;
{{Quote|
A Member of the United Nations against which preventive or enforcement action has been taken by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] may be suspended from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] upon the recommendation of the Security Council. The exercise of these rights and privileges may be restored by the Security Council.
}}

From Article 6:&lt;ref name="charter ch2" /&gt;
{{Quote|
A Member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.
}}

Since its inception, no member state has been suspended or expelled from the UN under Articles 5 and 6. However, in a few cases, states were suspended or expelled from participating in UN activities by means other than Articles 5 and 6:
* On 25 October 1971, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]] was adopted, which recognized the [[China|People's Republic of China]] instead of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (since 1949 controlling only Taiwan) as the legitimate representative of China in the UN and effectively expelled the Republic of China from the UN in 1971 ''(see the section [[#Republic of China|Former members: Republic of China]])''. This act did not constitute as the expulsion of a member state under Article 6, as this would have required Security Council approval and been subjected to [[United Nations Security Council veto power|vetoes]] by its permanent members, which included the Republic of China itself and the United States, which at that time still recognized the Republic of China.&lt;ref name="bolton"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/new-directions-for-the-chen-administration-on-taiwanese-representation-in-the-united-nations/ |title=New Directions for the Chen Administration on Taiwanese Representation in the United Nations |date=1 July 2000 |author=[[John R. Bolton]] |journal=China Affairs Quarterly |volume=1 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 1974, the Security Council considered a draft resolution that would have recommended that the General Assembly immediately expel South Africa from the UN, in compliance with Article 6 of the United Nations Charter, due to [[Apartheid in South Africa|its apartheid policies]].&lt;ref name="yearbook" /&gt; However, the resolution was not adopted because of vetoes by three permanent members of the Security Council: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In response, the General Assembly decided to suspend South Africa from participation in the work of the Assembly's 29th session on 12 November 1974; however, South Africa was not formally suspended under Article 5. The suspension lasted until the General Assembly welcomed South Africa back to full participation in the UN on 23 June 1994, following its successful democratic [[South African general election, 1994|elections earlier that year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N94/278/46/PDF/N9427846.pdf?OpenElement| title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/48/258| publisher=United Nations| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924221014/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N94/278/46/PDF/N9427846.pdf?OpenElement| archivedate=24 September 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 28 April 1992, the new [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was established, by the remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 22 September 1992, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1 was adopted, by which it considered that "the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations," and therefore decided that "the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly". It did not apply for membership until [[Slobodan Milošević]] was ousted from the presidency and was admitted on 1 November 2000 ''(see the section [[#Yugoslavia|Former members: Yugoslavia]])''.

===Withdrawal of Indonesia (1965–1966)===
{{Main|CONEFO}}
[[File:Soekarno.jpg|alt=A black-and-white three-quarters view of Sukarno's face|upright|thumb|Indonesian president [[Sukarno]]'s decision to withdraw from the United Nations in 1965 is the only instance of a withdrawal of membership in UN history. [[Indonesia]] rejoined the UN a year later.]]

Since the inception of the UN, only one member state (excluding those that dissolved or merged with other member states) has unilaterally withdrawn from the UN. During the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]], and in response to the election of [[Malaysia]] as a [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council]], in a letter dated 20 January 1965, [[Indonesia]] informed the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] that it had decided "at this stage and under the present circumstances" to withdraw from the UN. However, following the overthrow of [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]], in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision "to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly". On 28 September 1966, the United Nations General Assembly took note of the decision of the Government of Indonesia and the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|President]] invited the representatives of that country to take their seats in the Assembly.&lt;ref name="yearbook" /&gt;

Unlike suspension and expulsion, no express provision is made in the United Nations Charter of whether or how a member can legally withdraw from the UN (largely to prevent the threat of withdrawal from being used as a form of political blackmail, or to evade obligations under the Charter, similar to withdrawals that weakened the UN's predecessor, the [[League of Nations]]),&lt;ref name="bolton" /&gt; or on whether a request for readmission by a withdrawn member should be treated the same as an application for membership, i.e., requiring Security Council as well as General Assembly approval. Indonesia's return to the UN would suggest that this is not required; however, scholars have argued that the course of action taken by the General Assembly was not in accordance with the Charter from a legal point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Eroding the United Nations Charter| year=1993| last=Blum| first=Yehuda Zvi| publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| isbn=978-0-7923-2069-2| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39qvWCYWo5QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4193">'''Nicolae Culianu''' (August 28, 1832 – November 28, 1915) was a [[Moldavia]]n, later [[Romania]]n mathematician and astronomer.

A native of [[Iași]], he enrolled in the [[University of Paris]] after graduating from ''[[Academia Mihăileană]]'' in 1855, and earned his undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1860. He remained there until 1863, performing research at the [[Paris Observatory]].&lt;ref name="ieseni"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ciprian Teodorescu, [http://bjiasi.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ACADEMICIENI-IESENI.pdf ''Academicieni ieșeni''], p. 124, at the Gheorghe Asachi Iași County library site&lt;/ref&gt; Initially a high school teacher,&lt;ref name="o307"&gt;Ornea, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; he later joined the astronomy and geodesy faculty of [[Iași University]],&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oc"/&gt; where he served as dean of the sciences faculty, and from 1880 to 1898 as rector.&lt;ref name="oc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d"&gt;Diaconu, pp. 129–30&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of [[Titu Maiorescu]], a member of the ''[[Junimea]]'' movement that the latter led, and involved in the educational reform movement it promoted. As such, he was among the founders of a private high school in Iași, to which he donated a group of buildings.&lt;ref name="oc"/&gt; While active in ''Junimea'', his renowned affability and venerable bearing earned him the nickname "Papa Culiano".&lt;ref name="o307"/&gt; He was elected a corresponding [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=C Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped found the Iași astronomical observatory for the use of students and teachers, and published textbooks on mathematics and geodesy.&lt;ref name="oc"/&gt; He was among the founders ''[[Recreații Științifice]]'', the country's first scientific periodical addressed to young people and to a generalist audience.&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d"/&gt; Briefly involved in politics, he was vice president of the [[Romanian Senate]] during the fourth [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|conservative]] government of [[Lascăr Catargiu]] (1892–1896).&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oc"&gt;{{ro icon}} Tereza Culianu-Petrescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/O-biografie*articleID_989-articles_details.html "O biografie"], ''Observator Cultural'', nr. 87, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Culianu's textbooks include an 1870 one on differential and integral calculus, the first published Romanian-language course on mathematical analysis; and ones on elementary algebra (1872), applied geometry (1874), plane and spherical trigonometry (1875), cosmography (1893), plane trigonometry (1894) and high-school cosmography (1895).&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt; He was buried in [[Eternitatea cemetery]].&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{ro icon}} Temistocle Bîrsan, [http://www.recreatiimatematice.ro/arhiva/miscelannea/RM12011CLIMESCU.pdf "Restaurarea mormântului lui C.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}
'''Nicolas de Nicolay''', Sieur d'Arfeville &amp; de Belair, (1517–1583) of the [[Nicolay (family)]] was a French geographer.

==Biography==
Born at [[la Grave]] in Oisans, in the [[Dauphiné]], he left France in 1542 to participate in the siege of [[Perpignan]] which was then held by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of Austria.

In 1547 he sailed to Scotland where his intervention ended the [[siege of St Andrews Castle]]. In 1548 he returned to Scotland to take away [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] from [[Dumbarton Castle]], sailing around the west coast of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;E. Bonnar, 'The recovery of St. Andrews Castle in 1547, French diplomacy in the British Isles', in ''English Historical Review'', (June 1996), 578–598&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled around Germany, Denmark, England, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Greece and Turkey and served in the armies of most of these countries. On his return to France, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] made him Geographer Ordinary and Valet to the Chamber.

Around this time, he appears to have made a terrestrial globe that provided the model for the Oterschaden globe of c.1600.

In 1551, Henry II ordered him to follow [[Gabriel d'Aramon]], envoy and ambassador to the Grand Turk [[Suleyman the Magnificent|Suleiman the Magnificent]]. In the course of the voyage, his unofficial mission was to survey the places visited, including [[Istanbul]]. It has been suggested that one of his objectives was to spy for the French crown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1583, he died in [[Soissons]], where he was Commissioner of artillery, after a stay at the royal castle of [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]].

== ''Quatre premiers livres des navigations'' ==

Published in 1598, [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rosenwald.1207 ''Quatre premiers livres des navigations''] (''Travels in Turkey)'' recorded Nicolay's observations about the Ottoman court and peoples from his 1551 mission to [[Istanbul]] on behalf of the French government. The book served as the first comprehensive survey of customs and costumes in the Ottoman world, and is hailed as one of the earliest and most accurate depictions of the Islamic world to appear in Europe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brafman|first=David|date=2009|title=Facing East: The Western View of Islam in Nicolas de Nicolay's "Travels in Turkey"|url=|journal=Getty Research Journal|volume=1|pages=153–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Travels in Turkey'' achieved a high level of commercial success upon its release. It was later reissued and translated for a number of different countries, including [[Italy]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[England]], and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mukerji|first=Chandra|date=2013|title=Costume and Character in the Ottoman Empire: Dress as Social Agent in Nicolay's Navigations|url=|journal=Early modern things: objects and their histories, 1500-1800|volume=|pages=151–169|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread popularity of the book contributed to the proliferation of costume books throughout Europe at the end of the 16th century, and continued to influence [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] artists well into the 19th century such as [[Eugène Delacroix|Eugene Delacroix]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]].

''Travels in Turkey'' is divided in four books, following Nicolay's voyage to [[Istanbul]], accounts of ethnic groups and Ottoman court life, and the religious and military administration in Istanbul.  Louis Danet made 60 engravings based on Nicolay's original drawings, which serve as the core of the books, and each print is followed by a caption, describing Islamic ritual, religion and monuments. The images cover all aspects of Ottoman daily life, and depict figures ranging from [[sultan]]s and sultanas to wrestlers, cooks and [[Janissaries|Janissary]] generals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The images are typical of costume books, and consist of lone figures, depicted on a very sparse background, which emphasizes the dress of the figure, rather than geography. In the costume book, figures are schematized and follow general types, and Brafman writes that "Nicolay, or his engravers, render facial expressions in an exaggerated style. Emotional reaction are evoked artistically, whether it be identification with a mother, sympathy for a Christian slave, or fascination with exotic and 'monstrous' alien practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brafman|first=David|date=2009|title=Facing East: The Western View of Islam in Nicolas de Nicolay's "Travels in Turkey"|url=|journal=Getty Research Journal|volume=1|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

OKATO's purpose is organization of information about structure of the administrative divisions of the [[federal subjects of Russia]].

The document assigns numeric codes to each administrative division of the country, which are hierarchically structured from the [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] level down to [[selsoviet]] level; an expanded version also includes listings of individual [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|inhabited localities]] within each administrative division.

OKATO is used for statistical and tax purposes.  It was adopted on July 31, 1995, replacing SOATO (''Designation System of Objects of Administrative Division of the Union of SSR and the Union Republics, as well as Inhabited Localities''). It went into effect on January&amp;nbsp;1, 1997 and as of 2014 underwent 243&amp;nbsp;revisions. The compilation and maintenance of the OKATO data are the responsibility of the [[Federal State Statistics Service]] (''Rosstat'') of Russia.

'''Owain Jones''' [[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society|FGS]] (born 1957, [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Wales) is a Professor of Environmental Humanities at [[Bath Spa University]] (UK). He was previously [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Cultural Geography: Place, Nature and Landscape  (previously Senior Research Fellow) at the Countryside &amp; Community Research Institute (which is a joint Institute of the Universities of the [[West of England University|West of England]] and [[University of Gloucestershire|Gloucestershire]] and the [[Royal Agricultural College]] and [[Hartpury College]]) and member of staff of the Department of Geography and Environmental Management, Faculty of Environment and Technology, University of the West of England.

He works mainly in [[cultural geography]] and has published a number of peer-reviewed research articles in international [[geography]] and related [[social science]] journals. He has two main areas of research and writing interests; geographies of nature-culture and [[children's geographies]]. Within the former he focuses upon [[animal geographies]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones O., (2008)  '"The Restraint of Beasts": rurality, animality, actor network theory and dwelling', in P. Cloke (ed.)

== Biography ==
Jones undertook a BA in 3D Design/Construction at [[Bristol Polytechnic]], graduating in 1981, an MA /Postgraduate Diploma in Environmental Policy and Geography, [[University of the West of England]], 1993, MSc. in Society and Space, [[University of Bristol]], 1993, MA in Creative Writing, BSUC, 2004 and completed his PhD in the Dept of Geography, [[University of Bristol]] in 1997. He has conducted research variously funded by the [[ESRC]], [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]], and [[RCUK]] (RELU). He has also written on geography, [[non-representational theory]] and pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones O., (2008) 'Stepping from the Wreckage: Non-representational theory and the promise of pragmatism’ in special issue on Pragmatism and Geography, [[Geoforum]], edited by N. Wood and S. Smith, Geoforum, 39, 1600–1612&lt;/ref&gt; and geography and memory.&lt;ref&gt;Jones O., (2005) 'An Emotional Ecology of Memory, Self and Landscape', in J. Davidson, L. Bondi and M. Smith (eds.) Emotional Geographies, Oxford, [[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]], pp 205–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

His work is of significance in the area of geographies nature-culture. That is – a view of nature-society relations which seeks to understand the interdependency between the human and non-human world. This draws upon, and contributes to, a range of theories including Actor Network Theory (ANT);&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Latour]] (1993) ''We Have Never Been Modern''. Hemel Hempstead: Harvester/Wheatsheaf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[dwelling]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Ingold]] (2000). ''The Perception of the Environment. Essays in Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hybridity]];&lt;ref&gt;Whatmore, S. (2002). Hybrid Geographies: Natures, Cultures, Spaces. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; new [[dialectics]];&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Braun, (2006). ''Towards a new earth and a new humanity: nature, ontology, politics'', In N. Castree and D. Gregory (eds), [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]]. A Critical Reader.

London: Sage. {{ISBN|1412903610}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and new ecologies.

The importance of his work is reflected in the selection of an extract from the book "''Tree Cultures: The Place of Trees, and Trees in their Place'',&lt;ref&gt;Jones O., and Cloke P., (2002) ''Tree Cultures: The Place of Trees, and Trees in their Place'', Oxford: Berg, 252pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  for the “Nature” section of ''The Cultural Geography Reader'' edited by Oakes and Price.&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Oakes and P. L. Price (eds) ''The Cultural Geography Reader'', London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This extract sits alongside other seminal writings on nature by [[Raymond Williams]], [[Clarence J. Glacken]], [[Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)|Alexander Wilson]] and others. Because of his work in this field, Owain Jones was selected to write the "Nature-Culture"&lt;ref&gt;Jones O. (2008). ''Nature-Cultures'' in R. Kitchen and N. Thrift (eds.), ''International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography'', London: [[Elsevier]], vol 7: 309–323.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Dwelling"&lt;ref&gt;Jones O., 2008 ''Dwelling'' in R. Kitchen and N. Thrift (eds.), ''International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography'', London: [[Elsevier]], vol 3: 266–272.&lt;/ref&gt; entries for the ''International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kitchen and N. Thrift (eds.) (2009). ''International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography'', London: [[Elsevier]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Owain Jones's influential 1995 paper on discourses of [[rurality]]&lt;ref&gt;Jones O., (1995) "Lay Discourses of the Rural: Developments and Implications for Rural Studies", ''Journal of Rural Studies'', 11, 1, pp 35–49.&lt;/ref&gt; has been recently republished as part of the ''Journal of Rural Studies''' 25th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/S06_343.cws_home/vsijrurstud_rurality
&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also been an invited speaker at a number of major international academic conferences on rurality,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campoadentro.es/en/conferencia_internacional&lt;/ref&gt; [[human-animal interactions]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uio.no/forskning/tverrfak/kultrans/aktuelt/konferanser/sentient-creatures/&lt;/ref&gt; and geographies of forests, places and landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/INFD-7RXCB4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of children's geographies Owain Jones has pioneered the idea of the "otherness of children".&lt;ref&gt;Jones O., (2008) “True geography [ ] quickly forgotten, giving away to an adult-imagined universe. Approaching the otherness of childhood". ''Children's Geographies'', 8, 2, pp 195–212..&lt;/ref&gt; This has been taken up by other academics such as Karen Lury.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Lury (2010) ''The Child in Film''. I. B. Tarus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owain Jones is also founder and Chair of Priston Festival, a community art and music festival near the city of [[Bath, Somerset]], south west England.

* [[Barlavento Islands|Barlavento]] (meaning literally [[Windward]]), including [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]], [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]], [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]], [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]] and [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]], in the northern side.

In addition to the historical regions, the islands can also be divided by geographical features, resulting in:
* A group of dry, very flat, and geologically old islands (Sal, Boa Vista and Maio), lying to the east and closer to the African coast (which makes them a target for sand from the [[Sahara desert]], resulting in long sandy beaches, typically used for beach tourism), and
* A group of rocky, volcanic, agricultural islands more to the west. Their [[orography]] is rougher because they're geologically newer, and the westernmost islands (such as Santo Antão) tend to be the most mountainous.

'''Reserva Ecologica Taricaya''' is a private nature reserve located in the [[Peruvian Amazon]] along the [[Madre de Dios River]], a major tributary to the [[Amazon River]].  Since 2004, it has been under the ownership of Projects Abroad, a profit company based in Great Britain with volunteer programs in over 20 countries.  
[[Puerto Maldonado]], the nearest city and capital of the Madre de Dios department of Peru, is located approximately one hour away by boat ride.

Captain '''Richard Spratly''' (1802–1870) was a British sea captain and contributor to navigational records, after whom the [[Spratly Islands]] in the [[West Philippine Sea]] are named.

==Early life==
Richard Spratly was born on 22 January 1802 in the parish of All Saints, [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], East London. His father, Thomas, is described on his birth certificate as a boatbuilder. His mother was Ann née Myers. He was the second of four children (Mary Ann born 25 December 1799), Jane (born 15 December 1812) and William (born 18 March 1815).

==Early voyages==
1818, 6 June – Spratly first sails as an apprentice on ''Earl of Marley'' (possibly ''Earl Morley'', a [[whaler]])&lt;br /&gt;
1824,	June –  Spratly sails as 2nd officer on ''Marquis of Huntley'', a convict ship&lt;br /&gt;
1832,	1 September – [[Convict ship]] [[York (1819 ship)|''York'']], with Richard Spratly as captain, sails from Plymouth with 200 convicts on board.&lt;br /&gt;
1832,	29 December – Convict ship ''York'', with Richard Spratly as captain, arrives [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania)&lt;br /&gt;
1833,	20 October – {{ship||Cyrus|1800 whaler|2}}, under Captain Hingston, arrives [[Gravesend]] from the Southern Ocean. Owners were Jarvis and Co.&lt;br /&gt;
1834,	5 July – Richard Spratly replaces Hingston as master of ''Cyrus''&lt;br /&gt;
1837,	25 October – ''Cyrus'' arrives at Portsmouth from South Seas&lt;br /&gt;
1838,	(unknown) – ''Cyrus'' surveyed by Lloyds&lt;br /&gt;
1838,	June – ''Cyrus'' departs on a whaling voyage

In 1840, Richard Spratly was sailing past [[Manado]], on [[Sulawesi]].&lt;ref name="arcNorth"&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Mariners/2003-02/1045225780 RootsWeb: Mariners-L [Mar&amp;#93; Sydney Shipping Gazette – Murder of Hon. Erskine Murray]. Archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com (2003-02-14). Retrieved on 2009-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;  He became the witness to an attack by a local sultan on Erskine Murray's yacht ''Young Queen'', captained by Captain Hait, and the brig ''Anne'', captained by Captain Lewis.&lt;ref name="arcNorth" /&gt;  The account was documented in a letter to one Honorable E. Murray and published in the ''Sydney Shipping Gazette''.&lt;ref name="arcNorth" /&gt;

==Kema incident==
According to accounts by the crew, on 24 February 1844, ''Cyrus'' anchored at [[Kema Dstrict|Kema Roads]], [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], with a valuable cargo of whale oil. The next day the crew went ashore, but returned a few men short. Two men, Heron and Robson, were spotted and told to return but fled after they were confronted only to return later on the 28th. Crew members Howland and Heron went missing on 2 March. Finally on 3 March, after much searching and drunken antics by her crew on the Dutch occupied island, ''Cyrus'' sailed away to return to England, but without the missing crew members.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 13 September 1844&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to Great Britain in August 1844, the crew was summoned to a hearing by William Heron's mother. The incident had not been well documented and there was not enough evidence to suggest one way or the other if Captain Spratly was guilty of abandoning them without a thorough search, therefore no jury trial followed. The account given by the newspapers was starkly different from the crew's accounts recorded by the courts and gave more details of the course of events.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 September 1844&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to navigational knowledge==
Captain Spratly occasionally submitted navigational routes and survey information to ''[[The Nautical Magazine]]'' and the ''Naval Chronicles''.

The publication of his voyage in the Nautical Magazine and [[The Naval Chronicle]] popularized his naming of the island, even though the island had previously been named "Horsburgh's Storm Island" by Captain [[James Horsburgh]].&lt;ref name="marbrief" /&gt;  The [[British Admiralty]] finally agreed that the scattered islands in the area be named the [[Spratly Islands]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3023">[[Image:Sologne localization.jpg|thumb|270px|The Sologne in France]]
The '''Sologne''' {{IPA-fr|sɔlɔɲ|}} is a region of north-central [[France]] extending over portions of the [[departments of France|departements]] of [[Loiret]], [[Loir-et-Cher]] and [[Cher (department)|Cher]]. Its area is about {{convert|5000|km2|sqmi}}. To its north is the river [[Loire]], to its south the river [[Cher (river)|Cher]], while the districts of [[Sancerre]] and [[Berry (province)|Berry]] are to its east.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sologne |volume=25 |page=362 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name is thought to derive either from the [[Latin]] ''sœcalonia'' ("[[rye]] country") or ''sabulonia'' ("sandy country").

==Geography==
The Sologne is watered by the [[Cosson]] and the [[Beuvron (Loire)|Beuvron]], tributaries of the Loire, and the [[Sauldre]], a tributary of the Cher, all three having a west-south-westerly direction. The pools and marshes which are characteristic of the region are due to the impermeability of its soil, which is a mixture of sand and clay.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The main towns of Sologne are:
* [[Orléans]] (the most southern part of the city (La Source) and the university have been built in the woods of Sologne)
* [[Romorantin-Lanthenay]]
* [[La Ferté-Saint-Aubin]]
* [[Salbris]]
* [[Lamotte-Beuvron]]
* [[Aubigny-sur-Nère]]

==History==
In the middle of the 19th century [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] led the way in the reclamation of swamps, the planting of pines and other trees and other improvements. Arable farming and stock-raising are fairly flourishing in the Sologne, but there is little manufacturing activity, the cloth manufacture of [[Romorantin-Lanthenay|Romorantin]] being the chief industry. Game is abundant, and the region owes much of its revived prosperity to the creation of large sporting estates.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Cultural references==
In the early 18th century, [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] composed a famous harpsichord piece, ''Les Niais de Sologne'', whose name translates as "the simpletons of Sologne".  The form is a [[rondo]] with two episodes that are variations on the main section.  Despite the title (which may allude to the meandering melody throughout), its use of ornamentation denotes a work of great subtlety and sophistication.

The book ''[[Le Grand Meaulnes]]'' by [[Alain-Fournier]] is set in the region of Sologne and mentions several places, such as [[Bourges]], [[Vierzon]] and the [[Cher (river)|Cher]].  It is somewhere in this region where Meaulnes becomes lost and stumbles across the mysterious estate.

Many stories and essays of [[Maurice Genevoix]] are set in Sologne.

===UN World Heritage Site===

The [[Chateau de Chambord]] is situated in the region.

'''Syria Palaestina''' was a [[Roman province]] between 135 AD and about 390.&lt;ref name = "Lehmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811054625/http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/history.htm |archivedate=2009-08-11 &lt;!-- 054625 --&gt; |title=Palestine: History: 135–337: Syria Palaestina and the Tetrarchy |accessdate=2014-08-24 |last=Lehmann |first=Clayton Miles |date=Summer 1998 |work=The On-line Encyclopedia of the Roman Provinces |publisher=University of South Dakota}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by the merger of [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman Syria]] and [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judaea]], following the defeat of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE. Shortly after 193, the northern regions were split off as [[Syria Coele (Roman province)|Syria Coele]] in the north and [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]] in the south, and the province Syria Palaestina was reduced to Judea.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The earliest [[numismatic]] evidence for the name ''Syria Palaestina'' comes from the period of emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Background ==
{{further|Bar Kokhba revolt|Roman Syria|Judea (Roman province)}}

[[Roman Syria|Syria]] was an early [[Roman province]], annexed to the [[Roman Republic]] in 64 BCE by [[Pompey]] in the [[Third Mithridatic War]], following the defeat of [[Armenians|Armenian]] King [[Tigranes the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKK4ge9FD14C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=tigranes+jerusalem&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8k2jTYbRLcnDswasivX5AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tigranes&amp;f=false |title=Between Rome and Jerusalem: 300 years of Roman-Judaean relations|author=Martin Sicker |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the partition of the [[Herodian kingdom]] into tetrarchies in 6 CE, it was gradually absorbed into Roman provinces, with Roman Syria annexing [[Iturea and Trachonitis (tetrarchy)|Iturea and Trachonitis]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The [[Roman province]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] incorporated the regions of [[Judea]], [[Samaria]], and [[Idumea]], and extended over parts of the former regions of the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] and [[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] kingdoms of Israel. It was named after [[Herod Archelaus]]'s [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|Tetrarchy of Judea]], but the Roman province encompassed a much larger territory.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The capital of Roman Syria was established in [[Antioch]] from the very beginning of Roman rule, while the capital of the Judaea province was shifted to [[Caesarea Maritima]], which, according to historian [[H. H. Ben-Sasson]], had been the "administrative capital" of the region beginning in 6 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Jewish People'', [[H. H. Ben-Sasson]] editor, 1976, page 247: "When Judea was converted into a Roman province [in 6 AD, page 246], Jerusalem ceased to be the administrative capital of the country. The Romans moved the governmental residence and military headquarters to Caesarea. The centre of government was thus removed from Jerusalem, and the administration became increasingly based on inhabitants of the hellenistic cities (Sebaste, Caesarea and others)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Judea province was the scene of unrest at its founding in 6 CE during the [[Census of Quirinius]] and several wars were fought in its history, known as the [[Jewish–Roman wars]]. [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|The Temple was destroyed in 70 CE]] as part of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]] resulting in the institution of the [[Fiscus Judaicus]]. The Provinces of Judaea and Syria were key scenes of an increasing conflict between Judaean and Hellenistic population, which exploded into full scale Jewish–Roman wars, beginning with the [[Great Jewish Revolt]] of 66–70. Disturbances followed throughout the region during the [[Kitos War]] in 117–118. Between 132–135, [[Simon bar Kokhba]] led [[Bar Kokhba revolt|a revolt]] against the [[Roman Empire]], controlling parts of Judea but seemingly not Jerusalem, for three years. As a result, [[Hadrian]] sent [[Sextus Julius Severus]] to the region, who brutally crushed the revolt. Shortly before or after the [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] (132–135), the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian#Hadrian in Judea|Hadrian]] changed the name of the Judea province and merged it with Roman Syria to form ''Syria Palaestina'', while [[Jerusalem]] was renamed to ''[[Aelia Capitolina]]'', which certain scholars conclude was done in an attempt to remove the relationship of the Jewish people to the region.&lt;ref name="H.H. Ben-Sasson, 1976, page 334"&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}}, page 334: "In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria-Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lewin. ''The archaeology of Ancient Judea and Palestine''.  Getty Publications, 2005 p. 33. "It seems clear that by choosing a seemingly neutral name - one juxtaposing that of a neighboring province with the revived name of an ancient geographical entity (Palestine), already known from the writings of Herodotus - Hadrian was intending to suppress any connection between the Jewish people and that land." {{ISBN|0-89236-800-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]] suggested the name change preceded the revolt; he writes "Hadrian was in those parts in 129 and 130. He abolished the name of Jerusalem, refounding the place as a colony, Aelia Capitolina. That helped to provoke the rebellion. The supersession of the ethnical term  by the geographical may also reflect Hadrian's decided opinions about Jews." {{Cite journal| issn = 0075-4358| volume = 52| pages = 87–96| last = Syme| first = Ronald| title = The Wrong Marcius Turbo| journal = The Journal of Roman Studies| date = 1962| jstor = 297879}} (page 90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Only [[circumstantial evidence]] links [[Hadrian]] with the name change, and the precise date is not certain.&lt;ref name=F90&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|1990|p=19}}: "While it is true that there is no evidence as to precisely who changed the name of Judaea to Palestine and precisely when this was done, circumstantial evidence would seem to point to Hadrian himself, since he is, it would seem, responsible for a number of decrees that sought to crush the national and religious spirit of thejews, whether these decrees were responsible for the uprising or were the result of it. In the first place, he refounded Jerusalem as a Graeco-Roman city under the name of Aelia Capitolina. He also erected on the site of the Temple another temple to Zeus."&lt;/ref&gt; The common view that the name change was intended to "sever the connection of the Jews to their historical homeland" is disputed.{{sfn|Jacobson|2001|p=44-45|ps=: "Hadrian officially renamed Judea Syria Palaestina after his Roman armies suppressed the Bar-Kokhba Revolt (the Second Jewish Revolt) in 135 C.E.; this is commonly viewed as a move intended to sever the connection of the Jews to their historical homeland. However, that Jewish writers such as Philo, in particular, and Josephus, who flourished while Judea was still formally in existence, used the name Palestine for the Land of Israel in their Greek works, suggests that this interpretation of history is mistaken. Hadrian’s choice of Syria Palaestina may be more correctly seen as a rationalization of the name of the new province, in accordance with its area being far larger than geographical Judea. Indeed, Syria Palaestina had an ancient pedigree that was intimately linked with the area of greater Israel."}}

=== Consolidation ===
{{further|Name of Syria|Palestine (region)#Boundaries|Timeline of the name Palestine}}
After crushing the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] applied the name ''Syria Palestina'' to the entire region that had formerly included [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea province]]. Hadrian probably chose a name that revived the ancient name of [[Philistia]] (Palestine), combining it with that of the neighboring province of Syria, in an attempt to suppress Jewish connection to the land, although the actual [[Philistines]] from which the name derives had disappeared from history during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC).&lt;ref name="H.H. Ben-Sasson, 1976, page 334"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lewin. ''The Archaeology of Ancient Judea and Palestine''. Getty Publications, 2005 p. 33.

The capital of the enlarged province remained in Antiochia.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Mosaïque Phénix 03.JPG|thumb|250px|Roman mosaic from [[Antioch]]ia (detail) 2nd century, [[Louvre]]]]
In 193, the province of [[Syria-Coele (Roman province)|Syria-Coele]] was split from Syria Palaestina. In the 3rd century, Syrians even reached for imperial power, with the Severan dynasty. Syria was of crucial strategic importance during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Conflict with Sassanids and emergence of the Palmyrene Empire ===
Beginning in 212, Palmyra's trade diminished as the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] occupied the mouth of the [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]]. In 232, the Syrian Legion rebelled against the Roman Empire, but the uprising went unsuccessful.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

[[Odaenathus|Septimius Odaenathus]], a Prince of the [[Aramean]] state of [[Palmyra]], was appointed by [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] as the governor of the province of Syria Palaestina. After Valerian was captured by the Sassanids in 260, and died in captivity in [[Bishapur]], [[Odaenathus]] campaigned as far as [[Ctesiphon]] (near modern-day [[Baghdad]]) for revenge, invading the city twice. When Odaenathus was assassinated by his nephew Maconius, his wife [[Zenobia|Septimia Zenobia]] took power, ruling Palmyra on behalf of her son, [[Vabalathus]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Palmyra Julius Aurelius Zenobius inscription.jpg|thumb|Inscription honouring Julius Aurelius Zenobius, the father of [[Zenobia|Queen Zenobia]], at Palmyra.]]
Zenobia rebelled against Roman authority with the help of [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] and took over [[Bosra]] and lands as far to the west as [[Egypt]], establishing the short-lived [[Palmyrene Empire]]. Next, she took [[Antioch]] and large sections of Asia Minor to the north. In 272, the Roman Emperor [[Aurelian]] finally restored Roman control and Palmyra was besieged and sacked, never to recover her former glory. Aurelian captured Zenobia, bringing her back to Rome. He paraded her in golden chains in the presence of the senator Marcellus Petrus Nutenus, but allowed her to retire to a villa in [[Tivoli, Italy|Tibur]], where she took an active part in society for years. A legionary fortress was established in Palmyra and although no longer an important trade center, it nevertheless remained an important junction of Roman roads in the Syrian desert.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Isaac|Isaac (2000)]], p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diocletian]] built the [[Camp of Diocletian]] in the city of Palmyra to harbor even more legions and walled it in to try and save it from the Sassanid threat. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period following the Roman Empire only resulted in the building of a few churches; much of the city went to ruin.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Reorganization ===
In circa 390, Syria Palaestina was reorganised into the several administrative units: [[Palaestina Prima]], ''[[Palaestina Secunda]]'', and ''[[Palaestina Tertia]]'' (in the 6th century),&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Weathered by Miracles: A History of Palestine From Bonaparte and Muhammad Ali to Ben-Gurion and the Mufti|author=Thomas A.

All were included within the larger Eastern Roman (''Byzantine'') [[Diocese of the East]], together with the provinces of [[Isauria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]] (until 536), [[Euphratensis]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Osroene]], and  [[Arabia Petraea]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

[[Palaestina Prima]] consisted of [[Judea]], [[Samaria]], the [[Paralia (Palestine)|Paralia]], and [[Perea (Holy Land)|Peraea]], with the governor residing in [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]]. ''Palaestina Secunda'' consisted of the Galilee, the lower [[Jezreel Valley]], the regions east of Galilee, and the western part of the former [[Decapolis]], with the seat of government at [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]. ''Palaestina Tertia'' included the Negev, southern Transjordan part of Arabia, and most of [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], with [[Petra]] as the usual residence of the governor. Palestina Tertia was also known as Palaestina Salutaris.&lt;ref name=Salutaris&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Arabia|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2007-08-11|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-439113/Palaestina-Salutaris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Jewish–Roman wars]] (66–135), which [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] believed the [[Cenacle]] survived,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Jerusalem (A.D. 71-1099)]: "Epiphanius (died 403) says..."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Jerusalem in Christianity|significance of Jerusalem to Christians]] entered a period of decline, Jerusalem having been temporarily converted to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|pagan]] [[Aelia Capitolina]], but interest resumed again with the [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] of [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]] (the mother of Constantine the Great) to the [[Holy Land]] c. 326–28.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

New pagan cities were founded in Judea at [[Eleutheropolis]] ([[Bayt Jibrin]]), Diopolis ([[Lod|Lydd]]), and [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Nicopolis]] ([[Emmaus Nicopolis|Emmaus]]).&lt;ref name=Shahinp7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=palestineeb&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2007). Palestine. In Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2007. Retrieved on 2007-08-12 from [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-45053.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Temple in Judaism ===
{{see also|Second Temple Judaism}}
Second Temple Judaism is Judaism between the construction of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem, c. 515 BCE, and its [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction by the Romans in 70 CE]]. The [[development of the Hebrew Bible canon]], the [[synagogue]], Jewish [[Jewish eschatology|apocalyptic expectations for the future]], and Christianity, can all be traced to the [[Second Temple period]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Following the Jewish–Roman wars, many Jews left the country altogether for the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] communities, and large numbers of prisoners of war were sold as slaves throughout the Empire. This changed the perception of Jerusalem as the center of faith and autonomous Jewish communities shifted from centralized religious authority into more dispersed one.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Early Christianity ===
The Romans destroyed the Jewish community of the Church in Jerusalem, which had existed since the time of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Whealey, J. (2008) "Eusebius and the Jewish Authors: His Citation Technique in an Apologetic Context" (''Journal of Theological Studies''; Vol 59: 359-362)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2012}} Traditionally it is believed the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Christians]] waited out the [[Jewish–Roman wars]] in [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] in the [[Decapolis]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The line of [[Jewish bishops in Jerusalem]], which is claimed to have started with Jesus's brother [[James the Just|James the Righteous]]  as its first bishop, ceased to exist, within the Empire. Hans Kung in "Islam: Past Present and Future", suggests that the [[Jewish Christians]] sought refuge in Arabia and he quotes with approval Clemen et al.:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This produces the paradox of truly historic significance that while Jewish Christianity was swallowed up in the Christian church, it preserved itself in Islam."&lt;ref&gt;C. Clemen, T. Andrae and H.H. Schraeder, p.&amp;nbsp;342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christianity was practiced in secret and the [[Hellenization]] of Palaestina continued under [[Septimius Severus]] (193–211 AD).&lt;ref name = "Shahinp7"&gt;Shahin, Mariam (2005) ''Palestine: a Guide''. Interlink Books {{ISBN|1-56656-557-X}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
As a large province, the territory of Syria-Palaestina comprised the Levant and the western part of Mesopotamia. In Northern Levant, the mixed pagan population of [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Romans]] formed the majority, alongside later arriving migrant Ismaelite Arab societies of [[Itureans]] and later also Qahtanite [[Ghassanids]], who migrated to the area of [[Golantis]] in 4th century from what is today [[Yemen]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] were still populating  western Mesopotamia and indeed Mesopotamia as a whole, while nomad [[Arameans]], [[Nabateans]] and Bedouins, were thriving in the south Syrian Desert. In Southern Levant, until about 200 CE, and despite the genocide of [[Jewish–Roman wars]], Jews had formed a majority of the population.&lt;ref name="Publishing2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scholastic Library Publishing|title=Encyclopedia Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQXYAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=May 2006|publisher=Scholastic Library Pub.|isbn=978-0-7172-0139-6|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of the Byzantine period (disestablishment of Syria-Palaestina), the Jews had become a minority and were living alongside [[Samaritans]], pagan Greco-Syriacs and a large [[Syriac Christian]] community.&lt;ref name="BarnaviEliav-Feldon2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Élie Barnavi|author2=Miriam Eliav-Feldon|author3=Denis Charbit|title=A historical atlas of the Jewish people: from the time of the patriarchs to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrMUAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=2002|publisher=Schocken Books|isbn=978-0-8052-4226-3|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Geodesy}}
The '''United States National Grid''' (USNG) is a point reference system of grid references commonly used in the [[United States]].  It provides a nationally consistent language of location in a user friendly format.  It is similar in design to the [[national grid reference system]]s used throughout other nations.  The USNG was developed by the [[Federal Geographic Data Committee]].

==Overview==
The purpose of the USNG according to the FGDC, is to ''"create a more interoperable environment for developing [[location-based service]]s within the United States and to increase the interoperability of location services appliances with printed map products by establishing a nationally consistent grid reference system as the preferred grid for NSDI applications. The U.S. National Grid is based on universally-defined coordinate and grid systems and can, therefore, be easily extended for use worldwide as a universal grid reference system."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fgdc.gov/usng/articles-reports/20050701_ESRIUser_USNGintro.pdf/at_download/file]&lt;/ref&gt;

It resembles the [[Military Grid Reference System]] (MGRS). When the [[WGS84]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] or [[North American Datum|NAD83 datum]] is used, USNG and MGRS coordinates are "equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;Cavell, J. Anthony. [http://www.amerisurv.com/PDF/TheAmericanSurveyor_USNationalGrid-Cavell_June2005.pdf "A Guide to using the USNG"], ''[[The American Surveyor]]'', 2005. Retrieved on 14 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it has the advantage of being easily plotted on USGS topographic and other properly gridded maps by using a simple "read right and then up" convention where the user measures to the East and then North in linear increments. The coordinates are easily translated to distance as they are actually in meters rather than the more complex degree based increments of latitude and longitude.  Thus the distance between two coordinates can quickly be determined in the field.

USNG 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; grid statewide polygons for select states can be downloaded from http://usngcenter.org. The website also provides more detailed information about the US National Grid.

USNG allows a common system based on the US Military Grid system using landmarks like hills or streams, anything permanent. It allows these maps to be printed anywhere by responders totally unfamiliar with the local area. The degree of precision is determined by the number of digits in the coordinates, 23 67 = 1000 meters, 23451 67345 = 1 meter.

'''WMS''' (Watershed Modeling System) is a [[drainage basin|watershed]] [[Computer model|computer simulation]] and modeling software application from [[Aquaveo]]. It was originally created in the early 1990s at the Engineering Computer Graphics Laboratory at [[Brigham Young University]].

The software supports a number of hydraulic and hydrologic models that can be used to create drainage basin simulations.

==Features==
The Watershed Modeling System (WMS) is a proprietary water modeling software application used to develop [[drainage basin|watershed]] [[Computer model|computer simulations]]. The software provides tools to automate various basic and advanced delineations, calculations, and modeling processes.&lt;ref name="edsel 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Edsel | first=B.D.| title=Watershed Modeling and its Applications: A State-of-the-Art Review | journal=The Open Hydrology Journal | volume=5 | pages=26–50 | date=2011 | url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/vector/wp-content/uploads/WatershedModeling_OpenHydrology2011.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports river hydraulic and storm drain models, [[Lumped parameters|lumped parameter]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], 2D [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] modeling of watersheds, and can be used to model both water quantity and [[water quality]]. {{As of|January 2017}}, supported models include [[HEC-1]], [[HEC-RAS]], [[HEC-HMS]], [[TR-20]], [[TR-55 Hydrologic Model|TR-55]], [[National Flood Frequency Model|NFF]], [[Rational Hydrologic Model|Rational]], [[MODRAT]], [[HSPF (software)|HSPF]], [[CE-QUAL-W2]], [[GSSHA]], [[SMPDBK]], and other models.&lt;ref name="wms models"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaveo.com/software/wms-models|title=WMS Supported Models|publisher=[[Aquaveo]]|accessdate=January 24, 2017|archivedate=January 24, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6nlRFRmfX?url=http://www.aquaveo.com/software/wms-models|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
WMS was initially developed by the Engineering Computer Graphics Laboratory at [[Brigham Young University]] in the early 1990s on [[Unix]] workstations. James Nelson, Norman Jones, and Woodruff Miller wrote a 1992 paper titled "Algorithm for Precise Drainage-Basin Delineation" that was published in the March 1994 issue of the ''[[Journal of Hydraulic Engineering]]''.&lt;ref name="nelson 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first=E.J. |author2=Jones, N.L. |author3=Miller, A.W.  |year=1994 |title=An algorithm for precise drainage basin delineation |journal=ASCE Journal of Hydraulic Engineering |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Norman_Jones4/publication/245294040_Algorithm_for_Precise_Drainage-Basin_Delineation/links/0deec5339c5316a832000000.pdf|format=PDF|volume=120|issue=3 |pages=298–312 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1994)120:3(298)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper described an algorithm that could be used to describe the flow of water in a drainage basin, thereby defining the drainage basin. 

The development of WMS was funded primarily by The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (COE). In 1997, WMS was used by the COE to model runoff in the [[Sava|Sava River]] basin in [[Bosnia]].&lt;ref name="sava river"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecgl.byu.edu/software/wms/overview/logo.html|title=Sava River Basin, Bosnia|publisher=Engineering Computer Graphics Laboratory|accessdate=January 23, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980208164729/http://www.ecgl.byu.edu/software/wms/overview/logo.html|archivedate=February 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software was sold commercially by Environmental Modeling Systems.&lt;ref name="wms 6.0 release"/&gt;

It was later [[Porting|ported]] to [[Windows (operating system)|Windows]] platforms in the mid 1990s. WMS 6.0 (2000)&lt;ref name="wms 6.0 release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems-i.com/wms/index.html|title=WMS Home Page|publisher=Environmental Modeling Systems, Inc.|accessdate=January 23, 2017|archivedate=March 9, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309134053/http://www.ems-i.com/wms/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the last supported version for [[HP-UX]], [[IRIX]], [[OSF/1]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] platforms. Development of WMS was done by the Environmental Modeling Research Laboratory (EMRL) at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) until April 2007, when the main software development team at EMRL incorporated as [[Aquaveo]]. Royalties from the software are paid to the engineering department at BYU.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/ci_2781607|title=BYU prof's 3-D software makes an art out of the science of predicting a deluge|first=Todd |last=Hollingshead|date=June 6, 2005|publisher=''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]''|accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planners of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], held in Salt Lake City, Utah, used WMS software to simulate terrorist attacks on water infrastructure such as the [[Jordanelle Reservoir]].&lt;ref name="byumag fall 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.byu.edu/article/modeling-the-worlds-waters/|title=Modeling the World’s Waters|first=Nathan K.|last=Chai|publisher=''[[BYU Magazine]]''|date=Fall 2002|accessdate=25 February 2016|archivedate=25 February 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fZPVKbl2?url=http://magazine.byu.edu/article/modeling-the-worlds-waters/|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 paper, "Demonstrating Floodplain Uncertainty Using Flood Probability Maps", used WMS to demonstrate a new method of floodplain mapping that included uncertainty in its calculations and results.&lt;ref name="smemoe 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smemoe |first=C.M. |author2=Nelson, E.J. |author3=Zundel, A.K. |author4=Miller, A.W.  |year=2007 |title=Demonstrating Floodplain Uncertainty Using Flood Probability Maps |journal=Journal of the American Water Resources Association |volume=43 |pages=359–371 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00028.x |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Smemoe/publication/230310644_Demonstrating_Floodplain_Uncertainty_Using_Flood_Probability_Maps1/links/57b1d8c708ae95f9d8f4c119.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the software was used in a study of severe [[flash flood]]ing common to the [[Dez River]] basin in [[Khuzestan province]] in [[Iran]]. Both a rainfall runoff model (HEC-1) and hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) were created to simulate a major flood scenario to allow future planning for flash flooding control.&lt;ref name="sadrolashrafi 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sadrolashrafi | first=S.S.| title=Integrated Modeling for Flood Hazard Mapping Using Watershed Modeling System. | journal=American Journal of Engineering and Applied Science | volume=1 | pages=149–156. | date=2008 | url=http://www.thescipub.com/abstract/10.3844/ajeassp.2008.149.156|display-authors=etal | doi=10.3844/ajeassp.2008.149.156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study to identify areas with potential groundwater in the Sinai Peninsula was performed using WMS by Hossam H. Elewa and Atef A. Qaddah. &lt;ref name="hossam qaddah 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hossam | first1=H.E. | last2=Qaddah | first2=A.A. | title=Groundwater potentiality mapping in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, using remote sensing and GIS-watershed-based modeling | journal= Hydrogeology Journal | volume=19 |issue=3 | pages=613–628 | date=May 2011 | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10040-011-0703-8 | doi=10.1007/s10040-011-0703-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; WMS was used in combination with the TOPAZ model by a group of researchers in 2012 to help determine the impact of land development on the tropical watershed in the Upper Bernam River Basin in Malaysia for the years 1989-1995. The study was done to find ways of preventing shortages of irrigation water and the occurrence of floods.&lt;ref name="mustafa et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mustafa | first=Y.M.| title=Evaluation of Land Development Impact on a tropical Watershed Hydrology Using Remote Sensing and GIS | journal=Journal of Spatial Hydrology | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=16–30 | date=Fall 2012 | url=http://www.spatialhydrology.net/index.php/JOSH/article/download/40/41|display-authors=etal|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to water shortages in Iraq, a group of engineers used WMS to study ways to optimize water collection and storage.&lt;ref name="al-ansari et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Al-Ansari | first=N.| title=Water Harvesting and Reservoir Optimization in Selected Areas of South Sinjar Mountain, Iraq | journal=Journal of Hydrologic Engineering | volume=18 | issue=12 | pages=1607–1616 | date=Dec 2013 | url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/34477357/Water_Harvesting_and_Reservoir_Optimization_in_Selected.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485299094&amp;Signature=5VO%2BDX%2BMFepN6XjAFlHpw7DBVng%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DWater_harvesting_and_reservoir_optimizat.pdf |format=PDF | doi=10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000712}}&lt;/ref&gt;
