'''A Nong''' (also '''A Nùng''', {{lang-zh|阿儂}}; {{circa}} 1005–1055) was a [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] shamaness, matriarch and warrior. She was the mother of the warlord [[Nong Zhigao]] (1025–1055). Alongside her son, father, and husband, she led the Zhuang and [[Nùng people|Nùng]] minorities of the Sino-Vietnamese frontier against Vietnamese and Chinese foes.{{sfn|Barlow|2002}}

A Nong was born around 1005, the daughter of a chieftain who was [[feoffment|enfeoffed]] as a zhou-level official by the [[Han Chinese]]. Her brother, Nong Dang-dao, inherited the Zhuang heartland region. A Nong married the chieftain and zhou-level official Nong Quan-fu ([[Nùng Tồn Phúc]]) around 1020.{{sfn|Barlow|1987|p=256}}{{sfn|Barlow|2002}} She had several children, chief among them Nong Zhigao (born 1025).{{sfn|Barlow|2002}}

According to a legend of Zhetu villagers from [[Guangnan County]], A Nong was both brave and wise. She is called ''Yah Woeng'' (Powerful Mother), with the legend recounting that she became accidentally pregnant one day. Her husband was unknown to her, as he always visited her at night. Per her father's suggestion, she tied a silk thread to his leg one night, only to discover the thread tied to the leg of one of their family dogs. Before fleeing to escape the wrath of her father, the dog told her that she would give birth when she met a deer. She gave birth, though when she met a buffalo. The legend relates that her son, Nong Zhigao, was defeated by a Chinese emperor because he was born prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inchan|first1=Damrongphon|title=Nong of Southern China: Linguistic, Historical and Cultural Contexts|journal=Silpakorn University Journal of Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts|date=2015|volume=15|issue=1|page=164|url=https://www.academia.edu/15369206/Nong_of_Southern_China_Linguistic_Historical_and_Cultural_Contexts|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''[[History of Song]]'' describes A Nong as a shamaness who engaged in magic, including ritual [[human sacrifice]], but Confucian prejudices may color the data.{{sfn|Barlow|1987|p=256}} The Zhuang gender system was egalitarian, relative to Confucian orthodoxy.{{sfn|Barlow|1987|p=255}} Confucian historians usually minimized or ignored powerful women, attributing their actions to their fathers, husbands, or sons.{{sfn|Barlow|1987|pp=255-256}} But the importance of Zhuang matriarch A Nong can be perceived, despite their veil of Confucian prejudices.{{sfn|Barlow|1987|p=256}}

Later events suggest that A Nong influenced her husband to kill his brother and take lands belonging to the Cen clan.{{sfn|Barlow|1987|p=256}} The Nong clan then grew in power, with Nong Quan-fu founding the kingdom of Longevity (長生國) and styling himself Tu Dan Chao, the first king of Dali. In 1039, Vietnamese emperor [[Lý Thái Tông]] led an army into the region and captured Nong Quan-fu and much of his family. They were executed, though A Nong and her son Nong Zhigao both escaped.{{sfn|Barlow|1987|p=256}}

A Nong was reputed to be resourceful; "Zhigao often asked for and adopted her strategies when conquering cities and towns. She arrogated herself the title of Empress Dowager."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bangwei|first1=Zhang|title=A Social History of Medieval China|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-16786-5|page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40elDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;ots=-8YPfpmKMx&amp;dq=%22a%20nong%22%201055&amp;pg=PA218|chapter=Women: Ethnic Women Living in the Territories of Liao, Western Xia, Jin and Dali, and Ethnic Settlements under the Jurisdiction of Song}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Nong and Nong Zhigao developed close relationships with Chinese traders who made regular trips from [[Guangzhou]] to purchase gold. A Nong, with a trader known as Huang Wei, advised Nong Zhigao to engage Song forces at Yong. He was successful and went on to capture [[Hengzhou, Guangxi|Hengzhou]] and [[Wuzhou]] before laying an unsuccessful siege on Canton in 1052. The court of Song placed bounties on the heads of Nong Zhigao and A Nong. A Nong's head fetched a 3,000 guan bounty and an official post — a greater bounty than those placed on two Cantonese traitors.{{sfn|Barlow|2005}} Following the mobilization of Song forces and a military defeat at Yong, A Nong and Nong Zhigao fled to Temo in [[Yunnan]], where they attempted to raise more troops. They were caught and A Nong was executed in 1055.{{sfn|Barlow|1987|p=261}}

A Nong led a long struggle to preserve the unity of her people, but the forces arrayed against her were too great.{{sfn|Barlow|2002}} Zhuang women have continued to act as leaders in the region, some of them worthy successors to A Nong, including the remarkable Zhuang woman [[Wa Shi]].{{sfn|Barlow|2002}}

[[Image:Mahabodhitemple.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Mahabodhi|Mahabodhi temple]] in [[Bodhgaya]], [[India]]]]
'''Anagarika Shri Munindra''' (1915 – October 14, 2003), also called '''Munindraji''' by his disciples,&lt;ref name="tricycle"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: Anagarika Munindra (1914-2003) |url=http://www.tricycle.com/memoriam/memoriam-anagarika-munindra-1914-2003|publisher=[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[vipassana]] meditation teacher, who taught many notable meditation teachers including [[Dipa Ma]],{{sfn |Schmidt|2005|p=11}}[[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]],{{sfn |Schmidt|2005|p=11}} [[Sharon Salzberg]],{{sfn |Schmidt|2005|p=9}} and [[Surya Das]].{{sfn |Das|2015|p=49}} [[Anagarika]] simply means a practicing Buddhist who leads a nomadic life without attachment in order to focus on the [[dharma]]. 

==Early life==
Anagarika was born in [[Chittagong, Bangladesh]] and descended from Buddhists of India forced east by the [[India#Medieval India|eleventh century Muslim invasion]].&lt;ref name="tricycle"/&gt;

==Buddhist Life==
He was an active member of the [[Maha Bodhi Society]]&lt;ref name="tricycle"/&gt; whose purpose was the resuscitation of Buddhism in India and the restoration of ancient Buddhist shrines there. Munindra was the superintendent of the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] from 1953 to 1957,&lt;ref name="tricycle"/&gt; the first Buddhist to hold this position in modern times.  From 1957 to 1966 he lived in Burma, where he was a close disciple of [[Mahasi Sayadaw]],&lt;ref name="tricycle"/&gt; who authorized him to teach vipassana meditation.  While in Burma he also studied the [[Pali canon]] thoroughly,{{sfn|Knaster|2010|p=xiii}} before returning to India, where he taught vipassana for many years in [[Bodh Gaya]].{{sfn|Knaster|2010|p=xv}} He was known to be very open-minded and relaxed in the way he taught.{{sfn|Knaster|2010|p=x}} He would encourage his students to study with other teachers, and investigate other traditions.{{sfn|Knaster|2010|p=xvi}}

==In the tradition of Ledi Sayadaw==
During his stay in Burma he came in close contact with [[S. N. Goenka]] and had dhamma discussions with him.{{sfn|Knaster|2010|p=xvii}} Subsequently, he wished to learn Vipassana from Sayagyi U [[Ba Khin]] but since he had already learnt Vipassana from a monk, Sayagyi expressed his inability to teach him Vipassana in the tradition of [[Ledi Sayadaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Friend, Munindraji By S. N. Goenka|url=http://www.vridhamma.org/en2004-09|publisher=Vipassana Research Institute|date=August 30, 2004|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, his wish was fulfilled a few years later when [[S. N. Goenka]] started teaching Vipassana in India. Munindra joined a 10-day course conducted by Goenka at Bodhgaya. He was very impressed by the technique, as expressed in a letter of appreciation that he wrote to Sayagyi U [[Ba Khin]] after the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pariyatti.com/downloads/treasures/Maha_Bodhi_Journal_1972-04.pdf|title=The Maha Bodhi|page=91|date=April 1972|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years ==
He spent the last part of his life living at the Vipassana Research Institute's main meditation centre, Dhamma Giri, at the village of [[Igatpuri]], India, as a guest of his close friend [[S. N. Goenka]].{{sfn|Knaster|2010|p=xvii}}

'''Sir Arthur Charles Clarke''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FRAS}} (16 December 1917&amp;nbsp;– 19 March 2008) was a British [[list of science-fiction authors|science fiction writer]], science writer and [[futurist]],&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.

He is famous for being co-writer of the screenplay for the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', widely considered to be one of the most influential films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Ranked #15 by the [[American Film Institute]]. {{cite web | title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies – 10th Anniversary Edition | url=http://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx | accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ranked #6 by the [[British Film Institute]]. {{cite journal | url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time | title= The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time |issue= September 2012 |date= 1 August 2012 |journal= [[Sight &amp; Sound]] | accessdate=20 September 2014 | editor-link= Ian Christie (film scholar) | editor-first= Ian | editor-last= Christie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke was a science writer, who was both an avid populariser of space travel and a futurist of uncanny ability.  On these subjects he wrote over a dozen books and many essays, which appeared in various popular magazines.  In 1961 he was awarded the [[Kalinga Prize]], an award which is given by [[UNESCO]] for popularising science. These along with his science fiction writings eventually earned him the moniker "Prophet of the Space Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Reddy, John | title= Arthur Clarke: Prophet of the Space Age | journal= Reader's Digest | volume= 9 | number= 564 | date= April 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other science fiction writings earned him a number of [[Hugo award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula award|Nebula]] awards, which along with a large readership made him one of the towering figures of science fiction. For many years Clarke, [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein]] and [[Isaac Asimov]] were known as the "Big Three" of science fiction.&lt;ref name=bigthree&gt;{{cite web | title= The Big Three and the Clarke–Asimov Treaty | url= http://www.wireclub.com/clubs/books/isaac_asimov_fans/conversations/Toj1CgM8CzfoOEM80 |publisher= wireclub.com | accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke was a lifelong proponent of [[Human spaceflight|space travel]]. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the [[British Interplanetary Society]]. In 1945, he proposed a [[satellite]] communication system using [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary orbit]]s.&lt;ref name="etrelays"/&gt; He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946–47 and again in 1951–53.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benford | first1 = G. | title = Obituary: Arthur C.

Clarke emigrated from England to [[Sri Lanka]] (formerly Ceylon) in 1956, largely to pursue his interest in [[scuba diving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.natureseychelles.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=326&amp;Itemid=106 | title = Remembering Arthur C.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Clarke was born in [[Minehead]], [[Somerset]], England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign for Sir Arthur C Clarke memorial in Minehead|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-18927588|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in nearby [[Bishops Lydeard]]. As a boy, he lived on a farm, where he enjoyed [[astronomy|stargazing]], fossil collecting, and reading American science fiction [[pulp magazine]]s. He received his secondary education at [[Richard Huish College, Taunton|Huish]] [[Grammar school]] in [[Taunton]]. Early influences included dinosaur [[cigarette cards]], which led to an enthusiasm for fossils starting about 1925. Clarke attributed his interest in science fiction to reading three items: the November 1928 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1929; ''[[Last and First Men]]'' by [[Olaf Stapledon]] in 1930; and ''[[The Conquest of Space]]'' by [[David Lasser]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Arthur C., 1983, Of sand and stars: New York Times Book Review, 6 March 1983, reprinted in Clarke, Arthur C., 1984, 1984: Spring: A choice of futures: New York, Ballantine Books, p. 151-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teens, he joined the Junior Astronomical Association and contributed to ''Urania'', the society's journal, which was edited in Glasgow by Marion Eadie. At Clarke's request, she added an Astronautics Section, which featured a series of articles by him on spacecraft and space travel. Clarke also contributed pieces to the Debates and Discussions Corner, a counterblast to a ''Urania'' article offering the case against space travel, and also his recollections of the Walt Disney film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.  He moved to London in 1936 and joined the [[Board of Education]] as a pensions auditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34321|page=5798|date=8 September 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and some fellow science fiction writers shared a flat in [[Gray’s Inn Road]], where he got the nickname "Ego" because of his absorption in subjects that interested him,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/01/close-tears-he-left-intermission-how-stanley-kubrick-upset-arthur-c-Clarke "Close to tears, he left at the intermission": how Stanley Kubrick upset Arthur C Clarke]&lt;/ref&gt; and would later name his office filled with memorabilia as his "ego chamber".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1969/08/09/ego-chamber |title =Arthur C. Clarke: Out of the Ego Chamber | work = The New Yorker|last = Bernstein|first = Jeremy|date = 9 August 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
During the [[Second World War]] from 1941 to 1946 he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as a radar specialist and was involved in the [[early-warning radar]] defence system, which contributed to the RAF's success during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on [[ground-controlled approach]] (GCA) radar, as documented in the semi-autobiographical ''[[Glide Path]]'', his only non-science-fiction novel. Although GCA did not see much practical use during the war, it proved vital to the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948–1949 after several years of development. Clarke initially served in the ranks, and was a [[corporal#United Kingdom|corporal]] instructor on radar at No. 2 Radio School, [[RAF Yatesbury]] in [[Wiltshire]]. He was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] (technical branch) on 27 May 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36089 |supp=y|pages=3162–3163|date=9 July 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted [[flying officer]] on 27 November 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36271 |supp=y|page=5289|date=30 November 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed chief training instructor at [[RAF Honiley]] in Warwickshire and was [[Demobilization|demobilised]] with the rank of [[flight lieutenant]].

===Post-war===
After the war he attained a [[first-class degree]] in mathematics and physics from [[King's College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur C. Clarke|url=https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/cr-100226/arthur-c-clarke|publisher=Harper Collins|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ocx4Jc12mkgC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166 |title = International Biographical Dictionary of Computer Pioneers| page =166 |editor-last=Lee|editor-first = John A.

Although he was not the originator of the concept of [[geostationary satellite]]s, one of his most important contributions in this field may be his idea that they would be ideal telecommunications relays. He advanced this idea in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the British Interplanetary Society in 1945. The concept was published in ''[[Wireless World]]'' in October of that year.&lt;ref name="etrelays"/&gt; Clarke also wrote a number of non-fiction books describing the technical details and societal implications of rocketry and space flight. The most notable of these may be ''[[Interplanetary Flight: An Introduction to Astronautics]]'' (1950), ''The Exploration of Space'' (1951) and ''The Promise of Space'' (1968). In recognition of these contributions, the [[geostationary orbit]] {{convert|36000|km}} above the equator is officially recognised by the [[International Astronomical Union]] as the [[Clarke Orbit]].&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarkefoundation.org/acc/biography.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725175711/http://www.clarkefoundation.org/acc/biography.php |archivedate=25 July 2011 |title=Clarke Foundation Biography |accessdate=19 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1968 release of ''2001'', Clarke became much in demand as a commentator on science and technology, especially at the time of the [[Apollo space program]]. On 20 July 1969 Clarke appeared as a commentator for [[CBS]] for the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|xMAmk5Rp1tk|Mondo Cult Presents Walter Cronkite Apollo 11 Interview with Robert A.

===Sri Lanka and diving===
Clarke lived in Sri Lanka from 1956 until his death in 2008, first in [[Unawatuna]] on the south coast, and then in [[Colombo]].&lt;ref name=obitnyt/&gt; Initially, he and his friend Mike Wilson travelled around Sri Lanka, diving in the coral waters around the coast with the Beachcombers club. In 1957, during a dive trip off Trincomalee, Clarke discovered the underwater ruins of a temple which would subsequently make the region popular with divers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri lanka's underwater ruins |url=http://www.ceylondigest.com/discovering-sri-lankas-underwater-ruins/ |publisher=Ceylon digest |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently described it in his 1957 book ''The Reefs of Taprobane''. This was his second diving book after the 1956 ''The Coast of Coral''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book review - Reefs fo Taprobane |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/arthur-c-clarke/reefs-of-taprobane/ |website=www.kirkusreviews.com/ |publisher=Kirkus Book Reviews |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Clarke lived mostly in Colombo, he set up a small diving school and a simple [[dive shop]] near Trincomalee. He dived often at Hikkaduwa, Trincomalee and Nilaveli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Underwater safaris - company details |url=https://lk.kompass.com/c/underwater-safaris-ltd/lk006970/ |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Lankan government offered Clarke resident guest status in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sir Arthur Clarke dies at age 90|url=http://www.clarkefoundation.org/news/031808.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710013339/http://www.clarkefoundation.org/news/031808.php |archivedate=10 July 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2012 |publisher=The Arthur C. Clark Foundation |date=19 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was held in such high esteem that when fellow science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] came to visit, the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] provided a helicopter to take them around the country.&lt;ref name="pournelle198204"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering#page/n213/mode/2up | title=The Osborne 1, Zeke's New Friends, and Spelling Revisited | work=BYTE | date=April 1982 | accessdate=19 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the early 1970s, Clarke signed a three-book publishing deal, a record for a science-fiction writer at the time. The first of the three was ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' in 1973, which won all the main genre awards&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; and spawned sequels that along with the ''2001'' series formed the backbone of his later career.

In 1986 Clarke was named a [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award|Grand Master]] by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/awards/grand.htm |title=SFWA Grand Masters |accessdate=4 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621013507/http://www.sfwa.org/awards/grand.htm |archivedate=21 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he was diagnosed with [[post-polio syndrome]], having originally contracted [[polio]] in 1962, and needed to use a wheelchair most of the time thereafter.&lt;ref name=obitnyt/&gt; Clarke was for many years a Vice-Patron of the [[British Polio Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpolio.org.uk/|title=British Polio Fellowship|website=www.britishpolio.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1989 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] Clarke was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) "for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka".&lt;ref name=CBE&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=51772 |supp=y|page=16|date=16 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he became the first Chancellor of the [[International Space University]], serving from 1989 to 2004.  He also served as Chancellor of [[Moratuwa University]] in Sri Lanka from 1979 to 2002.

In 1994, Clarke appeared in a [[science fiction film]]; he portrayed himself in the telefilm ''[[Without Warning (1994 film)|Without Warning]]'', an American production about an apocalyptic alien first-contact scenario presented in the form of a faux newscast.

Clarke also became active in promoting the protection of gorillas and became a patron of the [[Digit Fund|Gorilla Organization]] which fights for the preservation of [[gorilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gorillas.org/arthur_c_clarke |title= Gorilla Organization mourns loss of patron Sir Arthur C Clarke – a true champion for gorillas |date= 27 March 2008 |publisher= Gorilla Organization |location= London |accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[tantalum]] mining for cell phone manufacture threatened the gorillas in 2001, he lent his voice to their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-4626572-details/Campaign+for+gorilla-friendly+mobiles/article.do |title=Campaign for gorilla-friendly mobiles - News - This is London |accessdate=20 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626235230/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-4626572-details/Campaign%2Bfor%2Bgorilla-friendly%2Bmobiles/article.do |archivedate=26 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dive shop that he set up continues to operate from Trincomalee through the Arthur C Clarke foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diving at Trncomalee |url=http://underwatersafari.org/index.php/scuba-diving/ |website=www.underwatersafari.org |publisher=Underwaer safaris |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series host===
In the 1980s Clarke became well known to many for his television programmes ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'', ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]'' and ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe]]''.

=== Personal life ===
On a trip to [[Florida]] in 1953&lt;ref name=pegasos/&gt; Clarke met and quickly married Marilyn Mayfield, a 22-year-old American divorcee with a young son. They separated permanently after six months, although the divorce was not finalised until 1964.&lt;ref name="McAleer"&gt;McAleer, Neil. "Arthur C. Clarke: The Authorized Biography", Contemporary Books, Chicago, 1992. {{ISBN|0-8092-3720-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- pp. 93-100 --&gt; "The marriage was incompatible from the beginning", said Clarke.&lt;ref name="McAleer"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 100 --&gt; Clarke never remarried, but was close to a Sri Lankan man, Leslie Ekanayake (13 July 1947 – 4 July 1977), whom Clarke called his "only perfect friend of a lifetime" in the dedication to his novel ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]''.{{efn|Full dedication reads: "To the still unfading memory of LESLIE EKANAYAKE (13 JuIy 1947 – 4 July 1977) only perfect friend of a lifetime, in whom were uniquely combined Loyalty, Intelligence and Compassion.

Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In his biography of [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[John Baxter (author)|John Baxter]] cites Clarke's homosexuality as a reason why he relocated, due to more tolerant [[LGBT rights in Sri Lanka|laws with regard to homosexuality in Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists who enquired of Clarke whether he was gay were told, "No, merely mildly cheerful."&lt;ref name=obitnyt/&gt; However, [[Michael Moorcock]] wrote: {{quote|Everyone knew he was gay. In the 1950s I'd go out drinking with his boyfriend. We met his protégés, western and eastern, and their families, people who had only the most generous praise for his kindness.

In an interview in the July 1986 issue of ''Playboy'' magazine, when asked if he had had a bisexual experience, Clarke stated "Of course. Who hasn't?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Playboy.com |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/arthur-clarke-playboy-interview/index.html?page=2 |title=Arthur C.

As [[Isaac Asimov]] once told me, 'I think he simply found he preferred men.' Arthur didn't publicise his sexuality—that wasn't the focus of his life—but if asked, he was open and honest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tobyjohnson.com/arthurcclarke.html | title = In honor of Sir Arthur C. Clarke |accessdate=18 March 2008 |publisher = Toby Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke accumulated a vast collection of manuscripts and personal memoirs, maintained by his brother Fred Clarke in Taunton, Somerset, England, and referred to as the "Clarkives". Clarke said that some of his private diaries will not be published until 30 years after his death. When asked why they were sealed, he answered, "Well, there might be all sorts of embarrassing things in them."&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite web | last= Adams | first= Tim | url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/sep/12/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.arthurcclarke | title= Man on the moon | date= 12 September 1999 | publisher= The Guardian | accessdate= 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knighthood===
On 26 May 2000 he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] "for services to literature" at a ceremony in Colombo.&lt;ref name=BBCknighted /&gt;{{efn|1=[[Letters Patent]] were issued by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] on 16 March 2000 to authorise this.}}&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=55796 |page=3167 |date=21 March 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award of a knighthood had been announced in the 1998 [[New Year Honours]] list,&lt;ref name=BBCsfknight /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kt&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=54993 |supp=y|page=2| date=30 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; but investiture with the award had been delayed, at Clarke's request, because of an accusation, by the British tabloid ''[[The Sunday Mirror]]'', of [[paedophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-60659502/it-doesn-t-do-any-harm-most-of-the-damage-comes |title=It Doesn't Do Any Harm&amp;nbsp;...

===Later years===
[[File:Clarke sm.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.05|Clarke at his home in Sri Lanka, 2005]]
Although he and his home were unharmed by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] [[tsunami]], his "Arthur C. Clarke Diving School" (also called "Underwater safaris")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us |url=http://underwatersafari.org/ |publisher=Underwater safaris |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Hikkaduwa]] near Trincomalee was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arthur C Clarke loses diving school |url=https://www.writerswrite.com/arthur-c-clarke-loses-diving-school-1229041 |website=www.writerswrite.com |publisher=Writers write |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made humanitarian appeals, and the Arthur C.

Because of his post-polio deficits, which limited his ability to travel and gave him halting speech, most of Clarke's communications in his last years were in the form of recorded addresses. In July 2007, he provided a video address for the [[Heinlein Centennial|Robert A. Heinlein Centennial]] in which he closed his comments with a goodbye to his fans. In September 2007, he provided a video greeting for [[NASA]]'s [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini probe]]'s flyby of [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] (which plays an important role in the book of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/videos/video-details.cfm?videoID=160 |title=Video greeting to NASA JPL by Arthur C.

Just hours before Clarke's death a massive [[gamma-ray burst]] (GRB) reached Earth. Known as [[GRB 080319B]], the burst set a new record as the farthest object that could be seen from Earth with the [[naked eye]].&lt;ref name="nasa1"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Satellite Detects Naked-Eye Explosion Halfway Across Universe |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/brightest_grb.html |publisher=NASA |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurred about 7.5 billion years ago (roughly equal to half the time since the [[Big Bang]]), taking the light that long to reach Earth.&lt;ref name="nasa1"/&gt; It was suggested by Larry Sessions, a science writer for ''[[Sky and Telescope]]'' magazine blogging on earthsky.org, that the burst be named "The Clarke Event".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.allthingsd.com/20080326/sessions/ |title=Why not the Clarke Event? |publisher=EarthSky Blogs |date=March 21, 2008 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328212009/http://voices.allthingsd.com/20080326/sessions/ |archivedate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.slashdot.org/index2.pl?fhfilter=GRB+080319B |title=The Arthur C.

==Science fiction writer==
[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1951spr n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Clarke's novella "The Road to the Sea" was originally published in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1951 as "Seeker of the Sphinx"]]

===Beginnings===
While Clarke had a few stories published in [[fanzine]]s, between 1937 and 1945, his first professional sale appeared in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' in 1946: "[[Loophole (short story)|Loophole]]" was published in April, while "[[Rescue Party (short story)|Rescue Party]]", his first sale, was published in May.{{efn|[[ISFDB]] catalogues one "Letter" to ''Amazing Stories'' published in 1935, ten more nonfiction items ("Essays") published 1938 to 1945, and five "Shortfiction" published 1937 to 1942.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;}} Along with his writing Clarke briefly worked as assistant editor of ''[[Science Abstracts]]'' (1949) before devoting himself in 1951 to full-time writing.

Clarke began carving out his reputation as a "scientific" science fiction writer with his first science fiction novel, ''[[Against the Fall of Night]]'', published as a novella in 1948. It was very popular and considered ground-breaking work for some of the concepts it contained. Clarke revised and expanded the novella into a full novel which was published in 1953. Clarke would later rewrite and expand this work a third time to become ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' in 1956, which rapidly became a definitive must-read in the field. His third science fiction novel, ''[[Childhood's End]]'', was also published in 1953, cementing his popularity. Clarke capped the first phase of his writing career with his sixth novel, ''[[A Fall of Moondust]]'', in 1961, which is also an acknowledged classic of the period.

During this time, Clarke corresponded with [[C. S. Lewis]] in the 1940s and 1950s and they once met in an Oxford pub, [[Eastgate Hotel|The Eastgate]], to discuss science fiction and space travel. Clarke voiced great praise for Lewis upon his death, saying that the [[The Space Trilogy|Ransom trilogy]] was one of the few works of science fiction that should be considered literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C.S. Lewis and Arthur C. Clarke |url=http://www.shawnsmallstories.com/tomes-of-lewis/c-s-lewis-and-arthur-c-clarke/ |publisher=Shawn Small Stories |accessdate=1 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060924/http://www.shawnsmallstories.com/tomes-of-lewis/c-s-lewis-and-arthur-c-clarke/ |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Sentinel" ===
[[File:If 195305.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Clarke's novelette "[[Jupiter Five]]" was cover-featured on the May 1953 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'']]
In 1948 he wrote "[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]" for a [[BBC]] competition. Though the story was rejected, it changed the course of Clarke's career. Not only was it the basis for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', but "The Sentinel" also introduced a more cosmic element to Clarke's work. Many of Clarke's later works feature a technologically advanced but still-prejudiced mankind being confronted by a superior alien intelligence. In the cases of ''[[Childhood's End]]'', and the ''2001'' series, this encounter produces a conceptual breakthrough that accelerates humanity into the next stage of its evolution.  This also applies in the far-distant past (but our future) in ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' (and its original version, ''Against the Fall of Night'').

In Clarke's authorised biography, Neil McAleer writes that: "many readers and critics still consider ''Childhood's End'' Arthur C. Clarke's best novel."&lt;ref name="McAleer"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 88 --&gt; But Clarke did not use [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] in any of his later stories, saying "I've always been interested in ESP and, of course, Childhood's End was about that. But I've grown disillusioned, partly because after all this time they're still arguing about whether these things happen. I suspect that telepathy does happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arthur C. Clarke Interview |url=https://futurism.media/arthur-c-clarke-interview |website=Futurism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collection of early essays was published in ''[[The View from Serendip]]'' (1977), which also included one short piece of fiction, "[[When the Twerms Came]]". Clarke also wrote short stories under the pseudonyms of E.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;O'Brien and Charles Willis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 26, 2018 |title=Clarke, Arthur C |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/clarke_arthur_c |website=SFE: The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of his short stories can be found in the book ''[[The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke]]'' (2001).

==="Big Three"===
[[File:Arthur C, Clarke Amazing 5306.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Clarke as depicted in ''Amazing Stories'' in 1953.]]
[[File:If 195806.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Clarke's novelette "[[The Songs of Distant Earth]]", the cover story for the June 1958 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'', was expanded to novel length almost three decades later]]
For much of the later 20th century, Clarke, Asimov, and Heinlein were informally known as the "Big Three" of science fiction writers.&lt;ref name=bigthree /&gt; Clarke and Heinlein began writing to each other after ''The Exploration of Space'' was published in 1951, and first met in person the following year. They remained on cordial terms for many years, including visits in the United States and Sri Lanka.

Clarke and Asimov first met in New York City in 1953, and they traded friendly insults and gibes for decades. They established an oral agreement, the "Clarke–Asimov Treaty", that when asked who was better, the two would say Clarke was the better science fiction writer and Asimov was the better science writer. In 1972, Clarke put the "treaty" on paper in his dedication to ''Report on Planet Three and Other Speculations''.&lt;ref name="McAleer"/&gt;&lt;!-- pages 265–269 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Edward Seiler  |author2=John H.

In 1984, Clarke testified before Congress against the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hartwell |first1=David G. |last2=Cramer |first2=Kathryn | authorlink1= David G.

Although the two later reconciled formally, they remained distant until Heinlein's death in 1988.&lt;ref name="McAleer"/&gt;&lt;!-- pages 81, 290, 326–329 --&gt;

===''2001'' series of novels===
''2001: A Space Odyssey'', Clarke's most famous work, was extended well beyond the 1968 movie as the [[Space Odyssey]] series. In 1982, Clarke wrote a sequel to ''2001'' titled ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', which was [[2010 (film)|made into a film]] in 1984. Clarke wrote two further sequels that have not been adapted into motion pictures: ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'' (published in 1987) and ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' (published in 1997).

''2061: Odyssey Three'' involves a visit to [[Halley's Comet]] on its next plunge through the [[Inner Solar System]] and a spaceship crash on the Jovian moon Europa. The whereabouts of astronaut Dave Bowman (the "Star Child"), the artificial intelligence [[HAL 9000]], and the development of native life on Europa, protected by the alien [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|Monolith]], are revealed.

Finally, in ''3001: The Final Odyssey'', [[Frank Poole (astronaut)|astronaut Frank Poole]]'s [[freeze-dried]] body, found by a spaceship beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]], is revived by advanced [[medical science]]. The novel details the threat posed to humanity by the alien monoliths, whose actions are not always as their builders had intended.

===''2001: A Space Odyssey''===

Clarke's first venture into film was ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]]. Kubrick and Clarke had met in New York City in 1964 to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project. As the idea developed, they decided to loosely base the story on Clarke's short story, ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'', written in 1948 as an entry in a BBC short story competition. Originally, Clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film, but Kubrick suggested during one of their [[brainstorming]] meetings that before beginning on the actual script, they should let their imaginations soar free by writing a novel first, on which they would base the film. "This is more or less the way it worked out, though toward the end, novel and screenplay were being written simultaneously, with feedback in both directions. Thus I rewrote some sections after seeing the movie rushes—a rather expensive method of literary creation, which few other authors can have enjoyed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-clarke19mar19,1,1990610,full.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604222033/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-clarke19mar19%2C1%2C1990610%2Cfull.story |archivedate= 4 June 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |title=Arthur C. Clarke, 90; scientific visionary, acclaimed writer of '2001: A Space Odyssey' |date=19 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ended up being published a few months after the release of the movie.

Due to the hectic schedule of the film's production, Kubrick and Clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book. Clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of 1964 with the plan to publish in 1965 in advance of the film's release in 1966. After many delays the film was released in the spring of 1968, before the book was completed. The book was credited to Clarke alone. Clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a [[Novelization|novelisation]], that Kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay Clarke's authorship. For these and other reasons, the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie. The film contains little explanation for the events taking place. Clarke, on the other hand, wrote thorough explanations of "cause and effect" for the events in the novel. [[James Randi]] later recounted that upon seeing the premiere of ''2001'', Clarke left the theatre at the intermission in tears, after having watched an eleven-minute scene (which did not make it into general release) where an astronaut is doing nothing more than jogging inside the spaceship, which was Kubrick's idea of showing the audience how boring space travels could be.&lt;ref name="jamesrandionclarke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itricks.com/randishow/?p=21 |title= Randi shares some stories regarding his friend Arthur C.

In 1972, Clarke published ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'', which included his accounts of the production, and alternative versions of key scenes. The "special edition" of the novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|A Space Odyssey]]'' (released in 1999) contains an introduction by Clarke in which he documents the events leading to the release of the novel and film.

===''2010: Odyssey Two''===
In 1982 Clarke continued the ''2001'' epic with a sequel, ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. This novel was also made into a film, ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', directed by [[Peter Hyams]] for release in 1984. Because of the political environment in America in the 1980s, the film presents a [[Cold War]] theme, with the looming tensions of [[nuclear warfare]] not featured in the novel. The film was not considered to be as revolutionary or artistic as ''2001'', but the reviews were still positive.

Clarke's email correspondence with Hyams was published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Clarke and Peter Hyams. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_KPAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+odyssey+file The Odyssey File]. Ballantine Books, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010'', and co-authored with Hyams, it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium of email and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film while living on opposite sides of the world. The book also included Clarke's personal list of the best science-fiction films ever made.

Clarke appeared in the film, first as the man feeding the pigeons while [[Heywood R. Floyd|Dr. Heywood Floyd]] is engaged in a conversation in front of the White House. Later, in the hospital scene with [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]]'s mother, an image of the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' portrays Clarke as the American President and Kubrick as the Soviet Premier.

===''Rendezvous with Rama''===
Clarke's award-winning novel ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' (1973) was [[option (filmmaking)|optioned for filmmaking]] in the early 21st century&lt;ref name= freeman&gt;{{cite web|title= Freeman Still Pushes ''Rama'' |url= http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2003-03/14/12.00.film |work= Sci Fi Wire |publisher= The Sci Fi Channel |date=14 March 2003 |accessdate=12 February 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090117032453/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2003-03%2F14%2F12.00.film |archivedate=17 January 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= revelations&gt;{{cite web|title= Rendezvous with Rama |url= http://www.revelationsent.com/movie_page.php?movieId=12 |website=Revelations Entertainment |accessdate= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715175504/http://www.revelationsent.com/movie_page.php?movieId=12 |archivedate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this motion picture is in "[[development hell]]" {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. In the early 2000s, the actor [[Morgan Freeman]] expressed his desire to produce a movie based on ''Rendezvous with Rama''. After a drawn-out development process – which Freeman attributed to difficulties in getting financing – it appeared that in 2003 this project might be proceeding, but this is very dubious.&lt;ref name= freeman/&gt; The film was to be produced by Freeman's production company, [[Revelations Entertainment]], and [[David Fincher]] has been touted on Revelations' ''Rama'' web page as far back as 2001 as the film's director.&lt;ref name= revelations/&gt; After years of no progress, Fincher stated in an interview in late 2007 (in which he also credited the novel as being influential on the films ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'') that he is still attached to helm.&lt;ref name="AICN1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35179 |title= David Fincher and Quint talk about everything from A(lien3) to Z(odiac)!!! |author=quint |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=7 March 2009 |work= [[Ain't It Cool News]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090319122237/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35179 |archivedate= 19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revelations indicated that [[Stel Pavlou]] had written the adaptation.

In late 2008, Fincher stated the movie is unlikely to be made. "It looks like it's not going to happen. There's no script and as you know, Morgan Freeman's not in the best of health right now. We've been trying to do it but it's probably not going to happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Science writer==
Clarke published a number of non-fiction books with essays, speeches, addresses, etc. Several of his non-fiction books are composed of chapters that can stand on their own as separate essays.

===Space travel===
In particular, Clarke was a populariser of the concept of space travel. In 1950 he wrote ''[[Interplanetary Flight]]'', a book outlining the basics of space flight for laymen. Later books about space travel included ''The Exploration of Space'' (1951), ''The Challenge of the Spaceship'' (1959), ''Voices from the Sky'' (1965), ''The Promise of Space'' (1968, rev. ed. 1970) and ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) among others.

===Futurism===
His books on space travel usually included chapters about other aspects of science and technology, such as computers and bioengineering.  He predicted telecommunication satellites (albeit serviced by astronauts in space suits, who would replace the satellite's [[vacuum tube]]s as they burned out).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dTwIDun4MroC&amp;pg=PA604&amp;lpg=PA604 | title= Handbook of Space Engineering, Archaeology, and Heritage |editor1=Darrin, Ann |editor2=O'Leary, Beth L. | publisher= CRC Press | date= 26 June 2009 | page= 604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His many predictions culminated in 1958 when he began a series of magazine essays that eventually became ''Profiles of the Future,'' published in book form in 1962.&lt;ref name="profiles"/&gt; A timetable&lt;ref name="digitallantern"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallantern.net/McLuhan/course/spring96/profiles.gif |title=Chart of the Future |accessdate=8 February 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070224092756/http://www.digitallantern.net/mcluhan/course/spring96/profiles.gif| archivedate= 24 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; up to the year 2100 describes inventions and ideas including such things as a "global library" for 2005. The same work also contained "Clarke's First Law" and text that became [[Clarke's three laws]] in later editions.&lt;ref name="McAleer"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 169 --&gt;

In a 1959 essay Clarke predicted global satellite TV broadcasts that would cross national boundaries indiscriminately and would bring hundreds of channels available anywhere in the world. He also envisioned a "personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one." He wrote: "the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialling a number." Such a device would also, in Clarke's vision, include means for global positioning so that "no one need ever again be lost." Later, in ''Profiles of the Future'', he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="profiles"/&gt;

[[File:ABC Clarke predicts internet and PC.ogv|thumb|1974 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] interview with Clarke in which he describes a future of ubiquitous computing reminiscent of the modern Internet]]

In a 1974 interview with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], the interviewer asked Clarke how he believed the computer would change the future for the everyday person, and what life would be like in the year 2001. Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality, including [[online banking]], [[online shopping]], and other now commonplace things. Responding to a question about how the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clarke responded: "He will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, [points to nearby computer], but at least, a console through which he can talk, through his friendly local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theatre reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house&amp;nbsp;... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|OIRZebE8O84|Arthur C. Clarke Predicts the Internet &amp; PC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive selection of Clarke's essays and book chapters (from 1934 to 1998; 110 pieces, 63 of them previously uncollected in his books) can be found in the book ''Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!'' (2000), together with a new introduction and many prefatory notes. Another collection of essays, all previously collected, is ''By Space Possessed'' (1993). Clarke's technical papers, together with several essays and extensive autobiographical material, are collected in ''Ascent to Orbit: A Scientific Autobiography'' (1984).

==Geostationary communications satellite==

{{Main|Geostationary orbit}}
Clarke contributed to the popularity of the idea that [[geostationary satellite]]s would be ideal telecommunications relays. He first described this in a letter to the editor of ''[[Wireless World]]'' in February 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Arthur C. Clarke |title=Peacetime Uses for V2 |url=http://lakdiva.org/clarke/1945ww/1945ww_058.jpg |accessdate=8 February 2007 |format=JPG |work=Wireless World |date=February 1945 |page=58  |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070315181210/http://lakdiva.org/clarke/1945ww/1945ww_058.jpg| archivedate= 15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborated on the concept in a paper titled ''Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?'', published in ''Wireless World'' in October 1945.&lt;ref name="etrelays"/&gt; The [[geostationary orbit]] is now sometimes known as the Clarke Orbit or the Clarke Belt in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= NASA |url= http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf5-1.php |title= Basics of Space Flight Section 1 Part 5, Geostationary Orbits |accessdate=13 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Earl |first= Michael A. |title= A sea of satellite dishes |publisher= The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |date= 9 January 2006 |url= http://ottawa-rasc.ca/articles/earl_mike/Satellite_Tracking/Dishes/Satellite_Dishes.html |accessdate= 13 July 2010 |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/68390iBKg?url=http://ottawa-rasc.ca/articles/earl_mike/Satellite_Tracking/Dishes/Satellite_Dishes.html |archive-date= 30 May 2012 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lakdiva"/&gt;

It is not clear that this article was actually the inspiration for the modern telecommunications satellite. According to [[John R. Pierce]], of [[Bell Labs]], who was involved in the [[Echo satellite]] and [[Telstar]] projects, he gave a talk upon the subject in 1954 (published in 1955), using ideas that were "in the air", but was not aware of Clarke's article at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Pierce |first= John R. |authorlink= John R.

Though different from Clarke's idea of telecom relay, the idea of communicating via satellites in geostationary orbit itself had been described earlier. For example, the concept of geostationary satellites was described in [[Hermann Oberth]]'s 1923 book ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen'' (''The Rocket into Interplanetary Space''), and then the idea of radio communication by means of those satellites in [[Herman Potočnik]]'s (written under the pseudonym Hermann Noordung) 1928 book ''Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums&amp;nbsp;– der Raketen-Motor ([http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4026/contents.html The Problem of Space Travel&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;The Rocket Motor])'', sections: ''Providing for Long Distance Communications and Safety'',{{efn|name=a}} and (possibly referring to the idea of relaying messages via satellite, but not that 3 would be optimal) ''Observing and Researching the Earth's Surface'', published in Berlin.&lt;ref name="celestrak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celestrak.com/columns/v04n07/ |title=Basics of the Geostationary Orbit |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Kelso |first=Dr. T.

==Undersea explorer==
Clarke was an avid scuba diver and a member of the [[Underwater Explorers Club]]. In addition to writing, Clarke set up several diving-related ventures with his business partner Mike Wilson.  In 1956, while scuba diving, Wilson and Clarke uncovered ruined masonry, architecture and idol images of the sunken original Koneswaram temple – including carved columns with flower insignias, and stones in the form of elephant heads – spread on the shallow surrounding seabed.&lt;ref name="reluctant"&gt;{{cite book |last=Greig |first=Doreen E. |year=1987 |title=The Reluctant Colonists: Netherlanders Abroad in the 17th and 18th Centuries |publisher=Assen, The Netherlands; Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, United States |oclc=14069213 |page=227 |isbn=978-9-02322-227-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1965 |title=Expedition in the waters of Ceylon |journal=[[Science Digest]] |location= Chicago |issn=0036-8296 |oclc=1624458 |volume=57 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=i9QCAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=konesar |quote=One of the major achievements in Ceylon was the discovery of the ruins of the sunken Konesar Temple, which as located with the wrecked treasure ship&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other discoveries included [[Chola art|Chola bronzes]] from the original shrine, and these discoveries were described in Clarke's 1957 book ''The Reefs of Taprobane.''&lt;ref name="reef"&gt;{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Arthur C. | title = The Reefs of Taprobane; Underwater Adventures around Ceylon| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper]] | year = 1957 | location = New York | isbn = 0-7434-4502-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, while filming off Great Basses Reef, Wilson found a [[Great Basses wreck|wreck]] and retrieved silver coins. Plans to dive on the wreck the following year were stopped when Clarke developed paralysis, ultimately diagnosed as polio. A year later, Clarke observed the salvage from the shore and the surface. The ship, ultimately identified as belonging to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]], [[Aurangzeb]], yielded fused bags of silver [[rupee]]s, cannon, and other artefacts, carefully documented, became the basis for ''The Treasure of the Great Reef''.&lt;ref name="McAleer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Throckmorton |first= Peter |authorlink= Peter Throckmorton |year=1964 |title= The Great Basses Wreck |journal= Expedition |url= http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/6-3/The%20Great.pdf |volume= 6 |issue= 3, Spring |pages= 21–31 |issn= 0014-4738 |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in Sri Lanka and learning its history also inspired the backdrop for his novel ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]'' in which he described a [[space elevator]]. This, he believed, would make rocket-based access to space obsolete and, more than geostationary satellites, would ultimately be his scientific legacy.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;Personal e-mail from Sir Arthur Clarke to Jerry Stone, Director of the [[Sir Arthur Clarke Award]]s, 1 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===On religion===
&lt;!-- Please avoid adding quotations if the statement can be represented clearly in prose. This section could easily become overrun (see WP:QUOTEFARM). --&gt;
Themes of religion and spirituality appear in much of Clarke's writing. He said: "Any path to knowledge is a path to God—or Reality, whichever word one prefers to use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3582978.ece|title=Sir Arthur C.

[[J. B. S. Haldane|J.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;S. Haldane]], near the end of his life, suggested in a personal letter to Clarke that Clarke should receive a prize in theology for being one of the few people to write anything new on the subject, and went on to say that if Clarke's writings did not contain multiple contradictory theological views, he might have been a menace.&lt;ref name=credo&gt;{{cite book |last= Clarke |first= Arthur C. |others= First appearing in ''Living Philosophies'', Clifton Fadiman, ed.

A famous quotation of Clarke's is often cited: "One of the great tragedies of mankind is that morality has been hijacked by religion."&lt;ref name="freeinquiry" /&gt; He was quoted in ''Popular Science'' in 2004 as saying of religion: "Most malevolent and persistent of all mind viruses.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to the penultimate episode of ''Mysterious World'', entitled "Strange Skies", Clarke said: "I sometimes think that the universe is a machine designed for the perpetual astonishment of astronomers," reflecting the dialogue of the episode, in which he stated this concept more broadly, referring to "mankind".  Near the very end of that same episode, the last segment of which covered the [[Star of Bethlehem]], he said that his favourite theory&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN1yvdYx0HU | title=Mysterious world strange skies 3 of 3| publisher=YouTube |date=24 Nov 2007|accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that it might be a [[pulsar]]. Given that pulsars were discovered in the interval between his writing the short story, "[[The Star (Clarke short story)|The Star]]" (1955), and making ''Mysterious World'' (1980), and given the more recent discovery of pulsar [[PSR B1913+16]], he said: "How romantic, if even now, we can hear the dying voice of a star, which heralded the Christian era."&lt;ref name="youtube"/&gt;

Clarke left written instructions for a funeral that stated: "Absolutely no religious rites of any kind, relating to any religious faith, should be associated with my funeral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,1723669,00.html |title=Quotes of the Day |accessdate=20 March 2008 |date=19 March 2008 |work=Time |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324005027/http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0%2C26174%2C1723669%2C00.html |archivedate=24 March 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Regarding [[freedom of information]] Clarke believed "In the struggle for freedom 
of information, technology, not politics, will be the ultimate decider".

Clarke also wrote "It is not easy to see how the more extreme forms of nationalism can 
long survive when men have seen the Earth in its true perspective as a single small 
globe against the stars."&lt;ref name=v&gt;[http://www.keplerspaceinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/JSP-Spr-2014-12_Krone-Clarke-Final.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiioaua8uncAhWMBcAKHe0ACicQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1etTlG-v_cousq8XYXHRTd ]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding human jobs being replaced by robots Clarke said "Any teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be!"&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

Clarke supported the use of [[renewable energy]] saying "I would like to see us kick our current addiction to oil, and adopt clean energy sources..Climate change has now added a new sense of urgency. Our civilisation depends on energy, but we can’t allow oil and coal to slowly bake our planet."&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

===Intelligent life===
Clarke believed "The best proof that there’s intelligent life in outer space is the fact that it hasn’t come 
here...the fact that we have not yet found the slightest evidence
for life — much less intelligence — beyond this Earth does not surprise or disappoint 
me in the least. Our technology must still be laughably primitive; we may well be like 
jungle savages listening for the throbbing of [[tom-tom]]s, while the ether around them 
carries more words per second than they could utter in a lifetime"&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

Clarke also believed "Two possibilities 
exist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying."&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

===Paranormal phenomena===

Early in his career, Clarke had a fascination with the [[paranormal]] and stated that it was part of the inspiration for his novel ''Childhood's End''. Citing the numerous promising paranormal claims that were shown to be fraudulent, Clarke described his earlier openness to the paranormal having turned to being "an almost total sceptic" by the time of his 1992 biography.&lt;ref name="McAleer"/&gt;&lt;!-- Ch 8 --&gt; During interviews, both in 1993 and 2004–2005, he stated that he did not believe in [[reincarnation]], saying that there was no mechanism to make it possible, though he stated "I'm always paraphrasing J. B. S. Haldane: 'The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it's stranger than we ''can'' imagine.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Jeff Greenwald |authorlink= Jeff Greenwald |title= Arthur C.

Clarke was well known for his television series investigating [[paranormal]] phenomena – ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'' (1980), ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]'' (1985) and ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe]]'' (1994) – enough to be parodied [[Big Foot (Goodies episode)|in an episode]] of ''[[The Goodies]]'' in which his show is cancelled after it is claimed that he does not exist.

In Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World he gives three kinds of "mysteries".

*Mysteries of the First Kind: "something that was once utterly baffling, but is now completely understood." Clarke gives the example of a rainbow.
*Mysteries of the Second Kind: Something that is currently not fully understood and can be in the future.
*Mysteries of the Third Kind: Something of which we have no understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C Clarke's Mysterious Universe&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes, style and influences==
Clarke's work is marked by an optimistic view of science empowering mankind's exploration of the Solar System and the world's oceans. His images of the future often feature a [[Utopian]] setting with highly developed technology, ecology and society, based on the author's ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Guy|last= Riddihough|title = Cities Not Built to Last|journal = Science|date = 4 July 2008|volume = 321|issue = 5885|pages = 42–43 |doi = 10.1126/science.1161705|quote =What marks the book out are Clarke's sweeping vistas, grand ideas, and ultimately optimistic view of humankind's future in the cosmos.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His early published stories usually featured the extrapolation of a technological innovation or scientific breakthrough into the underlying decadence of his own society.

A recurring theme in Clarke's works is the notion that the evolution of an intelligent species would eventually make them something close to gods. This was explored in his 1953 novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and briefly touched upon in his novel ''[[Imperial Earth]]''. This idea of transcendence through evolution seems to have been influenced by [[Olaf Stapledon]], who wrote a number of books dealing with this theme. Clarke has said of Stapledon's 1930 book ''[[Last and First Men]]'' that "No other book had a greater influence on my life&amp;nbsp;... [It] and its successor ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon's] literary career".&lt;ref name="testermanscifi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.testermanscifi.org/ClarkeQuotesPart2.html |title=Arthur C.

====Awards====
* [[Arthur C. Clarke Awards]] for science fiction writing, awarded annually in the United Kingdom.
In 1986, Clarke provided a grant to fund the prize money (initially £1,000) for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for the best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in the previous year. In 2001 the prize was increased to £2001,&lt;!-- by Clarke? --&gt; and its value now matches the year (e.g., £2005 in 2005).
* [[Sir Arthur Clarke Award]], for achievements in space, awarded annually in the United Kingdom.
In 2005 he lent his name to the inaugural Sir Arthur Clarke Awards—dubbed the "Space Oscars". His brother attended the awards ceremony, and presented an award specially chosen by Arthur (and not by the panel of judges who chose the other awards) to the [[British Interplanetary Society]].
* [[Arthur C. Clarke Foundation]]&lt;!-- should itself be covered in the next subsection--&gt; awards: "Arthur C. Clarke Innovator's Award" and "Arthur C.

* A species of [[ceratopsian]] [[dinosaur]], discovered in [[Inverloch, Victoria|Inverloch]] in Australia, was named after Clarke, ''[[Serendipaceratops arthurcclarkei]]''. The genus name may also be an allusion to his adopted country, Sri Lanka, one of whose former names is ''Serendip''.
* The Learning Resource Centre at [[Richard Huish College, Taunton]], which Clarke attended when it was Huish Grammar School, is named after him.
* Clarke was a distinguished vice-president of the [[H. G. Wells Society]], being strongly influenced by [[H. G. Wells|Wells]] as a science-fiction writer.

* 'The Clarke Event' is a proposed name for [[GRB 080319B]], a gamma-ray burst detected just hours before Clarke's death that set a new record for the most intrinsically bright object ever observed by humans in the universe.

'''Bahrot Caves''', locally known as '''Barad''', near [[Dahanu]], [[Maharashtra]] are the only [[Parsi]]/[[Zoroastrian]] Cave temple in India. Bahrot Caves is located 25&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]], Gujarat and are situated at a small distance of 8&amp;nbsp;km away from the village of [[Bordi]]. They were unused Buddhist caves excavated by Buddhist monks. Zoroastrians hid for 13 years in these mountains after an invasion of their settlement at Sanjan by Alaf Khan, a general of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] in 1393 CE. The ‘Iranshah Flame’ was also moved to Bahrot during this period (1393–1405 AD). Even today, the Holy Fire is burning and it is given the most eminent grade of devoted fire in the world. Bahrot Caves have been declared a heritage site and is a protected monument under the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI).&lt;ref name="Desai2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anjali H.

'''Bariah''' or  '''Baptism for the Dead''' is only mentioned in {{Bible verse|1 Cor|15:29}}. This expression as used by the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] may be equivalent to saying, "He who goes through a baptism of blood in order to join a glorified church which has no existence [i.e., if the dead rise not] is a fool." Some also regard the statement here as an allusion to the strange practice which began, it is said, to prevail at [[Corinth]], in which a person was [[Baptism|baptized]] in the stead of others who had died before being baptized, to whom it was hoped some of the benefits of that rite would be extended. This they think may have been one of the erroneous customs which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] went to Corinth to "set in order."

'''Bodh Gaya''' is a religious site and place of pilgrimage associated with the [[Mahabodhi Temple Complex]] in [[Gaya district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Bihar]]. It is famous as it is the place where [[Gautama Buddha]] is said to have obtained [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|Enlightenment]] (Pali: bodhi) under what became known as the [[Bodhi Tree]].&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1991| page= 176|editor=K.S.

For Buddhists, Bodh Gaya is the most important of the main four pilgrimage sites related to the life of Gautama Buddha,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} the other three being [[Kushinagar]], [[Lumbini]], and [[Sarnath]]. In 2002, Mahabodhi Temple, located in Bodh Gaya, became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web

{{BuddhasHolySites}}

Bodh Gaya is the most holy place for Buddhists.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Situated by the bank of [[Lilajan River|river Neranjana]] the place was then known as Uruwela. King [[Ashoka]] was the first to build a temple here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhapilgrims.wordpress.com/places-to-visit/four-sacred-places/bodh-gaya-buddha-gaya/ |title=Bodh Gaya &amp;#124; Dambadiva Buddha Vandana Buddhist Pilgrims |publisher=Buddhapilgrims.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140603115550/http://buddhapilgrims.wordpress.com/places-to-visit/four-sacred-places/bodh-gaya-buddha-gaya/ |archivedate=3 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2017}}

Traditionally, Buddha was born in 563 BC in what is now Nepal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shaadi.com/buddha-purnima?retrg=T3JnYW5pYyBTZWFyY2g= |title=Buddha Purnima - Festival of Buddhist |publisher=Shaadi.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116214113/http://www.shaadi.com/buddha-purnima?retrg=T3JnYW5pYyBTZWFyY2g= |archivedate=16 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the following auspicious Baisakhi purnima. As Siddhartha, he renounced his family at the age of 29 in 534 BC&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barua |first=Sukomal |year=2012 |chapter=Buddha Purnima |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Buddha_Purnima |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508210314/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Buddha_Purnima |archivedate=8 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/04/22/spe03.asp |title=Spectrum &amp;#124; Sundayobserver.lk - Sri Lanka |publisher=Sundayobserver.lk |date=2012-04-22 |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013224257/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/04/22/spe03.asp |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and travelled and meditated in search of truth. After practicing self-mortification for six years at Urubela (Buddhagaya) in Gaya, he gave up that practice because it did not give him Vimukthi. Then he discovered Noble Eight-fold path without help from anyone and practiced it, then he attained Buddhatva or enlightenment. Enlightenment is a state of being completely free from lust (raga), hatred (dosa) and delusion (moha). By gaining enlightenment, you enter Nirvana, in which the final stage is Parinirvana.

At this place, the Buddha was abandoned by the five men who had been his companions of earlier austerities. All they saw was an ordinary man; they mocked his well-nourished appearance. "Here comes the mendicant Gautama," they said, "who has turned away from asceticism. He is certainly not worth our respect." When they reminded him of his former vows, the Buddha replied, "Austerities only confuse the mind. In the exhaustion and mental stupor to which they lead, one can no longer understand the ordinary things of life, still less the truth that lies beyond the senses. I have given up extremes of either luxury or asceticism. I have discovered the Middle Way". This is the path which is neither easy (a rich prince) nor hard (living in austere conditions practicing self-denial). Hearing this, the five ascetics became the Buddha's first disciples in Deer Park, [[Sarnath]], 13&amp;nbsp;km n.e. of Benares.

The disciples of Gautama Siddhartha began to visit the place during the full moon in the month of [[Vesak|Vaisakh]] (April–May), as per the [[Hindu calendar]]. Over time, the place became known as Bodh Gaya, the day of enlightenment as [[Buddha Purnima]], and the tree as the Bodhi Tree.

The history of Bodh Gaya is documented by many inscriptions and pilgrimage accounts. Foremost among these are the accounts of the [[China|Chinese]] pilgrims [[Faxian]] in the 5th century and [[Xuanzang]] in the 7th century. The area was at the heart of a Buddhist civilization for centuries, until it was [[Islamic invasion of India|conquered]] by Turkic armies in the 13th century.
The place-name, Bodh Gaya, did not come into use until the 18th century CE. Historically, it was known as Uruvela, Sambodhi ([[File:Sambodhi inscription.jpg|40px]]Saṃ+[[bodhi]], “Complete Enlightenment” in [[Ashoka]]'s [[Major Rock Edict|Major Rock Edict No.8]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Juergensmeyer |first1=Mark |last2=Roof |first2=Wade Clark |title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion |date=2011 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781452266565 |page=148 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vajrasana (the "[[Diamond Throne]]" of the Buddha) or Mahabodhi ("Great Enlightenment").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/pilgrim/pg_histbg.htm |title=A History of Bodh Gaya by Venerable S. Dhammika |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main monastery of Bodh Gaya used to be called the Bodhimanda-vihāra ([[Pali]]). Now it is called the [[Mahabodhi Temple]].

contains the Mahabodhi Temple with the [[Vajrasana, Bodh Gaya|Vajrasana]] or "diamond throne" and the holy [[Bodhi tree]]. This tree was originally a sapling of the [[Sri Maha Bodhi]] tree in [[Sri Lanka]], itself grown from a what is claimed to be a sapling of the original Bodhi tree.

In approximately 250 BCE, about 200 years after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, [[Buddhist]] Emperor [[Asoka]] visited Bodh Gaya in order to establish a monastery and shrine on the holy site, which have today disappeared.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

Representations of this early temple are found at [[Sanchi]], on the toraṇas of Stūpa I, dating from around 25 BCE, and on a relief carving from the stupa railing at [[Bharhut|Bhārhut]], from the early [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] period (c. 185–c. 73 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;"Sowing the Seeds of the Lotus: A Journey to the Great Pilgrimage Sites of Buddhism, Part I" by John C. Huntington. ''Orientations'', November 1985 pg 61&lt;/ref&gt; The present pyramidal temple was built at the time of the [[Gupta Empire]], circa the 6th century CE.

==Other Buddhist temples==
[[File:Buddhist Man Meditating.jpg|thumb|Buddhist Man Meditating in Bodh Gaya]]
[[Kittisirimegha]] of Sri Lanka, a contemporary of [[Samudragupta]], erected with the permission of Samudragupta, a [[monastery|Sanghārāma]] near the Mahabodhi Temple, chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree. The circumstances in connection with the Sanghārāma are given by [[Xuanzang]] ([[Samuel Beal|Beal]], op. cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself. It was probably here that [[Buddhaghosa]] met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.

Several Buddhist temples and monasteries have been built by the people of [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Tibet]] and [[Vietnam]] in a wide area around the Mahabodhi Temple. These buildings reflect the architectural style, exterior and interior decoration of their respective countries. The statue of Buddha in the Chinese temple is 200 years old and was brought from China. Japan's Nippon temple is shaped like a pagoda. The Myanmar (Burmese) temple is also [[pagoda]] shaped and is reminiscent of [[Bagan]]. The Thai temple has a typical sloping, curved roof covered with golden tiles. Inside, the temple holds a massive bronze statue of Buddha. Next to the Thai temple is 25-metre statue of Buddha located within a garden which has existed there for over 100 years.

;Sujata Stupa
Across the [[Phalgu]] river is the [[Sujata Stupa]], in the village of [[Bakraur]]. The stupa was dedicated to the [[milkmaid]] [[Sujata (milkmaid)|Sujata]], who is said to have fed [[Gautama Buddha]] milk and rice as he was sitting under a [[Banyan tree]], ending his seven years of fasting and [[ascetism]], and allowing him to attain illumination through the [[Middle Way]].&lt;ref name=prasoon07&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prasoon|first1=Shrikant |title=Knowing Buddha : [life and teachings] |date=2007 |publisher=Hindoology Books|location=[Delhi] |isbn=9788122309638 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us9wbjmvXfgC&amp;pg=PT32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Planet |first1=Lonely |last2=Blasi |first2=Abigail |title=Lonely Planet India |date=2017 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=9781787011991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLU7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1251 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dwivedi06&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dwivedi |first1=Sunita |last2=Lama |first2=Dalai (foreword) |authorlink2=14th Dalai Lama |title=Buddhist heritage sites of India|date=2006 |publisher=Rupa &amp; Co. |location=New Delhi |isbn=8129107384}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stupa was built in the 2nd century BCE as confirmed by finds of black polished wares and punch-marked coins in the attending monastery.&lt;ref name=DGS&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geary |first1=David |last2=Sayers |first2=Matthew R. |last3=Amar |first3=Abhishek Singh |title=Cross-disciplinary Perspectives on a Contested Buddhist Site: Bodh Gaya Jataka |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136320675 |pages=35–36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f56437oiblUC&amp;pg=PA35|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2013, at around 05:15, a low intensity [[2013 Bodh Gaya blasts|bomb blast]] took place in the 2500-year-old Mahabodhi Temple complex. This was followed by a series of nine low intensity blasts which resulted in two monks being injured; one was Tibetan and the other Burmese. These blasts were carried out by an Islamic terrorist organization. The serial blasts did not cause any damage to the temple or the tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment. Two other bombs, one under the 80-foot statue of the Buddha and the other near Karmapa Temple were defused by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serial Blasts rock Mahabodhi temple in Bodha gaya: terror attack, Center says|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/serial-blasts-rock-mahabodhi-temple-in-bodh-gaya-terror-attack-centre-says/articleshow/20952763.cms|accessdate=7 July 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=7 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709201724/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Serial-blasts-rock-Mahabodhi-Temple-in-Bodh-Gaya-terror-attack-Centre-says/articleshow/20952763.cms|archivedate=9 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blast&gt;{{cite news|title=Nine blasts in Bodh Gaya, 2 injured|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nine-blasts-in-bodh-gaya-2-injured/article4891094.ece|accessdate=7 July 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=7 July 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710180959/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nine-blasts-in-bodh-gaya-2-injured/article4891094.ece|archivedate=10 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of the blast was given to NIA (National Investigating Agency).

[[File:Cathar cross.svg|thumb|right|The [[Occitan cross]] was a "Cathar rallying symbol".&lt;ref&gt;''La vie quotidienne des cathares du Languedoc'', René Nelli.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Catharism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|θ|ər|ɪ|z|əm}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|καθαροί}}, ''katharoi'', "the pure [ones]"){{sfnp|OED|1989|loc = "Cathar"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kaqaro/s|καθαροί|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] or [[gnostic|Gnostic revival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/christianheresyheretics/p/CatharCatharism.htm|title=Cathars &amp; Albigenses: What Was Catharism? What did Cathars Believe?|publisher=About Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; movement that thrived in some areas of [[Southern Europe]], particularly what is now [[northern Italy]] and [[southern France]], between the 12th and 14th centuries. The followers were known as '''Cathars''' and are now mainly remembered for a prolonged period of persecution by the [[Catholic Church]], which did not recognise their belief as being Christian. Catharism appeared in Europe in the [[Languedoc]] region of France in the 11th century and this is when the name first appears. The adherents were sometimes known as '''Albigensians''', after the city [[Albi]] in southern France where the movement first took hold.  The beliefs are believed to have been brought from [[Persia]] or the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Cathar beliefs varied between communities because Catharism was initially taught by [[Asceticism|ascetic]] leaders who set few guidelines. The [[Catholic Church]] denounced its practices including the ''[[Consolamentum]]'' ritual, by which Cathar individuals were baptized and raised to the status of "[[Cathar Perfect|perfect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cathars|last=Lambert|first=Malcolm|publisher=Blackwell|year=1998|isbn=0-631-14343-2|location=Oxford|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catharism may have had its roots in the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] movement in [[Armenia]] and eastern [[Byzantine]] Anatolia and certainly in the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Cathars |title=Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe |editor-first=Edward |editor-last=Peters |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1980 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were influenced by the Paulicians resettled in [[Thrace]] ([[Plovdiv|Philipopolis]]) by the Byzantines. Though the term ''Cathar'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|θ|ɑː|r}}) has been used for centuries to identify the movement, whether the movement identified itself with this name is debated.{{sfnp|Pegg|2001a|pp=181 ff}} In Cathar texts, the terms ''Good Men'' (''Bons Hommes''), ''Good Women'' (''Bonnes Femmes''), or ''Good Christians'' (''Bons Chrétiens'') are the common terms of [[self-identification]].{{sfnp|Théry|2002|pp=75–117}}

The idea of two gods or principles, one good and the other evil, was central to Cathar beliefs. The good [[God]] was the God of the [[New Testament]] and the creator of the spiritual realm, contrasted with the evil [[Old Testament]] God,  creator of the physical world whom many Cathars, and particularly their persecutors, identified as Satan.&lt;ref&gt;James Wasserman ''The Templars and the Assassins: The Militia of Heaven'' Simon and Schuster 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-594-77873-5}} page&lt;/ref&gt; All visible matter, including the human body, was created by this evil god; matter was therefore tainted with [[sin]]. This was antithetical to the monotheistic Catholic Church, whose fundamental principle was that there was only one God, who created all things visible and invisible.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Nicene Creed]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cathars thought human [[spirit]]s were the genderless spirits of [[angel]]s trapped within the physical creation of the evil god, destined to be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] until they achieved salvation through the consolamentum.{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}}

From the beginning of his reign, [[Pope Innocent III]] attempted to end Catharism by sending missionaries and by persuading the local authorities to act against them. In 1208, Innocent's papal legate [[Pierre de Castelnau]] was murdered while returning to [[Rome]] after excommunicating [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse|Count Raymond VI of Toulouse]], who, in his view, was too lenient with the Cathars.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=15–16}} Pope Innocent III then abandoned the option of sending Catholic [[missionary|missionaries]] and [[jurist]]s, declared Pierre de Castelnau a [[Christian martyrs|martyr]] and launched the [[Albigensian Crusade]] which all but ended Catharism.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=15–16}}{{sfnp|Madaule|1967|pp=56–63}}

==Origins==
[[File:Spread of Paulicanism.png|alt=|thumb|300x300px|[[Paulicianism]] and Europe]]
The origins of the Cathars' beliefs are unclear, but most theories agree they came from the [[Byzantine Empire]], mostly by the [[trade route]]s and spread from the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] to the Netherlands. The name of [[Bulgarians]] (''Bougres'') was also applied to the Albigensians, and they maintained an association with the similar Christian movement of the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] ("Friends of God") of [[Thrace]]. "That there was a substantial transmission of ritual and ideas from Bogomilism to Catharism is beyond reasonable doubt."{{sfnp|Lambert|1998|p=31}} Their doctrines have numerous resemblances to those of the Bogomils and the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], who influenced them,{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|p=505}} as well as the earlier [[Marcionites]], who were found in the same areas as the Paulicians, the [[Manicheans]] and the Christian [[Gnostics]] of the first few centuries AD, although, as many scholars, most notably [[Mark Gregory Pegg|Mark Pegg]], have pointed out, it would be erroneous to extrapolate direct, historical connections based on theoretical similarities perceived by modern scholars.

[[John Damascene]], writing in the 8th century AD, also notes of an earlier sect called the "Cathari", in his book ''On Heresies'', taken from the epitome provided by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in his ''[[Panarion]]''. He says of them: "They absolutely reject those who marry a second time, and reject the possibility of penance [that is, forgiveness of sins after baptism]".{{sfnp|John of Damascus|2012|p=125}} These are probably the same Cathari (actually Novations) who are mentioned in Canon 8 of the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea in the year 325, which states "... [I]f those called Cathari come over [to the faith], let them first make profession that they are willing to communicate [share [[full communion]]] with the twice-married, and grant pardon to those who have lapsed&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfnp|Schaff|Wace|1994|p=20}}

It is likely that we have only a partial view of their beliefs, because the writings of the Cathars were mostly destroyed because of the doctrinal threat perceived by the Papacy;{{sfnp|Murphy|2012|pp=26–27}} much of our existing knowledge of the Cathars is derived from their opponents.  Conclusions about Cathar ideology continue to be debated with commentators regularly accusing their opponents of speculation, distortion and bias. There are a few texts from the Cathars themselves which were preserved by their opponents (the ''Rituel Cathare de Lyon'') which give a glimpse of the inner workings of their faith, but these still leave many questions unanswered.{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|p=505}}  One large text which has survived, ''The Book of Two Principles'' (''Liber de duobus principiis''),{{sfnp|Dondaine|1939}} elaborates the principles of dualistic theology from the point of view of some of the [[Albanenses]] Cathars.{{sfnp|Wakefield|Evans|1991|pp=511–515}}

[[File:Routes des châteaux cathares.svg|thumb|left|A map signifying the routes of the Cathar castles (blue squares and lines) in the south of France around the turn of the 13th century]]

It is now generally agreed by most scholars that identifiable historical Catharism did not emerge until at least 1143, when the first confirmed report of a group espousing similar beliefs is reported being active at Cologne by the cleric Eberwin of Steinfeld.&lt;ref&gt;See especially [[R.&amp;nbsp;I. Moore]]'s ''The Origins of European Dissent'', and the collection of essays ''Heresy and the Persecuting Society in the Middle Ages: Essays on the Work of R.I. Moore'' for a consideration of the origins of the Cathars, and proof against identifying earlier heretics in the West, such as those identified in 1025 at Monforte, outside [[Milan]], as being Cathars.  Also see ''Heresies of the High Middle Ages'', a collection of pertinent documents on Western heresies of the High Middle Ages, edited by Walter Wakefield and Austin P. Evans.&lt;/ref&gt; A landmark in the "institutional history" of the Cathars was the [[Council of Saint-Félix|Council]], held in 1167 at [[Saint-Félix-Lauragais]], attended by many local figures and also by the [[Bogomilism|Bogomil]] ''papa'' [[Nicetas, Bogomil bishop|Nicetas]], the Cathar bishop of [[France|(northern) France]] and a leader of the Cathars of [[Lombardy]].

The Cathars were largely local, Western European/Latin Christian phenomena, springing up in the Rhineland cities (particularly Cologne) in the mid-[[12th century]], northern [[France]] around the same time, and particularly the [[Languedoc]]—and the northern Italian cities in the mid-late 12th century. In the Languedoc and northern [[Italy]], the Cathars attained their greatest popularity, surviving in the Languedoc, in much reduced form, up to around 1325 and in the Italian cities until the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisitions]] of the fourteenth century finally extirpated them.&lt;ref name="Ladurie"&gt;See Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie's ''Montaillou: the Promised Land of Error'' for an analysis of the social context of these last Languedoc Cathars, and ''Power and Purity'' by Carol Lansing for a consideration of 13th-century Catharism in Orvieto.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General beliefs==
Cathars, in general, formed an anti-[[sacerdotal]] party in opposition to the pre-Reformation Christian Church, protesting against what they perceived to be the moral, spiritual and political corruption of the church.{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|p=505}}

When [[Folquet de Marselha|Bishop Fulk]] of [[Toulouse]], a key leader of the anti-Cathar persecutions, excoriated the [[Militia of the Faith of Jesus Christ|Languedoc Knights]] for not pursuing the heretics more diligently, he received the reply, "We cannot. We have been reared in their midst. We have relatives among them and we see them living lives of perfection."{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=42}}

===Sacraments===
In contrast to the Catholic Church, the Cathars had but one central rite, the [[Consolamentum]], or Consolation. This involved a brief spiritual ceremony to remove all sin from the believer and to induct him or her into the next higher level as a perfect.{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}}

Many believers would receive the Consolamentum as death drew near, performing the ritual of liberation at a moment when the heavy obligations of purity required of Perfecti would be temporally short. Some of those who received the sacrament of the consolamentum upon their death-beds may thereafter have shunned further food or drink and, more often and in addition, expose themselves to extreme cold, in order to speed death.  This has been termed the ''endura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Alexander | authorlink = | title = Suicide in the Middle Ages | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = | location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zsw1jJx5t9YC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=endura+cathar| doi =  | isbn = 0-19-820539-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by some of the church writers that when a Cathar, after receiving the Consolamentum, began to show signs of recovery he or she would be smothered in order to ensure his or her entry into paradise. Other than at such moments of ''extremis'', little evidence exists to suggest this was a common Cathar practice.{{sfnp|Barber|2000|pp =103–104}}

The Cathars also refused the sacrament of the [[eucharist]] saying that it could not possibly be the body of Christ. They also refused to partake in the practice of [[Baptism]] by water. The following two quotes are taken from the [[Inquisitor]] [[Bernard Gui]]'s experiences with the Cathar practices and beliefs:
{{Quote|Then they attack and vituperate, in turn, all the [[sacraments]] of the Church, especially the sacrament of the [[eucharist]], saying that it cannot contain the body of Christ, for had this been as great as the largest mountain Christians would have entirely consumed it before this. They assert that the host comes from straw, that it passes through the tails of horses, to wit, when the flour is cleaned by a sieve (of horse hair); that, moreover, it passes through the body and comes to a vile end, which, they say, could not happen if God were in it.{{sfnp|Burr|1996}}

Of baptism, they assert that the water is material and corruptible and is therefore the creation of the evil power, and cannot sanctify the spirit, but that the churchmen sell this water out of avarice, just as they sell earth for the burial of the dead, and oil to the sick when they anoint them, and as they sell the confession of sins as made to the priests.{{sfnp|Burr|1996}}}}

===Theology===
Some believe that the Catharist conception of Jesus resembled [[nontrinitarian]] [[modalistic monarchianism]] ([[Sabellianism]]) in the West and [[adoptionism]] in the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Columbia Encyclopedia | year = 2007 | publisher = Columbia University Press | contribution = Cathari}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Albigensians | title = Encyclopaedia 2 | publisher = The Free dictionary | contribution = Albigensians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard of Clairvaux]]'s biographer and other sources accuse some Cathars of [[Arianism]],{{sfnp|Lambert|1998|p=41|ps=: "Bernard's biographer identifies another group in Toulouse which he calls Arians, who have sometimes been identified as Cathars though the evidence is scant. It is most likely that the first Cathars to penetrate Languedoc appealed..."}}{{sfnp|Luscombe|Riley-Smith|2004|p=522|ps=: "Even though his biographer does not describe their beliefs, Arians would have been an appropriate label for moderate dualists with an unorthodox Christology, and the term was certainly later used in Languedoc to describe Cathars."}} and some scholars see Cathar Christology as having traces of earlier Arian roots.{{sfnp|Johnston|2011|p=115|ps=: "However, they became converts to Arian Christianity, which later developed into Catharism. Arian and Cathar doctrines were sufficiently different from Catholic doctrine that the two branches were incompatible."}}{{sfnp|Kienzle|2001|p=92|ps=: "The term 'Arian' is often joined with 'Manichean' to designate Cathars. Geoffrey's comment implies that he and others called those heretics 'weavers', whereas they called themselves 'Arians'."}} According to some of their contemporary enemies{{who|date=August 2017}} Cathars did not accept the normative Trinitarian understanding of Jesus, but considered him the human form of an angel similar to [[Docetic]] Christology.{{sfnp|Townsend|2008|p=9|ps=: "The Cathars did not accept the Church doctrine of Jesus being the 'Son of God'. They believed that Jesus was not embodied in the human form but an angel (Docetic Christology), which echoed back to the Arian controversy."}} [[Zoé Oldenbourg]] (2000) compared the Cathars to "Western Buddhists" because she considered that their view of the doctrine of "resurrection" taught by Jesus was, in fact, similar to the Buddhist doctrine of [[reincarnation]].{{sfnp|Maseko|2008|p=482|ps=: "In the book 'Massacre at Montsegur' (a book widely regarded by medievalists as having a pronounced, pro-Cathar bias) the Cathars are referred to as 'Western Buddhists' because of their belief that the Doctrine of 'resurrection' taught."}}{{self-published inline|date=September 2018|certain=y}} The Cathars taught that to regain angelic status one had to renounce the material self completely. Until one was prepared to do so, he/she would be stuck in a cycle of reincarnation, condemned to live on the corrupt Earth.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=11}}

The alleged sacred texts of the Cathars besides the ''[[New Testament]]'', include ''The [[Gospel of the Secret Supper]], or John's Interrogation'' and ''The Book of the Two Principles''.&lt;ref&gt;The Gnostic Bible, Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social relationships===
Killing was abhorrent to the Cathars. Consequently, abstention from all animal food ([[Pescetarianism|sometimes exempting fish]]) was enjoined of the Perfecti. The Perfecti avoided eating anything considered to be a by-product of sexual reproduction.{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}} War and [[capital punishment]] were also condemned—an abnormality in Medieval Europe. In a world where few could read, their rejection of oath-taking marked them as social outcasts.

To the Cathars, reproduction was a moral evil to be avoided, as it continued the chain of reincarnation and suffering in the material world. It was claimed by their opponents that, given this loathing for procreation, they generally resorted to [[sodomy]]. Such was the situation that a charge of heresy leveled against a suspected Cathar was usually dismissed if the accused could show he was legally married.

[[File:Berruguete ordeal.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Pedro Berruguete]] portraying the story of a disputation between [[Saint Dominic]] and the Cathars (Albigensians), in which the books of both were thrown on a fire and Dominic's books were miraculously preserved from the flames]]

===Organization===
It has been alleged that the Cathar Church of the Languedoc had a relatively [[Flat organization|flat structure]], distinguishing between the baptised ''perfecti'' (a term they did not use; instead, ''bonhommes'') and ordinary unbaptised believers (''credentes'').{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}} By about 1140, liturgy and a system of doctrine had been established.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=49–50}} They created a number of [[Episcopal see|bishoprics]], first at [[Albi]] around 1165 {{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=2–4}} and after the 1167 Council at [[Saint-Félix-Lauragais]] sites at [[Toulouse]], [[Carcassonne]], and [[Agen]], so that four bishoprics were in existence by 1200.{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}}{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=49–50}}{{sfnp|Lambert|1998|p=70}}{{sfnp|Lambert|2002|p=140}} In about 1225, during a lull in the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the bishopric of [[Razès]] was added. Bishops were supported by their two assistants: a ''filius maior'' (typically the successor) and a ''filius minor'', who were further assisted by deacons.{{sfnp|Moore|1995|p=137}} The ''perfecti'' were the spiritual elite, highly respected by many of the local people, leading a life of austerity and charity.{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}} In the apostolic fashion they ministered to the people and travelled in pairs.{{sfnp|Johnston|2000|p=252}}

===Role of women and gender===

[[File:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|left|Cathars being expelled from Carcassonne in 1209. In this group, women appear to be nearly as numerous as men.]]

Catharism has been seen as giving women the greatest opportunities for independent action since women were found as being believers as well as Perfecti, who were able to administer the sacrament of the ''consolamentum.''{{sfnp|Ward|2002|pp=241–42}}

Cathars believed that one would be repeatedly [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] until one commits to the self-denial of the material world. A man could be reincarnated as a woman and [[Vice-versa|vice versa]], thereby rendering gender meaningless.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=10–12}} The spirit was of utmost importance to the Cathars and was described as being [[wikt:Special:Search/immaterial|immaterial]] and [[sex]]less.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=10–12}} Because of this belief, the Cathars saw women as equally capable of being spiritual leaders, which undermined the very concept of gender as held by the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=25–26}}

Women accused of being [[Heresy|heretics]] in early [[medieval Christianity]] included those labeled [[Gnostics]], Cathars, and [[Beguines]], as well as several other groups that were sometimes "tortured and executed".{{sfnp|Clark|2001|p=412}} Cathars, like the Gnostics who preceded them, assigned more importance to the role of [[Mary Magdalene]] in the spread of early [[Christianity]] than the church previously did. Her vital role as a teacher contributed to the Cathar belief that women could serve as spiritual leaders. Women were found to be included in the Perfecti in significant numbers, with numerous receiving the ''consolamentum'' after being widowed.{{sfnp|Ward|2002|pp=241–42}} Having reverence for the [[Gospel of John]], the Cathars saw Mary Magdalene as perhaps even more important than [[Saint Peter]], the founder of the church.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=80–81}}

The Cathar movement proved successful in gaining female followers because of its [[proto-feminist]] teachings along with the general feeling of exclusion from the Catholic church. Catharism attracted numerous women with the promise of a leadership role that the Catholic Church did not allow.{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}} Catharism let women become a [[Cathar Perfect|perfect]] of the faith, a position of far more prestige than anything the Catholic Church offered.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=40–43}} These female perfects were required to adhere to a strict and ascetic lifestyle, but were still able to have their own houses.{{sfnp|Kaelber|1997|p=120}} Although many women found something attractive in Catharism, not all found its teachings convincing. A notable example is [[Hildegard of Bingen]], who in 1163 gave a widely renowned [[sermon]] against the Cathars in [[Cologne]]. During this speech, Hildegard announced a state of eternal punishment and [[damnation]] to all those who accepted Cathar beliefs.{{sfnp|Newman|1998|pp=753–755}}

While women perfects rarely traveled to preach the faith, they still played a vital role in the spreading of the Catharism by establishing group homes for women.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=41}} Though it was extremely uncommon, there were isolated cases of female Cathars leaving their homes to spread the faith.{{sfnp|Weis|2001|p=122}} In Cathar communal homes (ostals), women were educated in the faith, and these women would go on to bear children who would then also become believers. Through this pattern the faith grew [[exponential function|exponentially]] through the efforts of women as each generation passed.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=41}} Among some groups of Cathars there were more women than there were men.{{sfnp|Walther|1965|p=167}}

Despite women having an instrumental role in the growing of the faith, [[misogyny]] was not completely absent from the Cathar movement. Some seemingly misogynistic Cathar beliefs include that one's last [[incarnation]] had to be experienced as a man to break the cycle.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=42}} This belief was inspired by later French Cathars, which taught that women must be reborn as men in order to achieve [[salvation]].{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}} Another one was that the sexual allure of women impeded man's ability to reject the material world.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=42}} Toward the end of the Cathar movement, Catharism became more misogynistic and started the practice of excluding women perfects.{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}} However, the influence of these type of misogynistic beliefs and practices remained limited (Later Italian perfects still included women.{{sfnp|Schaus|2006|p=114}})

==Suppression==
[[File:Garotte - Excerpt from Pedro Berruguete - Saint Dominic Presiding over an Auto-da-fe.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cathars being burnt at the stake in an ''[[auto-de-fé]]'' presided over by Saint Dominic, as depicted by [[Pedro Berruguete]]]]
In 1147, [[Pope Eugene III]] sent a [[Papal legate|legate]] to the Cathar district in order to arrest the progress of the Cathars. The few isolated successes of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] could not obscure the poor results of this mission, which clearly showed the power of the sect in the Languedoc at that period. The missions of [[Cardinal Peter of St. Chrysogonus]] to Toulouse and the Toulousain in 1178, and of [[Henry of Marcy]], [[cardinal-bishop of Albano]], in 1180–81, obtained merely momentary successes.{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|p=505}} Henry's armed expedition, which took the stronghold at [[Lavaur, Tarn|Lavaur]], did not extinguish the movement.

Decisions of Catholic Church councils—in particular, those of the Council of [[Tours]] (1163) and of the [[Third Council of the Lateran]] (1179)—had scarcely more effect upon the Cathars. When [[Pope Innocent III]] came to power in 1198, he was resolved to deal with them.{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|pp=505–506}}

At first Innocent tried peaceful conversion, and sent a number of legates into the Cathar regions. They had to contend not only with the Cathars, the nobles who protected them, and the people who respected them, but also with many of the [[bishop]]s of the region, who resented the considerable authority the [[Pope]] had conferred upon his legates. In 1204, Innocent III suspended a number of bishops in [[Occitania]];{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|p=506}} in 1205 he appointed a new and vigorous [[bishop of Toulouse]], the former [[troubadour]] [[Folquet de Marselha|Foulques]]. In 1206 [[Diego of Osma]] and his canon, the future [[Saint Dominic]], began a programme of conversion in Languedoc; as part of this, Catholic-Cathar public debates were held at [[Verfeil, Haute-Garonne|Verfeil]], [[Servian (commune)|Servian]], [[Pamiers]], [[Montréal, Aude|Montréal]] and elsewhere.

Dominic met and debated with the Cathars in 1203 during his mission to the Languedoc. He concluded that only preachers who displayed real sanctity, humility and asceticism could win over convinced Cathar believers. The institutional Church as a general rule did not possess these spiritual warrants.{{sfnp|Johnson|1976|p=251}} His conviction led eventually to the establishment of the [[Dominican Order]] in 1216. The order was to live up to the terms of his famous rebuke, "Zeal must be met by zeal, humility by humility, false sanctity by real sanctity, preaching falsehood by preaching truth." However, even Dominic managed only a few converts among the Cathari.

===Albigensian Crusade===
{{main article|Albigensian Crusade}}
{{refimprove section|date = July 2014}}
[[File:Albigensian Crusade 01.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Pope Innocent III]] excommunicating the Albigensians (left), Massacre against the Albigensians by the crusaders (right)]]
In January 1208 the papal legate, [[Pierre de Castelnau]]—a [[Cistercian]] monk, theologian and canon lawyer—was sent to meet the ruler of the area, [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse]].{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=68–69}} Known for excommunicating noblemen who protected the Cathars, Castelnau [[excommunicate]]d Raymond for [[abettor|abetting]] heresy following an allegedly fierce argument during which Raymond supposedly threatened Castelnau with violence.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=72–73}} Shortly thereafter, Castelnau was murdered as he returned to Rome, allegedly by a knight in the service of Count Raymond. His body was returned and laid to rest in the Abbey at Saint Gilles.

As soon as he heard of the murder, the Pope ordered the legates to preach a [[Albigensian Crusade|crusade]] against the Cathars and wrote a letter to [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus, King of France]], appealing for his intervention—or an intervention led by his son, [[Louis VIII of France|Louis]]. This was not the first appeal but some see the murder of the legate as a turning point in papal policy. Others claim it as a fortuitous event in allowing the Pope to excite popular opinion and to renew his pleas for intervention in the south. The chronicler of the crusade which followed, [[Peter of Vaux de Cernay]], portrays the sequence of events in such a way that, having failed in his effort to peaceably demonstrate the errors of Catharism, the Pope then called a formal crusade, appointing a series of leaders to head the assault.

The French King refused to lead the crusade himself, and could not spare his son to do so either—despite his victory against [[John, King of England]], there were still pressing issues with Flanders and the empire and the threat of an [[House of Châteaudun|Angevin]] revival. Philip did however sanction the participation of some of his more bellicose and ambitious—some might say dangerous—barons, notably [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] and Bouchard de Marly. There followed twenty years of war against the Cathars and their allies in the Languedoc: the Albigensian Crusade.

[[File:Carcasonneouterwall.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Cité de Carcassonne]] today]]

This war pitted the nobles of France against those of the Languedoc. The widespread northern enthusiasm for the Crusade was partially inspired by a papal decree permitting the confiscation of lands owned by Cathars and their supporters. This not only angered the lords of the south but also the French King, who was at least nominally the [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] of the lords whose lands were now open to [[Plunder|despoliation]] and seizure. Philip Augustus wrote to Pope Innocent in strong terms to point this out—but the Pope did not change his policy. As the Languedoc was supposedly teeming with Cathars and Cathar sympathisers, this made the region a target for northern French noblemen looking to acquire new fiefs. The barons of the north headed south to do battle.

Their first target was the lands of the Trencavel, powerful lords of Carcassonne, Béziers, Albi and the Razes. Little was done to form a regional coalition and the crusading army was able to take Carcassonne, the Trencavel capital, incarcerating [[Raymond Roger Trencavel]] in his own citadel where he died within three months; champions of the [[Occitania|Occitan]] cause claimed that he was murdered. Simon de Montfort was granted the Trencavel lands by the Pope and did homage for them to the King of France, thus incurring the enmity of [[Peter II of Aragon]] who had held aloof from the conflict, even acting as a mediator at the time of the siege of Carcassonne. The remainder of the first of the two Cathar wars now focused on Simon's attempt to hold on to his gains through winters where he was faced, with only a small force of confederates operating from the main winter camp at Fanjeaux, with the desertion of local lords who had sworn fealty to him out of necessity—and attempts to enlarge his newfound domains in the summer when his forces were greatly augmented by reinforcements from France, Germany and elsewhere.

Summer campaigns saw him not only retake, sometimes with brutal reprisals, what he had lost in the "close" season, but also seek to widen his sphere of operation—and we see him in action in the Aveyron at St. Antonin and on the banks of the Rhone at Beaucaire. Simon's greatest triumph was the victory against superior numbers at the [[Battle of Muret]]—a battle which saw not only the defeat of Raymond of Toulouse and his Occitan allies—but also the death of Peter of Aragon—and the effective end of the ambitions of the house of Aragon/Barcelona in the Languedoc. This was in the medium and longer term of much greater significance to the royal house of France than it was to de Montfort—and with the battle of Bouvines was to secure the position of Philip Augustus vis a vis England and the Empire. The [[Battle of Muret]] was a massive step in the creation of the unified French kingdom and the country we know today—although Edward III, the Black Prince and Henry V would threaten later to shake these foundations.

===Massacre===
[[File:Dame guiraude supplice.jpg|thumb|210px|Massacre against the Albigensians by the crusaders]]
The crusader army came under the command, both spiritually and militarily, of the [[papal legate]] [[Arnaud-Amaury]], [[Abbot]] of [[Cîteaux]]. In the first significant engagement of the war, the town of [[Béziers]] was [[siege|besieged]] on 22 July 1209.  The Catholic inhabitants of the city were granted the freedom to leave unharmed, but many refused and opted to stay and fight alongside the Cathars.

The Cathars spent much of 1209 fending off the crusaders. The Béziers army attempted a [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] but was quickly defeated, then pursued by the crusaders back through the gates and into the city. Arnaud-Amaury, the Cistercian abbot-commander, is supposed to have been asked how to tell Cathars from [[Catholics]]. His reply, recalled by [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]], a fellow [[Cistercian]], thirty years later was ''"[[Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius]]"''—"Kill them all, the Lord will recognise His own".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eis | first = Caesarius | last = of Heisterbach | title = Caesarius Heiserbacencis monachi ordinis Cisterciensis, Dialogus miraculorum | editor-first = J | editor-last = Strange | place = Cologne | year = 1851 | publisher = JM Heberle | volume = 2 | pages = 296–8}}. Caesarius (c) was a Cistercian Master of Novices.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Moore|2003|p=180}}  The doors of the church of St Mary Magdalene were broken down and the refugees dragged out and slaughtered.  Reportedly at least 7,000 innocent men, women and children were killed there by Catholic forces.  Elsewhere in the town, many more thousands were mutilated and killed. Prisoners were blinded, dragged behind horses, and used for target practice.{{sfnp|Johnson|1976|p=252}}  What remained of the city was razed by fire. Arnaud-Amaury wrote to [[Pope Innocent III]], "Today your Holiness, twenty thousand heretics were put to the sword, regardless of rank, age, or sex."{{sfnp|Innocent III|1855|loc=Vol. 216}}{{sfnp|Sibly|Sibly|2003|p=128}} "The permanent population of Béziers at that time was then probably no more than 5,000, but local refugees seeking shelter within the city walls could conceivably have increased the number to 20,000."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Church Schism and Corruption|last=Maseko|first=Achim Nkosi|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=Durban, South Africa|pages=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=September 2018|certain=y}}

After the success of his siege of [[Carcassonne]], which followed the [[Massacre at Béziers]] in 1209, Simon de Montfort was designated as leader of the Crusader army. Prominent opponents of the Crusaders were [[Raymond Roger Trencavel]], viscount of Carcassonne, and his feudal overlord [[Peter II of Aragon|Peter II]], the king of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], who held fiefdoms and had a number of vassals in the region. Peter died fighting against the crusade on 12 September 1213 at the [[Battle of Muret]]. Simon de Montfort was killed on 25 June 1218 after maintaining [[Siege of Toulouse (1217–1218)|a siege of Toulouse]] for nine months.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chanson de la Croisade Albigeoise]]'' laisse 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaty and persecution===
[[File:Filip2 albigensti.jpg|thumb|210px|The burning of the Cathar heretics]]
The official war ended in the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)]], by which the king of France dispossessed the [[house of Toulouse]] of the greater part of its [[fiefdom|fiefs]], and that of the Trencavels ([[Viscount]]s of Béziers and Carcassonne) of the whole of their fiefs. The independence of the princes of the Languedoc was at an end. But in spite of the wholesale massacre of Cathars during the war, Catharism was not yet extinguished and Catholic forces would continue to pursue Cathars.{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|p=506}}

In 1215, the bishops of the Catholic Church met at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] under [[Pope Innocent III]]; part of the agenda was combating the Cathar heresy.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=179–81}}

The [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] was established in 1233 to uproot the remaining Cathars.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=230–232}} Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, [[Carcassonne]] and other towns during the whole of the 13th century, and a great part of the 14th, it succeeded in crushing Catharism as a popular movement and driving its remaining adherents underground.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=230–232}} Cathars who refused to recant were hanged, or burnt at the stake.{{sfnp|Martin|2005|pp=105–121}}

On Friday, 13 May 1239, 183 men and women convinced of Catharism were burned at the stake on the orders of Robert le Bougre. Mount Guimar was already denounced as a place of heresy by the letter of the bishop of Liège to Pope Lucius II in 1144. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], bishop of Hippo, had expelled from the city a Fortunatus who had fled Africa in 392; he is a Fortunatus who is reported as a monk from Africa and protected by the lord of Widomarum.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Mont Aimé]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;«Ce lieu est terrible, le Mont-Aimé en Champagne », père Albert Mathieu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://data.bnf.fr/15058149/albert_mathieu/&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar fortress of [[Montségur]] was besieged by the troops of the [[seneschal]] of Carcassonne and the [[archbishop of Narbonne]].{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=238–40}} On 16 March 1244, a large and symbolically important massacre took place, where over 200 [[Cathar Perfect]]s were burnt in an enormous pyre at the ''prat dels cremats'' ("field of the burned") near the foot of the castle.{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=238–40}} Moreover, the church decreed lesser chastisements against laymen suspected of sympathy with Cathars, at the 1235 Council of [[Narbonne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = [[Papal Bull|Bull]] | author-link = Pope Innocent IV| last = Innocent IV | title = [[Ad extirpanda]] | year = 1252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CatharCross.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Inquisitors required heretical sympathisers—repentant first offenders—to sew a yellow cross onto their clothes.{{sfnp|Weis|2001|pp=11–12}}]]

A popular though as yet unsubstantiated theory holds that a small party of Cathar Perfects escaped from the fortress before the massacre at ''prat dels cremats''. It is widely held in the Cathar region to this day that the escapees took with them ''le trésor cathar''. What this treasure consisted of has been a matter of considerable speculation: claims range from sacred Gnostic texts to the Cathars' accumulated wealth, which might have included the Holy Grail (see the Section on Historical Scholarship, below).

Hunted by the Inquisition and deserted by the nobles of their districts, the Cathars became more and more scattered fugitives: meeting surreptitiously in forests and mountain wilds. Later insurrections broke out under the leadership of [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix]], [[Aimery III of Narbonne]], and [[Bernard Délicieux]], a Franciscan friar later prosecuted for his adherence to another heretical movement, that of the [[Fraticelli|Spiritual Franciscans]] at the beginning of the 14th century. But by this time the Inquisition had grown very powerful. Consequently, many presumed to be Cathars were summoned to appear before it. Precise indications of this are found in the registers of the Inquisitors, [[Bernard of Caux]], [[Jean de St Pierre]], [[Geoffroy d'Ablis]], and others.{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|p=506}} The parfaits it was said only rarely recanted, and hundreds were burnt. Repentant lay believers were punished, but their lives were spared as long as they did not relapse. Having recanted, they were obliged to sew yellow crosses onto their outdoor clothing and to live apart from other Catholics, at least for a while.

===Annihilation===
After several decades of harassment and re-proselytising, and, perhaps even more important, the systematic destruction of their religious texts, the sect was exhausted and could find no more adepts. The leader of a Cathar revival in the Pyrenean foothills, [[Peire Autier]] was captured and executed in April 1310 in Toulouse.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=237–38}}{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=242–43}} After 1330, the records of the Inquisition contain very few proceedings against Cathars.{{sfnp|Alphandéry|1911|p=506}} The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc, [[Guillaume Bélibaste]], was executed in the autumn of 1321.{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|pp=239–46}}{{sfnp|Sumption|1999|pp=242–43}}

From the mid-12th century onwards, Italian Catharism came under increasing pressure from the Pope and the Inquisition, "spelling the beginning of the end".{{sfnp|O'Shea|2000|p=230}} Other movements, such as the [[Waldensians]] and the pantheistic [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]], which suffered persecution in the same area, survived in remote areas and in small numbers into the 14th and 15th centuries. Some Waldensian ideas were absorbed into other [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] sects, such as the [[Hussites]], [[Lollards]], and the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut|Herrnhuters of Germany]]). Cathars were in no way Protestant, and very few if any Protestants consider them as their forerunners (as opposed to groups like [[Waldensians]], [[Hussites]], [[Lollards]], and [[Arnoldists]]).

==Later history==
After the suppression of Catharism, the descendants of Cathars were at times required to live outside towns and their defences. They thus retained a certain Cathar identity, despite having returned to the Catholic religion.

Any use of the term "Cathar" to refer to people after the suppression of Catharism in the 14th century is a cultural or ancestral reference, and has no religious implication{{fact|date=June 2018}}. Nevertheless, interest in the Cathars, their history, legacy and beliefs continues.

===''Pays Cathare''===
[[File:Montsegur-w02.jpg|thumb|The castle of [[Château de Montségur|Montségur]] was razed after 1244. The current fortress follows French [[Military engineering|military architecture]] of the 17th century.]]
The term ''Pays Cathare'', French meaning "Cathar Country", is used to highlight the Cathar heritage and history of the region where Catharism was traditionally strongest. This area is centred around fortresses such as [[Château de Montségur|Montségur]] and [[Carcassonne]]; also the French [[departments of France|département]] of the [[Aude]] uses the title ''Pays Cathare'' in tourist brochures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.payscathare.com/www/contenu/d_payscathare.asp |title=Pays Cathare}}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas have ruins from the wars against the Cathars which are still visible today.

Some{{who|date=April 2018}} criticise the promotion of the identity of ''Pays Cathare'' as an exaggeration for [[tourism|tourist]] purposes. Many of the promoted [[Cathar castles]] were not built by Cathars but by local lords and later many of them were rebuilt and extended for strategic purposes.{{or-inline|date=April 2018}} Good examples of these are the magnificent castles of [[Queribus]] and [[Peyrepertuse]] which are both perched on the side of precipitous drops on the last folds of the Corbieres mountains. They were for several hundred years frontier fortresses belonging to the French crown and most of what is still there dates from a post-Cathar era. Many consider the [[County of Foix]] to be the actual historical centre of Catharism.

==Interrogation of heretics==
In an effort to find the few remaining heretics in and around the village of [[Montaillou]], Jacques Fournier, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pamiers|Bishop of Pamiers]], future [[Pope Benedict XII]], had those suspected of heresy interrogated in the presence of scribes who recorded their conversations.  The late 13th- to early-14th-century document, discovered in the Vatican archives in the 1960s and edited by [[Jean Duvernoy]], is the basis for [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s work ''[[Montaillou (book)|Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error]]''.&lt;ref name="Ladurie"/&gt;

==Historical scholarship==
The publication of the early scholarly book ''Crusade Against the Grail'' by the young German [[Otto Rahn]] in the 1930s rekindled interest in the connection between the Cathars and the [[Holy Grail]], especially in Germany. Rahn was convinced that the 13th-century work ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] was a veiled account of the Cathars.  The philosopher and Nazi government official [[Alfred Rosenberg]] speaks favourably of the Cathars in ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]''.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg, 1980?"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/TheMythOfThe20thCentury/MythOfThe20thCentury#page/n93/mode/2up/search/cathars | title=Myth of the 20th century | date=c. 1980 | accessdate=25 January 2017 | author=Rosenberg, Alfred | pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic books in English first appeared at the beginning of the millennium: for example, Malcolm Lambert's ''The Cathars''{{sfnp|Lambert|1998}} and Malcolm Barber's ''The Cathars''.{{sfnp|Barber|2000}}

Starting in the 1990s and continuing to the present day, historians like [[R.&amp;nbsp;I. Moore]] have radically challenged the extent to which Catharism, as an institutionalized religion, actually existed. Building on the work of French historians such as Monique Zerner and Uwe Brunn, Moore's ''The War on Heresy''&lt;ref&gt;R.&amp;nbsp;I. Moore, ''War on Heresy''. New York: Belknap Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Catharism was "contrived from the resources of [the] well-stocked imaginations" of churchmen, "with occasional reinforcement from miscellaneous and independent manifestations of local anticlericalism or apostolic enthusiasm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R.&amp;nbsp;I. |last=Moore |title=L.&amp;nbsp;J. Sackville. ''Heresy and Heretics in the Thirteenth Century: The Textual Representations'' |journal=H-France Review |volume=12 |issue=44 |year=2012 |url=https://www.h-france.net/vol12reviews/vol12no44moore.pdf |access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Moore claims that the men and women persecuted as Cathars were not the followers of a secret religion imported from the East, instead they were part of a broader spiritual revival taking place in the later twelfth and early thirteenth century. Moore's work is indicative of a larger [[historiography|historiographical]] trend towards examination of how heresy was constructed by the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Biller |title=review of ''The War on Heresy: Faith and Power in Medieval Europe'', (review no. 1546) |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1546 |access-date=9 October 2015 |website=Reviews in History |postscript=, with R.&amp;nbsp;I. Moore's response.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art and music==
The principal legacy of the Cathar movement is in the poems and songs of the Cathar [[troubadors]], though this artistic legacy is only a smaller part of the wider [[Occitan]] linguistic and artistic heritage. Recent artistic projects concentrating on the Cathar element in Provençal and troubador art include commercial recording projects by Thomas Binkley, electric hurdy-gurdy artist Valentin Clastrier and his CD Heresie dedicated to the church at Cathars,&lt;ref&gt;L'Agonie du Languedoc: Claude Marti / Studio der frühen Musik – Thomas Binkley, dir. EMI "Reflexe" 1C 063-30 132 [LP-Stereo]1975&lt;/ref&gt; La Nef,&lt;ref&gt;La Nef. Montségur: La tragédie cathare. Dorian Recordings.DOR-90243&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jordi Savall]].&lt;ref&gt;Savall The Forgotten Kingdom: The Cathar Tragedy – The Albigensian Crusade AVSA9873 A+C Alia Vox 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Cathars have been depicted or re-interpreted in popular books, video games, and films such as ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'', ''[[The Bone Clocks]]'', the History Channel TV series ''Knightfall'', Damsels in Distress ''[[Labyrinth (novel)|Labyrinth]]'', ''[[The Winter Ghosts]]'', ''[[The Apocalypse Fire (novel)|The Apocalypse Fire]]'', ''[[Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse]]'', [[Paulo Coelho]]'s [[Brida (novel)|Brida]], [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Grail Quest]]'' series, [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]]'s ''[[Flicker (novel)|Flicker]]'', and [[Kathleen McGowan]]'s ''The Magdaline Line'' trilogy.

Catharism, along with other Christian movements including [[Fraticelli]], [[Waldensianism]], and [[Lollardy]], is featured in the [[grand strategy game]] ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'', which is notable as being the only Catholic heresy in-game that allows female priests; it also grants the option of absolute cognatic succession laws (such as [[absolute primogeniture]]) and the appointment of female generals and councilors. This was added as part of the Conclave DLC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Crusader Kings II]], developer:[[Paradox Development Studio]], publisher:[[Paradox Interactive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charodis are believed to have migrated from [[Goa]] in four boats ('char' means four and 'hodi' means boat) which landed in four different places of Karnataka.

[[File:Traditionalfuneralmarch-china-approx-june24-1900.jpg|thumb|Traditional Chinese funeral march, circa 1900]]

'''Chinese funeral rituals''' comprise a set of traditions broadly associated with [[Chinese folk religion]], with different rites depending on the age of the deceased, the cause of death, and the deceased's marital and social statuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traditionscustoms.com/death-rites/chinese-funeral|title=Chinese funeral|last=|first=|date=|website=traditionscustoms.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different rituals are carried out in different parts of China, and many contemporary Chinese people carry out funerals according to various religious faiths such as [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]] or Christianity. However, in general, the funeral ceremony itself is carried out over seven days, and mourners wear funerary dress according to their relationship to the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/14Traditions986.html|title=Funeral Customs|last=|first=|date=|website=traditions.cultural-china.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, white clothing is symbolic of the dead, while red is not usually worn, as it is traditionally the symbolic colour of happiness worn at Chinese weddings.&lt;ref name="laurenmack" /&gt; The number three is significant, with many customary gestures being carried out three times.

While traditionally [[inhumation]] was favoured, in the present day the dead are often [[cremated]] rather than buried, particularly in large cities in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat3/sub69/item101.html|title=FUNERALS IN CHINA|last=Hays|first=Jeffrey|date=|website=factsanddetails.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memorialize.com/Chinese-Cremation-information.php|title=Chinese Cremation: The Intriguing History of a Tradition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.memorialize.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Chinese [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] (MCA), of the 9.77&amp;nbsp;million deaths in 2014, 4.46&amp;nbsp;million, or 45.6%, were cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2015-04/04/content_35243460.htm|title=Less than 50% of China's dead cremated in 2014|last=|first=|date=4 April 2015|website=www.china.org.cn|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Funerary art#China}}
Throughout history, Chinese people have carried out complex funeral rites, with tombs of early rulers rivalling [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tombs in their funerary art and provision for the dead in the [[afterlife]]. The late 3rd century BCE [[Terracotta Army]] contains approximately 9,000 terracotta figures that were buried to protect [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[Emperor of China]].

Traditional burial customs show a strong belief in life after death and the need for [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]] among the living; [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosophy calls for paying respect to one's ancestors as an act of [[filial piety]] (孝 ''xiào'').&lt;ref name="laurenmack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chineseculture.about.com/od/chinesefestivals/a/Chinese-Funeral-Traditions.htm|title=Chinese Funeral|author=Lauren Mack|work=About.com News &amp; Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfcca.sg/en/node/62|title=Funeral Rituals|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sfcca.sg|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideals still inform funeral rites for many Chinese people today.

== Practice ==
It is customary for relatives to hold vigils over the dying, in order to accompany them till the very last moment before entering the afterlife. This process, called ''shou ling'' (守靈), is a way for loved ones to show filial piety and loyalty to the deceased. Family members thus take shifts to watch over a relative on their deathbed.&lt;ref name="baidu.com" /&gt;

It is common to place a white banner over the door of the household to signify that a death has occurred. Families will usually gather to carry out funeral rituals, in order both to show respect for the dead and to strengthen the bonds of the kin group. Those with closer relationships to the dead (i.e. sons and daughters) wear white garments, while more distant relatives wear garments in different colours of white, black, blue and green. The colours red, yellow, and brown are traditionally not worn during the mourning period, which may last up to three years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Before a funeral, an [[obituary]] notice (訃聞) is commonly sent to relatives and friends announcing the date and time of the funeral procession.&lt;ref name="laurenmack" /&gt; The date is usually selected as an auspicious one according to the Chinese fortune calendar (通勝 ''tong sheng'').

The deceased is dressed in clean funeral dress (小殮) in preparation for their departure from the world (人世 ''rén shì'') and journey into the afterlife (來世 ''lei shì'').&lt;ref name="baidu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/60874.htm|title=小殓|work=baidu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dà liàn'' (大殮) is the ritual of transferring the body of deceased into the coffin (入木 ''rù mù''), which will rest in the funeral hall decorated with four character idioms (成语 [[Chengyu|''cheng yu'']]) prior to the burial or cremation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sentosacasket.com/index.asp?p=/static/funeralrundown.html|title=FUNERAL RUNDOWN AND PROCESS &lt;!--with typo: PROSESS in the actual title--&gt; {{!}} 喪禮流程|website=www.sentosacasket.com|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the funeral procession, the ''jiā jì'' (家祭) is held. According to the closeness and status of the family members, they will pay respects (奠) to the deceased.

According to Chinese custom, an elder should never show respect to someone younger. So, if the deceased is a young bachelor, for example, his body cannot be brought home and must remain at the funeral parlor. His parents cannot offer prayers to their son either. Since he was unmarried, he did not have any children who could perform these same rites for him. (This is why the body cannot come into the family home.) If an infant or child dies, no funeral rites are performed either since respect cannot be shown to a younger person. The child is thus buried in silence.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The funeral procession (發引 ''fā yǐn'') is the process of bringing the hearse to the burial site or site of cremation. During the funeral, offerings of food items, incense, and [[joss paper]] are commonly presented. The offering of food and joss paper signifies the continuing interdependence between the deceased and their living descendants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taoist or Buddhist prayers are sometimes carried out by monks, to help the deceased's soul to find peace and escape a fate of becoming a "restless ghost".

Every year at the [[Qingming Festival|Qing Ming Festival]] (清明節), people pay respect to their ancestors by visiting their graves and tidying up their tombstones. Later generations are invited to participate through this process of ancestor veneration (慎終追遠 ''shèn zhōng zhuī yuǎn'').

====United Kingdom and some other English-speaking countries====
{{See also|Forms of address in the United Kingdom}}
The major difference between U.S. practice and that in several other English-speaking countries is the form of address for archbishops and bishops. In Britain and countries whose Roman Catholic usage it directly influenced:
* Archbishop: ''the Most Reverend'' (''Most Rev.''); addressed as ''Your Grace'' rather than ''His Excellency'' or ''Your Excellency''.
* Bishop: "the Right Reverend" (''Rt. Rev.''); formally addressed as ''My Lord'' rather than ''Your Excellency''. This style is an ancient one, and has been used in the western church for more than a thousand years; it corresponds to, but does not derive from, the Italian ''[[Monsignore]]'' and the French ''[[Monseigneur]]''. However, most bishops prefer to be addressed simply as ''Bishop'' (''Bp.'').

In Ireland, and in other countries whose Roman Catholic usage it influenced, all bishops, not archbishops alone, are titled ''the Most Reverend'' (''Most Rev.'').

Clergy are often referred to with the title ''Doctor'' (''Dr.''), or have ''D.D. (Doctor of Divinity)'' placed after their name, where justified by their possession of such degree.

====Italy====
Similar to, and the source of, most of the U.S. English titles, with some variation:
*Diocesan priest: ''The Reverend Diocesan'' (''Rev.do.''); ''Don''.
*Religious priest: ''Padre''; ''Father'' (''Fr.'').
*Religious sister: ''The Reverend Sister'' (''Rev. Sr.'').
*(Permanent) Deacon: ''the Reverend Deacon'' (''Rev. Dcn.''); may be addressed as ''Father'' (''Fr.'').

====The Philippines====
In the predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Philippines]], ecclesiastical address is adapted from American usage. The titles listed below are only used in the most formal occasions by media or official correspondences, save for the simpler forms of address. Post-nominals that indicate educational attainment or membership in a religious order are usually included.

* The [[Pope]] is always given the title ''Ang Kaniyáng Kabanalan'' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for [[His Holiness]]). As such, the Pope is styled, ''Ang Kaniyáng Kabanalan Papa Francisco'' 
* A cardinal is formally styled and addressed as ''Ang Kaniyáng Kabunyian'' (literally, His Illustriousness; [[Philippine English|English]]: [[His Eminence]]). Cardinals are informally addressed as "Cardinal &lt;name&gt;". For example, ''Cardinal Juan''. Unlike in the US or Commonwealth countries, a cardinal's name is always written or printed as "&lt;first name&gt; Cardinal &lt;last name&gt;". For example, ''Juan Cardinal de la Cruz.''
* A bishop is formally titled ''Ang Mahál na Obispo'' ([[Excellency|His Excellency]], the Bishop), and more commonly as ''Ang Lubháng Kagalanggalang'' ("The [[Most Reverend]] &lt;name&gt;"). In the same way, an archbishop is similarly titled ''Ang Mahál na Arsobispo'' (His Excellency, the Archbishop). They are often addressed as "Bishop/Archbishop &lt;name&gt;". For example, ''Bishop Juan de la Cruz'' or ''Archbishop Juan de la Cruz.''
* A [[monsignor]] is formally styled ''Reberendo Monsenyor'' (Reverend Monsignor) although if the monsignor holds extra administrative office, he is styled appropriate to his office. Vicars General, [[Vicar forane|Forane]] and [[Episcopal Vicar|Episcopal]] are styled ''Very Reverend.'' Monsignori are colloquially addressed as "Monsignor" (abbreviated "Msgr."). As defined, the written form of address for such a priest is ''Monsignor (first name) (last name)'' or ''The Reverend Monsignor (first name) (last name)'', while the spoken form of address is ''Monsignor (last name)''.{{Sfn | Secretary of State | 2000 | ps =: “26. For Supernumerary Apostolic Protonotaries, Prelates of Honour and Chaplains of His Holiness there may be used the title 'Monsignor', preceded, where appropriate, by 'Reverend'”.}}
* Priests, both diocesan and those belonging to a religious order, are formally titled ''Reberendo Padre'' (Reverend Father, abbreviated Rev. Fr.) before their given name and surname. Priests are colloquially addressed ''Father'' (abbreviated Fr.) before their name, which may either be a formal name or nickname.
* Deacons are formally titled ''Reberendo'' (Reverend). For example, ''Reverend Juan de la Cruz''. In the country, deacons are rarely titled  "Deacon &lt;name&gt;" as in the United States. Instead, they are colloquially addressed as ''Rev'' as opposed to priests who are addressed as ''Father.''
* Consecrated persons have different styles and addresses.
** Religious sisters are titled as ''Sister'' (abbreviated Sr.). Superiors are optionally called ''Mother'' (abbreviated Mo.) and are usually addressed formally with the title ''Reverend Sister/Mother'' (abbreviated Rev. Sr./Mo.) For example, ''Rev. Sr. Juana de la Cruz, OP''  or ''Rev. Mo. Juana de la Cruz, OSB.'' Contemplative nuns are formally and colloquially called ''Sor'' (short for Soror which is Latin for Sister). Prioresses and Abbesses are formally addressed as ''Reverend Mother.''
** Religious brothers who aren't priests are titled and addressed as ''Brother'' (abbreviated Br.). For example, ''Br. Juan de la Cruz, OFM.'' And like their female counterparts, contemplative monks are addressed and styled as ''Fra'' (short for Frater which is Latin for Brother). Sometimes, monks who are priests are also called ''Fra.'' 

===Eastern Catholic clergy===

Although the styles and titles of Eastern Catholic clergy varies from language to language, in the Greek and Arabic-speaking world the following would be acceptable, but is by no means a full list of appropriate titles. It is notable that surnames are never used except in extra-ecclesial matters or to specify a particular person where many share one Christian name or ordination name. Where not noted, Western titles may be supposed. The following are common in Greek Melkite Catholic usage and in Greek Orthodox usage in the United States.

Bishop / Archbishop: In Arabic, a bishop is styled "Sayedna," while in Syriac-tradition churches, he is styled "[[Mar]]". If an Eastern Catholic Archbishop or Patriarch is made a Cardinal by the Pope, he may be addressed as "His Eminence" or use the hybrid title "His Beatitude and Eminence". 

Priest: In Arabic, "Abouna", and in Greek "Pappas".

Deacon: Identical to a priest in all ways except "Father Deacon" is also heard ("Abouna Shammas" or "Pappas Diakonos").

Subdeacon: Reverend Subdeacon in written address, but the Christian name with or without "Brother" is usually used, except some traditions where "Father Subdeacon" is used. In Arabic, this is confused by the word "Shammas" being used for both the subdeaconate and the deaconate, the distinction being a "Deacon of the Letter" and a "Deacon of the Gospel," respectively. Often a Deacon will be addressed as "Father" and the subdeacon as "Brother" to make the distinction clear.

Reader: Readers are addressed as "Reader" or "Brother" depending on the preference of the addresser.

Seminarians: "Brother" or "Brother Seminarian" is the most common title; the appellation "Father Seminarian" or "Father Student" is not seen outside of rural Greek and Arabic-speaking laity.

Tonsured individuals of no title: Brother.

==Eastern Orthodox Churches==
[[File:Slovo4.jpg|thumb|An Eastern Orthodox priest blesses his congregation at the conclusion of the [[Divine Liturgy]]]]

[[Image:EeJaNaiKaScene.jpg|thumb|"Ee ja nai ka" dancing scene, 1868.]]

{{Nihongo||ええじゃないか|'''Ee ja nai ka'''}} was a complex of carnivalesque religious celebrations and communal activities, often understood as social/political protests, which occurred in many parts of [[Japan]] from June 1867 to May 1868, at the end of the [[Edo period]] and the start of the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The movement originated in the Kansai region, near Kyoto.

In West Japan, ''ee ja nai ka'' appeared at first in the form of dancing [[festival]]s, often related to public works, rain magic, or dances for the dead. When sacred amulets were said to have fallen from [[heaven]], thanksgiving celebrations for these amulets were added that could last for several days and effectively took whole rural and urban communities away from everyday life. Gifts were exchanged, youth groups organized mass dancing including cross-dressing, wearing costumes, or not wearing clothes at all. To express their gratitude towards the gods or buddhas who had given them the [[amulet]]s, many people went on pilgrimages to local or regional sanctuaries. The term ''ee ja nai ka'' was a refrain in popular songs performed during these activities and was therefore later chosen as their title. The phrase's meaning is both defiant and fatalistic, and it translates as "Who cares?", "Why not?", or "What the hell?", along the lines of "Who cares if we take our clothes off?", "Who cares if we have sex?".&lt;ref name="New York Review of Books" /&gt;

The great diversity and rivalry of religious practice in premodern Japan helped shape the range of events. It has been suggested that religious activists, such as [[priest]]s and itinerant [[preacher]]s, played a major role in fabricating the "amulet showers", and some suspects were even caught in action by alert officers. Youth interested in celebrating parties, or in becoming spiritual leaders, were also suspected and in some cases convicted.

''Ee ja nai ka'' was not linked to any specific political platform, though it is often understood "as a form of political protest when other ways [were] blocked",&lt;ref name="New York Review of Books" /&gt; in reaction to the crumbling [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Disappointment regarding the lack of governing political leadership, disgust at Western and [[Christianity|Christian]] foreigners, and other signs of social/political critique were frequently displayed. There is no evidence for any coordinated political setup or staging of ''ee ja nai ka'', although this was also rumoured.

The movement spread across Japan, eventually descending to mob violence before coming to an end. The end of ''ee ja nai ka'' was concurrent with the beginning of the Meiji Restoration and the Western-style modernization of Japan.

In 1981, Japanese director [[Shohei Imamura]] produced his film ''[[Eijanaika (film)|Eijanaika]]'', which gives a deliberately historically incorrect interpretation of the events but nevertheless catches the unstable and tense atmosphere of the age. Imamura had previously helped write the 1957 [[Yuzo Kawashima]] film on the period {{Nihongo|''[[Sun in the Last Days of the Shogunate]]''|幕末太陽傳|Bakumatsu taiyōden}}. This era was also depicted in the 1969 [[Kihachi Okamoto]]-directed [[Toshirō Mifune]] film {{Nihongo|''[[Red Lion (film)|Red Lion]]''|赤毛|Akage}}. The ''ee ja nai ka'' activities, hitherto unknown as part of Japanese history during the [[Bakumatsu]], have in recent years been included and alluded to in mainstream historical productions, such as the NHK [[Taiga drama]]s ''[[Ryōmaden]]'' and ''[[Yae no Sakura]]''.

'''The Fourth Way''' is an approach to self-development described by [[George Gurdjieff]] which he developed over years of travel in [[Eastern World|the East]] (c. 1890 - 1912). It combines and harmonizes what he saw as three established traditional "ways" or "schools": those of the mind, emotions, and body, or of yogis, monks, and [[fakirs]] respectively. Students often refer to the Fourth Way as "The Work", "Work on oneself," or "The System". The exact origins of some of Gurdjieff's teachings are unknown, but people have offered various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Storr ''Feet of Clay'', p. 26, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-684-83495-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Fourth Way" was further used by his student [[P. D. Ouspensky]] in his lectures and writings. After Ouspensky's death, his students published a book entitled ''[[Fourth Way (book)|The Fourth Way]]'' based on his lectures.

According to this system, the three traditional schools, or ways, "are permanent forms which have survived throughout history mostly unchanged, and are based on religion. Where schools of yogis, monks or fakirs exist, they are barely distinguishable from religious schools. The fourth way differs in that "it is not a permanent way. It has no specific forms or institutions and comes and goes controlled by some particular laws of its own."&lt;ref&gt;"In Search of the Miraculous" by P.D. Ouspensky p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When this work is finished, that is to say, when the aim set before it has been accomplished, the fourth way disappears, that is, it disappears from the given place, disappears in its given form, continuing perhaps in another place in another form. Schools of the fourth way exist for the needs of the work which is being carried out in connection with the proposed undertaking. They never exist by themselves as schools for the purpose of education and instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[[P.D. Ouspensky]] (1949), ''[[In Search of the Miraculous]]'', Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Fourth Way addresses the question of humanity's place in the Universe and the possibilities of inner development. It emphasizes that people ordinarily live in a state referred to as a semi-hypnotic "waking sleep," while higher levels of consciousness, virtue, unity of will are possible.

The Fourth Way teaches how to increase and focus attention and energy in various ways, and to minimize day-dreaming and absent-mindedness. This inner development in oneself is the beginning of a possible further process of change, whose aim is to transform man into "what he ought to be."

==Overview==

Gurdjieff's followers believed he was a spiritual master,&lt;ref&gt;''Meetings with Remarkable Men'', translator's note&lt;/ref&gt; a human being who is fully awake or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]]. He was also seen as an [[Esotericism|esotericist]] or [[occult]]ist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/gurdjief.html Gurdjieff article in ''The Skeptic's dictionary''] by [[Robert Todd Carroll]]&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed that the teaching was esoteric but claimed that none of it was veiled in secrecy but that many people lack the interest or the capability to understand it.&lt;ref&gt;P.D. Ouspensky, ''In Search of the Miraculous'', p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; Gurdjieff said, "The teaching whose theory is here being set out is completely self supporting and independent of other lines and it has been completely unknown up to the present time."&lt;ref&gt;In Search of The Miraculous (Chapter 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Way teaches that humans are born with a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] but that one's soul becomes encapsulated by personality leaving one not really conscious, even as they clearly ''believe'' they are. A person must free the soul by following a teaching which can lead to this aim or "go nowhere" upon death of his body. Should a person be able to receive the teaching and find a school, upon the death of the physical body they will "go elsewhere."   Humans are born ''asleep'', live in ''sleep'' and die in ''sleep'', only ''imagining'' that they are awake with few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Ouspensky ''In Search of the Miraculous'', p. 66, Harcourt Brace &amp; Co., 1977 {{ISBN|0-15-644508-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinary waking "consciousness" of human beings is not consciousness at all but merely a form of sleep."

Gurdjieff taught "sacred dances" or "movements", now known as [[Gurdjieff movements]], which they performed together as a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gurdjieff-heritage-society.org/excerptsbook.htm |title=Gurdjieff Heritage Society Book Excerpts &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=5 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030182608/http://www.gurdjieff-heritage-society.org/excerptsbook.htm |archive-date=30 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left a body of music, inspired by that which he had heard in remote monasteries and other places, which was written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils, [[Thomas de Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff.org/mangan1.html Thomas de Hartmann: A Composer’s Life]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by John Mangan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three ways==

Gurdjieff taught that traditional paths to spiritual enlightenment followed one of three ways:

* '''''The Way of the [[Fakir]]'''''

:The ''Fakir'' works to obtain mastery of the attention (self-mastery) through struggles with [controlling] the physical body involving difficult physical exercises and postures.

* '''''The Way of the [[Monk]]'''''

:The ''Monk'' works to obtain the same mastery of the attention (self-mastery) through struggle with [controlling] the affections, in the domain, as we say, of the heart, which has been emphasized in the west, and come to be known as the way of faith due to its practice particularly in Catholicism.

* '''''The Way of the [[Yogi]]'''''

:The ''Yogi'' works to obtain the same mastery of the attention (as before: 'self mastery') through struggle with [controlling] mental habits and capabilities.

Gurdjieff insisted that these paths - although they may intend to seek to produce a fully developed human being - tend to cultivate certain faculties at the expense of others. The goal of religion or spirituality was, in fact, to produce a well-balanced, responsive and sane human being capable of dealing with all eventualities that life may present. Gurdjieff therefore made it clear that it was necessary to cultivate a way that integrated and combined the traditional three ways.

===Fourth Way===

Gurdjieff said that his Fourth Way was a quicker means than the first three ways because it simultaneously combined work on all [[Centers (Fourth Way)|three centers]] rather than focusing on one. It could be followed by ordinary people in everyday life, requiring no [[hermit|retirement into the desert]].  The Fourth Way does involve certain conditions imposed by a teacher, but blind acceptance of them is discouraged. Each student is advised to do only what they understand and to verify for themselves the teaching's ideas.

Ouspensky documented Gurdjieff as saying that "two or three thousand years ago there were yet other ways which no longer exist and the ways then in existence were not so divided, they stood much closer to one another. The fourth way differs from the old and the new ways by the fact that it is never a permanent way. It has no definite forms and there are no institutions connected with it."&lt;ref&gt;"In Search of the Miraculous" by P.D. Ouspensky p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

Ouspensky quotes Gurdjieff that there are fake schools and that "It is impossible to recognize a wrong way without knowing the right way. This means that it is no use troubling oneself how to recognize a wrong way. One must think of how to find the right way."&lt;ref&gt;In Search of The Miraculous (Chapter 10)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

In his works, Gurdjieff credits his teachings to a number of more or less mysterious sources:&lt;ref&gt;[gurdjiefffourthway.org/pdf/source.pdf Sources of Gurjieff's Teachings]&lt;/ref&gt;-
* Various small sects of 'real' Christians in Asia and the Middle East. Gurdjieff believed that mainstream Christian teachings had become corrupted. 
* Various [[dervish]]es (he did not use the term '[[Sufi]]')
* Gurdjieff mentions practicing [[Yoga]] in his youth but his later comments about Indian [[fakir]]s and [[yogi]]s are dismissive.
* The mysterious ''[[Sarmoung]]'' monastery in a remote area of central Asia, to which Gurdjieff was led blindfold.
* The non-denominational "Universal Brotherhood".

Attempts to fill out his account have featured:
* Technical vocabulary first appearing in early 19th century [[Russian freemasonry]], derived from [[Robert Fludd]] ([[P. D. Ouspensky]])
* [[Eastern Christianity]] as detailed in the works of [[Robin Amis]] and [[:fr:Boris Mouravieff]]
* [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] [[Ahmsta Kebzeh]] ([[Murat Yagan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kebzeh.org/publications/bk_Ahmsta-Kebzeh_pb.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520191109/http://www.kebzeh.org/publications/bk_Ahmsta-Kebzeh_pb.htm |archivedate=20 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Tibetan Buddhism]], according to Jose Tirado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff-internet.com/article_details.php?ID=251&amp;W=39 Gurdjieff-internet]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Chatral Rinpoche]] believes that Gurdjieff spent several years in a monastery in the [[Swat valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://amritayana.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/meetings-with-three-tibetan-masters.html Meetings with Three Tibetan Masters]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[James George (diplomat)|James George]] theorises that [[Surmang]], a Tibetan Buddhist monastery now in China, is the real [[Sarmoung]] monastery.
* [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]]sm, ([[Idries Shah]],&lt;ref&gt;Idries Shah: The Way of the Sufi, Part 1, Notes and Bibliography, Note 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rafael Lefort]])

* in principle to [[Zoroaster]], and explicitly to the 12th century [[Khwajagan]] Sufi leader, [[Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani]] ([[J. G. Bennett]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Fourth Way" Bennett's last public lecture, available on CD from J. G. Bennet website).[http://www.jgbennett.net]&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Teachings and teaching methods==

===Basis of teachings===
The Fourth Way focuses on "conscious labor" and "intentional suffering."

'''Conscious Labor'''  is an action where the person who is performing the act is present to what he is doing; not absentminded. At the same time he is striving to perform the act more efficiently.

'''Intentional suffering''' is the act of struggling against automatism such as daydreaming, pleasure, food (eating for reasons other than real hunger), etc... In Gurdjieff's book ''[[Beelzebub's Tales]]'' he states that "the greatest 'intentional suffering' can be obtained in our presences by compelling ourselves to endure the displeasing manifestations of others toward ourselves"&lt;ref&gt;[[G.I. Gurdjieff]] (1950). [[Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson]], pg 242&lt;/ref&gt;

To Gurdjieff these two were the basis of all evolution of man.

'''Self-Observation'''

This is to strive to observe in oneself behavior and habits usually only observed in others, and as dispassionately as one may observe them in others, to observe thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judging or analyzing what is observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dennislewis.org/articles-other-writings/articles-essays/gurdjieff-the-further-reaches-of-self-observation Gurdjieff &amp; the Further Reaches of Self-Observation], an article by [[Dennis Lewis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Need for Effort'''

Gurdjieff emphasized that awakening results from consistent, prolonged effort. Such efforts may be made as an act of will after one is already exhausted.

'''The Many 'I's'''

This indicates fragmentation of the psyche, the different feelings and thoughts of ‘I’ in a person: I think, I want, I know best, I prefer, I am happy, I am hungry, I am tired, etc. These have nothing in common with one another and are unaware of each other, arising and vanishing for short periods of time. Hence man usually has no unity in himself, wanting one thing now and another, perhaps contradictory, thing later.

'''Centers'''

{{main|Centers (Fourth Way)}}

Gurdjieff classified plants as having one center, animals two and humans three. Centers refer to apparati within a being that dictate specific organic functions. There are three main centers in a man: '''intellectual''', '''emotional''' and '''physical''', and two higher centers: '''higher emotional''' and '''higher intellectual'''.

'''Body, Essence and Personality'''

Gurdjieff divided people's being into ''Essence'' and ''Personality''.

*'''Essence''' - is a "natural part of a person" or "what he is born with"; this is the part of a being which is said to have the ability to evolve.
*'''Personality''' - is everything artificial that he has "learned" and "seen".

'''Cosmic Laws'''

Gurdjieff focused on two main cosmic laws, the ''Law of Three'' and the ''Law of Seven'' {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

*The '''Law of Seven''' is described by Gurdjieff as "the first fundamental cosmic law". This law is used to explain processes. The basic use of the law of seven is to explain why nothing in nature and in life constantly occurs in a straight line, that is to say that there are always ups and downs in life which occur lawfully. Examples of this can be noticed in athletic performances, where a high ranked athlete always has periodic downfalls, as well as in nearly all graphs that plot topics that occur over time, such as the economic graphs, population graphs, death-rate graphs and so on. All show parabolic periods that keep rising and falling. Gurdjieff claimed that since these periods occur lawfully based on the law of seven that it is possible to keep a process in a straight line if the necessary shocks were introduced at the right time. A piano keyboard is an example of the law of seven, as the seven notes of the major scale correspond exactly to it.
*The '''Law of Three''' is described by Gurdjieff as "the second fundamental cosmic law". This law states that every whole phenomenon is composed of three separate sources, which are [[Action (philosophy)|Active]], [[Passivity (behavior)|Passive]] and Reconciling or [[Neutrality (philosophy)|Neutral]]. This law applies to everything in the [[universe]] and [[human]]ity, as well as all the [[structure]]s and processes. The [[Three Centres|Three Centers]] in a human, which Gurdjieff said were the Intellectual Centre, the Emotional Centre and the Moving Centre, are an expression of the law of three. Gurdjieff taught his students to think of the law of three forces as essential to transforming the [[energy]] of the [[human being]]. The process of transformation requires the three actions of [[wikt:affirmation|affirmation]], [[denial]] and [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconciliation]].

How the ''Law of Seven'' and ''Law of Three'' function together is said to be illustrated on the [[Fourth Way Enneagram]], a nine-pointed symbol which is the central glyph of Gurdjieff's system.

===Use of symbols===

In his explanations Gurdjieff often used different symbols such as the [[Fourth Way Enneagram|Enneagram]] and the [[Ray of Creation]]. Gurdjieff said that "the enneagram is a universal symbol. All knowledge can be included in the enneagram and with the help of the enneagram it can be interpreted ... A man may be quite alone in the desert and he can trace the enneagram in the sand and in it read the [[The Laws (Fourth Way)|eternal laws of the universe]]. And every time he can learn something new, something he did not know before."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endlesssearch.co.uk/philo_enneagramtalk.htm A Lecture by G.I. Gurdjieff]&lt;/ref&gt; The ray of creation is a diagram which represents the Earth's place in the Universe. The diagram has eight levels, each corresponding to Gurdjieff's laws of octaves.

Through the elaboration of the law of octaves and the meaning of the enneagram, Gurdjieff offered his students alternative means of conceptualizing the world and their place in it.

===Working conditions and sacred dances===

To provide conditions in which attention could be exercised more intensively, Gurdjieff also taught his pupils "[[Movements (sacred dances)|sacred dances]]" or "movements" which they performed together as a group, and he left a body of music inspired by what he heard in visits to remote monasteries and other places, which was written for piano in collaboration with one of his pupils, [[Thomas de Hartmann]].

Gurdjieff laid emphasis on the idea that the seeker must conduct his or her own search. The teacher cannot do the student's work for the student, but is more of a guide on the path to self-discovery. As a teacher, Gurdjieff specialized in creating conditions for students - conditions in which growth was possible, in which efficient progress could be made by the willing. To find oneself in a set of conditions that a gifted teacher has arranged has another benefit. As Gurdjieff put it, "You must realize that each man has a definite repertoire of roles which he plays in ordinary circumstances ... but put him into even only slightly different circumstances and he is unable to find a suitable role and for a short time he becomes himself."

==Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man==
Having migrated for four years after escaping the [[Russian Revolution]] with dozens of followers and family members, Gurdjieff settled in France and established his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at the Château Le Prieuré at Fontainebleau-Avon in October 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff.org/institute.htm Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was an esoteric school based on Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teaching. After nearly dying in a car crash in 1924, he recovered and closed down the Institute. He began writing ''All and Everything''. From 1930, Gurdjieff made visits to North America where he resumed his teachings.

[[P. D. Ouspensky|Ouspensky]] relates that in the early work with Gurdjieff in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], Gurdjieff forbade students from writing down or publishing anything connected with Gurdjieff and his ideas. Gurdjieff said that students of his methods would find themselves unable to transmit correctly what was said in the groups. Later, Gurdjieff relaxed this rule, accepting students who subsequently published accounts of their experiences in the Gurdjieff work.

==After Gurdjieff==

After Gurdjieff's death in 1949 a variety of groups around the world have attempted to continue The Gurdjieff Work. The Gurdjieff Foundation, was established in 1953 in New York City by [[Jeanne de Salzmann]] in cooperation with other direct pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff.org/foundation.htm The Gurdjieff Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. G. Bennett]] ran groups and also made contact with the [[Subud]] and [[Sufi]] schools to develop The Work in different directions. [[Maurice Nicoll]], a [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian psychologist, also ran his own groups based on Gurdjieff and Ouspensky's ideas.
The French institute was headed for many years by Madam de Salzmann - a direct pupil of Gurdjieff. Under her leadership, the Gurdjieff Societies of London and New York were founded and developed.

There is debate regarding the ability to use Gurdjieff's ideas through groups. Some critics believe that none of Gurdjieff's students were able to raise themselves to his level of understanding. Gurdjieff himself seemed to have formed this impression some ten years before his death, which led him to divert his efforts away from the Institute and into writing. Proponents of the continued viability of Gurdjieff's system, and its study through the use of groups, however, point to Gurdjieff's insistence on the training of initiates in interpreting and disseminating the ideas that he expressed cryptically in ''[[Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson]]''. This, combined with Gurdjieff's almost fanatical dedication to the completion of this text (''Beelzebub's Tales''), suggest that Gurdjieff himself intended his ideas to continue to be practiced and taught long after his death. Other proponents of continuing the Work are not concerned with external factors, but focus on the inner results achieved through a sincere practice of Gurdjieff's system.

"There are only special schools; there are no general schools. Every teacher, or guru, is a specialist in some one thing. One is an astronomer, another a sculptor, a third a musician. And all the pupils of each teacher must first of all study the subject in which he has specialized."&lt;ref&gt;In Search of the Miraculous, by P.D. Ouspensky&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, some former Gurdjieffians joined other movements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjiefflegacy.org/40articles/neosufism.htm Neo-Sufism: The Case of Idries Shah]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurdjieff.org/bennett1.htm Gurdjieff and Bennett]&lt;/ref&gt; and there are a number of offshoots, and syntheses incorporating elements of the Fourth Way, such as:

* [[Claudio Naranjo]]'s teaching.
* [[Oscar Ichazo]]'s [[Arica School]]
* [[Samael Aun Weor]]
* The [[Diamond Approach]] of [[A. H. Almaas]].

The Enneagram is often studied in [[Enneagram of personality|contexts that do not include other elements of Fourth Way teaching]].

'''''GHOSTS/ALIENS''''' is a humor book written by the [[pseudonym]]ous Trey Hamburger.  The book chronicles the research of two amateur scientists, Trey Hamburger and Mike Stevens, who investigate the possible teleportation of a [[hot pocket]].  The investigation soon expands to psychic babies, "Indians", the efficacy of toothpaste foam, the dangers caused by floating pillows, states of bird consciousness, portals in space/time, and so on.

The author sends letters to actual scientists requesting advice about the existence of ghosts, aliens, inter-dimensional portals as well as advice about paranormal combat.  Those letters and replies are published in the book.

==Author==
The author of ''GHOSTS/ALIENS'' is also the author of [[REAL Ultimate Power]]: The Official Ninja Book.  In the 'Hamburger mythology', Trey Hamburger is the cousin of Robert Hamburger, the protagonist of REAL Ultimate Power.

'''Hero cults''' were one of the most distinctive features of [[ancient Greek religion]]. In Homeric Greek, "[[hero]]" ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἥρως}}}}, {{transl|grc|''hḗrōs''}}) refers to a man who fought (on either side) during the [[Trojan War]].  By the historical period, however, the word came to mean specifically a ''dead'' man, venerated and propitiated at his tomb or at a designated [[shrine]], because his fame during life or his unusual manner of death gave him power to support and protect the living. A hero was more than human but less than a [[Greek god|god]], and  various kinds of supernatural figures came to be assimilated to the class of heroes; the distinction between a hero and a god was less than certain, especially in the case of [[Heracles]], the most prominent, but atypical hero.&lt;ref&gt;
Parker gives a concise and clear synopsis of ''hero''.

 | quote = The term 'hero' had a technical sense in Greek religion: a hero was a figure less powerful than a god, to whom cult was paid. He was normally conceived as a mortal who had died, and the typical site of such a cult was a tomb. But various kinds of minor supernatural figure came to be assimilated to the class and, as in the case of Heracles, the distinction between a hero and a god could be uncertain.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand ruins and [[tumulus|tumuli]] remaining from the [[Bronze Age]] gave the pre-literate Greeks of the 10th and 9th centuries BC a sense of a grand and vanished age; they reflected this in the oral [[epic tradition]], which would crystallize in the ''[[Iliad]]''. Copious renewed offerings begin to be represented, after a hiatus, at sites like [[Lefkandi]],&lt;ref&gt;Carla Maria Antonaccio, ''An Archaeology of Ancestors: Tomb Cult and Hero Cult in Early Greece'' (1995) and "Lefkandi and Homer", in O. Anderson and M. Dickie, ''Homer's World: Fiction, Tradition and Reality'' (1995); I. Morris, "Tomb cult and the Greek Renaissance" ''Antiquity'' '''62''' (1988:750-61).&lt;/ref&gt; even though the names of the grandly buried dead were hardly remembered. "Stories began to be told to individuate the persons who were now believed to be buried in these old and imposing sites", observes [[Robin Lane Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Nature of hero cult==
Greek hero-cults were distinct from the clan-based [[ancestor worship]] from which they developed,&lt;ref&gt;"The cult of Heroes everywhere has the same features as the cult of ancestors... the remains of a true cult of ancestors provided the model and were the real starting-point for the later belief and cult of Heroes." Rohde 1925:125.&lt;/ref&gt; in that as the ''[[polis]]'' evolved, they became a civic rather than familial affair, and in many cases none of the worshipers traced their descent back to the hero any longer: no shrine to a hero can be traced unbroken from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times. Whereas the ancestor was purely local, Lewis Farnell observed, the hero might be tended in more than one locality, and he deduced that hero-cult was more deeply influenced from the [[epic poetry|epic tradition]], that "suggested many a name to forgotten graves",&lt;ref&gt;Farnell 1921:283f.&lt;/ref&gt; and provided even [[Dorians]] a connection to Mycenaean heroes, according to [[John Nicolas Coldstream|Coldstream]].&lt;ref&gt;Coldstream, "Hero cults in the age of Homer", ''Journal of the Hellenic Society'' '''96''' (1976:8-17).&lt;/ref&gt;  "Coldstream believed the currency of epic would account for votives in Dorian areas, where an alien, immigrant population might otherwise be expected to show no particular reverence for Mycenaean predecessors".&lt;ref&gt;Antonaccio 1994:395.&lt;/ref&gt; Large Mycenaean [[tholos tomb]]s that betokened a grander past, were often the site of hero-cults. Not all heroes were even known by names.
 
[[Image:Hero cult Louvre CA308.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Cult of [[Oedipus]] on a [[Lucania]]n amphora, ca. 380-70 BC ([[Louvre]], CA 308)]]
Aside from the epic tradition, which featured the heroes alive and in action rather than as objects of ''[[Cult (religion)|cultus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Hack, "Homer and the cult of heroes", ''Transactions of the American  Philological Association'' '''60''' (1929::57-74).&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest written reference to hero-cult is attributed to [[Dracon]], the Athenian lawgiver of the late seventh century BC, who prescribed that gods and local heroes should both be honoured according to ancestral custom. The custom, then, was already established, and there were multiple local heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Carla M. Antonaccio, "Contesting the Past: Hero Cult, Tomb Cult, and Epic in Early Greece" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''98'''.3 (July 1994:389-410).&lt;/ref&gt; The written sources emphasise the importance of heroes' tombs and the ''[[temenos]]'' or sanctuary, where [[chthonic]] rites appeased their spirits and induced them to continue to favour the people who looked to them as founders, of whom [[founding myth]]s were related. In the hero's restricted and local scope he "retained the limited and partisan interests of his mortal life.  He would help those who lived in the vicinity of his tomb or who belonged to the tribe of which he himself was the founder," observes Robert Parker,&lt;ref&gt;Parker 1988:250.&lt;/ref&gt; with the reservation that Heracles, with his pan-Hellenic scope was again the exception.

[[James Whitley (archaeologist)|Whitley]] interpreted the final stage, in which hero-cult was co-opted by the [[city-state]] as a political gesture, in the archaic aristocratic [[tumulus]] surrounded by [[stela]]e, erected by Athens to the cremated [[Battle of Marathon|citizen-heroes of Marathon]] (490 BC), to whom chthonic cult was dedicated, as the offering trenches indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptions reveal that offerings were still being made to the heroised dead in the first century BC; the tumulus is discussed in Whitley, "The Monuments that stood before Marathon: Tomb cult and hero cult in Archaic Attica" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''98'''.2 (April 1994:213-230).&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the other hand, Greek heroes were distinct  from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|cult of dead emperors]], because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local.  For this reason hero cults were [[chthonic]] in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for [[Hecate]] and [[Persephone]] than those for [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]: [[libation]]s in the dark hours, sacrifices that were not shared by the living.

The two exceptions to the above were [[Heracles]] and [[Asclepius]], who might be honored as either heroes or gods, with chthonic libation or with burnt sacrifice. Heroes in cult behaved very differently from heroes in myth.  They might appear indifferently as men or as snakes, and they seldom appeared unless angered.  A [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] saying advises not to eat food that has fallen on the floor, because "it belongs to the heroes". Heroes if ignored or left unappeased could turn malicious: in a fragmentary play by [[Aristophanes]], a chorus of anonymous heroes describe themselves as senders of lice, fever and boils.

Some of the earliest hero and heroine cults well attested by archaeological evidence in mainland Greece include the Menelaion dedicated to [[Menelaus]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] at [[Therapne]] near [[Sparta]], a shrine at [[Mycenae]] dedicated to [[Agamemnon]] and [[Cassandra]], another at [[Amyklai]] dedicated to [[Cassandra|Alexandra]], and another in [[Ithaca]]'s Polis Bay dedicated to [[Odysseus]]. These all seem to date to the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;In the case of the shrine to Odysseus, this is based on a single graffito from the Hellenistic period.&lt;/ref&gt; The cult of [[Pelops]] at Olympia dates from the Archaic period.

==Heroes and heroines==
Hero cults were offered most prominently to men, though in practice the experience of the votary was of propitiating a cluster of family figures, which included women who were wives of a hero-husband, mothers of a hero-son ([[Alcmene]] and [[Semele]]), and daughters of a hero-father.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lynn Larson, ''Greek Heroine Cults'' (University of Wisconsin Press) 1995, has marshalled the evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Moses I. Finley|Finley]] observed of the world of [[Odysseus]], which he reads as a nostalgic eighth-century rendering of traditions from the culture of Dark Age Greece,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Penelope became a moral heroine for later generations, the embodiment of goodness and chastity, to be contrasted with the faithless, murdering Clytaemnestra, Agamemnon's wife; but 'hero' has no feminine gender in the age of heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1954; rev. ed. 1978), p.32f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where local cult venerated figures such as the sacrificial virgin  [[Iphigeneia]], an archaic local ''[[nymph]]e'' has been reduced to a mortal figure of [[legend]].  Other isolated female figures represented priestess-initiators of a local cult. Iconographic and epigraphal evidence marshalled by [[Jennifer Lynn Larson|Larson]] combine to depict heroines as similar in kind to heroes, but in androcentric Greek culture,&lt;ref&gt;"Heroine cults fit well into our modern view of ancient Greek culture as firmly androcentric, though not as androcentric as some would have had us believe" (Larson 1995:144).&lt;/ref&gt; typically of lesser stature.

==Types of hero cult==
[[Image:Hero offering.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Offerings to a deified hero and another deity, depicted on a Greek marble relief ca. 300 BC]]

[[James Whitley (archaeologist)|Whitley]] distinguishes four or five essential types of hero cult:&lt;ref&gt;Whitley1994:220ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Oikist cults''' of founders.&lt;ref&gt;A general study of ''oikist'' cults is I. Malkin, ''Religion and Colonization in Ancient Greece'' (Leiden) 1987:189-266.&lt;/ref&gt; Such cults arose in [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies in the Hellenic world]] in [[Magna Graecia]] and [[Sicily]] at the grave of the founder, the ''[[oikist]]''. In the case of cults at the tombs of the recently heroised, it must be assumed that the identity of the occupant of the tomb was unequivocally known.  [[Thucydides]] (V.11.1) gives the example of [[Brasidas]] at [[Amphipolis]]. [[Battus I of Cyrene|Battus]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] might also be mentioned. "Such historical examples," Whitley warns, "have clearly colored the interpretation of certain tomb cults in the Archaic period." Such Archaic sites as the "''heroon''" at [[Lefkandi]] and that close to the West Gate at [[Eretria]] cannot be distinguished by archaeological methods from family observances at tombs (tomb cults) and the cult of ancestors.
* '''Cults to named heroes.''' A number of cult sites known in Classical times were dedicated to known heroes in the Greek and modern senses, especially of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and other episodes of the [[Epic Cycle]]. Whitley makes two points here, first that the earliest ''heria''&lt;!-- Should this be heroa? --&gt; associate the male hero with earlier and stronger ''female'' presences, and second, that figures such as Odysseus, Agamemnon and Menelaus all have strong ''local'' connections. The cults of [[Oedipus]] at [[Athens (polis)|Athens]] and [[Pelops]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] are examples.
* '''Cults to local heroes.''' Such local figures do not figure among the Panhellenic figures of epic. Examples would be [[Akademos]] and [[Erechtheus]] at Athens.
* '''Cults at Bronze Age tombs.''' These are represented archaeologically by Iron Age deposits in Mycenaean tombs, not easily interpreted. Because of the gap in time between the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and the earliest [[votive object]]s, continuity appears to be broken. A sherd from above the [[Grave Circle A, Mycenae|Grave Circle A]] at Mycenae is simply inscribed "to the hero",&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich Schliemann]], ''Mycenae'', adduced by Whitley 1994:222 and note 44&lt;/ref&gt; and Whitley suggests that the unnamed race of the [[Silver Age]] might have been invoked. In Attica, such cults are those associated with [[tholos tomb]]s at [[Thorikos]] and [[Acharnes|Menidhi]].
* '''Oracular hero cults.''' Whitley does not address this group of local cults where an [[oracle]] developed, as in the case of [[Amphiaraus]], who was swallowed up by a gaping crack in the earth. Minor cults accrued to some figures who died violent or unusual deaths,  as in the case of the dead from the [[Battle of Marathon]], and those struck by lightning, as in several attested cases in [[Magna Graecia]].

==Heroes, politics, and gods==
Hero cults could be of the utmost political importance.  When [[Cleisthenes]] divided the [[History of Athens|Athenians]] into new [[deme]]s for voting, he consulted [[Delphi]] on what heroes he should name each division after.  According to [[Herodotus]], the [[Sparta]]ns attributed their conquest of [[Arcadia]] to their theft of the bones of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] from the Arcadian town of [[Tegea]]. Heroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods.  Thus [[Heracles]]'s name means "the glory of Hera", even though he was tormented all his life by the queen of the gods.  This was even truer in their cult appearances.   Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king Erechtheus, whom [[Poseidon]] killed for choosing [[Athena]] over him as the city's patron god.  When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]], they invoked him as ''Poseidon Erechtheus''.

Gurdjieff taught that the movements were not merely [[calisthenics]], exercises in concentration, and displays of bodily coordination and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic sensibility]]: on the contrary, in the movements was embedded real, concrete knowledge, passed from generation to generation of initiates - each posture and gesture representing some cosmic [[truth]] that the informed observer could read like a book. Certain of Gurdjieff's followers claim that the Gurdjieff Movements can only be properly transmitted by those who themselves have been initiated in the direct line of Gurdjieff; otherwise, they say, it leads nowhere.

The movements are purportedly based upon traditional dances that Gurdjieff studied as he traveled throughout [[central Asia]], India, Tibet, the Orient and [[Africa]] where he encountered various Indo-European and [[Sufi]] orders, [[Buddhist]] centers and other sources of traditional culture and learning.&lt;ref name="ToussulisPh.D2011"&gt;{{cite book

There were literally thousands of movements collected and taught by Gurdjieff throughout his teaching career. The music for the movements was written by Gurdjieff and [[Thomas de Hartmann]], as well as British composer Edouard Michael.

A brief glimpse of the dances appears at the very end of the motion picture about Gurdjieff, ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men (film)|Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', produced and directed in 1978 by [[Peter Brook]].&lt;ref name="PanafieuNeedleman1997"&gt;{{cite book

"'''Heaven'''" is a song by [[alternative rock]] group [[Live (band)|Live]], which was released as the first single from their 2003 album, ''[[Birds of Pray]]''.

The song was not released as a commercial CD single in the United States, but was made available as a purchasable digital download, which enabled the song to reach #59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.  The song also reached #56 on ''Billboard''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay|Hot 100 Airplay]] chart, and peaked at #33 on both the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] and [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] charts. It was also a hit in Australia, Brazil,  New Zealand, The Netherlands and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultratop.be/nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Live&amp;titel=Heaven&amp;cat=s "Ultratop entry for Heaven"] ''Ultratop''&lt;/ref&gt;

The video, considered a "concept" video, as it featured highly symbolical imagery without the participation of the band, depicts a young girl and a boy at the opposite sides of a river who want to cross it, so they can be together. They plan to meet in a place where the boy thinks he can swim to the other side, but he is taken by the stream and carried away. The girl swims to him and they are finally together, but soon they realize they are heading to the tumultuous river waterfalls. Whether they survive or not is unknown. The video was shot in Iceland and its supposed religious symbolism is open to different interpretations. 

After the song became a success in the United States, the original video was replaced in most rotations by a new video. Shot at [[Voorst National]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], this version was a high intensity performance of the song, featuring all four principal band members. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff3NUP-xzqQ] "Heaven Video (2nd Version)"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1792">The [[Huichol people]] of western [[Mexico]] exude an enduring spirit and passion to hold on to their traditions.  This is exemplified in the pilgrimage route between [[Nayarit]] and [[Huiricuta]], stretching nearly 800&amp;nbsp;km, wherein dozens of sacred sites are visited along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1959/ Huichol Route through the sacred sites to Huiricuta (Tatehuari Huajuye) - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;  The route follows the old pre-Hispanic [[trade routes]] between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]].  One of the most important of these routes, to Huiricuta or [[Wirikuta]], is known as such for its historical importance in the preservation of Huichol cultural as well as the sheer proliferation of pilgrims that follow the route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1959/ Huichol Route through the sacred sites to Huiricuta (Tatehuari Huajuye) - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the Huichol have no written language, the pilgrimage has the added importance of linking  populations of Huichol and disseminating knowledge of culture and reinforcing cultural practices.

== World Heritage status ==
This site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on December 6, 2004 in the Mixed (Cultural + Natural) category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1959/ Huichol Route through the sacred sites to Huiricuta (Tatehuari Huajuye) - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamic art''' encompasses the [[visual arts]] produced from the 7th century onward by people who lived within the territory that was inhabited by or ruled by culturally [[Islamic]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, Richard Ettinghausen and [[Oleg Grabar]], 2001, ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650–1250'', Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-08869-4}}, p.3; Brend, 10&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thus a very difficult art to define because it covers many lands and various peoples over some 1,400 years; it is not art specifically of a religion, or of a time, or of a place, or of a single medium like painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=J. M. Bloom |author2=S. S. Blair |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture, Vol. II |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-530991-1 |pages=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PR7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The huge field of [[Islamic architecture]] is the subject of a separate article, leaving fields as varied as [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[painting]], [[Islamic glass|glass]], [[Islamic pottery|pottery]], and textile arts such as [[Oriental rug|carpets]] and [[Islamic embroidery|embroidery]].

Islamic art is not at all restricted to religious art, but includes all the art of the rich and varied cultures of Islamic societies as well. It frequently includes secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some Islamic theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson's History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, {{ISBN|0-13-193455-4}} pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the ever-present calligraphic inscriptions, specifically religious art is actually less prominent in Islamic art than in Western [[medieval art]], with the exception of Islamic architecture where [[mosque]]s and their complexes of surrounding buildings are the most common remains.  Figurative painting may cover religious scenes, but normally in essentially secular contexts such as the walls of palaces or illuminated books of poetry.  The calligraphy and decoration of manuscript [[Qur'an]]s is an important aspect, but other religious art such as glass [[mosque lamp]]s and other mosque fittings such as tiles (e.g. [[Girih tiles]]), woodwork and carpets usually have the same style and motifs as contemporary secular art, although with religious inscriptions even more prominent.

"Islamic art developed from many sources: [[Roman art|Roman]], [[Early Christian art]], and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] styles were taken over in early Islamic art and architecture; the influence of the [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] art of pre-Islamic Persia was of paramount significance; Central Asian styles were brought in with various nomadic incursions; and [[Chinese art|Chinese]] influences had a formative effect on Islamic painting, pottery, and textiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=MSN Encarta: ''Islamic Art and architecture'' |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577725/Islamic_Art_and_Architecture.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrZY56V?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577725/Islamic_Art_and_Architecture.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the whole concept of "Islamic art" has been criticised by some modern art historians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Melikian |first=Souren |title=Qatar's Museum of Islamic Art: Despite flaws, a house of masterpieces |newspaper=International Herald Tribune|date=December 5, 2008 |quote=This is a European construct of the 19th century that gained wide acceptance following a display of Les Arts Musulmans at the old Trocadero palace in Paris during the 1889 Exposition Universelle.

the similarities between art produced at widely different times and places in the Islamic world, especially in the [[Islamic Golden Age]], have been sufficient to keep the term in wide use by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=De Guise |first=Lucien |title=What is Islamic Art? |publisher=Islamica Magazine |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views of Islamic Art are widely seen through Eurocentrism which coins the term [[orientalism]]. The East has dominant control over most interpretations while infiltrating in their prejudice perceptional views. It is also important to note the Western linear theory of evolution in cultures that suggests progress began in the East and later translated to the West. Along with this comes the Philosophy of “Universal History. This philosophy of George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel says that Universal history goes from East to West. Europe is absolutely the end of universal history. Asia is the beginning.”&lt;ref&gt;This citation of Hegel is taken from Enrique Dussel, The Invention of the Americas: Eclipse of ‘the Other’ and the Myth of Modernity , tr. Michel D. Barber, New York: Continuum, 1995, 20&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy is taken into the interpretations of Islamic Art while misconstruing it with the ideology that Asia is extremely underdeveloped as if they were in an infantile state. On the other hand, Europe has surpassed all others as they are at the peak of cultural evolution and has claimed dominance over the “New World.”&lt;ref&gt;Dussel, Invention of the Americas , chapter 1: ‘ Eurocentrism ’ , mainly 19 – 26; see also Enrique Dussel, ‘Eurocentrism and Modernity (Introduction to the Frankfurt Lectures)’, Boundary 2 , 20(3), 1993, 65 – 76&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the justification of Europe’s capitalist theories while condoning their aggression towards any non-European entity, especially Islam. With this information in mind, it is easy to see the stress that is placed on European influence of Islamic art and Architecture. This takes away the cultural value of the artistic intention of the culture on its architecture. It also further perpetuates an idea of Eurocentric superiority and distracts the focus from the individuality and aspects of the Islamic culture that are reflected in this architectural style.

There are repeating elements in Islamic art, such as the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. The arabesque in Islamic art is often used to symbolize the transcendent, indivisible and infinite nature of God.&lt;ref name="JAACMadden"&gt;Madden (1975), pp.423–430&lt;/ref&gt; Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only God can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Textile Art: Anomalies in Kilims |author=Thompson, Muhammad |author2=Begum, Nasima |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |work=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |publisher=TurkoTek |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The future of art in a digital age: from Hellenistic to Hebraic consciousness |last=Alexenberg |first=Melvin L. |year=2006 |publisher=Intellect Ltd |isbn=1-84150-136-0 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Only God is Perfect |url=http://www.geometricdesign.co.uk/perfect.htm |work=Islamic and Geometric Art |author=Backhouse, Tim |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, though not entirely, Islamic art has focused on the [[Islamic interlace patterns|depiction of patterns]], whether [[Islamic geometric patterns|purely geometric]] or floral, and Arabic calligraphy, [[aniconism in Islam|rather than on figures]], because it is feared by many Muslims that the depiction of the human form is [[idolatry]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UxRoBmUnsYC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=islam+depiction+of+the+human+form+is+idolatry&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F6rsToKkBNP04QSbzOySCQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=islam%20depiction%20of%20the%20human%20form%20is%20idolatry&amp;f=false John L. Esposito (2010), ''The future of Islam'', Oxford University Press, page 42]&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby a sin against [[God in Islam|God]], forbidden in the [[Qur'an]].  Human portrayals can be found in all eras of Islamic art, above all in the more private form of miniatures, where their absence is rare.  Human representation for the purpose of worship is considered [[idolatry]] and is duly forbidden in some interpretations of Islamic law, known as ''[[Sharia]]'' law. There are also many [[depictions of Muhammad]], [[Mohammed|Islam's chief prophet]], in historical Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpUuqLPPKK4C&amp;dq=wijdan&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QXySmKzsy6&amp;sig=a9V6tTTfsrTT5Ex01QGnwrL7XYY ''The Arab Contribution to Islamic Art: From the Seventh to the Fifteenth Centuries''], [[Wijdan Ali]], American Univ in Cairo Press, December 10, 1999, {{ISBN|977-424-476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.let.uu.nl/solis/anpt/EJOS/pdf4/07Ali.pdf  ''From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad's Portrayal from 13th Century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th Century Ottoman Art''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041203232347/http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/pdf4/07Ali.pdf |date=2004-12-03 }}, [[Wijdan Ali]], [http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/EJOS-1.html EJOS (Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies)], volume IV, issue 7, p. 1-24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Small decorative figures of animals and humans, especially if they are hunting the animals, are found on secular pieces in many media from many periods, but portraits were slow to develop.

== Calligraphy ==

{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}

Calligraphic design is omnipresent in Islamic art, where, as in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]], religious exhortations, including Qur'anic verses, may be included in secular objects, especially coins, tiles and metalwork, and most painted miniatures include some script, as do many buildings. Use of Islamic calligraphy in architecture extended significantly outside of Islamic territories; one notable example is the use of [[Chinese calligraphy]] of Arabic verses from the Qur'an in the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondak|first1=Marwa|title=Islamic Art History: An Influential Period|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/islamic-art-history-an-influential-period/|website=Mozaico|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other inscriptions include verses of poetry, and inscriptions recording ownership or donation. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic ''[[kufic]]'' and ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' scripts, which can be found adorning and enhancing the visual appeal of the walls and domes of buildings, the sides of [[minbar]]s, and metalwork.&lt;ref name="JAACMadden"/&gt; Islamic calligraphy in the form of painting or sculptures are sometimes referred to as ''quranic art''.&lt;ref&gt;Islamic Archaeology in the Sudan - Page 22, Intisar Soghayroun Elzein - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called "epigraphic ware", has been described as "probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278–290&lt;/ref&gt;  Large inscriptions made from tiles, sometimes with the letters raised in [[relief]], or the background cut away, are found on the interiors and exteriors of many important buildings.  Complex carved calligraphy also decorates buildings. For most of the Islamic period the majority of coins only showed lettering, which are often very elegant despite their small size and nature of production.  The [[tughra]] or monogram of an Ottoman sultan was used extensively on official documents, with very elaborate decoration for important ones.  Other single sheets of calligraphy, designed for albums, might contain short poems, Qur'anic verses, or other texts.

The main languages, all using [[Arabic script]], are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], always used for Qur'anic verses, [[Farsi|Persian]] in the [[Persianate]] world, especially for poetry, and [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Turkish]], with [[Urdu]] appearing in later centuries.  Calligraphers usually had a higher status than other artists.

== Painting ==

{{see also|Arabic miniature|Ottoman miniature|Persian miniature|Mughal miniature}}

Although there has been a tradition of wall-paintings, especially in the [[Persianate]] world, the best-surviving and highest developed form of painting in the Islamic world is the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, or later as a single page for inclusion in a ''[[muraqqa]]'' or bound album of miniatures and [[calligraphy]].  The tradition of the [[Persian miniature]] has been dominant since about the 13th century, strongly influencing the [[Ottoman miniature]] of Turkey and the [[Mughal miniature]] in India. Miniatures were especially an art of the court, and because they were not seen in public, it has been argued that constraints on the depiction of the human figure were much more relaxed, and indeed miniatures often contain great numbers of small figures, and from the 16th century portraits of single ones.  Although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts, notably several of the [[Umayyad Desert Castles]] (c. 660-750), and during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749–1258).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom |author2=S. Blair |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest commissions of illustrated books were usually classics of [[Persian poetry]] such as the epic ''[[Shahnameh]]'', although the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s both produced lavish manuscripts of more recent history with the autobiographies of the Mughal emperors, and more purely military chronicles of Turkish conquests.  Portraits of rulers developed in the 16th century, and later in Persia, then becoming very popular. Mughal portraits, normally in profile, are very finely drawn in a realist style, while the best Ottoman ones are vigorously stylized.  Album miniatures typically featured picnic scenes, portraits of individuals or (in India especially) animals, or idealized youthful beauties of either sex.

Chinese influences included the early adoption of the vertical format natural to a book, which led to the development of a birds-eye view where a very carefully depicted background of hilly landscape or palace buildings rises up to leave only a small area of sky.  The figures are arranged in different planes on the background, with recession (distance from the viewer) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space, but at essentially the same size.  The colours, which are often very well preserved, are strongly contrasting, bright and clear.  The tradition reached a climax in the 16th and early 17th centuries, but continued until the early 19th century, and has been revived in the 20th.

No Islamic artistic product has become better known outside the Islamic world than the pile carpet, more commonly referred to as the ''Oriental carpet'' ([[oriental rug]]). Their versatility is utilized in everyday Islamic and Muslim life, from floor coverings to architectural enrichment, from cushions to bolsters to bags and sacks of all shapes and sizes, and to religious objects (such as a [[prayer rug]], which would provide a clean place to pray).  They have been a major export to other areas since the late Middle Ages, used to cover not only floors but tables, for long a widespread European practice that is now common only in the [[Netherlands]].  Carpet weaving is a rich and deeply embedded tradition in Islamic societies, and the practice is seen in large city factories as well as in rural communities and nomadic encampments.  In earlier periods, special establishments and workshops were in existence that functioned directly under court patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox.

[[File:Antique oushak 418424.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] [[Ushak carpet]]]]
Very early Islamic carpets, i.e. those before the 16th century, are extremely rare. More have survived in the West and [[oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] from Europe are a major source of information on them, as they were valuable imports that were painted accurately.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout, but 9–28, 49–50, &amp; 59 in particular&lt;/ref&gt;  The most natural and easy designs for a carpet weaver to produce consist of straight lines and edges, and the earliest Islamic carpets to survive or be shown in paintings have geometric designs, or centre on very stylized animals, made up in this way.  Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design.

There are a few survivals of the grand Egyptian 16th century carpets, including one almost as good as new discovered in the attic of the [[Pitti Palace]] in Florence, whose complex patterns of octagon roundels and stars, in just a few colours, shimmer before the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 27, 61–62, as "The Medici Mamluk Carpet"&lt;/ref&gt;  Production of this style of carpet began under the [[Mamluks]] but continued after the Ottomans conquered Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 59–66, 79–83&lt;/ref&gt;  The other sophisticated tradition was the [[Persian carpet]] which reached its peak in the 16th and early 17th century in works like the [[Ardabil Carpet]] and [[Coronation Carpet]]; during this century the Ottoman and Mughal courts also began to sponsor the making in their domains of large formal carpets, evidently with the involvement of designers used to the latest court style in the general Persian tradition.  These use a design style shared with non-figurative Islamic illumination and other media, often with a large central ''[[Gul (design)|gul]]'' motif, and always with wide and strongly demarcated borders.  The grand designs of the workshops patronized by the court spread out to smaller carpets for the merely wealthy and for export, and designs close to those of the 16th and 17th centuries are still produced in large numbers today.  The description of older carpets has tended to use the names of carpet-making centres as labels, but often derived from the design rather than any actual evidence that they originated from around that centre.  Research has clarified that designs were by no means always restricted to the centre they are traditionally associated with, and the origin of many carpets remains unclear.

As well as the major Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans.  Spanish carpets, which sometimes interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include [[coats of arms]], enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the [[Papal Palace, Avignon]], and the industry continued after the [[Reconquista]].&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester: Spanish carpets: 11–12, 50–52; Balkans: 77 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Armenian carpet]]-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought.  The [[Berber carpet]]s of North Africa have a distinct design tradition.  Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, there was also a large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs.  As well as pile carpets, [[kelim]]s and other types of flat-weave or [[embroidered]] textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls.   Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.

=== Columns ===
Early Islamic columns followed the style seen in the classic period of the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/|title=Columns in Islamic Architecture|last=Graves|first=Margaret|date=2 June 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic columns can be seen in earlier mosques such as the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]] and [[Córdoba Mosque|Córdoba]]. These columns can vary in form from being completely smooth, and having vertical or twisting fluting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the 7th and 8th century, the [[Mosque of the Prophet Medina]], was rebuilt using a style known as hypostyle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hypostyle mosques usually entail multiple columns that support a smooth and even wall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In India, traditionally Indian stone columns of different shapes such a circles, squares and octagons, were incorporated into some mosques.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, engaged columns were introduced into decorate Islamic buildings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arches ===
Islamic arches, similar to columns, followed a style similar to Roman architecture. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.T2082057|title=Arches in Islamic Architecture|last=Graves|first=Margaret|date=|website=Grove Art Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arches became quite prominent to Islamic architecture during the 8th-10th centuries. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three distinct shapes of Islamic arches which include horseshoe, keel, and polylobuled.

== Ceramics ==
{{main|Islamic pottery}}
[[File:Iran orientale o asia centrale, coppa, x sec 02.JPG|thumb|left|10th-century dish from East Persia]]

Islamic art has very notable achievements in ceramics, both in [[pottery]] and [[tile]]s for walls, which in the absence of wall-paintings were taken to heights unmatched by other cultures.  Early pottery is often unglazed, but [[Tin-glazing|tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The first industrial complex for [[glass]] and [[pottery]] production was built in [[Raqqa]], [[Syria]], in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Henderson |first2=S. D. |last2=McLoughlin |first3=D. S. |last3=McPhail |year=2004 |title=Radical changes in Islamic glass technology: evidence for conservatism and experimentation with new glass recipes from early and middle Islamic Raqqa, Syria |journal=Archaeometry |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=439–68 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.2004.00167.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lusterware]]s with iridescent colours may have continued pre-Islamic Roman and Byzantine techniques, but were either invented or considerably developed on pottery and glass in Persia and Syria from the 9th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 206–207&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic pottery was [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery|often influenced]] by [[Chinese ceramics]], whose achievements were greatly admired and emulated.&lt;ref&gt;See Rawson throughout; Canby, 120–123, and see index; Jones &amp; Mitchell, 206–211&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially the case in the periods after the [[Mongol invasion]]s and those of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]].  Techniques, shapes and decorative motifs were all affected.  Until the [[Early Modern]] period Western ceramics had very little influence, but Islamic pottery was very sought after in Europe, and often copied.  An example of this is the [[albarello]], a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of [[pharmacy]] jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. [[Hispano-Moresque]] examples were exported to Italy, stimulating the earliest Italian examples, from 15th century Florence.

[[File:Animal Decorated Ottoman Pottery P1000585.JPG|thumb|[[Iznik pottery|Iznik glazed pottery]] ca. 1575]]

The [[Hispano-Moresque]] style emerged in [[Al-Andaluz]] or Muslim Spain in the 8th century, under Egyptian influence, but most of the best production was much later, by potters presumed to have been largely Muslim but working in areas reconquered by the Christian kingdoms. It mixed Islamic and European elements in its designs, and much was exported across neighbouring European countries. It had introduced two [[ceramic]] techniques to [[Europe]]: [[ceramic glaze|glazing]] with an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] white [[tin-glazing|tin-glaze]], and [[Lusterware|painting in metallic lusters]].  Ottoman [[İznik pottery]] produced most of the best work in the 16th century, in tiles and large vessels boldly decorated with floral motifs influenced, once again, by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics.  These were still in earthenware; there was no porcelain made in Islamic countries until modern times, though Chinese porcelain was imported and admired.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, 175, suggests that the Persians had made some experiments towards producing it, and the earliest European porcelain, [[Medici porcelain]], was made in the late 16th century, perhaps with a Persian or [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] assistant on the team.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval Islamic world also had pottery with painted animal and human imagery. Examples are found throughout the medieval Islamic world, particularly in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |first=Eva |last=Baer |year=1983 |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=0-87395-602-8 |pages=58, 86, 143, 151, 176, 201, 226, 243, 292, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiling===
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns|Tessellation}}

[[File:HeratFridayMosque.jpg|thumb|left|Tiled exterior of the [[Friday Mosque of Herat]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
The earliest grand Islamic buildings, like the [[Dome of the Rock]], in [[Jerusalem]] had interior walls decorated with [[mosaic]]s in the Byzantine style, but without human figures.  From the 9th century onwards the distinctive Islamic tradition of glazed and brightly coloured [[tile|tiling]] for interior and exterior walls and [[dome]]s developed.  Some earlier schemes create designs using mixtures of tiles each of a single colour that are either cut to shape or are small and of a few shapes, used to create abstract geometric patterns.  Later large painted schemes use tiles painted before firing with a part of the scheme – a technique requiring confidence in the consistent results of firing.

Some elements, especially the letters of inscriptions, may be moulded in three-dimensional [[relief]], and in especially in Persia certain tiles in a design may have figurative painting of animals or single human figures.  These were often part of designs mostly made up of tiles in plain colours but with larger fully painted tiles at intervals.  The larger tiles are often shaped as eight-pointed stars, and may show animals or a human head or bust, or plant or other motifs.  The geometric patterns, such as modern North African [[zellige]] work, made of small tiles each of a single colour but different and regular shapes, are often referred to as "[[mosaic]]", which is not strictly correct.

The Mughals made much less use of tiling, preferring (and being able to afford) "parchin kari", a type of [[pietra dura]] decoration from inlaid panels of semi-precious stones, with jewels in some cases.  This can be seen at the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]] and other imperial commissions.  The motifs are usually floral, in a simpler and more realistic style than Persian or Turkish work, relating to plants in Mughal miniatures.

== Glass ==
{{main|Islamic glass}}
[[File:Luckofedenhall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"The [[Luck of Edenhall]]", a 13th-century Syrian beaker, in England since the Middle Ages]]

For most of the Middle Ages Islamic glass was the most sophisticated in [[Eurasia]], exported to both Europe and China.  Islam took over much of the traditional glass-producing territory of [[Sassanian glass|Sassanian]] and [[Ancient Roman glass]], and since figurative decoration played a small part in pre-Islamic glass, the change in style is not abrupt, except that the whole area initially  formed a political whole, and, for example, Persian innovations were now almost immediately taken up in [[Egypt]].  For this reason it is often impossible to distinguish between the various centres of production, of which Egypt, Syria and Persia were the most important, except by scientific analysis of the material, which itself has difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 135. The Introduction (pp. 131–135) is by [[Ralph Pinder-Wilson]], who shared the catalogue entries with [[Waffiya Essy]].&lt;/ref&gt;  From various documentary references glassmaking and [[Ancient glass trade|glass trading]] seems to have been a speciality of the Jewish minority in several centres.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica, "Glass", [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07392.html Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosque lamp Met 91.1.1534.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mamluk]] [[mosque lamp]]]]

Between the 8th and early 11th centuries the emphasis in luxury glass is on effects achieved by "manipulating the surface" of the glass, initially by incising into the glass on a wheel, and later by cutting away the background to leave a design in relief.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;  The very massive [[Hedwig glass]]es, only found in Europe, but normally considered Islamic (or possibly from Muslim craftsmen in [[Norman Sicily]]), are an example of this, though puzzlingly late in date.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 141&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other glass pieces probably represented cheaper versions of vessels of carved [[rock crystal]] (clear [[quartz]]), themselves influenced by earlier glass vessels,&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 141&lt;/ref&gt; and there is some evidence that at this period glass cutting and [[hardstone carving]] were regarded as the same craft.&lt;ref&gt;Endnote 111 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONUFZfcEkBgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA88&amp;dq=Islamic+glass+Jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CRdUTcrcFYHQhAepnb2vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20glass%20Jewish&amp;f=false ''Roman glass: reflections on cultural change''], Fleming, Stuart. see also endnote 110 for Jewish glassworkers&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 12th century the industry in Persia and [[Mesopotamia]] appears to decline, and the main production of luxury glass shifts to Egypt and Syria, and decorative effects of colour on smooth surfaced glass.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 133–135&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the period local centres made simpler wares such as [[Hebron glass]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

Lustre painting, by techniques similar to [[lustreware]] in pottery, dates back to the 8th century in Egypt, and became widespread in the 12th century.  Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects.  [[Gilding|Gilded]], painted and [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] glass were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork.  Some of the finest work was in [[mosque lamp]]s donated by a ruler or wealthy man.  As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it "often has a brownish-yellow tinge, and is rarely free from bubbles".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131–135, 141–146; quote, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aleppo]] seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the [[Mongol invasion]] of 1260, and [[Timur]] appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to [[Samarkand]].  By about 1500 the [[Venice|Venetians]] were receiving large orders for mosque lamps.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Islamic brasswork}}

== Metalwork ==
[[File:Bassin Syrie 1.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the "Baptistère de Saint-Louis," c. 1300, a [[Mamluk]] basin of engraved brass with gold, silver and [[niello]] inlay]]

Medieval Islamic metalwork offers a complete contrast to its European equivalent, which is dominated by modelled figures and brightly coloured decoration in [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], some pieces entirely in precious metals.  In contrast surviving Islamic metalwork consists of practical objects mostly in [[brass]], bronze, and steel, with simple, but often monumental, shapes, and surfaces highly decorated with dense decoration in a variety of techniques, but colour mostly restricted to inlays of gold, silver, copper or black [[niello]].  The most abundant survivals from medieval periods are fine brass objects, handsome enough to preserve, but not valuable enough to be melted down.  The abundant local sources of [[zinc]] compared to [[tin]] explains the rarity of [[bronze]].  Household items, such as ewers or water pitchers, were made of one or more pieces of sheet brass soldered together and subsequently worked and inlaid.&lt;ref name=Baer1983&gt;{{cite book |last=Baer |first=Eva |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s__yi4pD-VEC |year=1983 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-602-4 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s, as was the wearing of gold rings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&amp;translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]&lt;/ref&gt;  One thing Islamic metalworkers shared with European ones was high social status compared to other artists and craftsmen, and many larger pieces are signed.

Islamic work includes some three-dimensional animal figures as fountainheads or [[aquamanile]]s, but only one significant enamelled object is known, using Byzantine [[cloisonne]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 201, and earlier pages for animal shapes.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Pisa Griffin]] is the largest surviving bronze animal, probably from 11th century Al-Andaluz.  More common objects given elaborate decoration include massive low candlesticks and lamp-stands, lantern lights, bowls, dishes, basins, buckets (these probably for the bath),&lt;ref&gt;But see Arts, 170, where the standard view is disputed&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ewer]]s, as well as caskets, pen-cases and plaques. Ewers and basins were brought for hand-washing before and after each meal, so are often lavishly treated display pieces.  A typical 13th century ewer from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] is decorated with foliage, animals and the [[Signs of the Zodiac]] in silver and copper, and carries a blessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/91.1.530 "Base of a ewer with Zodiac medallions &amp;#91;Iran&amp;#93; (91.1.530)"].

(New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1997), 16. The inscription reads: ''“Bi-l-yumn wa al-baraka…”'' meaning “With bliss and divine grace…”&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialized objects include knives, arms and armour (always of huge interest to the elite) and scientific instruments such as [[astrolabe]]s, as well as [[jewellery]].  Decoration is typically densely packed and very often includes arabesques and calligraphy, sometimes naming an owner and giving a date.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 157–160, and exhibits 161–204&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applied arts ==
[[File:Dagger horse head Louvre OA7891.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dagger with hilt in [[jade]], gold, [[rubies]] and [[emerald]]s.  Blade of [[damascening|damascened]] steel inlaid with gold.]]
High levels of achievement were reached in other materials, including [[hardstone carving]]s and jewellery, ivory carving, textiles and leatherwork. During the Middle Ages, Islamic work in these fields was highly valued in other parts of the world and often traded outside the Islamic zone.  Apart from miniature painting and calligraphy, other arts of the book are decorative illumination, the only type found in Qur'an manuscripts, and Islamic book covers, which are often highly decorative in luxury manuscripts, using either the geometric motifs found in illumination, or sometimes figurative images probably drawn for the craftsmen by miniature painters.  Materials include coloured, tooled and stamped leather and [[lacquer]] over paint.&lt;ref&gt;See the relevant sections in "Arts"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precious stones===

Egyptian carving of [[rock crystal]] into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040.  There are a number of these vessels in the West, which apparently came on the market after the [[Cairo]] palace of the [[Fatimid]] [[Caliph]] was looted by his mercenaries in 1062, and were snapped up by European buyers, mostly ending up in church treasuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-fatimid-rock-crystal-ewers-most-valuable-objects-in-islamic-art/ Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art]&lt;/ref&gt; From later periods, especially the hugely wealthy Ottoman and Mughal courts, there are a considerable number of lavish objects carved in semi-precious stones, with little surface decoration, but inset with jewels.  Such objects may have been made in earlier periods, but few have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

===House and furniture===
[[File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman [[marquetry]] and tile-top table, about 1560]]
Older wood carving is typically relief or pierced work on flat objects for architectural use, such as screens, doors, roofs, beams and friezes.  An important exception are the complex [[muqarnas]] and [[mocárabe]] designs giving roofs and other architectural elements a [[stalactite]]-like appearance. These are often in wood, sometimes painted on the wood but often plastered over before painting; the examples at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada, Spain]] are among the best known.  Traditional Islamic furniture, except for chests, tended to be covered with cushions, with cupboards rather than cabinets for storage, but there are some pieces, including a low round (strictly twelve-sided) table of about 1560 from the Ottoman court, with [[marquetry]] inlays in light wood, and a single huge ceramic tile or plaque on the tabletop.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|Table]] in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The fine inlays typical of Ottoman court furniture may have developed from styles and techniques used in weapons and musical instruments, for which the finest craftsmanship available was used.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also intricately decorated caskets and chests from various periods.  A spectacular and famous (and far from flat) roof was one of the Islamic components of the 12th century Norman [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]], which picked from the finest elements of Catholic, Byzantine and Islamic art.  Other famous wooden roofs are in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].

===Ivory===

[[File:Panel hunters Louvre OA 6265-1.jpg|left|upright=&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;1.3|thumb|Ivory with traces of paint, 11th–12th century, Egypt]]
[[Ivory carving#Islamic ivory|Ivory carving]] centred on the [[Mediterranean]], spreading from Egypt, where a thriving [[Copt]]ic industry had been inherited;  Persian ivory is rare.  The normal style was a deep relief with an even surface; some pieces were painted.  Spain specialized in caskets and round boxes, which were probably used to keep jewels and perfumes.  They were produced mainly in the approximate period 930–1050, and widely exported. Many pieces are signed and dated, and on court pieces the name of the owner is often inscribed; they were typically gifts from a ruler. As well as a court workshop, [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] had commercial workshops producing goods of slightly lower quality.  In the 12th and 13th century workshops in [[Norman Sicily]] produced caskets, apparently then migrating to Granada and elsewhere after persecution.  Egyptian work tended to be in flat panels and friezes, for insertion into woodwork and probably furniture – most are now detached from their settings.  Many were calligraphic, and others continued Byzantine traditions of hunting scenes, with backgrounds of arabesques and foliage in both cases.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 147–150, and exhibits following&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:IlkhanateSilkCircular.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ilkhanid]] piece in silk, cotton and gold, Iran or Iraq, early 14th century]]

===Silk===

Despite [[Hadithic]] sayings against the wearing of silk, the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Islam.  Some designs are calligraphic, especially when made for palls to cover a tomb, but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions, with many large figures of animals, especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle.  These are often enclosed in roundels, as found in the pre-Islamic traditions.  The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs, and in Europe [[reliquaries]], where the relics were often wrapped in silk.  European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and, for example, the body of an early bishop of [[Toul]] in France was wrapped in a silk from the [[Bukhara]] area in modern [[Uzbekistan]], probably when the body was reburied in 820.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 65–68; 74, no. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Shroud of St Josse]] is a famous [[samite]] cloth from East Persia, which originally had a carpet-like design with two pairs of confronted elephants, surrounded by borders including rows of [[camel]]s and an inscription in [[Kufic]] script, from which the date appears to be before 961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 Louvre, Suaire de St-Josse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623185919/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 |date=2011-06-23 }}.

[[File:Batik Indonesia.jpg|170px|left|thumb|upright|[[Javanese culture|Javanese]] court [[batik]]]]

Ottoman silks were less exported, and the many surviving royal [[kaftan]]s have simpler geometric patterns, many featuring stylized "tiger-stripes" below three balls or circles.  Other silks have foliage designs comparable to those on Iznik pottery or carpets, with bands forming ogival compartments a popular motif. Some designs begin to show Italian influence.  By the 16th century Persian silk was using smaller patterns, many of which showed relaxed garden scenes of beautiful boys and girls from the same world as those in contemporary album miniatures, and sometimes identifiable scenes from Persian poetry. A 16th-century circular ceiling for a tent, 97&amp;nbsp;cm across, shows a continuous and crowded hunting scene; it was apparently looted by the army of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in his invasion of Persia in 1543–45, before being taken by a Polish general at the [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1683. Mughal silks incorporate many Indian elements, and often feature relatively realistic "portraits" of plants, as found in other media.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 68, 71, 82–86, 106–108, 110–111, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesian batik===
{{main|Batik}}

The development and refinement of [[Indonesia]]n ''[[batik]]'' cloth was closely linked to Islam.  The Islamic prohibition on certain images encouraged ''batik'' design to become more abstract and intricate.  Realistic depictions of animals and humans are rare on traditional ''batik''.  However, mythical serpents, humans with exaggerated features and the [[Garuda]] of pre-Islamic mythology are common motifs.

Although its existence pre-dates Islam, ''batik'' reached its zenith in royal Muslim courts such as [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], whose [[sultan]]s encouraged and patronised ''batik'' production.  Today, batik is undergoing a revival, and cloths are used for additional purposes such as wrapping the Quran.

== History ==

===Beginnings===

====Pre-dynastic====
[[File:Mschatta-Fassade (Pergamonmuseum).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mshatta facade|Palace facade from Mshatta]] in Jordan, now in the [[Pergamon Museum, Berlin]], c.&amp;nbsp;?740]]  
The period of a rapid expansion of the Islamic era forms a reasonably accurate beginning for the label of Islamic art. Early geographical boundaries of the Islamic culture were in present-day [[Syria]]. It is quite difficult to distinguish the earliest Islamic objects from their predecessors in Persian or [[Sassanid]] and [[Byzantine art]], and the conversion of the mass of the population, including artists, took a significant period, sometimes centuries, after the initial [[Muslim conquest]]. There was, notably, a significant production of unglazed ceramics, witnessed by a famous small bowl preserved in the [[Louvre]], whose inscription assures its attribution to the Islamic period. Plant motifs were the most important in these early productions.

Influences from the Sassanian artistic tradition include the image of the king as a warrior and the lion as a symbol of nobility and virility. [[Bedouin]] tribal traditions mixed with the more sophisticated styles of the conquered territories.  For an initial period coins had human figures in the Byzantine and Sassanian style, perhaps to reassure users of their continued value, before the Islamic style with lettering only took over.

====Umayyad====
[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Mosaics west.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaics from the ''riwaq'' (portico) of the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]]]]
Religious and civic architecture were developed under the [[Umayyad]] dynasty (661–750), when new concepts and new plans were put into practice.

The [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence ([[mosaic]] against a gold background, and a central plan that recalls that of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic [[frieze]]. The desert palaces in [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] (for example, [[Mshatta facade|Mshatta]], [[Qasr Amra]], and Khirbat al-Mafjar) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated, including some wall-paintings, to promote an image of royal luxury.

Work in ceramics was still somewhat primitive (unglazed) during this period. Some metal objects have survived from this time, but it remains rather difficult to distinguish these objects from those of the pre-Islamic period.

'Abd al-Malik introduced standard coinage that featured Arabic inscriptions, instead of images of the monarch. The quick development of a localized coinage around the time of the Dome of the Rock's construction demonstrates the reorientation of Umayyad acculturation. This period saw the genesis of a particularly Islamic art.

In this period, Umayyad artists and artisans did not invent a new vocabulary, but began to prefer those received from Mediterranean and Iranian [[late antiquity]], which they adapted to their own artistic conceptions. For example, the mosaics in the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]] are based on [[Byzantine]] models, but replace the figurative elements with images of trees and cities. The desert palaces also bear witness to these influences. By combining the various traditions that they had inherited, and by readapting motifs and architectural elements, artists created little by little a typically Muslim art, particularly discernible in the aesthetic of the arabesque, which appears both on monuments and in illuminated [[Qur'ān]]s.

====Abbasid====
[[File:Cup Susa Louvre MAO568.jpg|thumb|[[Lusterware]] bowl from [[Susa]], 9th century, today in the Louvre]]
The [[Abbasid dynasty]] (750 [[AD]] – 1258&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, World of Art&lt;/ref&gt;) witnessed the movement of the capital from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], and then from Baghdad to [[Samarra]]. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. [[Art history|Art historian]] Robert Hillenbrand (1999) likens the movement to the foundation of an "Islamic [[Rome]]", because the meeting of Eastern influences from Iranian, Eurasian steppe, Chinese, and Indian sources created a new paradigm for Islamic art. Classical forms inherited from Byzantine Europe and Greco-Roman sources were discarded in favor of those drawn from the new Islamic hub. Even the design of the city of Baghdad placed it in the "navel of the world", as 9th-century historian al-Ya'qubi wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient city of Baghdad cannot be excavated well, as it lies beneath the modern city. However, [[Abbasid Samarra]], which was largely abandoned, has been well studied, and is known for its surviving examples of [[stucco]] reliefs, in which the prehistory of the [[arabesque]] can be traced.  Motifs known from the stucco at Samarra permit the dating of structures built elsewhere, and are furthermore found on portable objects, particular in wood, from Egypt through to Iran.

[[Samarra]] witnessed the "coming of age" of Islamic art. Polychrome painted [[stucco]] allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: the invention of [[faience]], and of metallic [[lusterware]]. [[Hadith]]ic prohibition of the use of golden or silver vessels led to the development of metallic [[lusterware]] in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second round through the kiln, but the wish to exceed fine [[Chinese porcelain]] led to the development of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiraz Textile Fragment with Inscriptions with Name of Caliph al-Muti', 946-974.jpg|thumb|upright=&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;1.3|Tiraz Textile Fragment, 946–974 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Though the common perception of Abbasid artistic production focuses largely on pottery, the greatest development of the Abbasid period was in textiles. Government-run workshops known as ''[[tiraz]]'' produced silks bearing the name of the monarch, allowing for aristocrats to demonstrate their loyalty to the ruler. Other silks were pictorial. The utility of silk-ware in wall decor, entrance adornment, and room separation was not as important as its cash value along the "[[silk route]]".

Calligraphy began to be used in surface decoration on pottery during this period. Illuminated [[Qur'an]]s gained attention, letter-forms now more complex and stylized to the point of slowing down the recognition of the words themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period (9th–15th centuries)===
Beginning in the 9th century, Abbasid sovereignty was contested in the provinces furthest removed from the Iraqi center. The creation of a [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] dynasty, that of the north African [[Fatimid]]s, followed by the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Umayyads in Spain]], gave force to this opposition, as well as small dynasties and autonomous governors in Iran.

====Spain and the Maghreb====
[[File:Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover.JPG|thumb|Moroccan [[Islamic embroidery|Embroidery]] [[fly mask]]]]
[[File:Pyxid Al Mughira OA 4068.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pyxis of al-Mughira]], Madinat al-Zahra, Spain, 968]]

The first Islamic dynasty to establish itself in Spain (or [[al-Andalus]]) was that of the Spanish Umayyads. As their name indicates, they were descended from the great Umayyads of Syria. After their fall, the Spanish Umayyads were replaced by various autonomous kingdoms, the [[taifa]]s (1031–91), but the artistic production from this period does not differ significantly from that of the Umayyads. At the end of the 11th century, two Berber tribes, the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], captured the head of the Maghreb and Spain, successively, bringing Maghrebi influences into art. A series of military victories by Christian monarchs had reduced Islamic Spain by the end of the 14th century to the city of [[Granada]], ruled by the Nasirid dynasty, who managed to maintain their hold until 1492.

Al-Andalus was a great cultural center of the Middle Ages. Besides the great universities, which taught philosophies and sciences yet unknown in Christendom (such as those of [[Averroes]]), the territory was an equally vital center for art.

Many techniques were employed in the manufacture of objects. Ivory was used extensively for the manufacture of boxes and caskets. The [[pyxis of al-Mughira]] is a masterwork of the genre. In metalwork, large sculptures in the round, normally rather scarce in the Islamic world, served as elaborate receptacles for water or as fountain spouts. A great number of textiles, most notably silks, were exported: many are found in the church treasuries of Christendom, where they served as covering for saints’ [[reliquaries]]. From the periods of [[Maghreb]]i rule one may also note a taste for painted and sculpted woodwork.

The art of north Africa is not as well studied. The Almoravid and Almohad dynasties are characterized by a tendency toward austerity, for example in mosques with bare walls. Nevertheless, luxury arts continued to be produced in great quantity. The Marinid and Hafsid dynasties developed an important, but poorly understood, architecture, and a significant amount of painted and sculpted woodwork.

====Arab Mashriq====
The Fatimid dynasty, which reigned in Egypt from 909 and 1171 introduced crafts and knowledge from politically troubled Baghdad to Cairo.

By the year 1070, the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s emerged as the dominant political force in the Muslim world after they liberated Baghdad and defeated the Byzantines at [[Manzikert]]. During the rule of [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]] the Seljuks excelled in architecture at the same time in Syria, the [[atabeg]]s (governors of Seljuk princes) assumed power. Quite independent, they capitalized on conflicts with the Frankish [[Crusades|crusaders]]. In 1171, [[Saladin]] seized Fatimid Egypt, and installed the transitory [[Ayyubid dynasty]] on the throne. This period is notable for innovations in metallurgy and the widespread manufacture of the Damascus steel swords and daggers and the production ceramics, glass and metalwork of a high quality were produced without interruption, and enameled glass became another important craft.

In 1250, the [[Mamluk]]s seized control of Egypt from the Ayyubids, and by 1261 had managed to assert themselves in Syria as well their most famous ruler was [[Baibars]]. The Mamluks were not, strictly speaking, a dynasty, as they did not maintain a patrilineal mode of succession; in fact, Mamluks were freed Turkish and Caucasian slaves, who (in theory) passed the power to others of like station. This mode of government persevered for three centuries, until 1517, and gave rise to abundant architectural projects (many thousands of buildings were constructed during this period), while patronage of luxury arts favored primarily enameled glass and metalwork, and is remembered as the golden age of medieval Egypt.  The "Baptistère de Saint-Louis" in the [[Louvre]] is an example of the very high quality of metalwork at this period.

====Iran and Central Asia====
[[File:SamarkandBibiKhanym.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]], [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]], built by [[Timur]] in 1399]]
In Iran and the north of India, the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]], [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurids]] struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] and [[Ghazni]], and the construction of the Great Mosque of [[Isfahan]] (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated, while potters developed quite individual styles: kaleidoscopic ornament on a yellow ground; or marbled decorations created by allowing colored glazes to run; or painting with multiple layers of slip under the glaze.

The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]], nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of "Seljuq" works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]] to [[Merv]], [[Nishapur]], [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], and [[Isfahan]], all in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.89&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze and designed by anthropic figure with bull head Golestan, Gorgan 9th century CE, Early Islamic period.jpg|thumb|Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze, Gorgan, 9th century CE, Early Islamic period, National Museum of Iran]]
Popular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth.   Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece.  For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques.  Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.91&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated.  In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous.  It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware and the manufacture of vessels, not out of clay, but out of a [[silicon]] paste ("[[fritware]]"), while metalworkers began to encrust bronze with precious metals.  Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen.  These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th century, the [[Mongols]] under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]] swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] in China, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] in Iran and the [[Golden Horde]] in northern Iran and southern Russia.

=====Ilkhanids=====
A rich civilization developed under these "little khans", who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north-south orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of "iranisation" took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the "Iranian plan" mosques, was resumed. The [[Persian miniature|art of the Persian book]] was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the lajvardina (a variation on luster-ware), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts.

=====The Golden Horde and the Timurids=====
The early arts of the nomads of the Golden Horde are poorly understood. Research is only beginning, and evidence for town planning and architecture has been discovered. There was also a significant production of works in gold, which often show a strong Chinese influence. Much of this work is preserved today in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].

The beginning of the third great period of medieval Iranian art, that of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], was marked by the invasion of a third group of nomads, under the direction of [[Timur]]. During the 15th century this dynasty gave rise to a golden age in Persian manuscript painting, including renowned painters such as [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād]], but also a multitude of workshops and patrons.

====Syria, Iraq, Anatolia====
[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|[[Çifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum. Before 1265]]
The Seljuq Turks pushed beyond Iran into Anatolia, winning a victory over the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (1071), and setting up a sultanate independent of the Iranian branch of the dynasty. Their power seems largely to have waned following the Mongol invasions in 1243, but coins were struck under their name until 1304. Architecture and objects synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. The art of woodworking was cultivated, and at least one illustrated manuscript dates to this period.

[[Caravanserai]]s dotted the major trade routes across the region, placed at intervals of a day's travel. The construction of these caravanserai [[inns]] improved in scale, fortification, and replicability. Also, they began to contain central mosques.

The [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] were nomads who settled in the area of [[Lake Van]]. They were responsible for a number of mosques, such as the [[The Blue Mosque of Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] in [[Tabriz]], and they had a decisive influence after the fall of the Anatolian Seljuqs. Starting in the 13th century, Anatolia was dominated by small Turkmen dynasties, which progressively chipped away at Byzantine territory. Little by little a major dynasty emerged, that of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]], who, after 1450, are referred to as the "first Ottomans". Turkmen artworks can be seen as the forerunners of Ottoman art, in particular the "Milet" ceramics and the first blue-and-white Anatolian works.

Islamic book painting witnessed its first golden age in the thirteenth century, mostly from Syria and Iraq. Influence from Byzantine visual vocabulary (blue and gold coloring, angelic and victorious motifs, symbology of drapery) combined with Mongoloid facial types in 12th-century [[book frontispiece]]s.

Earlier coinage necessarily featured Arabic [[epigraphy|epigraph]]s, but as Ayyubid society became more cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic, coinage began to feature [[astrology|astrological]], figural (featuring a variety of Greek, Seleucid, Byzantine, Sasanian, and contemporary Turkish rulers' busts), and animal images.

Hillenbrand suggests that the medieval Islamic texts called ''[[Maqama]]t'', copied and illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti]] were some of the earliest "[[coffee table book]]s". They were among the first texts to hold up a mirror to daily life in Islamic art, portraying humorous stories and showing little to no inheritance of pictorial tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.128-131&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian subcontinent====
[[File:RedFortAgra-Musamman-Burj-20080211-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] inlays at the  [[Agra Fort]], India.]]
The Indian subcontinent, some northern parts of which conquered by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in the 9th century, did not become autonomous until 1206, when the Muizzi, or slave-kings, seized power, marking the birth of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Later other competing sultanates were founded in [[Bengal]], [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]], [[Gujarat]], [[Jaunpur Sultanate|Jaunpur]], [[Malwa (Madhya Pradesh)|Malwa]], and in the north [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmanids]]). They separated themselves little by little from Persian traditions, giving birth to an original approach to architecture and urbanism, marked in particular by interaction with [[Hindu]] art. Study of the production of objects has hardly begun, but a lively art of manuscript illumination is known. The period of the sultanates ended with the arrival of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], who progressively seized their territories.

===The Three Empires===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}

====Ottomans====
[[File:Iznik ware 1500 1510.jpg|thumb|left|16th century [[İznik pottery]]]]
The [[Ottoman Empire]], whose origins lie in the 14th century, continued in existence until shortly after [[World War I]]. This impressive longevity, combined with an immense territory (stretching from Anatolia to Tunisia), led naturally to a vital and distinctive art, including plentiful architecture, mass production of ceramics for both tiles and vessels, most notably [[İznik pottery|Iznik ware]], important metalwork and jewellery, Turkish paper marbling [[Ebru]], [[Turkish carpet]]s as well as tapestries and exceptional [[Ottoman miniature]]s and decorative [[Ottoman illumination]].

Masterpieces of Ottoman manuscript illustration include the two "[[Surname-I Hümayun|books of festivals]]" (Surname-I Hümayun), one dating from the end of the 16th century, and the other from the era of Sultan [[Murad III]]. These books contain numerous illustrations and exhibit a strong [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] influence; thus they may have been inspired by books captured in the course of the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 16th century.

The Ottomans are also known for their development of a bright red pigment, "Iznik red", in ceramics, which reached their height in the 16th century, both in tile-work and pottery, using floral motifs that were considerably transformed from their Chinese and Persian models.  From the 18th century, Ottoman art came under considerable European influence, the Turks adopting versions of [[Rococo]] which had a lasting and not very beneficial effect, leading to over-fussy decoration.

====Mughals====
[[File:The marriage procession of Dara Shikoh - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|An illustrated manuscript of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] attending the marriage procession of his eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]]. Mughal-Era [[fireworks]] brightened the night throughout the wedding ceremony.]]
The [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] lasted from 1526 until (technically) 1858, although from the late 17th century power flowed away from the emperors to local rulers, and later European powers, above all the [[British Raj]], who were the main power in India by the late 18th century. The period is most notable for luxury arts of the court, and Mughal styles heavily influenced local Hindu and later [[Sikh]] rulers as well. The [[Mughal miniature]] began by importing Persian artists, especially a group brought back by [[Humayun]] when in exile in [[Safavid]] Persia, but soon local artists, many Hindu, were trained in the style.  Realistic portraiture, and images of animals and plants, was developed in Mughal art beyond what the Persians had so far achieved, and the size of miniatures increased, sometimes onto canvas.  The Mughal court had access to European prints and other art, and these had increasing influence, shown in the gradual introduction of aspects of Western [[graphical perspective]], and a wider range of poses in the human figure.  Some Western images were directly copied or borrowed from.  As the courts of local [[Nawab]]s developed, distinct provincial styles with stronger influence from traditional [[Indian painting]] developed in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts.

The arts of jewelry and [[hardstone carving]] of gemstones, such as [[jasper]], [[jade]], adorned with rubies, diamonds and emeralds are mentioned by the Mughal chronicler [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l Fazl]], and a range of examples survive; the series of hard stone daggers in the form of horses’ heads is particularly impressive.

The Mughals were also fine metallurgists they introduced [[Damascus steel]] and refined the locally produced [[Wootz steel]], the Mughals also introduced the "bidri" technique of metalwork in which silver motifs are pressed against a black background. Famous Mughal metallurgists like [[Ali Kashmiri]] and [[Muhammed Salih Thatawi]] created the [[wikt:seamless|seamless]] [[celestial globes]].

====Safavids and Qajars====
[[File:Sheykh lotfollah mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to [[Sheykh Lotfollah mosque]], [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], [[Isfahan]]]]
The Iranian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], a dynasty stretching from 1501 to 1786, is distinguished from the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, and earlier Persian rulers, in part through the Shi'a faith of its shahs, which they succeeded in making the majority denomination in Persia.  Ceramic arts are marked by the strong influence of Chinese porcelain, often executed in [[blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]. Architecture flourished, attaining a high point with the building program of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] in [[Isfahan]], which included numerous gardens, palaces (such as [[Ālī Qāpū|Ali Qapu]]), an immense bazaar, and a [[Shah Mosque|large imperial mosque]].

[[File:Fes Medersa Bou Inania Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bou Inania Madrasa]], [[Fes]], [[Morocco]], [[zellige]] mosaic tiles forming elaborate [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] [[tessellations]]]]

The art of manuscript illumination also achieved new heights, in particular in the [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] [[Shahnameh]], an immense copy of [[Ferdowsi]]’s poem containing more than 250 paintings. In the 17th century a new type of painting develops, based around the album ([[muraqqa]]). The albums were the creations of conoisseurs who bound together single sheets containing paintings, drawings, or calligraphy by various artists, sometimes excised from earlier books, and other times created as independent works. The paintings of [[Reza Abbasi]] figure largely in this new art of the book, depicting one or two larger figures, typically idealized beauties in a garden setting, often using the [[grisaille]] techniques previously used for border paintings for the background.

After the fall of the Safavids, the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]], a [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribe established from centuries on the banks of the [[Caspian Sea]], assumed power. Qajar art displays an increasing European influence, as in the large oil paintings portraying the Qajar shahs. Steelwork also assumed a new importance. Like the Ottomans, the Qajar dynasty survived until 1925, a few years after the First World War.

== Modern period ==
From the 15th century, the number of smaller Islamic courts began to fall, as the Ottoman Empire, and later the Safavids and European powers, swallowed them up; this had an effect on Islamic art, which was usually strongly led by the patronage of the court.  From at least the 18th century onwards, elite Islamic art was increasingly influenced by European styles, and in the applied arts either largely adopted Western styles, or ceased to develop, retaining whatever style was prevalent at some point in the late 18th or early 19th centuries.  Many industries with very long histories, such as [[Persian pottery|pottery in Iran]], largely closed, while others, like metalwork in [[brass]], became generally frozen in style, with much of their production going to tourists or exported as oriental exotica.

The carpet industry has remained large, but mostly uses designs that originated before 1700, and competes with machine-made imitations both locally and around the world.  Arts and crafts with a broader social base, like the [[zellige]] mosaic tiles of the [[Maghreb]], have often survived better.  Islamic countries have developed modern and contemporary art, with very vigorous art worlds in some countries, but the degree to which these should be grouped in a special category as "Islamic art" is questionable, although many artists deal with Islam-related themes, and use traditional elements such as calligraphy.  Especially in the oil-rich parts of the Islamic world much modern architecture and interior decoration makes use of motifs and elements drawn from the heritage of Islamic art.

'''Jacques Ploncard''' (13 March 1910, [[Chalon-sur-Saône]] – 20 February 2005), also called "Jacques Ploncard d'Assac", was a [[French people|French]] writer and [[journalist]] and a [[far right]] activist — he was, among other things, a member of the [[Parti Populaire Français]]. Following the fall of the [[Vichy regime]], he escaped to [[Portugal]]'s ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' in 1945, where he counselled [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]. He introduced [[Yves Guérin-Sérac]], one of the co-founder of the [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]], to the [[PIDE]]. After the April 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], he returned to France and collaborated on ''[[Présent]]'', a far right newspaper which maintains loose links with [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[National Front (France)|National Front]]. Jacques Ploncard also wrote ''Doctrines of [[Nationalism]]''.

His son, Philippe Ploncard, was also a member of the National Front.

[[File:NAMA Mystères d'Eleusis.jpg|thumb|In this votive plaque depicting elements of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], a female figure ''(top center of rectangular portion)'' wears a ''kernos'' on her head]]

In the [[Typology of Greek vase shapes|typology of ancient Greek pottery]], the '''''kernos''''' (Greek κέρνος or κέρχνος, plural ''kernoi'') is a pottery ring or stone tray to which are attached several small vessels for holding offerings. Its unusual design is described in literary sources, which also list the ritual ingredients it might contain.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquelyn Collins-Clinton, A Late Antique Shrine of Liber Pater at Cosa (Brill, 1976), pp. 29 –30 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=kernos&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=kernos&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kernos'' was used primarily in the cults of [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]], and of [[Cybele]] and [[Attis]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillippe Borgeaud, ''Mother of the Gods: From Cybele to the Virgin Mary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, English translation 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9O96bVwwKkC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=kernos&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=kernos&amp;f=false ''passim''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term is sometimes applied to similar compound vessels from other cultures found in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Excavations at Mohenjo Daro, Pakistan: The Pottery'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum, 1986), p. 226 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iew_THp8foC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=kernos&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=kernos&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary description==
[[Athenaeus]] preserves an ancient description of the ''kernos'' as

{{cquote|a [[terracotta]] vessel with many little bowls stuck on to it. In them there is sage, white poppy heads, wheat, barley, peas (?), vetches (?), pulse, lentils, beans, spelt (?), oats, cakes of compressed fruit, honey, olive oil, wine, milk, and unwashed sheep's wool. When one has carried this vessel, like a ''[[liknon|liknophoros]]'', he tastes of the contents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]] 11.478c = Polemon, frg. 88 Preller; English translation from Homer A. Thompson, ''Hellenistic Pottery and Terracottas'' (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1987), p. 448 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ec8ejUxhfVwC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=kernos&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=kernos&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''kernos'' was carried in procession at the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] atop the head of a priestess, as can be found depicted in art. A lamp was sometimes placed in the middle of a stationary ''kernos''.&lt;ref&gt;The verb ''kernophorein'' means "to bear the ''kernos''"; the noun for this is ''kernophoria''; Stephanos Xanthoudides, "Cretan Kernoi," ''Annual of the British School at Athens'' 12 (1906), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

([[Southern Song Dynasty]]), was a famous Chinese [[Buddhist monk]], [[calligrapher]], idealist philosopher, and is the founder of the [[Kenchō-ji]] sect, which is a branch of the [[Rinzai school]]. 

Lanxi Daolong entered temple life at the age of thirteen. Due to the Mongol Conquest of the Song Dynasty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confucianism.com.cn/html/A00010014/11726435.html |title=中国古代战争年表1 -中国国学网 |publisher=Confucianism.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in China in 1246, also driven by the new trend that Zen monks of the Southern Song Dynasty increasingly tended to voluntarily go to Japan to preach [[Zen]] Buddhism, plus the influences of his teachers and friends, he sailed to Japan to preach Zen Buddhism, and later moved to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], where he took charge of [[Kenchō-ji]] (建長寺).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenchoji.com/ |title=大本山 巨福山 建長寺 &amp;#124; 臨済宗建長寺派 大本山 建長寺の公式ページです |publisher=Kenchoji.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having accepted the invitation of [[Hōjō Tokiyori]] (北条時頼) in 1253.&lt;ref&gt;"Flammule Dictionary", P3781, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lanxi Daolongs calligraphy was famous in Japan, especially ''Rule of Zen'' (法语规则). Daolong died in Kenchō-ji, and was given the Posthumous Name as Dajue Zen Master (大覚禅師, Daikaku Zenji in Japanese) by [[Emperor Go-Uda]] (後宇多天皇). Throughout his lifetime, he made great contributions to promote Sino-Japanese cultural interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbllxx.com/typenews1.asp?id=2022 |title=湖北理论信息网 |publisher=Hbllxx.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early life in China===
Lanxi Daolong was born in Lanxi, Fujiang, Sichuan Province (presently Mianyang, Sichuan Province) in 1213 (in the Jiading period of Southern Song Dynasty) and died in Japan on July 24, 1278 at 2pm. It is difficult to trace his parenthood and the living conditions of his childhood. We only know that the family name of Lanxi Daolong was Ran. According to ''Biographies of Monks'' (高僧传),&lt;ref&gt;高僧传/ (南朝梁释) 慧 皎撰 汤用彤校注 北京:中华书局,1992.10&lt;/ref&gt; Lanxi Daolong displayed purity, excellence and bravery. 

In 1226, at the age of 13, he went to Daci Temple ([[:zh:大慈寺]]), Chengdu, and he was tonsured to participate in various forms of Zen learning in 1227. Later, he went to Zhejiang Province to learn Zen from Wuzhun Shifan in Wanshou Temple (万寿寺),&lt;ref&gt;《中华文化画报》，7th issue, 2008,http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/ZHHB200807013.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  and finally became a disciple of Chijue Daochong, Beijian Jujian and so on. Daolong persevered in learning dhyana there. Before long he began to travel through Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi, finally settling down in Yangshan (in Wuxi, Jiangsu) where he learned Zen from Renjue (formerly known as Wuming Huixing, 1160–1237) in Cuiwei Temple.

=== Travel to Japan ===
In the autumn of the 6th year of Chunhu (AD 1246), at the age of 33, Lanxi Daolong left for Japan with his disciples and two statues of the Buddha to preach Zen, boarding a Japanese merchant ship from Tiantong Temple in Ningbo, Zhejiang.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jssdfz.com:8080/dfz/book/index.jsp?bookName=book/1996-1/DEFAULT.html&lt;/ref&gt; First, he arrived in [[Dazaifu, Fukuoka|Daizaifu]] (太宰府) and wrote ''The rite of sitting in meditation'' (坐禅仪) to instruct his followers. In the second year, he arrived in Kyoto and lived in [[Sennyū-ji]] (泉涌寺), a Ritsu temple. After spending some years in Kyushu and Kyoto, Lanxi Daolong came to Kamakura. In 1248, he went to Kikokuzan Kongō Jufuku Zenji (亀谷山金剛寿福禅寺), a temple of the Kenchō-ji branch of the Rinzai sect, usually known as [[Jufuku-ji]] (寿福寺). 

In 1249, [[Hōjō Tokiyori]] (北條時賴), the fifth shikken (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate, decided to build a Zen training monastery, and at that time, he has converted to Lanxi Daolong. Built according to the architecture style of the Chinese Song Dynasty, [[Kenchō-ji]] (建長寺), a Rinzai Zen temple, was constructed on the orders of [[Emperor Go-Fukakusa]] (後深草天皇) in Kamakura　and completed in 1253, fifth year of the Kenchō era, from which it takes its name, and Lanxi Daolong became its first abbot. Lanxi Daolong preached Zen in Kamakura for 13 years. Later [[Emperor Kameyama]] (亀山天皇) recalled Lanxi Daolong to Kyoto and appointed him the eleventh abbot of [[Kennin-ji]] (建仁寺). Lanxi Daolong made it a purely Zen institution, and three years later, he returned to Kamakura. There he was exiled twice to [[Kōshū, Yamanashi|Kōshū]] (甲州). He built more than 20 temples during his exile in Kōshū, [[Shinshū]] (信州) and [[Mutsu Province|Ōshū]] (奥州). [[Hōjō Tokimune]] (北条時宗) remitted Lanxi Daolong and greeted him back to Kamakura. Lanxi Daolong selected a site for [[Engaku-ji]] (円覚寺), but in 1278, he died before the construction. After his nirvana, there are Buddha's relics. During his thirty-three-year stay in Japan, he built 49 temples and now these temples have become famous Buddhist architectures.&lt;ref&gt;“Buddhist Communication History Between China and Japan", Chapter 18, http://dongchu.ddbc.edu.tw/html/02/cwdc_02/cwdc_020436.html#d1e14556&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Works of calligraphy ===
In calligraphy, Lanxi Daolong imitated [[Huang Tingjian]], Zhang Jizhi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfrx.cn/old/searches.php?id=89 |title=书法报&amp;#124;书法艺术网 |publisher=Sfrx.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chu Suiliang]]’s works of calligraphy, and he not only inherited the core of their works, but also developed it, and formed his own style. His calligraphy has an elegant pattern. The force of his writing was powerful and skillful. The whole style was simple and straight. 

In the calligraphy circles of Japanese Buddhist temple, Lanxi Daolong was equal to Rong Xi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.fjdh.com/index.php?doc-view-36329.html |title=荣西- 佛教百科-佛教知识堂 佛教百科_佛经_法师 - Powered by HDWiki! |publisher=Wiki.fjdh.com |date=2008-01-21 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a few works of his calligraphy are extant today. Two works of ''Rule of Zen'' (法语规则) and three works of ''The article of reading the variant Chinese characters'' (重文讽诵文) are now stored at Kenchō-ji (建長寺) and are national treasures of Japan. The work of ''Diamond Sutra'' (金刚经) preserved in the Da De temple of Kyoto is also an important work of his calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://202.107.212.146/homepage/page02-10-01.php?id=1095749510&amp;theme=418&amp;uptheme=true |title=欢迎光临宁波文化网!-兰溪道隆 |publisher=202.107.212.146 |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences on Japanese culture ==

=== Buddhism ===
Living in Japan for more than 30 years, Lanxi Daolong had great effects on Japanese culture. He was the first one to introduce the Pure Zen Buddhism of Song Dynasty into Japan. In addition, Lanxi Daolong also brought the Song Dynasty characterized culture into Japan, for instance, the Edo [[Neo-Confucianism]] and philosophy, the literature and art, the architectural aesthetics and the daily customs. By mixing them with Japanese culture, he accelerated the formation of Japanese Zen Buddhism. Moreover, Lanxi Daolong had strong supports from Japanese rulers, especially from the [[Kamakura Shogunate]] , which paved the road for the development of Zen Buddhism in Japan and helped it establish its leadership position in the various Japanese Buddhism sects. Furthermore, the Zen Buddhism had a great impact on the formation of the [[Bushidō]] and the national character of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-ZHHB200807013.htm |title=禅僧兰溪道隆与日本文化-《中华文化画报》2008年07期 |publisher=Cnki.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tea ===
As drinking tea was prevalent in Buddhist temple and the provinces of [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]] and [[Sichuan]] where Lanxi Daolong used to live in were the main tea-producing areas, he was deeply influenced by the [[tea culture]].We can find many words and phrases concerning "drinking tea" in Quotations from Lanxi Daolong.Therefore, Lanxi Daolong required his disciples to follow strictly the discipling of drinking tea, the way as many people in Southern Song Dynasty did. What Lanxi Daolong did made contributions to the formation and spread of [[Japanese tea ceremony]].

=== Drama ===
It is still inconclusive about his influence on Japanese drama. But Lanxi Daolong had written a poem in Japan. In this poem, he expressed the insights of Zen Buddhism by recalling the scene that he was seeing the [[Zaju]] in Sichuan province. By confirmation, Some scholars think that it is the important clue approving that Japanese drama was influenced by Zaju of Song Dynasty. Thus, he was regarded as one of the important figures in the exchanges of Sino-Japanese drama culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/YKXX200822021.htm |title=南宋禅僧兰溪道隆对日本文化的影响-《学习月刊》2008年22期-中国知网 |publisher=Mall.cnki.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
Lanxi Daolong mainly used three forms to communicate Chinese literature with Japanese literature:

First, Lanxi Daolong quoted a large number of references of the [[Tang poetry]] and [[Song poetry]] and literary [[allusions]] when he preached Zen, for example "The cloud does at the end of the Castle Peak, but the pedestrian is outside the Castle Peak" (白云尽处是青山, 行人更在青山外).,&lt;ref&gt;''中华诗词-全宋诗-释慧性'' http://book.guqu.net/quansongshi/18636.html&lt;/ref&gt; "Disregard the changing circumstances" (刻舟求剑) and "Castles in the air" (画饼充饥).

Second, Daolong often wrote poems about Zen and his feelings. These poems were full of grace and charm, and had a great influence on [[Literature of the Five Mountains]] ([[:ja:五山文学]]).Third, Quotations from Lanxi Daolong, which was edited by the disciples of Lanxi Daolong, has enriched and improved the literary genre of Japanese Zen Quotations with Rich content, complete form, and wide propagation. It was regarded as one of the signs of maturity of Japanese Zen Quotations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30642">This is a list of well-known [[Mormon dissident]]s or other [[LDS Church]] members who have either [[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|been excommunicated]] or have been resigned from the church &amp;ndash; as well as of individuals no longer self-identifying as LDS. In a very few cases, the list below may include former adherents of other [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint movement denominations]] who have ceased identifying as Mormon, as well.

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
Although [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) does not regularly disseminate information about the excommunication or resignation of former members, persons who are here identified as having been excommunicated or resigned from the church have made such information public. In addition to former members of the LDS Church, there are a small number of adherents of related denominations (as labeled).

See: [[List of Latter-day Saints]] for current members of the LDS Church.

'''Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla''' (22 September 1875 – 25 May 1956), also abbreviated '''M. N. Dhalla''', was a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] priest and religious scholar.

Dhalla is best known for his criticism of the orthodox factions within the [[Parsi people|Parsi]] community. In particular, he was stringently opposed to the excessive ritualization of religious practice, including that of the use of the [[Towers of Silence]]. In his autobiography, he was also critical of the orthodox refusal to accept converts,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975}}, ch. LXV, LXVI.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that "the permanent blockade to an influx from outside, the abandoning of the fold by an increasing number of both men and women, and the ever-falling birth-rate of the community [...] it can be said that [the question of conversion] has become the thread on which hangs the very existence of this microscopic community."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|pp=713–714}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' entry for Dhalla – written by the son of a contemporary of Dhalla's with whom the Head Priest was at loggerheads for many years – summarizes Dhallas's position as "embroiled in the problem of proselytizing [...] that plagued the community; even though he held liberal views in the matter, he always sided with the orthodox majority."&lt;ref name="JamaspAsa_1996_para2"&gt;{{harvnb|JamaspAsa|1996|loc=para. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dhalla himself merely acknowledged that "in replying to questions concerning ceremonies and conventions I do not give my personal opinion as a thinking individual or as a humble scholar or as a reformist, because I have no authority to do so. I am the Head Priest of a [community] that is 75% conservative and of a performing priest-class that is 99% orthodox. These gentlemen consider the later [traditional treatises] as authentic law-books on customs and conventions, hence my replies are perforce based mainly in conformity with their teachings."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=547}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Maneckji Dhalla was born on 22 September 1875 in [[Surat|Surat, India]] into a family of ''Godavara'' priests. At age 3, he was sent with his father Nusserwanji Dhalla to [[Karachi]] (then a city in the [[Sindh]] province of [[British India]], and today lies in Pakistan), where his father had subsequently employed.

In 1890, at the age of 15, Dhalla began his training for the priesthood. Shortly thereafter he interrupted his studies in order to work and so augment the family's meagre income. In 1894, Dhalla became editor of a monthly magazine ''Goolshan-e-Danesh.'' Two years later, Dhalla acquired ownership of the magazine but was forced to shut it down when funds ran out a few months later. The debt incurred would remain with him for many years.

Dhalla completed his clerical training on 21 March 1895 at the age of 20 and his first lecture as a full-fledged priest was on ''[[atar|atash]]'', fire. In the next three years, he published six booklets (in the [[Gujarati language]]) on various aspects of the Zoroastrian religion. On 21 September 1900, just shy of his 25th birthday, Dhalla delivered his first public lecture in Bombay (present day [[Mumbai]]), the first of what would become a lecture tour of the Indian subcontinent.

The lecture series made him famous among the [[Parsi people|Parsi]] community, and in August 1901 Dhalla was accepted at the postgraduate degree program in [[Avestan]] and [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] studies at the [[Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy|Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Madressa]] (today the J. J. Institute) in Bombay. He graduated in 1904, having completed the five-year course in just over three.

In May 1905 and with the financial support of [[Parsi people|Parsi]] community (in particular that of the [[Tata family]]), Dhalla continued his studies at [[Columbia University]] in New York City, where he studied under the personal tutelage of [[A. V. Williams Jackson]], an authority on the [[Avestan language]]. Even with the preparatory assistance of [[Shapurji Saklatvala]] and [[Jivanji Jamshedji Modi]], New York was initially quite a culture shock for Dhalla, who until his arrival in the United States had never even worn "foreign attire."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|pp=109–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "How and when to wear these [suits] was quite unknown to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, and with great pecuniary discipline, for the next three years Dhalla studied [[Iranian languages]] and [[Sanskrit]] as majors with minors in philology and philosophy. He received a [[Master of Arts|Master's degree]] in 1906. Following the publication of his thesis on ''The Nyaishes or Zoroastrian Litanies'', Dhalla was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in May 1908.

The experience at Columbia University gave Dhalla "a new outlook on life"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he began "observing religious literature from a new angle."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He "renounced conventional religion"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his "fascination for ritualistic religion" faded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=199}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He now "considered ethics as the highest form of religion"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=215}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "embraced the path of devotion"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His "antagonism for western culture turned to amity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|p=229}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it would be later said that his time at Columbia had made him "felt attracted to mysticism,"&lt;ref name="JamaspAsa_1996_para1"&gt;{{harvnb|JamaspAsa|1996|loc=para. 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dhalla unambiguously says the opposite in his own autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|pp=224–228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 1914 Dhalla and his wife again sailed again for the United States, where Dhalla was to have his book ''Zoroastrian Theology'' published. While there, Dhalla delivered a series of lectures on 'The Culture of the East' under the chairmanship of Williams Jackson.

In September 1921 Dhalla, accompanied by his wife and son (Nariman, who would eventually also study at Columbia), again proceeded to New York, this time to have his book ''Zoroastrian Civilization'' published. On the way, the family also spent four months in [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], where Dhalla again gave a series of lectures. Although Dhalla was appalled at the living conditions (not just of Zoroastrians), he found that the still-medieval infrastructure afforded him with opportunities for closer contacts with the people that he would have had with more modern forms of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1975|pp=401–403}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, Dhalla delivered lectures whenever the opportunity arose. Following the publication of his book, Dhalla and family returned to Karachi via London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Milan, Rome, and Naples, and felt the effects of the war that had ended only three years previously. Following a five-week layover in Bombay, they returned to Karachi in July 1922.

In 1929, Dhalla journeyed again to New York to attend Columbia University's 175th anniversary celebrations, and at which he received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] (Litt.D.). His book ''Our Perfecting World: Zarathushtra's Way of Life'' was subsequently published there and he again delivered lectures. On his return journey – this time eastwards – he was surprised to discover that he was known in Japan. It turned out that a newspaper article on him had recently been published. Dhalla was upgraded to a first class cabin for the onward journey to Karachi.

In June 1935, Dhalla was awarded the title of ''Shams-ul Ulema'' by the [[British India|British colonial government]]. In January 1938, Dhalla again travelled to New York, where his magnum opus ''The History of Zoroastrianism'' was then published.

On 24 June 1942 his wife Cooverbai died of a stomach affliction. She was 65. Dhalla continued to write and give lectures until 1954. He died in 1956, aged 79. He was the only ordained Dastur or High Priest of Karachi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5728">In the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the '''Manu''' is one of the most important beings at the highest levels of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Initiation]] of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], along with [[Sanat Kumara]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the [[Maha Chohan]], and [[Djwal Khul]].  According to Theosophy, each [[root race]] has its own ''Manu'' which physically [[Reincarnation|incarnates]] in an advanced body of an individual of the old root race and physically progenerates with a suitable female partner the first individuals of the new root race.  The Theosophical concept of the Manu is derived from the concept in [[Hinduism]] that the [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] was the being who was the progenitor of the [[human race]]. 

When the ''Manu'' is spoken of in Theosophy, normally the "being" referred to, is the ''Vaivasvatu Manu.''

==Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
In Theosophy, the ''Vaivasvatu Manu'' is regarded as the progenitor of the fifth root race, the [[Root race#The fifth root race (Aryan)|Aryan root race]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 28&lt;/ref&gt;  This progeneration is believed to have taken place 100,000 years ago in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].  

The progenitor of the fourth root race, the [[Root race#The fourth root race (Atlantean)|Atlantean root race]], is called the ''Chakshusha Manu'' and is in appearance an individual of the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 31&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[C.W. Leadbeater]], a colony will be established in [[Baja California]] by the [[Theosophical Society]] under the guidance of the [[Ascended masters|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] in the [[28th century]] for the intensive selective [[Eugenics|eugenic]] breeding of the [[Root race#The sixth root race|sixth root race]].  The Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu ("progenitor") of this new root race.&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie and Leadbeater, C.W. ''[[Man: Whence, How and Whither]]''  Adyar, India:1913 Theosophical Publishing House Part Three ''Whither'' Chapters 22-26 (Pages 353-495) Note: On page vii of the Introduction it is stated that the information in the book is a result of Leadbeater's inspection of the [[Akashic records]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascended master teachings==
In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of [[religion]]s based on Theosophy, it is taught that the Vaivasvatu Manu has a ''[[twin flame]]'', i.e., a ''divine complement'' or ''celestial wife''.  However, her name has not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 378-379&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ascended Master Teachings, the being C.W. Leadbeater called the "Chakshusha Manu" is referred to as ''Lord Himalaya''.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], "Lord Himalaya" was the teacher of [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] when Maitreya incarnated in as one of the first individuals of the new Atlantean root race that was then being progenerated by the "Lord Himalaya" from the [[Root race#The third root race (Lemurian)|Lemurian root race]]—Maitreya served in the [[Garden of Eden]], which was actually a [[mystery school]] of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] run by the "Lord Himalaya" that was located in what is now [[San Diego, California]], which was then part of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare Prophet (compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==

The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.  
However, although she mentioned the ''Manu'' in [[The Secret Doctrine]], she never claimed to have met him.

'''Mayer Kirshenblatt''' (1916–2009) was a [[Canadian]] [[Jew]]ish painter and author.

==Biography==
Kirshenblatt was born in Apt (Yiddish)/ [[Opatów]] (Polish) Poland. He left Poland in 1934 and settled in Toronto, Canada, where he ran a paint and wallpaper store for many years. In 2007, he and his daughter [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] published ''They Called Me Mayer July: Painted Memories of a Jewish Childhood before the Holocaust'' (University of California Press in conjunction with the [[Judah L Magnes Museum]]). The book won the [[Canadian Jewish Book Award]], J. I. Segal Book Award, and American Association of University Presses (AAUP) award for book design, and was a finalist in three categories for the National Jewish Book Award. An exhibition of his work, which opened at the Magnes Museum in 2007, will travel to The Jewish Museum (New York City), Jewish Historical Museum (Amsterdam), and Museum of the History of Polish Jews (Warsaw). The book and exhibition are the culmination of a forty-year collaboration between father and daughter. In 1967, Barbara began interviewing Mayer about his childhood. In 1990, at the urging of his wife, daughter, and son-in-law [[Max Gimblett]], Mayer began to paint.

[[File:Ojibweherbalistmedicine.png|thumb|300px|Midew in a ''mide-wiigiwaam'' (medicine lodge).]]
The '''Midewiwin''' (also spelled ''Midewin'' and ''Medewiwin'') or the '''Grand Medicine Society''' is a secretive religion of some of the indigenous peoples of [[the Maritimes]], [[New England]] and [[Great Lakes]] regions in [[North America]]. Its practitioners are called ''Midew'', and the practices of ''Midewiwin'' are referred to as ''Mide''. Occasionally, male ''Midew'' are called ''Midewinini'', which is sometimes translated into English as "[[medicine man]]".

==Name==
The [[preverb]] ''mide'' can be translated as "mystery," "mysterious," "spiritual," "sanctified," "sacred," or "ceremonial", depending on the context of its use.  The derived [[verb]] ''midewi'', thus means "be in/of ''mide''."  The derived [[noun]] ''midewiwin'' then means "state of being in ''midewi''."  Often ''mide'' is translated into English as "medicine" (thus the term ''midewinini'' "medicine-man") though ''mide'' conveys the idea of a spiritual medicine, opposed to ''mashkiki'' that conveys the idea of a physical [[medicine]]. A practitioner of Midewiwin is called a ''midew'', which can also be rendered as ''mide'o''... both forms of the word derived from the verb ''midewi'', or as a ''medewid'', a gerund form of ''midewi''.  Specifically, a male practitioner is called a ''midewinini'' ("''midew'' man") and a female practitioner a ''midewikwe'' ("''midew'' woman").

Due to the body-part medial ''de''' meaning "heart" in the Anishinaabe language, "Midewiwin" is sometimes translated as "The Way of the Heart."&lt;ref name="BentonBanai"&gt;Benton Banai&lt;/ref&gt; Blessing shares a definition he received from Thomas Shingobe, a "Mida" (a Midewiwin person) of the [[Mille Lacs Indian Reservation]] in 1969, who told him that "the only thing that would be acceptable in any way as an interpretation of 'Mide' would be 'Spiritual Mystery'."&lt;ref&gt;Blessing&lt;/ref&gt; However, fluent speakers of Anishinaabemowin often caution that there are many words and concepts that have no direct translation to English.&lt;ref name="BentonBanai"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battiste&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
According to historian Michael Angel, the Midewiwin is a "flexible, tenacious tradition that provided an institutional setting for the teaching of the world view (religious beliefs) of the Ojibwa people".&lt;ref&gt;Angel&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly among the [[Anishinaabe]]g, Midewiwin is ascribed to [[Nanabozho|Wenaboozho (Onaniboozh)]] as its founder. However, among the [[Abenaki]]s, Midewiwin is ascribed to [[Jiibayaabooz|Mateguas]], who upon his death and needing to comfort his brother who is still alive, bestowed the Midewiwin to his grieving brother [[Gluskab]]. However, Hoffman records that according to the [[Mille Lacs Indians]] chief ''Bayezhig'' ("Lone One"), Midewiwin has its origin as:

:"In the beginning, Midemanidoo (Gichimanidoo) made the ''midemanidoowag''. He first created two men, and two women; but they had no power of thought or reason. Then ''Midemanidoo (Gichimanodoo)'' made them rational beings. He took them in his hands so that they should multiply; he paired them, and from this sprung the Anishinaabe. When there were people he placed them upon the earth, but he soon observed that they were subject to sickness, misery, and death, and that unless he provided them with the Sacred Medicine they would soon become extinct.

:"Between the position occupied by ''Gichi Manidoo'' and the earth were four lesser ''manidoog'' with whom ''Gichi Manidoo'' decided to commune, and to impart to them the mysteries by which the ''Anishinaabeg'' could be benefited. So he first spoke to a ''manidoo'' and told him all he had to say, who in turn communicated the same information to the next, and he in turn to next, who also communed with the next. They all met in council, and determined to call in the four wind ''manidoog''. After consulting as to what would be best for the comfort and welfare of the Anishinaabeg, these ''manidoog'' agreed to ask ''Gichi Manidoo'' to communicate the Mystery of the Sacred Medicine to the people.

:"''Gichi Manidoo'' then went to the Sun Spirit and asked him to go to the earth and instruct the people as had been decided upon by the council. The Sun Spirit, in the form of a little boy, went to the earth and lived with a woman who had a little boy of her own.

:"This family went away in the autumn to hunt, and during the winter this woman’s son died. The parents were so much distressed that they decided to return to the village and bury the body there; so they made preparations to return, and as they traveled along, they would each evening erect several poles upon which the body was placed to prevent the wild beasts from devouring it. When the dead boy was thus hanging upon the poles, the adopted child—who was the Sun Spirit—would play about the camp and amuse himself, and finally told his adopted father he pitied him, and his mother, for their sorrow. The adopted son said he could bring his dead brother to life, whereupon the parents expressed great surprise and desired to know how that could be accomplished.

:"The adopted boy then had the party hasten to the village, when he said, “Get the women to make a [[wigwam|''wiigiwaam'']] of bark, put the dead boy in a covering of [[birch bark|''wiigwaas'']] and place the body on the ground in the middle of the ''wiigiwaam''.” On the next morning after this had been done, the family and friends went into this lodge and seated themselves around the corpse.

:"When they had all been sitting quietly for some time, they saw through the doorway the approach of a bear, which gradually came towards the ''wiigiwaam'', entered it, and placed itself before the dead body and said, “ho, ho, ho, ho,” when he passed around it towards the left side, with a trembling motion, and as he did so, the body began quivering, and the quivering increased as the bear continued until he had passed around four times, when the body came to life again and stood up. Then the bear called to the father, who was sitting in the distant right-hand corner of the ''wiigiwaam'', and addressed to him the following words:

:"The little bear boy was the one who did this. He then remained among the Anishinaabeg and taught them the mysteries of the ''Midewiwin''; and, after he had finished, he told his adopted father that as his mission had been fulfilled he was to return to his kindred ''manidoog'', for the Anishinaabeg would have no need to fear sickness as they now possessed the ''Midewiwin'' which would enable them to live. He also said that his spirit could bring a body to life but once, and he would now return to the sun from which they would feel his influence."

This event is called ''Gwiiwizens wedizhichigewinid''—Deeds of a Little-boy.
&lt;!--Hoffman continues by recording what [[Mille Lacs Indians]] chief ''Zayaagaasige'' ("He who Keeps Shining Through") relayed regarding the origins of Midewiwin from Nanabozho as:...--&gt;

==Associations==
Tribal groups who have such societies include the [[Abenaki]], [[Quiripi language|Quiripi]], [[Nipmuc]], [[Wampanoag]], [[Anishinaabe]] ([[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Odawa]] and [[Potawatomi]]), [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Sioux]] and the [[Ho-Chunk]].  These indigenous peoples of [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]] pass along [[wiigwaasabak]] (birch bark scrolls), teachings, and have degrees of initiations and ceremonies.  They are often associated with the Seven Fires Society, and other aboriginal groups or organizations. The Miigis shell, or [[cowry]] shell, is used in some ceremonies, along with bundles, sacred items, etc. There are many oral teachings, symbols, stories, history, and wisdom passed along and preserved from one generation to the next by these groups.

[[Whiteshell Provincial Park]] (Manitoba) is named after the [[whiteshell]] (cowry) used in Midewiwin ceremonies.  This park contains some [[petroform]]s that are over 1000 years old, or possibly older, and therefore may predate some aboriginal groups that came later to the area.  The Midew society is commemorated in the name of the [[Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie]] (Illinois).

==Degrees==
The Mide practitioners are initiated and ranked by "degrees."  Much like the apprentice system or an [[academic degree]] program, a practitioner cannot advance to the next higher degree until completing the required tasks and gain the full knowledge of that degree's requirements.  Only after successful completion may a candidate be considered for advancement into the next higher degree.

===Extended Fourth===
The accounts regarding the extended Fourth Degrees vary from region to region. All Midewiwin groups claim the extended Fourth Degrees are specialized forms of the Fourth Degree. Depending on the region, these extended Fourth Degree Midew can be called "Fifth Degree" up to "Ninth Degree." In parallel, if the Fourth Degree Midew is to a [[doctorate degree]], the Extended Fourth Degree Midew is to a post-[[doctorate degree]]. The Jiisakiwinini is widely referred to by Elders as the "highest" degree of all the medicine practitioners in the Mide, as it is Spiritual medicine as opposed to physical/plant based medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/troufs/Buffalo/PB32.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine lodge==
===''Midewigaan''===
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2016}}
The ''midewigaan'' ("''mide'' lodge"), also known as ''mide-wiigiwaam'' ("''mide'' [[wigwam]]") when small or ''midewigamig'' ("''mide'' structure") when large, is known in English as the "Grand Medicine Lodge" and is usually built in an open grove or clearing. A ''midewigaan'' is a domed structure with the proportion of 1 unit in width by 4 units in length. Though Hoffman records these domed oval structures measuring about 20 feet in width by 80 feet in length, the structures are sized to accommodate the number of invited participants, thus many ''midewigaan'' for small ''mide'' communities in the early 21st century are as small as 6 feet in width and 24 feet in length and larger in those communities with more ''mide'' participants. The walls of the smaller ''mide-wiigiwaam'' consist of poles and saplings from 8 to 10 feet high, firmly planted in the ground, wattled with short branches and twigs with leaves. In communities with significantly large ''mide'' participants (usually of 100 people or more participants), the ''midewigamig'' becomes a formal and permanent ceremonial building that retains the dimensions of the smaller ''mide-wiigiwaam''; a ''midewigamig'' might not necessarily be a domed structure, but typically may have vaulted ceilings.

===''Jiisakiiwigaan''===
Design of the ''jiisakiiwigaan'' ("'juggler' lodge" or "Shaking Tent" or traditionally "shaking wigwam") is similar in construction as that of the ''mide-wiigiwaam''. Unlike a ''mide-wiigiwaam'' that is an oval domed structure, the ''jiisakiiwigaan'' is a round high-domed structure of typically 3 feet in diameter and 6 feet in height, and large enough to hold two to four people.

==Ceremonies==
===Annual and seasonal ceremonies===
*''Aabita-biboon'' (Midwinter Ceremony)
*''Animoosh'' ([White] Dog Ceremony)
*''Jiibay-inaakewin'' or ''Jiibenaakewin'' (Feast of the Dead)
*''Gaagaagiinh'' or ''Gaagaagishiinh'' (Raven Festival)
*''Zaazaagiwichigan'' (Painted Pole Festival)
*''Mawineziwin'' ("War [Remembrance] Dance")
*''Wiikwandiwin'' ([Seasonal] Ceremonial Feast)—performed four times per year, once per season. The ''Wiikwandiwin'' is begun with a review of the past events, hope for a good future, a prayer and then the smoking of the pipe carried out by the heads of the [[doodem]]. These ceremonies are held in mid-winter and mid-summer in order to bring together peoples various medicines and combine their healing powers for revitalization. Each ''Wiikwandiwin'' is a celebration to give thanks, show happiness and respect to ''Gichi-manidoo''. It is customary to share the first kill of the season during the ''Wiikwandiwin''. This would show ''Gichi-manidoo'' thanks and also ask for a blessing for the coming hunt, harvest and season.

===Rites of passage===
*''Nitaawigiwin'' (Birth rites)—ceremony in which a newborn's [[umbilical cord]] is cut and retained
*''Waawiindaasowin'' (Naming rites)—ceremony in which a name-giver presents a name to a child
*''Oshki-nitaagewin'' (First-kill rites)—ceremony in which a child's first successful hunt is celebrated
*''Makadekewin'' (Puberty fast rites)
*''Wiidigendiwin'' (Marriage rites)—ceremony in which a couple is joined into a single household
*''Bagidinigewin'' (Death rites)—wake, funeral and funerary feast

===Miscellaneous ceremonies===
*''Jiisakiiwin'' (Shaking tent)—ceremony conducted by a Shaking-tent seer (''jaasakiid''; a male ''jaasakiid'' known as a ''jiisakiiwinini'' or a female ''jaasakiid'' known as a ''jiisakiiwikwe''), often called a "Juggler" in English, who would enter the tent to conjure spirits and speak beyond this world.
*''Bagisewin'' (Present)—custom at the end of a wedding ceremony in which the bride presents wood at the groom's feet as a wedding present.
*''Ishkwaandem-wiikwandiwin'' (Entry-way Feast)—A ceremony performed by women who took a piece of wood out to the bushes to offer it to ''Gichi-manidoo'', and brought something back as well. This ceremony represents the woman as mother earth whom asked for blessing from ''Gichi-manidoo'' so that the home would be safe and warm.

==Teaching objects==
===Teaching scrolls===
{{main|Wiigwaasabak}}
Called ''wiigwaasabakoon'' in the [[Ojibwe language]], birch bark scrolls were used to pass on knowledge between generations.  When used specifically for Midewiwin ceremonial use, these ''wiigwaasabakoon'' used as teaching scrolls were called ''Mide-wiigwaas'' ("Medicine birch [bark scroll]").  Early accounts of the Mide from books written in the 1800s describe a group of elders that protected the birch bark scrolls in hidden locations.  They recopied the scrolls if any were badly damaged, and they preserved them underground. These scrolls were described as very sacred and the interpretations of the scrolls were not easily given away. The historical areas of the Ojibwe were recorded, and stretched from the east coast all the way to the prairies by way of lake and river routes.  Some of the first maps of rivers and lakes were made by the Ojibwe and written on birch bark.

"The Teachings of the Midewiwin were scratched on birch bark scrolls and were shown to the young men upon entrance into the society. Although these were crude pictographs representing the ceremonies, they show us that the Ojibwa were advanced in the development of picture 'writing.' Some of them were painted on bark. One large birch bark roll was 'known to have been used in the Midewiwin at Mille Lacs for five generations and perhaps many generations before',&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Bernard "The Religion of the Ojibwa of Northern Minnesota", in ''Primitive Man'', Vol. 10, No. 3/4. (Jul-Oct 1937) pp 33-57&lt;/ref&gt; and two others, found in a seemingly deliberate hiding place in the Head-of-the-Lakes region of Ontario,&lt;ref name="kidd"&gt;Kidd, Kenneth E. "Birch-bark Scrolls in Archaeological Contexts", in ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 30 No. 4 (1965) p480.&lt;/ref&gt; were carbon-dated to about 1560 CE +/-70.&lt;ref&gt;Rajnovich, Grace "Reading Rock Art: Interpreting the Indian Rock Paintings of the Canadian Shield". Dundurn Press Ltd. (1994) {{ISBN|0-920474-72-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the original report on these hidden scrolls advised: "Indians of this region occasionally deposited such artifacts in out-of-the-way places in the woods, either by burying them or by secreting them in caves. The period or periods at which this was done is far from clear. But in any event, archaeologists should be aware of the custom and not overlook the possibility of their discovery."&lt;ref name="kidd"/&gt;

===Teaching stones===
'''Teaching stones''' known in Ojibwe as either ''Gikinoo'amaagewaabik'' or ''Gikinoo'amaage-asin'' can be either [[petroglyph]]s or [[petroform]].

==Seven prophetical ages==
{{main|Seven fires prophecy}}
The seven fires prophecy was originally taught among the practitioners of ''Midewiwin''. Each fire represents a prophetical age, marking phases or epochs of [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. It represents key spiritual teachings for North America, and suggests that the different colors and traditions of humans can come together on a basis of respect. The [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]]s are the keepers of the seven fires prophecy ''[[wampum]]''.

==Background==
Harrison is a native of [[Brooklyn]], New York, and a graduate of the School of International Service of [[American University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="WH-bush" /&gt;

In 1973 she co-founded the [[Public relations|PR]] agency the [[E. Bruce Harrison Company]] with her husband [[E. Bruce Harrison]]. While working with the company, which was sold in a merger deal in 1996, "she created and directed programs in the public interest comprising diverse stakeholder groups, including the [[National Environmental Development Association]], a partnership of labor, agriculture and industry working for better environmental solutions together."&lt;ref name="WH-bush" /&gt;

[[George H. W. Bush]] appointed Harrison to the [[President's Export Council]] in the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] in 1990. She was elected co-chair of the [[Republican National Committee]] in 1997, serving until 2001, when she was appointed to the post of [[Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs]] by then-Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]].&lt;ref name=WH-bush&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Patricia de Stacy Harrison—Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/patharrison-bio.html|work=The White House Archives (Pres. George Bush)|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison's public relations skills were called upon to help with the U.S. government's [[public diplomacy]] program during the [[Iraq war]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;As Acting Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy during the Iraq conflict, Ms. Harrison also collaborated with the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] to bring the [[Iraq]] National Symphony Orchestra to Washington, and she has initiated a comprehensive renewal of the Baghdad National Museum.&lt;ref name="WH-bush" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Under Harrison's direction, the State Department initiated the CultureCommect program in which American celebrities including [[YoYo Ma]], [[Denyce Graves]], [[Doris Roberts]] and [[Frank McCourt]] acted as "cultural ambassadors" in trips to Pakistan, Russia, Israel, and other countries.

In June 2005 she was appointed president and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.&lt;ref name=cbp-bio/&gt; Later that year, the process by which she was selected was called into question by a report from the Inspector General of the CPB. The report concluded that then-CPB chairman [[Kenneth Tomlinson]] "was strongly motivated by political considerations in filling the president/CEO position".&lt;ref name=CPBOIJ/&gt; Tomlinson resigned from the CPB board on November 4, 2005, and was replaced by [[Cheryl Halpern]]. Harrison remains CPB president and CEO as of 2015.

In 2015 Harrison gave public support to the work of the [[David Lynch Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the Media Who Meditate|url=http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/broadcast/|publisher=David Lynch Foundation|accessdate=17 May 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YayqombX|archivedate=17 May 2015|quote=Eight nationally renowned women leaders in the media who meditate gathered on April 16, 2015 in New York City to raise awareness about the benefits of the evidence-based Transcendental Meditation technique for overcoming stress, improving performance, and enhancing work-life balance in their lives.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of her practice of [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] she has said, "TM is a oasis, a life-preserver.

A '''religious habit''' is a distinctive set of [[religious clothing]] worn by members of a [[religious order]]. Traditionally some plain garb recognisable as a religious habit has also been worn by those leading the religious [[Hermit|eremitic]] and [[Anchorite|anchoritic]] life, although in their case without conformity to a particular uniform style.

In the typical [[Roman Catholic]] or [[Anglican]] orders, the habit consists of a [[tunic]] covered by a [[scapular]] and [[cowl]], with a hood for [[monk]]s or [[friar]]s and a [[veil]] for [[nun]]s; in other orders it may be a distinctive form of [[cassock]] for men, or a distinctive habit and veil for women. Modern habits are sometimes eschewed in favor of a simple business suit. Catholic [[Canon Law]] requires only that it be in some way identifiable so that the person may serve as a witness of [[Evangelical counsels|Gospel values]]. This requires flexibility and creativity.  For instance in Turkey, a Franciscan might wear street clothes.

In many orders, the conclusion of [[postulant|postulancy]] and the beginning of the [[novitiate]] is marked by a ceremony, during which the new novice is accepted then clothed in the community's habit by the [[General superior|superior]]. In some cases the novice's habit will be somewhat different from the customary habit: for instance, in certain orders of women that use the [[veil]], it is common for novices to wear a white veil while professed members wear black, or if the order generally wears white, the novice wears a grey veil. Among some [[Franciscan]] communities of men, novices wear a sort of overshirt over their tunic; [[Carthusian]] novices wear a black cloak over their white habit.

In some orders, different types or levels of profession are indicated by differences in habits.

==Buddhism==
[[Image:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|upright|Monks from [[Central Asia]] and [[China]] wearing traditional kāṣāya. [[Bezeklik]], Eastern [[Tarim Basin]], China, 9th-10th century.]]

'''Kāṣāya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: काषाय kāṣāya; [[Pali]]: kasāva; {{CJKV|t=袈裟|s=袈裟|p=jiāshā|cj=gaa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;saa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;|j=袈裟 kesa|k=袈裟 가사 gasa|v=cà-sa}}), "chougu" ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]) are the robes of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monks]] and [[Bhikkhuni|nuns]], named after a brown or saffron dye. In Sanskrit and Pali, these robes are also given the more general term ''cīvara'', which references the robes without regard to color.

===Origin and construction===
[[Image:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright|An early representation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing kāṣāya robes, in the [[Hellenistic]] style.]]

Buddhist kāṣāya are said to have originated in [[India]] as set of robes for the devotees of [[Gautama Buddha]]. A notable variant has a pattern reminiscent of an Asian rice field. Original kāṣāya were constructed of discarded [[textile|fabric]]. These were stitched together to form three rectangular pieces of cloth, which were then fitted over the body in a specific manner. The three main pieces of cloth are the ''antarvāsa'', the ''uttarāsaṅga'', and the ''{{IAST|saṃghāti}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Kieschnick, John. ''The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture.'' Princeton University Press, Oxfordshire, 2003. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they form the "triple robe," or ''tricīvara''. The tricīvara is described more fully in the [[Theravāda]] [[Vinaya]] (Vin 1:94 289).

====Uttarāsaṅga====
A robe covering the upper body. It is worn over the undergarment, or antarvāsa. In representations of the Buddha, the uttarāsaṅga rarely appears as the uppermost garment, since it is often covered by the outer robe, or saṃghāti.

====Saṃghāti====
The saṃghāti is an outer robe used for various occasions. It comes over the upper robe (''{{IAST|uttarāsaṅga}}''), and the undergarment (''antarvāsa''). In representations of the Buddha, the saṃghāti is usually the most visible garment, with the undergarment or uttarāsaṅga protruding at the bottom. It is quite similar in shape to the Greek [[himation]], and its shape and folds have been treated in Greek style in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhāra]].

====Additions====
Other items that may have been worn with the triple robe were:
* a waist cloth, the kushalaka
* a buckled belt, the samakaksika

===Kāṣāya in Indian Buddhism===

In India, variations of the kāṣāya robe distinguished different types of monastics. These represented the different schools that they belonged to, and their robes ranged widely from red and ochre, to blue and black.&lt;ref&gt;Kieschnick, John. ''The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture.'' Princeton University Press, Oxfordshire, 2003. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 148 and 170 CE, the [[Parthia]]n monk [[An Shigao]] came to China and translated a work which describes the color of monastic robes utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called ''Dà Bǐqiū Sānqiān Wēiyí'' (Ch. 大比丘三千威儀).&lt;ref&gt;Hino, Shoun. ''Three Mountains and Seven Rivers.'' 2004. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Another text translated at a later date, the ''Śariputraparipṛcchā'', contains a very similar passage corroborating this information, but the colors for the Sarvāstivāda and Dharmaguptaka sects are reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Hino, Shoun. ''Three Mountains and Seven Rivers.'' 2004. pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhikku Sujato. ''Sects &amp; Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' Santi Forest Monastery, 2006. p. i.&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditions of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which follow the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, red robes are regarded as characteristic of the Mūlasarvāstivādins.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr, Thea. Tsedroen, Jampa. ''Dignity and Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns.'' 2010. p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dudjom Rinpoche from the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the robes of fully ordained Mahāsāṃghika monastics were to be sewn out of more than seven sections, but no more than twenty-three sections.&lt;ref&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche ''Perfect Conduct: Ascertaining the Three Vows''. 1999. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols sewn on the robes were the [[endless knot]] (Skt. ''śrīvatsa'') and the conch shell (Skt. ''śaṅkha''), two of the [[Ashtamangala|Eight Auspicious Signs]] in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche ''Perfect Conduct: Ascertaining the Three Vows''. 1999. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jiāshā in Chinese Buddhism===
In [[Chinese Buddhism]], the kāṣāya is called ''jiāshā'' (Ch. 袈裟). During the early period of [[Chinese Buddhism]], the most common color was red. Later, the color of the robes came to serve as a way to distinguish monastics, just as they did in India. However, the colors of a Chinese Buddhist monastic's robes often corresponded to their geographical region rather than to any specific schools.&lt;ref&gt;Kieschnick, John. ''The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture.'' Princeton University Press, Oxfordshire, 2003. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; By the maturation of Chinese Buddhism, only the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was still in use, and therefore the color of robes served no useful purpose as a designation for sects, the way that it had in India.

===Kesa in Japanese Buddhism===
[[File:JapaneseKesaofMabury.jpg|thumb|Japanese Buddhist Priest’s Mantle (Kesa), 1775-1825. [[LACMA]] textile collections.]]

In [[Japanese Buddhism]], the kāṣāya is called ''kesa'' (Jp. 袈裟). In Japan, during the [[Edo period|Edo]] and [[Meiji period]]s, kesa were even sometimes pieced together from robes used in [[Noh theatre]].

==Eastern Orthodoxy==
[[Image:megaloschema.svg|thumb|200px|The ''Analavos'', worn by Orthodox monks and nuns of the Great Schema.]]

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] does not have distinct religious orders such as those in the Catholic Church. The habit ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Σχήμα, ''Schēma'') is essentially the same throughout the world. The normal monastic color is black, symbolic of repentance and simplicity. The habits of monks and nuns are identical; additionally, nuns wear a scarf, called an [[apostolnik]]. The habit is bestowed in degrees, as the monk or nun advances in the spiritual life. There are three degrees: (1) the beginner, known as the '''Rassaphore''' ("robe bearer") (2) the intermediate, known as the '''Stavrophore''' ("cross bearer"), and (3) the '''Great Schema''' worn by Great Schema Monks or Nuns. Only the last, the Schemamonk or Schemanun, the monastic of the highest degree, wears the full habit.

The habit is formally bestowed upon monks and nuns at the ceremony known as the [[tonsure]]. The parts of the Eastern Orthodox habit are:

* '''Inner Rason''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Έσώρασον, Ζωστικὸν or Ἀντερί, ''Esórason''; [[church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''Podryásnik''): The [[Cassock#Eastern practice .28Orthodox and Eastern Catholic.29|inner rason]] (cassock) is the innermost garment. It is a long, collared garment coming to the feet, with narrow, tapered sleeves. Unlike the Roman cassock, it is double-breasted. The inner rason is the basic garment and is worn at all times, even when working. It is often given to [[novice]]s and [[seminarian]]s, though this differs from community to community. The inner rason is also worn by [[chanter]]s, [[Reader (liturgy)|readers]], and the married clergy. For monks and nuns, it symbolizes the [[Religious vows|vow]] of [[Poverty#Religious poverty|poverty]].
* '''Belt''' (Greek: Ζώνη, ''Zone''; Slavonic: ''Poyas''): The belt worn by Orthodox monks and nuns is normally leather, though sometimes it is of cloth. In the Russian tradition, married clergy, as well as the higher monastic clergy, may wear a cloth belt that is finely [[embroidery|embroidered]], especially on [[Great Feasts|feast days]]. The belt is symbolic of the vow of [[chastity]].
* '''Paramand''' (Greek: Παραμανδύας, ''Paramandýas''; Slavonic: ''Paraman''): The Paramand is a piece of cloth, approximately 5 inches square which is attached by ribbons to a wooden cross. The cloth is embroidered with a cross and the [[Passion (Christianity)#Instruments of the Passion|Instruments of the Passion]]. The wooden cross is worn over the chest, then the ribbons pass over and under the arms, like a [[yoke]], and hold the square cloth centered on the back. The paramand is symbolic of the yoke of Christ ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:29–30|KJV}}).
* '''Outer Rason''' (a.k.a. ''riasa'', Greek: εξώρασον, ''exorason'' or simply ράσο, ''raso''; Slavonic: ''ryasa''): Among the Greeks it is worn by readers and all higher clerics; among the Russians it is worn only by monks, deacons, priests, and bishops.
* '''Analavos''' (Greek: Άνάλαβος; Slavonic: ''Analav''): The distinctive dress of the Great Schema is the analavos, and it is worn only by Schemamonks and Schemanuns. Traditionally made of either leather or wool, the analavos covers the shoulders, and then comes down in the front and back, forming a cross (see illustration, above right).
* '''Polystavrion''' (Greek: Πολυσταύριον, lit. "many crosses"): The polystavrion is a long cord that has been plaited with numerous crosses forming a yoke that is worn over the analavos to hold it in place.
* '''Mantle''' (Greek: Μανδύας, ''Mandías''; Slavonic: ''Mantíya''): The [[Mantle (vesture)|Mantle]] is a long, full cape, joined at the neck which the monastic wears over the other parts of the habit.

[[Image:Tikhon of Moscow.jpg|thumb|St. [[Tikhon of Moscow]] wearing the patriarchal white koukoulion]]
* '''Kalymafki''' (a.k.a. ''[[Kalimavkion]]'', Greek: καλυμαύκι; Slavonic: klobuk): The distinctive [[headdress]] of Eastern Orthodox monks and nuns is the kalymafki, a stiffened hat, something like a [[Fez (clothing)|fez]], only black and with straight sides, covered with a [[veil]]. The veil has lappets which hang down on each side of the head and a stylized hood falling down the back. For monastics of the Great Schema, the kalymafki takes a very distinctive shape, known as a [[Cowl|koukoulion]] (cowl), and is embroidered with the Instruments of the Passion. The koukoulion is also worn by the Patriarchs of several local churches, regardless of whether or not he has been tonsured to that degree. In the Slavic tradition, the koukoulion will be in the form of a cloth hood, similar to that worn on the Western cowl. Outside church, monastics wear a soft hat known as a [[Skufia]]. Again, for Schemamonks and Schemanuns it is embroidered with the Instruments of the Passion.

The portions of the habit worn by the various degrees of monastics is as follows:

==Jainism==
Female ascetics and [[Svetambara]] male monks always wear un-stitched or minimally stitched white clothes. [[Digambara]] Jain monks do not wear clothes. A loin cloth which reaches up to the shins is called a Cholapattak. Another cloth to cover the upper part of the body is called Pangarani (Uttariya Vastra). A cloth that passes over the left shoulder and covers the body up to a little above the ankle is called a Kïmli. Kïmli is a woolen shawl. They also carry a woolen bed sheet and a woolen mat to sit on. Those who wear clothes have a [[muhapati]], which is a square or rectangular piece of cloth of a prescribed measurement, either in their hand or tied on their face covering the mouth. Svetambara ascetics have an Ogho or Rajoharan (a broom of woolen threads) to clean insects around their sitting place or while they are walking. Digambara ascetics have a Morpichhi and a Kamandal in their hands. This practice may vary among different sects of Jains but essential principle remains the same to limit needs.

==Roman Catholicism==
[[Image:Sisters (Daughters of Mary) Roman Catholic Singing.jpg|thumb|Nuns in traditional habit.]]

[[Pope John Paul II]] in his Post-Apostolic Exhortation ''Vita consecrata'' (1996) says concerning the religious habit of [[Consecrated life|consecrated]] persons:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
§25 … The Church must always seek to make her presence visible in everyday life, especially in contemporary culture, which is often very secularized and yet sensitive to the language of signs. In this regard the Church has a right to expect a significant contribution from consecrated persons, called as they are in every situation to bear clear witness that they belong to Christ.&lt;br&gt;
Since the habit is a sign of consecration, poverty and membership in a particular Religious family, I join the Fathers of the Synod in strongly recommending to men and women religious that they wear their proper habit, suitably adapted to the conditions of time and place.&lt;br&gt;
Where valid reasons of their apostolate call for it, Religious, in conformity with the norms of their Institute, may also dress in a simple and modest manner, with an appropriate symbol, in such a way that their consecration is recognizable.&lt;br&gt;
Institutes which from their origin or by provision of their Constitutions do not have a specific habit should ensure that the dress of their members corresponds in dignity and simplicity to the nature of their vocation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Nuns ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0320, Krakau, Gefängnis Montelupich, Klosterschwester.jpg|thumb|Polish [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughter of Charity]] wearing a white [[cornette]] and habit in 1939]]
The religious habit of Roman Catholic nuns typically consists of the following elements:

* '''Apron''': A variety of styles of aprons can be worn over the habit to protect it during work activities.
* '''Cincture''': The habit is often secured around the waist with a belt made of woven black wool.
* '''Card''': This stiff black covering is worn over the coif when the nun leaves the convent to prevent the coif from becoming wet or soiled.
* '''[[Coif]]''': This is the garment's headpiece and includes the white cotton cap secured by a [[bandeau]] and a white [[wimple]] or [[guimpe]] of starched linen, cotton, or (today) polyester to cover the cheeks and neck. It is sometimes covered by a thin layer of black [[crape]]. The [[cornette]] was another type of coif. 
* '''Tunic''': This is the central piece of the habit.  It is a loose dress made of [[serge (fabric)|serge]] fabric pleated at the neck and draping to the ground.  It can be worn pinned up in the front or in the back to allow the nun to work.
* '''[[Scapular]]''': This symbolic apron hangs from both front and back; it is worn over the tunic, and [[Benedictine]] nuns also wear it over the belt, whereas some other orders wear it tied under the belt.
* '''Sleeves''': The habit contains two sets of sleeves, the larger of which can be worn folded up for work or folded down for ceremonial occasions or whenever entering a chapel.
* '''Underskirts''': The complete vestment includes two underskirts, a top skirt of black serge trimmed with cord and a bottom skirt of black cotton.
* '''[[Black veil|Veil]]''': This element is worn pinned over the coif head coverings and could be worn down to cover the face or up to expose it.  The headpiece sometimes includes a white underveil as well.

Other accessories:
* '''Cross''': A cross of silver traditionally hangs from a black cord around the nun's neck.
* '''Ring''': Nuns who have taken final or "perpetual" vows indicate this status by wearing a simple silver ring on the left hand.
* '''[[Rosary]]''': The nun's rosary of wooden beads and metal links hangs from the belt by small hooks.
* '''Shoes''': Simple functional black shoes are the usual footwear.
* '''Suitcase''': Nuns often travel with a small black hand-held bag containing personal items and toiletries.

Different orders adhered to different styles of dress; these styles have changed over time. In the 12th century the German abbess [[Hildegard von Bingen]], for example, advocated a style for her nuns that included extravagant and lavish white silk habits worn with golden head pieces designed to present the nun to Christ in her most beautiful form.

===Priests===
{{expand section|date=March 2017}}
Usually, priests wear black or another dark color along with a white clerical collar. A cassock is worn in more formal situations, while a black shirt and slacks is worn when more mobility is needed. White may be worn in warmer climates. A priest is ceremonially given their habit, and it symbolizes that they are a part of the church.

==Shinto==
In Japan, various types of very traditional dress are worn by [[Shinto]] priests, often dating to styles worn by nobles during the [[Nara period]] or [[Heian period]].

*{{nihongo|''[[Hakama]]''|袴}} - a type of traditional [[Japanese clothing]], originally worn only by men, but today they are worn by both sexes. There are two types, divided {{nihongo||馬乗り|umanori|"horse-riding ''hakama''"}} and undivided {{nihongo||行灯袴|andon bakama|"lantern ''hakama''"}}. The ''umanori'' type have divided legs, similar to [[trousers]], but both types appear similar. ''Hakama'' are tied at the waist and fall approximately to the ankles, and  are worn over a [[kimono]] (hakamashita), with the kimono then appearing like a shirt.
*{{nihongo|''[[Jōe]]''|浄衣}} is a garment worn in Japan by people attending religious ceremonies and activities, including Buddhist and Shinto related occasions. Not only [[Shinto]] and Buddhist priests can be found wearing Jōe at rituals, but laymen as well, for example when participating in pilgrimage such as the [[Shikoku Pilgrimage]]. The garment is usually white or yellow and is made of linen or silk depending on its kind and use. The Shinto priest who wears the ''jōe'' is attired in a peaked [[cap]] called ''tate-eboshi'', an outer tunic called the ''jōe'' proper, an outer robe called ''jōe no sodegukuri no o'', an undergarment called ''hitoe'', ballooning trousers called ''sashinuki'' or ''nubakama'', and a girdle called ''jōe no ate-obi''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4406">'''Roozahang''' (روزآهنگ) is the [[Avestan language]] name of a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] benevolent divinity associated with life-bringing rainfall and fertility. '''Roozahang''' or Tishtrya is '''Tir''' in Middle- and Modern Persian. As has been judged from the archaic context in which Tishtrya (Roozahang) appears in the texts of the Avesta, the divinity/concept is almost certainly of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] origin.

==Persian mythology==
{{main article|Tishtrya}}

In a hymn of the [[Avesta]] (incorporated by [[Ferdowsi]], with due acknowledgement, in the [[Shahnameh]]), Tishter or Roozahang is involved in a cosmic struggle against the drought-bringing demon [[Apaosha]]. According to the myth, in the form of a [[White horse (mythology)|pure white horse]] the god did battle with the demon who, in contrast, had assumed the form of a terrifying black horse. Apaosa soon gained the upper hand over Tishtrya, who was weakened from the lack of sufficient prayers and sacrifices from humankind. The [[yazata]] proceeded to call upon the Creator [[Ahura Mazda]], who himself then intervened by offering a sacrifice to the overwhelmed god. Infused with the power brought by this sacrifice, Tishtrya was able to overcome Apaosa, and his rains were able to flow to the parched fields and pastures unabated by drought. This story serves to underscore the importance of votive offerings and sacrifice in religious tradition.

== Etymology and cultural significance ==
{{main article|Sirius}}

In Iranian mythology, especially in [[Persian mythology]] and in [[Zoroastrianism]], the ancient religion of [[Persia]], Sirius appears as ''[[Tishtrya]]'' or '''Tishter &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vajehyab.com/dehkhoda/%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1&lt;/ref&gt;''' or '''Roozahang'''  and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishter of [[New Persian]] poetry). Beside passages in the [[sacred texts]] of the [[Avesta]], the [[Avestan]] language '''Roozahang''' followed by the version ''Tir'' in [[Middle Persian|Middle]] and New Persian is also depicted in the [[Persian literature|Persian]] epic [[Shahnameh]] of [[Ferdowsi]]. Due to the concept of the [[yazatas]], powers which are "worthy of worship", '''Tishtrya''' ('''Tishter ''') is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of [[apaosha]], the demon of drought. In this struggle, '''Tishtrya''' ('''Tishter ''') is beautifully depicted as a white horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2442">'''Sajah bint Al-Harith ibn Suayd''' ({{lang-ar|سجاح بنت الحارث بن سويد}}) from tribe of [[Banu Tamim]] was [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] protected first by her tribe then cause a split within [[Banu Tamim]] and finally defended by [[Banu Hanifa]]. Her father, Al-Harith, belonged  to the [[Bani Yarbu]] section of the [[Bani Tamim]] tribe. Her mother belonged to the [[Banu Taghlib]] tribe of [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Kister, M.J., The Struggle Against Musaylima and the Conquest of Yamama, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the apostasy movement which emerged following the death of [[Muhammad]], Sajah declared she was a prophetess after learning that [[Musaylimah]] and [[Tulayha]] had declared [[prophethood]].&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Brill's first encyclopedia of Islam, 1913-1936 By M. Th. Houtsma, p665&lt;/ref&gt; Before claiming to be a prophetess, Sajah had a reputation as a soothsayer. Thereafter, 4,000 people gathered around her to march on [[Medina]]. Others joined her against Medina. However, her planned attack on Medina was called off after she learned that the army of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] had defeated [[Tulayha|Tulayha al-Asadi]] (another self-proclaimed prophet). Thereafter, she sought cooperation with Musaylimah to oppose the threat of Khalid. A mutual understanding was initially reached with Musaylimah. However, Sajah later married Musaylimah and accepted his self-declared prophethood. Khalid then crushed the remaining rebellious elements around Sajah, and then moved on to crush Musaylimah. After the [[Battle of Yamama]] where Musaylimah was killed, Sajah converted to Islam.

{{nihongo|'''Sanae Takaichi'''|高市 早苗|Takaichi Sanae|extra=born 7 March 1961}} is a conservative Japanese politician.

==Background and early career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2015}}
Born and raised in the city of [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]], Takaichi graduated from to Nara Prefectural Unebi Senior High School for her secondary education, then she received [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] from [[Kobe University]] in 1984.

She graduated from [[Matsushita Institute of Government and Management]]. In 1987, she moved to the [[United States]] to work for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Patricia Schroeder]] as a [[United States Congress|Congressional Fellow]]. When Takaichi returned to Japan on 1989, she gained attention from the mass media as a legislative analyst with experience in the US Congress, and wrote books based on the experience. In 1992, she formed Kansai [[Hi-Vision]] Consortium and presided as the first chairperson.

==Political rise==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2015}}
In 1993, Takaichi ran as an independent candidate for the [[House of Representatives of Japan]], Nara Prefectural district and won the most votes. She joined the "Liberals" study group of [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP), led by [[Koji Kakizawa]], which became part of the [[New Frontier Party (Japan)|New Frontier Party]].

In 1996, Takaichi ran as sanctioned candidate from [[New Frontier Party (Japan)|New Frontier Party]] and reelected to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] (lower house). However New Frontier Party lost nationally. On November 5, she responded to recruitment from the Secretary-General of LDP [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Koichi Kato]], and, then, joined the LDP. Act of switching the party, two months after winning the election with anti-LDP votes resulted in heavy criticism from the New Frontier Party members.

In the LDP, Takaichi belonged to the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)#Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyukai (Mori Faction)|Mori Faction]] (formally, the [[:ja:清和政策研究会|Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyū-kai]]) and she served as a Parliamentary Vice Minister for the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] under [[Keizō Obuchi]] cabinet. She also served as chairman of Education and Science Committee.  In 2000, House of Representatives election she was placed in the first position in proportional representation ballot from LDP and easily won her third term. In 2002 she was appointed as the Senior Vice Minister of the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] under [[Junichiro Koizumi]].

However, in 2003 lower house election, the first since she switched parties with her own name on the ballot, she lost. In 2004 she took a faculty position at [[Kinki University]]. She married [[Taku Yamamoto]] who is a fellow member of the House of Representatives.

==Governmental positions under Abe I (2006-2007)==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2015}}
Takaichi served as Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs, Minister of State for Science and Technology Policy, Minister of State for Innovation, Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Gender Equality&lt;ref&gt;Although the term "Youth Affairs" is used in its official English title, the original Japanese title {{nihongo|''shōshika''|少子化|}} is more aptly translated as "diminishing birth rate issue".&lt;/ref&gt; and Minister of State for Food Safety in the Japanese Cabinet of Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]].

==Governmental positions under Abe II (2014-)==
On September 3, 2014, Takaichi is selected as [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications|Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications]] to replace [[Yoshitaka Shindō]].

==Controversies==
Like most members of Abe's Cabinet, and the Prime Minister himself, Takaichi is affiliated to the openly revisionist organization [[Nippon Kaigi]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2994558 Abe's reshuffle promotes right-wingers"], KoreaJoongangDaily.joins.com; accessed 18 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as she was named as cabinet minister, a couple of embarrassing stories resurfaced in the international press:
*A picture of her together with Kazunari Yamada, the leader of Japan's [[Neo-Nazi]] party, in front of Japanese national flag (LDP leader [[Tomomi Inada]] also appeared on similar pictures). She denied any link with him and said she wouldn't have accepted the picture had she known Yamada's background.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/09/neo-nazi-photos-pose-headache-for-shinzo-abe Neo-Nazi photos pose headache for Shinzo Abe]" (The Guardian - 9 Sept. 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1994, she was shown promoting a controversial book praising [[Adolf Hitler]]'s electoral talents.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/japan-adolf-hitler-book-haunts-interior-minister-sanae-takaichi-1465067 Japan: Adolf Hitler Book Haunts Interior Minister Sanae Takaichi]" (Umberto Bacchi, ''International Business Times'', 11 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks later, Takaichi was among the three members of the cabinet to visit the controversial [[Yasukuni]] shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/news/asia/east-asia/story/japan-cabinet-minister-sanae-takaichi-visits-yasukuni-shrine-day-after-pm-#sthash.n7p942A8.dpuf "3 Japan Cabinet ministers visit controversial Yasukuni Shrine a day after PM Abe's offering"], ''Straitstimes.com, 18 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2016, the extreme right wing Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Sanae Takaichi said Tuesday that broadcast stations could be ordered to cease operations in the event they repeatedly present politically biased broadcasts in violation of the country’s domestic law severely restricting journalistic freedom.

'''Santería''', also known as '''Regla de Ocha''', '''La Regla de [[Ifá]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/santeri.htm |title=Santería |publisher=Religions of the World |accessdate=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mistic"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lucumí Religion |publisher=New Orleans Mistic |archivedate=May 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528053852/http://www.neworleansmistic.com/spells/primer/santeria.htm |accessdate=January 4, 2009 |url=http://www.neworleansmistic.com/spells/primer/santeria.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Lucumí''', is an [[Afro-American religion]] of [[Caribbean]] origin that developed in the [[Spanish Empire]] among West African descendants. ''Santería'' is a Spanish word that means the "worship of saints". Santería is influenced by and syncretized with [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. Its [[sacred language]] is the [[Lucumí language]], a variety of [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]].

== History ==
Santería is a system of beliefs that merges aspects of [[Yoruba religion]] brought to the [[New World]] by enslaved [[Yoruba people]] along with [[Christianity]] and the religions of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref name="mistic"/&gt; The Yoruba people carried with them various religious customs, including a trance and divination system for communicating with their ancestors and deities, animal sacrifice, and sacred drumming and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOzGiT9wT7EC&amp;pg=PA268 |title=Multicultural Health |author=Lois Ritter, Nancy Hoffman |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |date=April 18, 2011 |page=268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irele-2010&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hF_xjFL6_NEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA305 |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of African Thought, Volume 1 |editor=Abiola Irele, Biodun Jeyifo |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 27, 2010 |page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to preserve their traditions and belief systems in a hostile cultural environment prompted those enslaved in Cuba, starting from as early as 1515, to merge their customs with aspects of Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name=Irele-2010/&gt;

This religious tradition evolved into what is now recognized as Santería.
{{quote|The colonial period from the standpoint of enslaved African people can be defined as a time of perseverance. Their world quickly changed. Tribal kings and their families, politicians, business and community leaders all were enslaved and taken to a foreign region of the world. Religious leaders, their relatives and their followers were no longer free people to worship as they saw fit. Colonial laws criminalized their religion. They were forced to become baptized and worship a god their ancestors had not known who was surrounded by a pantheon of saints. The early concerns during this period seem to have necessitated a need for individual survival under harsh plantation conditions. A sense of hope was sustaining the internal essence of what today is called Santería, a misnomer (and former pejorative) for the indigenous religion of the Lukumi people of Nigeria. In the heart of their homeland, they had a complex political and social order. They were a sedentary hoe farming cultural group with specialized labor. Their religion, based on the worship of nature, was renamed and documented by their slave owners. Santería, a pejorative term that characterizes deviant Catholic forms of worshiping saints, has become a common name for the religion. The term ''santero(a)'' is used to describe a priest or priestess replacing the traditional term ''Olorisha'' as an extension of the deities. The ''orishas'' became known as the saints in image of the Catholic pantheon.|Ernesto Pichardo, CLBA, ''Santería in Contemporary Cuba: The individual life and condition of the priesthood''}}

In order to preserve and shield (mask) their traditional beliefs, the [[Lucumí people]] syncretized their ''Orichás'' with [[Saint#Catholic Church|Catholic saints]].&lt;ref name=Irele-2010/&gt; (As a consequence, the terms "saint" and "orichá" are commonly used interchangeably among practitioners.) Spanish colonial planters who saw the enslaved African people celebrating on saints' days did not know that they were actually performing rituals related to ''Orichás'', and assumed that they were showing more interest in Catholic saints than in the Christian God—hence the origin of the term Santería.&lt;ref name=Irele-2010/&gt;

The historical veiling of the relationship between Catholic saints and Orichás is compounded by the fact that the vast majority of ''santeros'' in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, are also Roman Catholics, have been [[baptism|baptized]], and often require initiates to be baptized in Roman Catholicism as well.

The spread of Santería beyond the Spanish-speaking parts of the Caribbean, including to the United States, was catalyzed by the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959.&lt;ref name=Irele-2010/&gt; In 1974, the [[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye]] became the first Santería church in the United States to become officially incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/11/nation/na-santeria11 |title=Santeria priest won't let Religious Freedom be sacrificed |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=Richard Fausset |date=August 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rituals and ceremonies ==
{{Orisa-Ifá sidebar|Variants}}
Santería does not use a central creed for its religious practices; though it is understood in terms of its rituals and ceremonies.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Miguel A. De La Torre]] |title=Santería: The Beliefs and Rituals of a Growing Religion in America |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |year=2004 |isbn=978-0802-84973-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} These rituals and ceremonies take place in what is known as a house-temple or ''{{lang|es|casa de santos}}'' (house of saints), also known as an ''ilé''. Most ''ilés'' are in the homes of the initiated priests and priestesses. ''Ilé'' shrines are built, by the priests and priestess, to the different ''[[Orisha|orichás]]'', which creates a space for worship, called an ''igbodu'' (altar).&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004"/&gt;{{rp|102}} In an ''igbodu'' there is a display of three distinct thrones (draped with royal blue, white, and red satin) that represent the seats of the queens, kings, and the deified warriors.&lt;ref name="Brown 2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=David H.

Each ''ilé'' is composed of those who occasionally seek guidance from the ''orishas'', as well as those who are in the process of becoming priests.&lt;ref name="Mason 2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Atwood Mason |title=Living Santería: Rituals and Experiences in an Afro-Cuban Religion |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-1588-34052-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

The many ''{{lang|es|cabildos}}'' and ''{{lang|es|casas}}'' that bridged the 19th and 20th centuries are fondly remembered by contemporary priests as the origins and strongholds of Cuban Lucumí culture and religion.&lt;ref name="Mason 2002" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

To become a ''Santero'' or ''Santera'' (Priest or Priestess of Santería), the initiator must go through an intensive week-long initiation process&lt;ref name="Brown 2003"/&gt;{{rp|165}} in which the teaching of the ritual skills and moral behavior occurs informally and nonverbally. To begin with, the initiator goes through what is called a cleansing ritual. The initiator's ''[[Godparent|Padrino]]'' (godfather) cleanses the head with special herbs and water. The ''Padrino'' rubs the herbs and water in a specific pattern of movements into the scalp of the head. However, if a person is entering Santería for the need of healing, they will undergo the ''{{lang|es|rogación de la cabeza}}'' (blessing of the head), in which coconut water and cotton are applied on the head to feed it.&lt;ref name="Mason 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Atwood Mason |title="I Bow My Head to the Ground": The Creation of Bodily Experience in a Cuban American ''Santería'' Initiation |journal=Journal of American Folklore |volume=107 |number=423 |year=Winter 1994 |pages=23–39 |jstor=541071}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26–28}} Once cleansed, there are four major initiation rituals that the initiator will have to undergo: obtaining the ''elekes'' (beaded necklace), receiving ''Los Guerreros'' (the Warriors), making ''Ocha'' (Saint), and ''Asiento'' (ascending the throne).&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004"/&gt;{{rp|107}}

=== Obtaining the ilekes ===
The first ritual is known as the acquisition of the beaded necklaces (known as ''ilekes''); according to De La Torre, "the colors and patterns of the beads on the ilekes will be those of the orichá that serves as the iyawo's (bride) ruling head and guardian angel and so the first thing that must be done is to determine who the orichá is. The ''ilekes'' necklace is bathed in a mixture of herbs, sacrificial blood, and other potent substances and given to the initiated.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004"/&gt;{{rp|107}}

The initiate most often receives the necklace of the five most powerful and popular ''oricha'', as the multicolored beads of the ''ilekes'' are each patterned for the primary ''Orishás'' ([[Eleguá]], [[Obatala|Obatalá]], [[Yemoja|Yemayá]], [[Shango|Changó]], and [[Oshun|Ochún]]), and they serve as a sacred point of contact with these ''Orishás''. When the necklace is received, the initiated must bow over a bathtub and have his/her head washed by the ''olo orichá''. The ''elekes''&lt;ref name="Mason 1994"/&gt;{{rp|28}} serves as the sacred banners for the ''Orishás'' and act as a sign of the ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Orichá'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s'' presence and protection; however, it must never be worn during a woman's menstruation period, nor during sex, nor when bathing.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004"/&gt;{{rp|107}}

=== Medio Asiento ===
The second important ritual is known as ''{{lang|es|medio asiento}}'', the creation of an image of the orichá Eleguá. The individual will go through a consultation with a Santero, where all the recipients' life, past, present, and future, will be reviewed. During the consultation, the Santero determines which path of Eleguá the recipient will receive. Then, based on his findings, he chooses materials that will be used to construct the image of the Eleguá, a sculpture that is used to keep evil spirits away from the initiator's home. This ritual is only prepared by men as the orichás take some of the Santero's "manly" spirit in the process.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-Wippler 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miguel Gonzalez-Wippler |title=Rituals and Spells of Santería |publisher=Original Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0942-27207-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi}}

=== Los Guerreros ===
The third ritual, known as "receiving the warriors", is a ritual where the initiated receives objects from their padrino that represents the warriors; Iron tools to represent Ogún; an iron bow and arrow to represent Ochosi; and an iron or silver chalice surmounted by a rooster to represent Osún.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004"/&gt;{{rp|112}} This ritual begins a formal and lifelong relationship that the initiate will have with these Orichás, as the orichás devote their energies to protecting and providing for the initiate on their path.

=== Asiento ===
The last ritual of the initiation process is known as ''Asiento'' (ascending the throne), and is the most important and the most secretive ritual in Santería, as it is the ceremony where the ''iyawo'' (bride of the oricha) becomes "born again" into the faith. This ritual is a culmination of the previous rituals, and cannot be made unless the others have been completed. Asiento is a process of purification and divination whereby the initiated becomes like a newborn baby and begins a new life of deeper growth within the faith.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004"/&gt;{{rp|112}}

=== Post-initiation ===
Once the initiation is completed, depending on the individuals "house", there is a year-long waiting period, known as ''iyaboraje'', in which the newly appointed Priest and Priestess can not perform cleansings and other remedies.&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dr Cynthia Duncan |publisher=University of Washington, Tacoma |url=http://www.aboutsanteria.com |year=2010 |title=About Santería }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a time where the ''Iyawo'' or Bride of the ''Orichá'' must follow a strict regimen of wearing all white and must avoid physical contact with those who have not been initiated. Once the ''{{lang|es|ebo del año}}'' has been completed there will be an end of year ceremony, which will enable the Priest or Priestess to consult clients, perform cleansings, provide remedies and perform initiations. And according to Gonzalez: "they are also regarded as royalty in the religion, as they are considered representatives of the ''Orichás'' and are vested with the power to work with the forces of those ''Orichás'' in full."&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-Wippler 2007"/&gt;{{rp|xi}}

With Santería rituals there are musical ceremonies and prayers that are referred to as ''bembé'', ''{{lang|es|toque de santo}}'', or ''tambor''. It is a celebration dedicated to an ''Orichá'', where the ''batá'' drums (set of three drums known as the ''iya'' (the largest drum), ''itoltele'', and ''okonkolo'') are played in the ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Orichá'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Diane Elizabeth Caudillo |title=Prayers to the ''Orishas'': A look at Santería |url=http://www.wenlin.com/lunasea/orishas.pdf |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414224051/http://www.wenlin.com/lunasea/orishas.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}  Through these sacred drums, messages of worshippers reach the ''orichás'' and the ''orichás'' respond to their devotees. These drums are used only by men and must always be treated with respect; for example, dancers must never turn their backs towards the drums while dancing, as it is considered disrespectful.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004"/&gt;{{rp|118}}

=== Clergy ===
Priests are commonly known as ''Santeros'' or ''Olorichas''. Once those priests have initiated other priests, they become known as ''babalorichás'', "fathers of ''orichá''" (for men), and as ''iyalorichás'', "mothers of ''orichá''" (for women). Priests can commonly be referred to as ''Santeros'' (male) and ''Santeras'' (female), and if they function as diviners (using [[cowrie-shell divination]] known as ''Dilogun'') of the ''Orichás'' they can be considered ''Italeros'', or if they go through training to become leaders of initiations, ''Obas'' or ''Oriates''.

== Lucumí traditional healing practices ==
Lucumí traditional healing practices are rooted in the spiritual influences of [[Americas|America]], [[Cuba]], and [[West Africa]].
Having a strong spiritual component, these traditional healing practices also use the pathways of the [[Herbalism|herbalist]], [[Psychology|psychologist]], [[Ethics|ethicist]], and that of a respected spiritual medium interceding between God and human beings. Du Toit refers to Cuban traditional healing practices as [[ethnomedicine]], which taps on the biodynamic chemical properties of certain plants, from which some commercial drugs were derived, such as the cardiac medications, [[digitalis]], [[quinine]], and [[curare]] – chemicals causing neuromuscular paralysis.&lt;ref name="du Toit 2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brian du Toit |chapter=Ethnomedical (Folk) Healing in the Caribbean |title=Healing Cultures: Art and Religion as Curative Practices in the Caribbean and its Diaspora |editors=Margarite Fernandez Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gerbert |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-312-21898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}  Du Toit categorizes Cuban ethnomedicine as having health specialists, which are ''{{lang|es|el yerbero}}'' (the herbalist), ''{{lang|es|el curandero}}'' (the curer), ''{{lang|es|el santero}}'' (the religious healer), and ''{{lang|es|el conocedor}}'' (the botanist). Du Toit continues, "Cuba is one of the regions in which a great deal of ethnographic and ethnobotanical research has been conducted."&lt;ref name="du Toit 2001" /&gt;{{rp|21}}

Du Toit cites the studies of Lydia Cabrera on the religious and healing role of indigenous medicinal plants, and Jose Gallo on the 900-page compilation of folk medicine, and also mentions that with the 31 herbs prescribed as [[bronchodilator]]s, only ''[[Datura]] candida'' was effective, due to its contents of [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] and [[atropine]] in the leaves. [[Cymbopogon|Lemongrass]] or ''{{lang|es|caña de limón}}'' is used for low blood pressure and anti-inflammatory effects. [[Thyme]] tea and [[castor oil]] are used to speed the delivery of babies and the broomweed (''[[Corchorus]] siliquosus'') induces the quick expulsion of the placenta.&lt;ref name="du Toit 2001" /&gt;{{rp|21}} Herbs are also used to create a trance possession using the hallucinogenic properties of ''Datura metel'' and ''Datura stramonium'' (both have scopolamine and atropine, causing amnesia), the [[psychoactive]] ingredients from the [[cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus'').&lt;ref name="du Toit 2001" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

Aside from being herbalist, Santería traditional healing practice has a spiritual aspect. Santería has a holistic approach, acknowledging the connection with heart, mind, and body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Margarite Fernandez Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gerbert |chapter=The Orisha Tradition in Cuba |title=Creole Religions of the Caribbean: An Introduction from Vodou and Santeria, to Obeah and Espiritismo |publisher=New York University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8147-2719-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}} In Santería, the world flows with the primal life energy called ''aché'' or growth, the force toward completeness and divinity. Aché is the current that Santería initiates channel so that it empowers them to fulfill their path in life, because aché is connected to all that has life or exhibits power; aché comprises blood, grace, and power.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004" /&gt;{{rp|12}} When a person is sick, the healer thinks, interprets and reacts, considering the illness not just a physical dysfunction but also an interface with suffering and bad luck in life, believed to be brought on by the activity of bad spirits.

Prevalent in Caribbean cultures, ''{{lang|es|[[espiritismo]]}}'' is a part of the Latin American traditional healing practice. Du Tout reveals that Santería has a "strong element of spiritism."&lt;ref name="du Toit 2001" /&gt;{{rp|26}}  McNeill also concurs that some ''Santeros'' have the power to communicate with spirits asking for guidance to improve the situation of a person consulting.&lt;ref name="McNeill 2008"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Brian McNeill, Eileen Esquivel |chapter=Santeria and the Healing Process in Cuba and the United States |title=Latina/o Healing Practices: Mestizos and Indigenous Perspectives |editors=Brian McNeill and Joseph Cervantes |location=New York |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-415-95420-4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}} However, in general, the ''Santeros'' of the ''Regla de Ocha'' primarily turn to religion as their practice to address personal challenges and identify means to improve a situation.'''''&lt;ref name="McNeill 2008" /&gt;{{rp|77}}  '''''Many people may go and see espirititas who don't see a ''Santero''. Also, espiritistas may work hand in hand with ''Santeros''.

While psychotherapy tends to use mostly [[allopathic]] principles, spiritism uses [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] principles that aim to reduce the anxiety, or permit the patient to acknowledge pent-up emotions, unexpressed guilt, or repressed behavior through catharsis meant to release emotions the patient may not even be aware of.&lt;ref name="du Toit 2001" /&gt;{{rp|25}} It is said that "healing can occur when the spirit medium assists the sufferer to come into harmony with the spirit world so as to change his or her physical condition, emotions, way of life, or destiny."&lt;ref name="du Toit 2001" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

The reputation of ''espiritistas'' was tinged with negativity, being accused of witchcraft because they deal with health through the unfamiliar paradigm of the spirit world, which was not understood by either the medical doctors or the Catholic priests. Consequently, ''espiritistas'' or traditional healers of Santería and other Latin American cultures working with healing through the spirit world are attacked as "works of the devil" from the pulpits of the Catholic Churches and labeled as "quackery" from the journals of the medical profession. This unique system of knowledge is appreciated as ethnopharmacology or ethnomedicine.&lt;ref name="du Toit 2001" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

Aligning and harmonizing with the forces of nature, practitioners of the ''Regla de Ocha'' invoke on the guidance of ''Orichás''. There are three foremost ''orichás'' that are predominantly concerned with folk-healing, however, other ''orichás'' may be invoked to help a person with a specific problem. These main ''orichás'' are: '''Osaín''', the orichá of the herbs; '''Babalú-Ayé''', the orichá of contagious and epidemic diseases; and [[Inle (Santería)|Inle]], the patron of physicians. Osaín is the patron of ''curanderos'' or traditional herbal healers, also called ''Osainistas''.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004" /&gt;{{rp|78}} According to de la Torre, Osaín is believed to be embodied in the ''omiero'', which is a combination of "blood from sacrifices offered during the ceremony and juices extracted from herbs that are sacred to the ''Orichás'' with water (from rain, rivers, or seas) honey, ''aguardiente'', powdered eggshell, ''corojo'', and cocoa butter."&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004" /&gt;{{rp|78}}  The forest has everything that would maintain a robust health and keep a person away from malevolence, thus, Santería practitioners would agree that no spell will be able to work without the sanction of Osaín, the master herbalist commanding the healing secrets of plant life.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004" /&gt;{{rp|50}} Osaín is syncretized with [[Saint Joseph]], Saint Benito, or [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]. Babalú-Ayé is revered by its victims and survivors like [[smallpox]], [[leprosy]], and skin diseases. Babalú-Ayé has become the guardian of those with [[HIV/AIDS]]. He is syncretized with [[Rich man and Lazarus|Saint Lazarus]].&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004" /&gt;{{rp|78}} Inle is the patron of physicians, known as a healer who favors scientific methods. Inle is ranked as one of the orichás that is approached for very specific health issues. Thus, Inle is also known as the protector of [[Gay|homosexuals]] and [[Lesbian|feminosexuals]].'''&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004" /&gt;{{rp|82}}'''

People go to a ''consulta'' for many reasons, mainly for health-related issues. Divination is a means that traditional healers utilize to inquire further on the details of a problem. Divination may articulate the origin/cause of the problem; in addition, it may include prescriptions for solutions/suggestions to certain difficulties.&lt;ref name="Mason 2002" /&gt;{{rp|96}} Divination establishes an interpretative frame for the situation a person finds himself in.&lt;ref name="Mason 2002" /&gt;{{rp|97}}   Hence, the ''Santeros'' offer [[cowrie-shell divination]] or other appropriate traditional practices. [[Rituals]], or the reading of [[patakí]]s may be done to clarify a problem, of which sometimes the person consulting may not even be aware. Passed orally from many generations, ''patakí'' are parables used by diviners to guide or give insights or moral lessons to a person who came for consultation.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; The ''patakí'' recited by the ''Santero'' corresponds to the number that the cowrie shell divination brings.

Aside from the use of herbs and divination, the Santería traditional healing is achieved through rituals that include animal sacrifice, offerings, altar building, music, dance, and possession trance.&lt;ref name="Wedel 2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Johan Wedel |title=Santeria Healing: A Journey into the Afro-Cuban World of Divinities, Spirits, and Sorcery |publisher=University Press of Florida |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8130-2694-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108}} When the patient is a child, the ''Santero'' uses the curative system known as ''santiguo'', which means "to heal by blessing". Perceiving health problems, most ''Santeros'' recommend that the client seeks a medical doctor. Parallel to the medical treatment, the patient might be prescribed some herbal teas, cleansing baths, or a special diet from the traditional healing practice. Sometimes, a ''Santero'' might advise a client to receive ''omiero'', whose efficacy is widely disputed by many in the medical community. An ''omiero'' is claimed by believers to be a sacred mixture that is made for specific Santería ceremonies and to embody the ''orichá'' ruler of herbs, Osaín.&lt;ref name="de la Torre 2004" /&gt;{{rp|108}}  Most clients who see ''Santeros'' would never be told to drink it.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt;

Santería traditional healing is just one of the many traditional healing practices used in Caribbean and Latin American cultures. Traditional healing practices are practiced side by side with mainstream medical practices through the [[Cuban healthcare]] system. Traditional healers recognize but do not compete with Western medicine.

== Current distribution ==
Santería is a religion found in [[Latin America]]. It is mainly practiced in but not limited to [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]], [[Panama]], and [[Colombia]]. There is also a large population who practice it in the [[United States]]. 

In 2001, there were an estimated 22,000 practitioners in the US alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_studies/aris.pdf |title=American Religious Identification Survey, 2001 |publisher=[[City University of New York]] |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the number may be higher as some practitioners may be reluctant to disclose their religion on a government census or to an academic researcher. Of those living in the United States, some are fully committed priests and priestesses, others are godchildren or members of a particular house-tradition, and many are non-committal clients seeking help with their everyday problems.

A similar religion of Yoruba origin called [[Candomblé Ketu|Candomblé Queto]] is practiced in [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and [[Uruguay]]. This is referred to as "parallel religiosity".&lt;ref name="Perez y Mena 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andrés I. Pérez y Mena |date=March 1998 |title=Cuban Santería, Haitian Vodun, Puerto Rican Spiritualism: A Multicultural Inquiry into Syncretism |journal=[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] |volume=37 |number=1 |pages=15–27 |jstor=1388026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States court rulings ==
In 1993, the issue of [[animal sacrifice]] in Santería was taken to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the case of ''[[Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]].'' The court ruled that animal cruelty laws targeted specifically at Santería were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.findlaw.com/us/508/520.html |title=Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 |publisher=FindLaw.com |date=June 11, 1993 |accessdate=October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, legal and religious issues that related to [[animal sacrifice]], [[animal rights]], and [[freedom of religion]] were taken to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in the case of ''Jose Merced, President Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless.'' The court ruled that the Merced case of the freedom of exercise of [[religion]] was meritorious and prevailing and that Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city of [[Euless, Texas]], from enforcing its ordinances restricting his religious practices relating to the use of animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1479305.html |title=Merced v. Kasson, United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit |publisher=FindLaw.com |date=July 31, 2009 | accessdate =October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code § 110.005(a)(2)) without the court having to reach his claims under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]]. After the court case was settled, a news article was published in the Dallas Observer documenting the volume and brutality of the animal sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2009-10-22/news/a-court-case-forced-a-santeria-priest-to-reveal-some-of-his-religion-s-secrets-it-s-ritual-of-animal-sacrifice-he-revealed-on-his-own/ |title=A court case forced a Santería priest to reveal some of his religion's secrets.

The '''Social Democratic Bund''' was a short-lived [[Jew]]ish [[political party]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. It was formed as the Russian [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] was split at its conference in [[Gomel]] in April 1920. The Social Democratic Bund was formed out of the rightwing minority section of the erstwhile Russian Bund (the leftwing majority formed the [[Communist Bund (Russia)|Communist Bund]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Michael, and Derek Jonathan Penslar. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MnhJlFa0jd8C In Search of Jewish Community: Jewish Identities in Germany and Austria, 1918-1933]''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5DuagGR8RNsC Guide to the YIVO Archives, Volym 0]''. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The party was led by [[Raphael Abramovitch]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinkus, Benjamin. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=52Ew77pZsNUC Jews of the Soviet Union: A History of a National Minority]''. [S.l.]: Cambridge, 1990. p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the party there were two ideological streams, a leftwing tendency led by Abramovitch and a rightwing tendency led by [[Mikhail Liber]].&lt;ref&gt;Minczeles, Henri. ''Histoire générale du Bund: un mouvement révolutionnaire juif''. Paris: Editions Austral, 1995. p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1920 Abramovitch travelled to [[Western Europe]] together with a [[Menshevik]] delegation. He did not return to Russia afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, A. Thomas. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HmNpl0wNa8AC Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders 1. A - L]''. Westport, Conn. [u.a.]: Greenwood Press, 1995. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Social Democratic Bund lived a shadowy existence. At public workers meetings it would condemn the [[Yevsektsia]], the Jewish Section of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Gitelman2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zvi Y. Gitelman|title=Jewish Nationality and Soviet Politics: The Jewish Sections of the CPSU, 1917-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufZ9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215|date=8 March 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-6913-8|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Social Democratic Bund representation abroad took part in a protest against a [[Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries|trial of Socialist-Revolutionary leaders]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name=j/&gt; As late as February 1923 it published ''Biuleten tsentralnogo komiteta Bunda'' ('Bulletine of the Bund Central Committee') from Moscow.&lt;ref name="Gitelman2015"/&gt; The February 1923 issue spoke of Bund sections active in Moscow and [[Vitebsk]].&lt;ref name="Gitelman2015"/&gt;

As of 1924, the foreign delegation of the Social Democratic Bund took part in the framing of the platform of the [[Menshevik|Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Mensheviks)]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. Its leading representatives (Abramovic, Yudin (Aizenshtat) and Grigori Aronson) were inducted into the Menshevik foreign delegation in Berlin.&lt;ref name=j&gt;Jacobs, Jack Lester.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9031">[[File:Tamagushi_on_an_an.jpg|275 px|thumb|A ''tamagushi'' on a table ([[an (Shinto)|''an'']]) during a ceremony]]{{nihongo|'''Tamagushi'''|[[wiktionary:玉串|玉串]]||literally "jewel skewer"}} is a form of [[Shinto]] offering made from a ''[[sakaki]]''-tree branch decorated with [[shide (Shinto)|shide]] strips of [[washi]] paper, silk, or cotton. At [[Japanese wedding]]s, funerals, [[miyamairi]] and other ceremonies at [[Shinto shrine]]s, ''tamagushi'' are ritually presented to the ''[[kami]]'' (spirits or gods) by parishioners or [[kannushi]] priests.

==Linguistic history==
The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word ''tamagushi'' is usually written with the ''[[kanji]]'' ''tama'' [[Wikt:玉|玉]] "jade; gem; jewel; precious; ball; bead" and ''kushi'' [[Wikt:串|串]] "string together; skewer; spit; stick", or sometimes written 玉ぐし with ''[[hiragana]]'' since the official [[Tōyō kanji]] do not include 串.

The earliest recorded transcription of ''tamagushi'' is 玉籤, using ''kuji'' [[Wikt:籤|籤]] "bamboo slip; (divination) lot; written oracle; raffle; lottery" instead of ''kushi''. The (ca. 720 CE) ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' "Chronicles of Japan", which repeatedly mentions a 500-branched ''masakaki'' 真榊 "true ''sakaki''" tree (tr. Aston 1896:43, 47, 121), is the ''locus classicus'' for ''tamagushi'' 玉籤. [[File:Tamagushi.jpg|thumb|left|A [[kannushi]] holding a ''tamagushi'']]This mytho-history records a legend that when the sun-goddess [[Amaterasu]] got angry with her brother [[Susano'o]] and closed the door on the "Rock-cave of Heaven", the gods decorated a giant ''sakaki'' tree in order to lure the sun out of the darkness. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then all the Gods were grieved at this, and forthwith caused Ama no nuka-do no Kami, the ancestor of the Be ["clan; guild"] of mirror-makers, to make a mirror, Futo-dama, the ancestor of the Imibe [weavers' clan], to make offerings, and Toyo-tama, the ancestor of the Be of jewel-makers, to make jewels. They also caused Yama-Tuschi [Mountain-god] to procure eighty precious combs of the five-hundred-branched true sakaki tree, and Nu-dzuchi [Moor-god] to procure eighty precious combs of the five-hundred-branched Suzuki grass. (tr. Aston 1896:47)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "precious combs" translation derives from ''tama'' 玉 (tr. "Toyo-tama" and "jewels") and ''kushi'' [[Wikt:櫛|櫛]] "comb", which is a ''Nihon Shoki'' graphic variant of ''kuji'' 籤 in the goddess named Tamakushi Hime 玉櫛姫 (tr. "jewel-comb" Aston 1896:62).

The (ca. 645-760 CE) ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' "Myriad Leaves Collection" does not use the word  ''tamagushi'' but one poem (tr. Pierson 1929-1938:199) describes making it with [[paper mulberry]]: "I tie pure white strands of mulberry to the branches of the sacred tree".

Some common ''tamagushi'' [[collocation]]s include:
*''tamagushi o sasageru'' 玉串を捧げる "offer a ''tamagushi''"
*''tamagushi hōnō'' 玉串奉納 "dedicate/offer ''tamagushi'' [in front of a shrine altar]"
*''tamagushi-ryō'' 玉串料 "[cash] offerings for ''tamagushi'' [presented at a shrine]"　
''Tamagushi'' has an uncommon secondary meaning of "name for the ''sakaki'' tree". The (ca. 1439 CE) [[Shin Kokin Wakashū]] "New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems" (tr. Carr 1995:8) contains the first occurrence, "Holding the ornamented ''tamagushi'' leaves".

The ''sakaki'' (''Cleyera japonica'') is a flowering evergreen tree, which is considered sacred in [[Japanese mythology]]. In the present day, Shinto shrines often plant it as a ''sakaiki'' (境木 "boundary tree") to demarcate sanctified space. ''Sakaki'' is written with the ''kanji'' [[Wikt:榊|榊]], which graphically combines ''boku'' or ''ki'' [[Wikt:木|木]] "tree; wood" and ''shin'' or ''kami'' [[Wikt:神|神]] "spirit; god", compare ''[[Shinboku]]'' (神木 "sacred tree"). Carr (1995:11) characterizes 榊 as "a doubly exceptional logograph"; it is an [[ideograph]] "character representing an idea" (which is an infrequent type of [[logograph]] "character representing a word", see [[Chinese character classification]]), and it is a ''[[kokuji]]'' 国字 "national character; Japanese-made character" (rather than a typical ''kanji'' 漢字 "Chinese character" [[loanword]]).

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of ''tamagushi'', like many Japanese words, is uncertain. Despite consensus that ''-gushi'' 串 means "skewer; stick" (of ''sakaki''), the original signification of ''tama-'' 玉 "jade; jewel; ball" remain obscure. The [[Kokugaku]] scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]] (1730-1801) suggested an etymon of ''tamukegushi'' 手向け串 "hand-offered stick/skewer". The Shinto theologian [[Hirata Atsutane]] (1776-1843) proposed "bejeweled stick/skewer", with ''tama'' 玉 referring to decorative "jewels" (cf. ''tama'' [[Wikt:珠|珠]] "jewel; pearl; bead"). The famous ethnologist [[Kunio Yanagita]] (1875-1962) hypothesized "spiritual stick/skewer", with ''tama'' 玉 meaning ''tama'' [[Wikt:霊|霊]] "spirit; soul" (believed to be shaped like a ''tama'' [[Wikt:球|球]] "ball; sphere; globe").

==The Ehime lawsuit==
''Tamagushi'' was central to the "Ehime-ken Yasukuni jinjā tamagushi soshō" 愛媛県靖国神社玉串訴訟 "[[Ehime Prefecture]]'s [[Yasukuni Shrine]] ''tamagushi'' lawsuit" over the constitutional separation of state and religion (see Nelson 1999 or Morimura 2003 for details). 

Although Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Japan]] prohibits the state [[establishment of religion]] and Article 89 forbids expenditure of public money "for the use, benefit, or maintenance of any religious institution", the Ehime Governor officially paid for ''tamagushi-ryō'' 玉串料 "''tamagushi'' offerings" presented at several Shinto shrines. In 1982, a group of prefectural residents sued his office for having misappropriated ¥ 166,000 (approximately US $1900) in public funds. On March 17, 1989, the [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] District Court ruled the ''tamagushi'' offerings were unconstitutional and ordered the defendants to repay the prefecture. On May 12, 1992, the [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]] High Court overturned the Matsuyama decision, reasoning that the Shinto offerings were constitutionally allowed within the realm of "social protocol". On April 2, 1997, the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] overturned that decision and made a landmark ruling that ''tamagushi'' offerings were unconstitutional.

The question of what constitutes support of [[State Shinto]] remains controversial. For instance, the reformist politician [[Ichirō Ozawa]] disagrees with the court ruling. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are some instances where the values specified in the constitution are not in accord with the Japanese traditional culture. The Shinto rite of worshipping one's ancestors is very different from the idea of religion in the West. The 'Tamagushirō Decision' of the Supreme Court against Ehime Prefecture, which declared that making donations to purchase ''tamagushi'' was against the Constitution based on the religious freedom of Article 20, would not strike the Japanese (who believe in many gods) as anti-constitutional. Perhaps it would be better to impose restrictions on religious freedom only in order to suppress the development of state-sponsored religious fascism. (2001:169) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legend summary==

Chunyu Fen (淳于棼) is a previously successful and rich officer in the [[Huainan]] army who has offended his general and been dismissed. Disgruntled, he drank himself to sleep under a huge [[ash tree]] and was carried back to his house by two friends. While he is resting in a half-asleep state, a pair of messengers enter with an invitation from the king of "Ashendon".

Chunyu goes with the messengers in their carriage, which heads towards the ash tree and into the hollow under it. The scenery in the hollow, while consisting of mountains and rivers, looks different from the world above. After about ten miles, they enter a large city though a grand gate over which is written "The Great Kingdom of Ashendon". Chunyu sees an old drinking friend of his at the side of the road, amongst other officers.

Chunyu is informed by the prime minister that the king has invited him here with the hope of him marrying one of his daughters, creating an alliance. When brought before the king, he is told that this is at his father's wish. Chunyu is bemused by this, but since his father was a missing frontier general, it is possible. At a feast that evening, Chunyu is entertained by nymphs and fairies, and meets his groomsmen and Tian Zihua, another old friend who tells him yet another friend, Zhou, is also in the city. Forthwith, he is married to the king's second daughter, a girl of about fifteen.

Chunyu and his wife come to love each other greatly, and his power grows. One day, Chunyu asks the king how his father could have made the request to the king for him to be married, as Chunyu's father has been missing for nearly twenty years. The king replies that he is in frequent contact with Chunyu's father who is still alive, and serving at the northern frontier. The king instructs Chunyu to write to his father, but not to go to see him. A reply is soon received, telling Chunyu of his father's regret that they can't meet then, but that they will meet in three years' time.

At his wife's request, Chunyu takes an official post at Nanke (a prosperous and fertile southern tributary state) where he serves as governor, with Tian Zihua as finance minister and Zhou as chief councillor. After a farewell feast and a several-day-long journey, they arrive at Nanke. Chunyu is a wise governor and the state flourishes. He has five sons, who all take official posts, and two daughters who are married into the royal family.

One day, the neighboring kingdom of "Sandalvine" invades, and Chunyu is commanded to raise an army and fight them, which he does, putting Zhou in charge of 30,000 men. However, Zhou proves a poor commander, and the battle is a rout. Zhou flees back to Nanke under cover of darkness, where Chunyu arrests him, but the king pardons both men for the defeat. The next month Zhou dies from a boil on his neck and Chunyu's wife dies shortly after that. Chunyu's request to travel back to the capital with the hearse is granted, and he is greeted there by the mourning king and queen. After his return Chunyu behaves oddly and gathers so many followers that the king begins to suspect him. Meanwhile, the king is informed of a mysterious portent that the kingdom will be destroyed by an event caused by a foreigner close to the royal family. Accordingly, the king forces Chunyu to retire.

Sensing Chunyu's feelings of despondence, the king informs him that is regretful that his wife has died so young, but now Chunyu must return home. Chunyu argues, saying that this ''is'' his home, but the king disagrees, saying that Chunyu came from the world of men. So, Chunyu returns the way he came, but this time in an old and shabby carriage. Entering his home again, he is gripped by sadness, and then is shocked to see himself lying in his bed. Suddenly he awakens, and finds that the day he fell asleep has not yet ended, despite having lived a generation in Ashendon.

He goes out with his friends and uncovers a great [[ant colony|ants' nest]] under the ash tree, with two huge ants attended to by the others, with another nest nearby for Nanke, and a burial mound for his wife. A connected nest is found under a [[sandalwood]] tree overgrown with vines, showing where the invaders had come from. Chunyu forbids his friends to damage the nests and covers them again with the vines, but that night a severe storm destroys Ashendon, fulfilling the prophecy of destruction. Chunyu then remembers his friends Zhou and Tian Zihua, and sends a servant for news, to find that they are both recently dead. Realising the emptiness of the material world, Chunyu becomes a [[Taoism|Taoist]], eschews money and women, and dies three years later.

==Analysis==

Luo&lt;ref name=Luo/&gt; notes that the story fits other tales' pattern of building up to a final "factuality", or justification for the story, in the finding of the ant nests. Yu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rereading the Stone: Desire and the Making of Fiction in Dream of the Red Chamber |last=Yu |first=Anthony |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-09013-0 |page=139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1pFLo0pR0YC&amp;pg=PA139 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; says that this story is similar to others such as [[The World Inside a Pillow|''The World inside a Pillow'' (''Zhenzhongji'')]] and ''Cherry and the Blue Robe Maiden'' (''Yingtao qingyi'') in that it uses the concept of a dream as a cautionary device. Indeed, this story has led to the [[chengyu|Chinese idiom]] "Nankeyimeng" (南柯一梦) to describe such an illusory dream or fantasy of grandeur, despite the emptiness of materialistic life.&lt;ref name=Liu/&gt;

===Derivative works===

As well as the similar Japanese story ''[[The Dream of Akinosuke]]'', the concept of a lifetime being lived in the space of a single dream was explored in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Inner Light (TNG episode)|The Inner Light]]", where Picard wakes up on an alien planet and lives a long life before waking up after only a few minutes back in the real world.

{{Criticism of Judaism}}
'''''The Jewish Question'''''  is an 1843 book by German historian and theologian [[Bruno Bauer]], written and published in German (original title ''Die Judenfrage'').&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Bauer: ''Die Judenfrage'' (''The Jewish Question'') Braunschweig 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

Bauer argued that Jews can achieve political emancipation only if they relinquish their particular religious consciousness, since political emancipation requires a [[secular state]], which he assumes does not leave any "space" for social identities such as [[religion]]. According to Bauer, such religious demands are incompatible with the idea of the "[[Rights of Man]]." True political emancipation, for Bauer, requires the abolition of religion. He described the contemporary concept of [[Jewish political movements|Jewish nationalism]] as "chimeral" and "baseless".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gLdUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Die Judenfrage, Bruno Bauer, p61], "Wollen die Juden wirkliches Volk werden - sie können es aber nicht in ihrer chimärischen Nationalität, sondern nur in den geschichtsfähigen und geschichtlichen Nationen unsrer Zeit werden - so müssen sie die chimärische Prärogative ausgeben, die, so lange sie dieselbe sesthalten, sie immer von den Völkern trennen und der Geschichte entfremden wird. Ehren Unglauben an die Völker und den ausschließlichen Glauben an ihre bodenlose Nationalität müssen sie zum Opser bringen. ehe sie sich auch nur im Entserntesten in Stand sehen können, an wirklichen Staats- und Volksangelegenheiten aufrichtig und ohne geheimen Vorbehalt Theil zu nehmen."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iv1DADhI6h4C&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Germany, Turkey, and Zionism 1897-1918, p6]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his commentary ''[[On the Jewish Question]]'' also published in 1843, [[Karl Marx]] criticizes Bauer's book as well as "Die Fähigkeit der heutigen Juden und Christen, frei zu werden" ("''The Capacity of Present-day Jews and Christians to Become Free''").&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Bruno. "Die Fähigkeit der heutigen Juden und Christen, frei zu werden" ("''The Capacity of Present-day Jews and Christians to Become Free''"), in: ''Einundzwanzig Bogen aus der Schweiz'', edited by [[Georg Herwegh]], Zürich and Winterthur, 1843, pp. 56-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3118">Rabbi '''Yaakov Meir Shechter'''  is a prominent leader and teacher in the [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement in [[Israel]]. He is a well-known [[kabbalah|kabbalist]] and a [[rosh yeshiva]] of both the main Breslov [[Yeshiva]] in [[Meah Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]], and the Non-Breslov [[Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva]] in [[Mekor Baruch]].&lt;ref name = "Breslov-vaad"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lectures, both in oral and written form, emphasize the application of Breslov and other related Chassidic and non-Chassidic teachings to the challenges of life and the pursuit of spiritual growth.

==Early life==
Yaakov Meir Shechter was born in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]] to a prominent Breslover family headed by his father, Rabbi [[Dovid Shechter]]. During his youth in the Old City, Shechter learned from Breslov elders of the previous generation &amp;mdash; especially Rabbi [[Abraham Sternhartz]], who had immigrated to [[Israel]] from [[Uman, Ukraine]] in 1936.

The Shechter family was expelled from the Old City together with the rest of the Jewish population by the [[Arab Legion|Jordanian army]] during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. They resettled in the [[Katamon]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]], where a Breslov [[yeshiva]] was founded. Later, the family moved again to the [[Meah Shearim]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]] near the main Breslov yeshiva, which was founded in 1953.

==Breslov leader==
Shechter is widely regarded as the leading figure of the faction of Breslov which is connected to the larger [[Ashkenazi Judaism|Ashkenazi]] Hasidic community, centered in [[Meah Shearim]].

Thousands  of people from all over the world and from all backgrounds flock to him for guidance on all matters, and for his blessings.

==Publications==
A selection of Shechter's talks from ''Leket Amarim'' (A Collection of Talks) was translated into [[English language|English]] as ''In All Your Ways: A Guide to Avodas Hashem'' ([http://www.moznaim.com Moznaim Publishers]). This work incorporates Shechter's broad knowledge of [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], [[Mussar movement|Mussar]], Breslov Hasidut, and Kabbalah into an inspirational guide for the spiritual seeker.[http://www.eichlers.com/Product/Books/Self_Improvment/In_All_Your_Ways_MOZ515-0.html]

'''Yam''' (also ''Yamm''&lt;!-- or '''Yammu''' {{cn}}--&gt;) is the   [[sea god|god of the sea]] in the [[Canaanite pantheon]].
Yam takes the role of the adversary of [[Hadad|Baal]] in the [[Ugaritic]] ''[[Baal Cycle]]''.

''Yam'' ({{lang|sem|ים }} {{lang|sem-Latn|ym}}), the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] word for "Sea" &lt;!--(supposedly also written {{lang|sem|יו }} {{lang|sem-Latn|yw}}{{cn}})--&gt;, is one name of the [[Ugarit]]ic god of Rivers and Sea. 
Also titled ''ṯpṭ nhr'' "Judge River",&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1994), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=jlfx4YwtaVkC&amp;pg=PA235  p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt; he is also one of the '' 'ilhm'' (''[[Elohim (gods)|Elohim]]'') or sons of [[El (deity)|El]], the name given to the Levantine [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].  

Of all the gods, despite being the champion of [[El (deity)|El]], Yam holds special hostility against [[Baal]] [[Hadad]], son of [[Dagon]]. Yam is a deity of the sea and his palace is in the [[Tartarus|abyss]] associated with the depths, or Biblical [[tehom]], of the oceans.  
Yam is the deity of the primordial [[Chaos (mythology)|chaos]] and represents the power of the sea, untamed and raging; he is seen as ruling storms and the disasters they wreak, and was an important divinity to the maritime [[Phoenicians]]. The gods cast out Yam from the heavenly mountain Sappan (modern [[Jebel Aqra]]; ''Sappan'' is [[cognate]] to ''[[Zephon (angel)|Tsephon]]'').{{cn|date=April 2017}} 

The fight of Baal-Hadad with Yam has long been equated with the ''[[Chaoskampf]]'' mytheme in [[Mesopotamian mythology]] in which a god fights and destroys a "[[dragon]]" or sea monster; the seven-headed [[dragon]] [[Lotan]] is associated closely with him and Yam is often described as ''the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]''. Both Mesopotamian [[Tiamat]]&lt;ref name=DDD_Tiamat&gt;Albert I. Baumgarten
, ''The Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos: A Commentary'' (1981), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=BM8UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA131  p. 131].
"The concept of a battle between the primordial cosmic sea and a leading god of the pantheon was an innovation in Babylonian religion introduced with ''Enuma elish''. The motif itself was probably inspired from the mythology of Western Asia, where it is represeted by the Ugaritic myth of Baal." "Tiamat" in  van der Toorn et al., ''[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]]'' (1999),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;pg=PA868  p. 868].
&lt;/ref&gt; and Biblical [[Leviathan]] are adduced as reflexes of this narrative,&lt;ref name=DDD_Dragon&gt; van der Toorn et al., ''[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]]'' (1999) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;pg=PA265 s.v. "Dragon"]&lt;/ref&gt; as is the fight of [[Zeus]] with [[Typhon]] in Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origins'' University of California Press (1959),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&amp;pg=PA134  p. 134]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baal Cycle==
{{main|Baal Cycle}}
{{Middle Eastern deities}}
In the  [[Ugarit#Ugaritic religion|Ugaritic]] ''[[Baal Cycle]]'', [[El (god)|El]], chief of the Gods and father to the second-tier divinities, appoints Yam to fight [[Hadad|Hadad-Baal]].
In the ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' of [[Philo of Byblos]], El corresponds to  [[Cronus]], Hadad-Baal to [[Zeus]],  Yam to [[Poseidon]] and [[Mot (Semitic god)|Mot]] to [[Hades]].

[[Keilschrift Texte aus Ugarit|KTU]] 1.2 iii:
:"From your throne of kingship you shall be driven,
:from the seat of your dominion cast out!
:On your head be Ayamari (Driver) O Yam,
:Between your shoulders Yagarish (Chaser), O Judge Nahar
:May Horon split open, O Yam,
:may Horon smash your head,
:´Athtart-Name-of-the-Lord thy skull!

After a great war in heaven involving many of the gods, Yam is soundly defeated:
:And the weapon springs from the hand of Baal,
:Like a raptor from between his fingers.
:It strikes the skull of Prince Yam,
:between the eyes of Judge Nahar.
:Yahm collapses, he falls to the earth;
:His joints quiver, and his spine shakes.
:Thereupon Baal drags out Yam and would rend him to pieces;
:he would make an end of Judge Nahar.

Hadad holds a great feast, but not long afterwards he battles [[Mot (Semitic god)|Mot]] (death) and through his mouth he [[descent to the underworld|descends to the netherworld]]. Yet like Yam, Death too is defeated and in h. I AB iii the Lord arises from the dead:
:For alive is Mighty Baal,
:Revived is the Prince, Master of Earth."
:'El calls to the Virgin Anat:
:"Hearken, O maiden [[Anat]]!"

==Comparative mythology==
The narrative of the conflict of Yam with Baal-Hadad has long been compared to parallels in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], the battle between [[Tiamat]] and [[Enlil]] and Babylonian [[Marduk]] and, more generically, the ''[[Chaoskampf]]'' motif in [[comparative mythology]].&lt;ref name=DDD_Tiamat/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Yisrael Mendel Kaplan was born in 1913 in [[Baranovich]], Poland (now [[Baranowicze]], Belarus) to Avraham and Esther Kaplan.  Avraham was a lawyer and Esther was involved in community service: Raising funds for the [[Yeshiva]], feeding the poor and so forth.

After his bar mitzva, he was enrolled in the yeshiva of Rabbi [[Elchonon Wasserman]].  He was considered a very promising student and was assigned Wasserman's son, Naftali, as a study partner. He later studied in the [[Mir Yeshiva (Poland)|Mir yeshiva]] as well.

===Marriage and children===
While studying in Mir, he married Sarah Baila Gutman (b. [[Navahrudak]], 1910 – d. New York City, March 12, 2008 ), the daughter of Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Gutman, the administrator of the yeshiva in Baranowicze.  When Rabbi Gutman was looking for a match, he asked Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman about a number of prospects.  Rabbi Wasserman recommended Kaplan.  When Rabbi Gutman pressed him "Isn't your own son, Naftoli, a little better?"  Rabbi Wasserman answered "My Naftoli is a good boy, but he doesn't measure up to Mendel."  (Greenwald 1995:31)

They had six children:

*Rabbi [[Yerucham Kaplan]]
*Tzirel, Wife of Rabbi [[Haim Benoliel]]
*Rachel, Wife of Rabbi [[David Lopian]]
*Esther, Wife of Rabbi Shaul Hutner
*Chaim Ozer Kaplan (born c.1942, died in Shanghai)
*Shimon Kaplan

===Escape from the Nazis===
In late 1939, the German's [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]] overtook Poland and the Jews of Baranovich fled for their lives.  Wasserman advised his yeshiva students to regroup in then-independent [[Vilnius|Vilna]], Lithuania.  Kaplan and his family moved there and Kaplan studied there under Rabbi [[Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik]].  In June 1940, when the [[Soviet Union]] occupied Vilna, Jewish life became unbearable.   Like the members of the [[Mir Yeshiva (Poland)|Mir yeshiva]] and other refugees there, Kaplan sought visas to allow him to escape Nazi and Soviet rule.  He obtained a ''de facto'' destination visa from the [[Jan Zwartendijk|Dutch consul]] but was unable to obtain the necessary transit visa from Japanese Vice-consul, [[Chiune Sugihara]] that would allow his family to detour through Japan while awaiting some final, true destination.  (Greenwald 1995:38)

The family nevertheless boarded the trains to the [[Russia]]n port city of [[Vladivostok]].  His son, Chaim Ozer, was born on the train ride.  After entering Japanese territory by boat, Kaplan expected deportation back to Russia and eventually [[Siberia]].  Japanese officials goaded him to produce any kind of visa and he reluctantly showed them an obviously tampered Japanese transit visa.  Inexplicably, it was stamped and accepted and the family continued on to [[Kobe]] and then later to Shanghai. (Greenwald 1995:39–40)

His son Shimon was born in Shanghai, while his middle son, Chaim Ozer grew sick and died there.

===Chicago===
Kaplan arrived in America after the war and moved to Chicago, where his brother, Rabbi Hertzl Kaplan was teaching at the Chicago yeshiva that was to become the [[Hebrew Theological College]].  Reb Mendel accepted a teaching position there, though his students were English-speaking and his English was not yet mastered.  He won the students over by offering to "teach them to read the ''Chicago Tribune'' if they taught him to read English."  His insights into world affairs and reading between the lines of the daily paper (even while needing help with the language) earned him his student's respect.  (Greenwald 1995:44)

When his girls were old enough for high school, his wife moved with them to [[Brooklyn]] New York, so they could attend a Jewish girls high school in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]].  Kaplan started Kaplan's Winery Corporation, producing traditional Kosher [[Concord grape|Concord]] wine, in an effort to supplement his income to cover his daughter's tuition costs. (Greenwald 1995:47)

===Philadelphia===
By 1965, Kaplan had joined his family in New York and was invited to start teaching the first-level post-high school class in the [[Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia]].  He accepted the position, lived in the dormitory and commuted each weekend to his wife and family in Brooklyn.  He stayed at the school and taught the same level until his death on April 4, 1985. Rabbi [[Yaakov Kamenetsky]] commented "''Ahzah Kuntz'',  (What a feat!)  He is greater than famous [[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]], and he can still work quietly under younger men." (Greenwald 1995:48–49) However, Reb Mendel had strong disagreements with the Roshei Yeshiva in Philadelphia regarding involving the students in secular studies.

'''Zend''' or '''Zand''' ([[Middle Persian]] :𐭦𐭭𐭣) is a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] technical term for [[exegesis|exegetical]] glosses, paraphrases, commentaries and translations of the [[Avesta]]'s texts. The term ''zand'' is a contraction of the [[Avestan language]] word ''{{transl|ae|zainti}}'' ''𐬰𐬀𐬌𐬥𐬙𐬌'' , meaning "interpretation", or "as understood".

''Zand'' glosses and commentaries exist in several languages, including in the Avestan language itself.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|pp=3-4}} These Avestan language exegeses sometimes accompany the original text being commented upon, but are more often elsewhere in the canon. An example of exegesis in the Avestan language itself includes ''[[Yasna]]'' 19-21, which is a set of three Younger Avestan commentaries on the three Gathic Avestan 'high prayers' of ''Yasna'' 27. ''Zand'' also appear to have once existed in a variety of [[Middle Iranian languages]],{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=4}}&lt;!-- "there would have been Zands in the various languages of the diverse Iranian peoples down to the fourth century A.C." --&gt; but of these Middle Iranian commentaries, the [[Middle Persian]] ''zand'' is the only to survive fully, and is for this reason regarded as 'the' ''zand''.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=4}}

With the notable exception of the ''[[Yasht]]s'', almost all surviving Avestan texts have their Middle Persian ''zand'', which in some manuscripts appear alongside (or interleaved with) the text being glossed. The practice of including non-Avestan commentaries alongside the Avestan texts led to two different misinterpretations in western scholarship of the term ''zand''; these misunderstandings are described [[#misnomer|below]]. These glosses and commentaries were not intended for use as theological texts by themselves but for religious instruction of the (by then) non-Avestan-speaking public. In contrast, the Avestan language texts remained sacrosanct and continued to be recited in the Avestan language, which was considered a [[sacred language]]. The Middle Persian ''zand'' can be subdivided into two subgroups, those of the surviving Avestan texts, and those of the lost Avestan texts.

A consistent exegetical procedure is evident in manuscripts in which the original Avestan and its ''zand'' coexist.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=4}} The priestly scholars first translated the Avestan as literally as possible. In a second step, the priests then translated the Avestan idiomatically. In the final step, the idiomatic translation was complemented with explanations and commentaries, often of significant length, and occasionally with different authorities being cited.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=4}}

Several important works in Middle Persian contain selections from the ''zand'' of Avestan texts, also of Avestan texts which have since been lost. Through comparison of selections from lost texts and from surviving texts, it has been possible to distinguish between the translations of Avestan works and the commentaries on them, and thus to some degree reconstruct the content of some of the lost texts.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=4}} Among those texts is the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', which has ''Zand-Agahih'' ("Knowledge from the ''Zand''") as its subtitle and is crucial to the understanding of Zoroastrian cosmogony and eschatology. Another text, the ''Wizidagiha'', "Selections (from the Zand)", by the 9th century priest Zadspram, is a key text for understanding Sassanid-era Zoroastrian orthodoxy. The [[Denkard]], a 9th or 10th century text, includes extensive summaries and quotations of ''zand'' texts.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=4}}

{{anchor|misnomer|Zend-Avesta}}The priests' practice of including commentaries alongside the text being commented upon led to two different misunderstandings in 18th/19th century western scholarship:{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=4}}
* The incorrect treatment of "Zend" and "Avesta" as synonyms and the mistaken use of "Zend-Avesta" as the name of Zoroastrian scripture. This mistake derives from a misunderstanding of the distinctions made by priests between manuscripts for scholastic use ("Avesta-''with''-Zand"), and manuscripts for liturgical use ("clean"). In western scholarship, the former class of manuscripts was misunderstood to be the proper name of the texts, hence the misnomer "Zend-Avesta" for the Avesta. In priestly use however, "Zand-i-Avesta" or "Avesta-o-Zand" merely identified manuscripts that are not suitable for ritual use since they are not "clean" (''sade'') of non-Avestan elements.
* The mistaken use of ''Zend'' as the name of a language or script. In 1759, [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil-Duperron]] reported having been told that ''Zend'' was the name of the language of the more ancient writings. Similarly, in his third discourse, published in 1798, [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] recalls a conversation with a Hindu priest who told him that the script was called ''Zend'', and the language ''Avesta''. This mistake results from a misunderstanding of the term ''[[pazend]]'', which actually denotes the use of the [[Avestan alphabet]] for writing certain Middle Persian texts. [[Rasmus Rask]]'s seminal work, ''A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language'' (Bombay, 1821), may have contributed to the confusion.
Propagated by N. L. Westergaard's ''Zendavesta, or the religious books of the Zoroastrians'' (Copenhagen, 1852–54), by the early/mid 19th century, the confusion became too universal in Western scholarship to be easily reversed, and ''Zend-Avesta'', although a misnomer, continued to be fashionable well into the 20th century.
