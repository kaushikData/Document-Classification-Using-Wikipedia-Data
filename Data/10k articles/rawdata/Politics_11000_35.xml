The '''al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades''' ({{lang-ar|كتائب شهداء الأقصى}} ''Katā'ib Shuhadā' al-'Aqṣā'') is a secular [[coalition]] of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] armed groups in the [[West Bank]]. The organization has been designated as a [[terrorist organization]] by Israel, the [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_340/l_34020051223en00640066.pdf], [[Official Journal of the European Union]], 30 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kushner|first=Harvey|title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|year=2002|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOfkAoDb_2IC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=Al-Aqsa+Brigades&amp;lr=&amp;sig=gaorV2LoWmqz5Di4u7yIDZ0S5t4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psepc.gc.ca/prg/ns/le/cle-en.asp#aamb5 "Currently listed entities"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119150657/http://www.psepc.gc.ca/prg/ns/le/cle-en.asp |date=19 November 2006 }}, [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada]], 11 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/2005/ch3-a.pdf Japan‘s Foreign Policy in Major Diplomatic Fields]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="NZ-r1373-terrorlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal-community/counterterrorism/designated-entities/lists-associated-with-resolution-1373 |title=Lists associated with Resolution 1373 |publisher=New Zealand Police |date=20 July 2014 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm "Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212050031/https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm |date=12 December 2007 }}, [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], 11 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arafat and Fatah==
The leadership of the brigades, and average members have identified themselves as the military wing of [[Fatah]]. On their website, and on posters, they post the Fatah emblem. The leadership of Fatah has said they never made a decision either to create the brigades, or make them the militant wing of Fatah. Since 2002, some leaders in Fatah have reportedly tried to get the brigades to stop attacking civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stork|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Stork|title=Erased in a Moment: Suicide Bombing Attacks Against Israeli Civilians|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=2002|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGiot772MSEC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Al-Aqsa+Martyrs%27+Brigades&amp;sig=tZif7ASqqEZYer5I5Q_ubsrjSO0#PPA78,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003, BBC journalists uncovered a payment by Fatah of $50,000 a month to al-Aqsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3243071.stm|newspaper=BBC News|title=Palestinian Authority funds go to militants|date=7 November 2003|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This investigation, combined with the documents found by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), led the [[government of Israel]] to draw the conclusion that the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades have always been directly funded by [[Yasser Arafat]]. In June 2004, then [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Prime Minister]] [[Ahmed Qurei]] openly stated this: "We have clearly declared that the Aksa Martyrs' Brigades are part of Fatah. We are committed to them and Fatah bears full responsibility for the group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eufunding.org/accountability/AbuToameh_Fatah_AksaMartyrs.html |title=Fatah committed to Aksa Martyrs |publisher=EU Funding |date=20 April 2004 |accessdate=17 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716211126/http://www.eufunding.org/accountability/AbuToameh_Fatah_AksaMartyrs.html |archivedate=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, he further declared "The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, military wing of the Fatah movement will not be dissolved and Fatah will never relinquish its military wing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=21474 IMRA 24 July 2004 PMW: Arafat Blames Israel for Tel Aviv Bombing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Website does not provide link to source for quote, seems like a propaganda website.|date=October 2015}}

On 18 December 2003, Fatah asked the leaders of the al-Aqsa Martyr's Brigades to join the Fatah Council, recognizing it officially as part of the Fatah organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS21235.pdf Palestinian Factions, CRS Report for Congress, Aaron D. Pina, 8 June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:Al-aqsa aamb.gif|thumb|200px|Flag of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]]
The al-Aqsa brigades are responsible for dozens of [[suicide bombing]]s and many more shooting attacks against Israeli vehicles in the [[West Bank]]. For a complete list of the suicide bombings carried out by the organization see: [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks]].

Some notable suicide bombings committed by the group were:
*January 2002: [[Bat Mitzvah massacre]], when a gunman killed six and wounded 33 in a [[Bat Mitzvah]] celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Phil|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/bat--mitzvah-massacre-in-israel-leaves-seven-dead-663843.html|title=Bat mitzvah massacre in Israel leaves seven dead|newspaper=The Independent|date=18 January 2002|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 2005, the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades claimed responsibility for a shooting attack at the [[Gush Etzion]] Junction, killing three Israelis and wounding three others.

On 24 March 2004, a Palestinian teenager named [[Hussam Abdo]] was caught in an [[Israeli Defense Forces|IDF]] checkpoint carrying an [[explosive belt]]. Following his arrest, an al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade teenagers' militant cell was exposed and arrested in [[Nablus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/international/middleeast/30teen.html |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Israel Says Children Are Used to Recruit Bombers |first=Greg |last=Myre |date=30 May 2004 |accessdate=27 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802024301/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/international/middleeast/30teen.html |archivedate=2 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2004, a 15-year-old suicide bomber was arrested by [[Israeli security forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Harel|first=Amos|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/481217.html|title=Heightened alert set for Yom Kippur; Afula attack thwarted|newspaper=Haaretz|date=23 September 2004|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brigades, like many militia groups, is noted for the use of promotional posters in the main cities of the Palestinian territories. The Brigades have attacked Palestinians as well as Israelis. In November and December 2003, they killed the brother of [[Ghassan Shakaa]] (the mayor of [[Nablus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/709/re3.htm |title=Not another day in Nablus |newspaper=Weekly Ahram |date=29 September 2004 |accessdate=17 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716190016/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/709/re3.htm |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2004 Shakaa filed his resignation from office in protest of the [[Palestinian Authority]]'s lack of action against the armed militias "rampaging" the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2004/s1056078.htm |title=AM Archive - Nablus Mayor resigns over lawlessness|newspaper=Abc|year=2004|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Middle East Information Center |url=http://middleeastinfo.org/article.php?sid=3978 |title=Conflicts, News, History, Religions and Discussions |publisher=Middleeast Info |accessdate=17 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716211201/http://middleeastinfo.org/article.php?sid=3978 |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first three months of 2004, a number of attacks on journalists in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were blamed on the Brigades as well, including the attack on the Arab television station [[Al Arabiya]]'s West Bank offices by masked men who identified themselves as members of the Brigades. Palestinian journalists in Gaza called a general strike on 0 February 2004 to protest this rising violence against journalists.

The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades have taken prominent part in the July 2004 riots in the Gaza Strip, in which Palestinian officers were kidnapped and PA security headquarters buildings and policemen were attacked by gunmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicom.org.uk/publications/israeli-palestinian_conflict/?content_id=721 |title=Increased pressure on Arafat to reform PA or resign |accessdate=12 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525230611/http://www.bicom.org.uk/publications/israeli-palestinian_conflict/?content_id=721 |archivedate=25 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These riots led the Palestinian cabinet to declare a state of emergency. One media outlet described the situation in the [[Palestinian Authority]] as [[Anomie|anarchy]] and [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades have carried out several joint attacks with the Islamist group [[Hamas]]. These attacks were committed mainly in the [[Gaza Strip]]. ''See also:'' [[PLO and Hamas]]. The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades have also carried out joint attack with other militant groups such as [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], [[The Popular Resistance Committees]] and with [[Hezbollah]] in the [[West Bank]].

The [[European Union]]'s [[Gaza City|Gaza]] offices were raided by 15 masked gunmen from al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades on 30 January 2006. They demanded apologies from Denmark and Norway regarding the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]] and left 30 minutes later without shots fired or injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4661572.stm|newspaper=BBC|title=Gaza EU offices raided by gunmen|date=30 January 2006|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Deleted image removed: [[File:Islamicjihadjeep.JPG|thumb|right|Vehicle used by armed Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa Martys' Brigade members marked with "TV" and "PRESS" insignias in a failed attempt to capture an Israeli soldier.]]--&gt;
On 9 June 2007, in a failed assault on an IDF position at the Kissufim crossing between Gaza and Israel in a possible attempt to kidnap IDF soldiers, 4 armed members of the [[al-Quds Brigades]] - the military wing of Islamic Jihad - and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades - the military wing of [[Fatah]] -, used a vehicle marked with "TV" and "PRESS" insignias penetrated the border fence and assaulted a guard tower in what Islamic Jihad and the army said was a failed attempt to capture an Israeli soldier.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181228588087&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Press slams gunmen for using TV jeep|Jerusalem Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; IDF troops killed one militant, while the others escaped.

The use of a vehicle that resembled a press vehicle evoked a sharp response from many journalists and news organizations, including the Foreign Press Association and [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/13/isrlpa16156.htm Gaza: Armed Palestinian Groups Commit Grave Crimes (Human Rights Watch, 13 June 2007)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2007, [[Zakaria Zubeidi]], considered the local al-Aqsa leader for [[Jenin]] and the northern West Bank and has been wanted for many years for his armed activity against Israel, agreed to cease fighting against Israel&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/091/article_54084.asp Un chef de guerre dépose les armes] (translation: "A war chief lays down his arms")&lt;/ref&gt; after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave conditional pardon for 178 prisoners from the PA territories.

==Amnesty deal==
In July, 2007, Israel and the Palestinian Authority reached an amnesty deal under which 178 al-Aqsa gunmen surrendered their arms to the Palestinian Authority, renounced future anti-Israel violence and were permitted to join Palestinian security forces.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Joel|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-07-16/news/0707150274_1_al-aqsa-martyrs-brigades-hamas-west-bank|title=Militants Accept Amnesty|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later agreements in 2007 and 2008 added more gunmen to the list of those granted amnesty in exchange for ending violence, eventually bringing the total to over 300.&lt;ref name="apinynet.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3433924,00.html |title=Report: Some 300 Gunmen Accept Israel's Amnesty Deal|newspaper=Ynet|date=7 May 2008|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2007, according to [[Arutz Sheva]], al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade announced that it was backing out of its commitment and promise to refrain from attacks against Israel and the Israeli backed amnesty deal giving amnesty to 178 al-Aqsa gunmen who agreed to stop militant activities against Israel and surrender their weapons.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123470 Fatah Claims Shooting Attack, Terrorists Break Amnesty Deal - Defense/Middle East - Israel News - Arutz Sheva&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; al-Aqsa said that it backed out of the deal due to the IDF's arrest of two militants who were supposed to be on the amnesty list. According to the IDF, they said they caught the two men at a checkpoint and said they were involved in "terrorist activity" which consequently mandated their arrest according to the stipulations of the amnesty deal. 
Shortly after backing out of the amnesty deal and its promise of stopping to attack Israel that Al Aqsa agreed to a month earlier, al-Aqsa gunmen in Gaza have announced that they are starting to launch hundreds of rockets and mortar shells at Israeli towns and cities and named the campaign, "Hole in the Wall II."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Members==

==Popular culture==
In the [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] movie ''[[Brüno]]'', the character Brüno interviewed [[Palestinian Christian]] Ayman Abu Aita, who was portrayed in the movie as a leader of the militant group. The group released a statement to a Jerusalem-based journalist saying that it was "very upset" that it had been featured in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Brown, David  |author2=Kartik, Mehta|date=28 July 2009|title=Terrorist threat to Sacha Baron Cohen over Brüno ridicule|newspaper=The Sunday Times|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6729022.ece|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Aita insists that he was tricked into appearing in the film and that he has never been involved with the Martyrs' Brigades.

The '''Alliance of Patriots of Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|საქართველოს პატრიოტთა ალიანსი}}, ''Sakartvelos Patriotta Aliansi'', APG) is a self-defined [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], [[pro-Russian]], [[Conservatism|conservative]] opposition party in the republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="cecire3.15"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/09/the-kremlin-pulls-on-georgia/ |title=The Kremlin pulls on Georgia |first=Michael |last=Cecire |date=March 9, 2015 |journal=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2012 by leaders from the Resistance Movement and its platform includes anti-Western positions.&lt;ref name="cecire11.15"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/georgia/2015-11-10/divide-and-conquer-georgia |title=Divide and conquer in Georgia |first=Michael |last=Cecire |date=November 10, 2015 |journal=[[Foreign Affairs (magazine)|Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party currently supports [[European integration]], it supports Christian and democratic values, and the party demonstrates itself as a [[Liberal conservatism|moderate-conservative]] party.&lt;ref name="Alliance of Patriots of Georgia"&gt;{{cite website|url=http://patriots.ge/about-temp/ |title=Alliance of Patriots of Georgia |first= |last= |date= |journal=[[Political Party’s Page]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party campaigned against the building of a mosque in [[Adjara]], saying “Turkey has too much influence in Georgia,” so it has been accused of [[Anti-Turkism]].&lt;ref name="Kucera"&gt;{{cite website|url=https://eurasianet.org/s/georgia-disillusion-with-establishment-fuels-rise-of-populism |title=Georgia: Disillusion with Establishment Fuels Rise of Populism

In the 2014 local elections, it gained an aggregate vote nationwide of 4.6%, exceeding the 4% threshold required to qualify as a political party for government funding. Through party-list voting in 47 cities, it won proportional seat representation on the local councils of 30 municipalities, including [[Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name="civil.ge"/&gt;

In June 2016, the party formed a bloc with five other parties (Free Georgia, led by [[Kakha Kukava]]; [[Tavisupleba (political party)|Tavisupleba]], led by [[Konstantine Gamsakhurdia (politician)|Konstantine Gamsakhurdia]]; Traditionalists, led by [[Akaki Asatiani]]; [[Christian-Democratic Movement (Georgia)|New Christian-Democrats]], led by [[Gocha Jojua]], and Political Movement of Law Enforcement and Armed Forces Veterans) for the scheduled 2016 parliamentary election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Alliance of Patriots Forms 6-Party Bloc for Elections|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=29218|accessdate=29 July 2016|work=Civil Georgia|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; finishing 3rd place in the proportional votе and just passing the [[electoral threshold]] of 5%.

==History==
The party was established in December 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/georgia-electoral-reform-concerns/27437225.html Georgian Electoral Amendment Clears Early Hurdle, But Vote Concerns Persist] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 19 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; by founders including [[Soso Manjavidze]], [[Davit Tarkhan-Mouravi]] and [[Irma Inashvili]]. Giorgi Lomia is political secretary.&lt;ref name="civil.ge"/&gt; The party leadership also includes former warlord [[Emzar Kvitsiani]], a figure that has attracted significant controversy.&lt;ref name="Kvitsiani"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Liz|title=Georgian Court Releases Jailed Warlord|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/georgia-kvitsiani-russia/26818432.html|accessdate=23 October 2016|agency=Radio Free Europe|date=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance party was based on the Resistance Movement, a group fiercely critical of the former ruling party, the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]].

The Alliance of Patriots maintains anti-Turkish rhetoric, warning of Ankara's designs on the Adjara region, has called for delaying free trade with the EU, and argues that the pursuit of NATO membership is fruitless, as NATO's leading members have themselves made clear that Georgia has little prospect of accession.&lt;ref name="civil.ge"/&gt;

The Alliance party has a television channel, Obieqtivi, run by Inashvili. Davit Tarkhan-Mouravi has a series on the channel in which he lectures on the Bible and [[Orthodox Christianity]]. A mathematician, he served in earlier administrations as "head of the state department for information technologies in the early 2000s, and as head of the customs department for several months in 2003."&lt;ref name="civil.ge"/&gt;

In the [[Georgian local elections, 2014|2014 local elections]], the [[Georgian Dream]] coalition, including the Republican Party, gained 50.80%; they have been leading the government since 2012. The UNM gained a nationwide party-list vote in 2014 of 22.41%. [[Nino Burjanadze]] and her [[Democratic Movement – United Georgia|United Opposition]] coalition gained the third best results in the local elections, with nationwide 10.22% in the party-list vote.&lt;ref name="civil.ge"/&gt; Burjanadze revived a Eurasianist rhetoric, which is supported by Russia, and the campaign was "fueled by massive influxes of what was likely Russian money."&lt;ref name="cecire3.15"/&gt;

The Alliance of Patriots of Georgia party received 4.7% of the aggregate vote, meeting the required threshold of 4% to qualify as a political party, and making it eligible for future state funding for elections. It ran in a party-list contest for proportional Sakrebulo seats in 47 of a total of 71 municipalities and cities. In 30 jurisdictions, its party-list voting exceeded 4%, making it eligible for seats on 30 local councils, including that of [[Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name="civil.ge"&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27395 "Local Elections Boost Alliance of Patriots’ Ambitions for Parliamentary Polls"], ''Civil Georgia,'' 21 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lansford (2015) ''Political Handbook of the World 2015'', CQ Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Inashvili finished fourth in the mayoral election in [[Tbilisi]] with 5.4% of the vote; the party won two seats in the [[Tbilisi City Assembly]]. In addition, Alliance of Patriots of Georgia mayoral candidates qualified for run-off elections against [[Georgian Dream]] (GD) candidates in the cities of [[Poti]] and [[Ozurgeti]]; and Alliance candidates qualified for second-round runoffs for municipal executives in the municipalities of [[Lanchkhuti]] and [[Khulo]].&lt;ref name="civil.ge"/&gt;

'''''America Right or Wrong: An Anatomy of American Nationalism''''' is a 2012 book by the British author and academic [[Anatol Lieven]]. A separate, earlier version was published in 2004.

==Synopsis==
The book investigates the [[far-right]] in American politics, the radicalisation of the [[Republican Party (US)|Republican Party]] and the [[Tea Party movement]]. The book also discusses the concept of [[American exceptionalism]].

==Reception==
In ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' the book was described as 'intelligent and often provocative'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2005-03-01/america-right-or-wrong-anatomy-american-nationalism|title=America Right or Wrong: An Anatomy of American Nationalism|work=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst in ''[[The Guardian]]'' the book was praised by Martin Woollacott who wrote 'We should have seen it coming. All the signs were there in the 1990s - the mania about resisting outside influences, the narrow religious beliefs, the harking back to a golden age, the sense of being under threat from modernity, the readiness to use violent means. The roots of it went back centuries. But it took the attacks of 9/11 for us to realise how powerful was this burgeoning extremism....We are not, of course, talking here about Islam or about al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden, but about America. It is Anatol Lieven's contention in this illuminating book that Bin Laden's assault on the United States stripped away many of the remaining restraints on the intolerant, irrational, and self-destructive side of American nationalism. Whether this nationalism is a greater problem than that represented by Islamic extremism is a moot point, but it is clear that the combination of the two could bring disaster on us all'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/13/highereducation.news1|title=Review: America, Right or Wrong by Anatol Lieven|author=Martin Woollacott|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' the work was praised as 'fascinating and incisive...a compelling argument'.

After feasibility studies projected that the park would be a boon to the state's tourism industry, the Ark Encounter received tax incentives from the city, county, and state to induce its construction. This drew criticism from groups concerned with the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name=loftus&gt;{{cite web | last1=Loftus | first1=Tom | title=Ark Park Tax Incentives Worth Up to $18M Approved | url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-governor/2016/04/26/ark-park-tax-incentives-worth-up-18m-approved/83540204/ | date=April 26, 2016 | work=[[Courier-Journal]] | accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dispute over AiG's hiring practices was adjudicated in U.S. federal court, which found in 2016 that the organization could require Ark Encounter employees to sign a statement of faith as a condition of their employment, prompting criticism of the park's discriminatory hiring practices.&lt;ref name=WKYT/&gt;

===Planning===
On December 1, 2010, the [[young Earth creationism]] group [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG) and the for-profit corporation Ark Encounter, LLC announced that they would partner to build a [[amusement park|theme park]] called Ark Encounter that, as they claimed, would "lend credence to the biblical account of a catastrophic flood and to dispel doubts that Noah could have fit two of every kind of animal onto a 500-foot-long ark".&lt;ref name=arkannounce&gt;{{cite news |last=Alford |first=Roger |title=Full-scale replica of Noah's Ark planned in Kentucky |agency=The Associated Press News Service |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 3, 2010 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-12-05-noahs-ark-kentucky-creation-museum_N.htm  |accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partners projected that the fully completed park would cost $150 million, which they intended to raise privately.&lt;ref name=wistv&gt;{{cite web |title=Plans announced for 'Noah's Ark' attraction in NKY |publisher=WISTV |date=November 30, 2010 |url=http://www.wistv.com/story/13589609/religious-themed-amusement?clienttype=printable |accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]], an organization that advocates for the [[separation of church and state]], sent letters to over 1,000 public school districts in [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]] and [[West Virginia]] warning them not to organize field trips to the Ark Encounter, arguing that such trips would "expose children to religious proselytizing in violation of the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|constitutional separation of church and state]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/education/article89061842.html|title=Public schools warned about taking field trips to Noah's Ark park|author=|date=|work=[[kentucky.com]]|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/education/school-groups-warned-against-visiting-noahs-ark-attraction-in-northern-kentucky|title=Noah's Ark, Ark Encounter, Answers in Genesis: Public schools warned against visiting Noah's ark attraction in N.

===Subsequent events===
The Tri-State Freethinkers has protested annually at the Ark Encounter on the anniversary of its opening, citing its hiring practices, anti-evolution teachings, and acceptance of state tax incentives as causes for protestors' concerns.&lt;ref name=protests&gt;{{cite news |title=Protesters gather at Ark Encounter on anniversary |newspaper=Grant County News and Express |date=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local media coverage estimated the size of the 2018 protest to be between 120 and 200 people.&lt;ref name=protests /&gt;

AiG initially predicted yearly attendance for the attraction of 1.4-2.2 million people.

==Tax incentives controversies==
Organizations dedicated to supporting the [[separation of church and state]] were divided on the question of providing tax incentives for the Ark Encounter. [[Barry W. Lynn]] of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] opined that "The government should not be giving tax incentives for religious projects. Religion should be supported by voluntary donations, not the government."&lt;ref name=arkannounce /&gt; Bill Sharp, the staff attorney for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Kentucky, countered that "Courts have found that giving such tax exemptions on a nondiscriminatory basis does not violate the establishment clause, even when the tax exemption goes to a religious purpose."&lt;ref name=arkannounce /&gt; [[Edwin Kagin]] of [[American Atheists]] brought up the difficulty of litigating against the incentives provided by state laws, saying, "The legislation is so drafted that they will give this incentive to any organization that is going to increase tourism in Kentucky, and there's no question whatsoever that this group will."&lt;ref name=prove /&gt; The editorial board of the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' wrote that "Ark Encounters [sic] is a private company seeking to make a profit off of a biblical theme. As such, it seems as entitled to apply for incentives from promised profits as any other private, for-profit company in Kentucky."&lt;ref name=lhlcritique&gt;{{cite news |title=Embracing the Ark Incentives mean cheap jobs, poor state image |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the board was critical of using the incentives to attract low-paying jobs and to facilitate construction of an attraction it characterized as hostile "to science, knowledge and education", which could be off-putting to "the kind of employers that will provide good-paying jobs with a future".&lt;ref name=lhlcritique /&gt;

Governor Beshear favored the incentives, stating "The people of Kentucky didn't elect me governor to debate religion. They elected me governor to create jobs," Beshear said, adding, "There's nothing even remotely unconstitutional about a for-profit organization coming in and investing $150 million to create jobs in Kentucky and bring tourism to Kentucky."&lt;ref name=arkannounce /&gt; Responding to an [[Freedom of information in the United States|open records]] request by the ''Lexington Herald-Leader'', Beshear's office later admitted it had not seen the feasibility study cited in its press release, and an administration representative said that the state tourism department would have to conduct its own study in order for the park to be eligible for the incentives.&lt;ref name=feasibility /&gt; The state-commissioned study by Hunden Strategic Partners and paid for by Ark Encounter, LLC, projected that the park would draw nearly 1.4 million visitors a year, but could require the state to widen the Interstate 75 interchange at Williamstown, at an additional cost to the state of about $11 million.&lt;ref name="Hansel"&gt;{{cite news

In June 2017, Grant County [[County Judge/Executive|Judge Executive]] Stephen P. Wood told the ''Lexington Herald-Leader'' that the tax incentives offered to the Ark Encounter were "a really bad deal for taxpayers".&lt;ref name=trickle&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackford |first=Linda |title=Town expected flood of business after Noah’s Ark opened.

In April 2017, the city of Williamstown implemented a "safety assessment" of 50 cents per ticket sold at the Ark Encounter, the Williamstown Family Fun Park, and Main Street Gardens to upgrade the city's emergency equipment to sufficiently serve the attractions.&lt;ref name=exemption&gt;{{cite news |title=Williamstown plans to reject Noah’s Ark tax exemption request |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=June 29, 2017 |url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article158790694.html |accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AiG maintained that, as the largest of the three attractions, the assessment placed an undue share of the cost on Ark Encounter.&lt;ref name=willpay&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackford |first=Linda |title=After months of disagreement, Noah’s Ark operators say they will pay safety tax |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=July 25, 2017 |url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article163514158.html |accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Williamstown officials rejected AiG's request to cap its share of the cost, first at $350,000 and later at $500,000, Ark Encounter LLC sold the main parcel of land for the attraction to its non-profit affiliate, Crosswater Canyon, for $10 and requested an exemption from the fee based on their status as a religious entity.&lt;ref name=willpay /&gt;&lt;ref name=requestsexemption&gt;{{cite news |title=Ark Encounter requests safety fee exemption |newspaper=Grant County News |date=June 28, 2017 |url=http://www.grantky.com/content/ark-encounter-requests-safety-fee-exemption |accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; County officials rejected that request.&lt;ref name=willpay /&gt;

On July 18, 2017, the state of Kentucky notified Ark Encounter that the sale of the property to Crosswater Canyon put them in breach of their agreement for $18 million in tax incentives.&lt;ref name=transferback&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackford |first=Linda |title=After state suspends tax break, Noah’s Ark park transfers land back to for-profit entity |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=July 24, 2017 |url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article163349603.html |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Crosswater Canyon reversed the sale, transferring the land back to Ark Encounter, LLC for $10.&lt;ref name=transferback /&gt; On July 25, Ark Encounter said they would pay the safety assessment and had been collecting it on tickets sold beginning July 1.&lt;ref name=willpay /&gt; In a public statement, AiG spokesman Mark Looy said, "The filing for an exemption as a religious non-profit (as permitted in the ordinance), was done in an attempt to get the county to change the wording as it currently stands, which would exempt the Ark Encounter. It was not to avoid paying its fair share, as some articles have suggested."&lt;ref name=willpay /&gt; AiG gave no official explanation for the transfer of land to or from Crosswater Canyon, which Williamstown officials had feared could be an attempt to avoid paying property taxes.&lt;ref name=transferback /&gt;&lt;ref name=willpay /&gt; The ''[[Grant County News and Express]]'' reported in December 2017 that the safety assessment had generated approximately $213,000 for the city in four months, with less than $500 of that amount being paid by attractions other than Ark Encounter.&lt;ref name=4months&gt;{{cite news |title=Grant County News and Express |newspaper=Grant County News and Express |date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first year of operation, Ark Encounter generated over $2.28 million in sales taxes for the state of Kentucky, a figure which excluded the period during which the attraction was owned by Crosswater Canyon.&lt;ref name=year1rebate&gt;{{cite news |last=Blackford |first=Linda |title=Noah's Ark theme park getting $1.8 million state tax rebate after first year |newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=September 7, 2017 |url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/state/article171736687.html |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ark Encounter received a rebate of $1.8 million of the collected taxes, the maximum amount allowed for the year under terms of its agreement with the state.&lt;ref name=year1rebate /&gt;

[[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]] petitioned the Kentucky Tourism Development Finance Authority in August 2014 to withdraw its preliminary approval of tax incentives for the Ark Encounter because of AiG's hiring practices, which required all applicants to profess Christianity and sign a statement of faith attesting to their beliefs in [[young Earth creationism]] and that homosexuality is sinful among other requirements.&lt;ref name=aupetition&gt;{{cite news |title=Group opposes tax incentives for Noah's Ark park |agency=Associated Press State Wire |date=August 23, 2014|url=http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/Group-opposes-tax-incentives-for-Noahs-Ark-park-272415671.html|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Costello |first=Carol |title=Kentucky's magnificent, controversial ark |publisher=CNN |date=June 21, 2016 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/21/opinions/kentucky-ark-costello/index.html |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zovath countered that the Ark Encounter's hiring policies had not been written yet and that the hiring policies of AiG should not be a factor because Ark Encounter, LLC was the entity receiving the incentives.&lt;ref name=aupetition /&gt; In response to Americans United's petition, a spokesman for the Kentucky Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet said, "As a condition of any incentive program, all projects must follow all state and federal laws, including all laws related to hiring."&lt;ref name=aupetition /&gt; Following Americans United's petition, the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' editorial board also called for the incentives to be rescinded.&lt;ref name=lhlrescind&gt;{{cite news

The '''Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act, 1946''' (Act No. 28 of 1946; subsequently renamed the '''Asiatic Land Tenure Act, 1946''', and also known as the "Ghetto Act") of South Africa sought to confine Asian ownership and occupation of land to certain clearly defined areas of towns. The Act also prohibited Asians from owning or occupying property without a permit when such property had not been owned or occupied by Asians before 1946.

Furthermore, it granted Indians in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and [[Natal Province|Natal]] the right to elect Whites to represent them in [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] and for Natal Indians to represent themselves in the [[Natal Provincial Council]].

The Act deprived the Asian South Africans of communal representation and took away their fundamental and elementary right of land ownership and occupation. It is called and regarded universally by Indian people as the "Ghetto Act".

The act struck at the heart of Indian commercial and economic life. Not only did it intend to reduce the levels of Indian trade and reduce progress in the acquisition of fixed property, it also is thought to have reduced the opportunities of the masses of the Indian people to earn a decent living and ultimately condemn them to existence in increasingly over-crowded slums and locations. Thus on 31 March 1948, it is thought that about 6,000 Indians marched in protest to the Act in [[Durban]], South Africa.

The sections of the act granting representation in Parliament and the provincial council were repealed by the [[Asiatic Laws Amendment Act, 1948]]. The rest of the act was repealed by the [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991]].

The '''Azerbaijan Democratic Party''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Demokrat Firqəsi}}; {{lang-fa|فرقه دموکرات آذربایجان|Ferqa-ye demokrāt-e Āḏarbāyjān}}) was a [[communist party]] supported by the [[Soviet Union]] and founded by [[Jafar Pishevari]] in [[Tabriz]], Iran, in September 1945. ADP was founded as an opposition [[political party|party]] against the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. Soviet-supported [[Tudeh party]] dissolved its Azerbaijan chapter and ordered its members to join ADP.&lt;ref&gt;Iran in claws of the bear, The failed Soviet landgrab of 1946 , Farhad Tale, iUniverse books, 2007, {{ISBN|0-595-41345-5}},p19&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{about|a derogatory slur used against the [[Bengali Hindus]] in [[Assam]]|the [[Bengali Hindu]] social sub-group of eastern [[Bengal]] origin|Bangal}}
{{For|the urban ethnic quip used to denote [[Bengali Hindus]] in [[India]]|Bong (term)}}

'''Bongal''' (Bongya) is a derogatory slur used to refer to the [[Bengali Hindus]] in [[Assam]]. The [[Bengalis]] who had settled in Assam during the British period when they were brought in from neighbouring [[Bengal]] province to work in and maintain the newly formed British administration or those who migrated from [[East Pakistan]] (present Bangladesh) as refugees in the wake of the [[Partition of India]] and their descendants are collectively referred to as Bongals. The Bengali speaking Muslims from eastern Pakistan (immigrants before 1971, infiltrators thereafter), on the other hand, are called [[Na Asamiya]] (meaning 'New Assamese') due to their cultural and linguistic assimilation with the Assamese Hindus and Muslims. The term lent the name to the infamous [[Bongal Kheda]] movement of the 1950s and 1960s which resulted in an ethnic cleansing of [[Bengali Hindus]] from the Brahmaputra valley in Assam. During the colonial days, the term referred to anyone who was perceived as a foreigner (a non-Assamese Indian citizen from the 'mainland'). Later on however, it meant exclusively the [[Bengali Hindus]].

== History ==
{{Persecution of Bengali Hindus}}
The term may have been derived from 'Bangala', the name of the [[Mughal Bengal|Mughal province of Bengal]]. Initially the term might have stood for the people of Bengal, but later it is said to have stood for any foreigner.&lt;ref name="fishmanetal244"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Fishman|editor-first1=Joshua|editor-last2=Garcia|editor-first2=Ofelia|title=Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity: The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUydX_3rG0AC|volume=2|date=6 March 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199837991|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its geographic location, the approach to the [[Ahom kingdom]] from mainland India was through Bengal.&lt;ref name="fishmanetal244"/&gt; During the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom rule]] the word was used in a derogatory manner for foreigners and invaders.&lt;ref name=das2014&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Das|first=Bitasta|date=4 January 2014|title=Unravelling Ethnic Tensions: Colonialism, Post colonialism and the Question of Identity in Assam|type=PhD|chapter=Chapter 4: Assam Movement, ULFA and Bodo Movement Locating the “Ethnic” in the Assertions|publisher=Manipal University|page=185|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/33043/14/14_chapter%204.pdf|access-date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahom general [[Lachit Borphukan]] is said to have referred to the Mughals as Bongals.&lt;ref name="assam.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assam.org/node/2366|title=Lachit Borphukon|last=Barua|first=Ajit|work=Assam Portal|publisher=assam.org|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over years of political seclusion, 'Bongal' became a term of suspicion, reproach and contempt.&lt;ref name="fishmanetal244"/&gt; When the [[United Kingdom|British]] annexed Ahom kingdom to its Indian territories, many [[Bengali Hindus]] arrived in Assam by taking up administrative jobs in the government. The Britishers and the Bengali Hindus alike were referred to as Bongals. The Assamese people viewed Bongal was someone who didn't belong Assam, an intruder whose presence threatened to marginalize them socially and politically.&lt;ref name=das2014/&gt; The Britishers were called Boga Bongal, literally meaning 'the white foreigner'&lt;ref name=das2014/&gt; and the Bengali Hindus were called 'Kola Bongal' literally meaning 'the black foreigner'.&lt;ref name="bareh92"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bareh|first=Hamlet|title=Encyclopaedia of North-East India: Assam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=odY_PWn7pesC|edition=Reprint|year=2001|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170997894|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century Assamese intellectual discourse, anyone other than the people of Assam or the Hill tribes were called Bongals. They were described to be foreigners, uncivilized and filthy. An 1872 [[Assamese language|Assamese]] play by Rudra Ram Bordoloi titled 'Bongal Bongalini' lampooned the social problems created by the outsiders i.e. the Bongals, especially who came during the British rule.&lt;ref name="pathak2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pathak|first=Namrata|title=Trends in Contemporary Assamese Theatre|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VLwYCAAAQBAJ|accessdate=19 October 2018|date=27 March 2015|publisher=Partridge Publishing|isbn=9781482846546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assamese women who preferred to marry the Bongals, referred to as 'Bongalini's (feminine of Bongal), were described as promiscuous women and concubines of the Bongals.&lt;ref name="pathak2015"/&gt;

After the [[Indian independence movement|Independence]], the term continued to be used for the [[Bengali Hindus]]. However, it was not used for the Bengalis only. In a broader sense, it was used to refer to any group that was perceived to be an outsider.&lt;ref name="ew30071960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chakravarti|first=K.C.|date=30 July 1960|title=Bongal Kheda Again|journal=The Economic Weekly|publisher=Sameeksha Trust|location=Mumbai|pages=1193–95|issn=0012-9976|url=http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1960_12/31/assam_disturbances_ibongal_kheda_again.pdf|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[West Bengal]] was described as ''Bongal Desh'', literally meaning 'the land of the Bongals' in [[Assamese language|Assamese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutta|first=Nandana|title=Questions of Identity in Assam: Location, Migration, Hybridity|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tOmICwAAQBAJ|accessdate=1 August 2017|date=11 September 2012|publisher=SAGE Publications India|isbn=9788132117001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bongal Kheda ==
{{Main|Bongal Kheda}}
In the colonial period, the Bengali Hindus dominated the white collar profession in Assam. This was resented by the Assamese population. After the independence, the Assamese political leadership promoted the concept of Assam for Assamese. Assamese was to be the sole official language of the state. No other non-Assamese group in Assam posed a direct challenge to the emerging Assamese middle class in the white collar profession than the Bengali Hindus. The selection of a Bengali Hindu as the chief of the oil refinery by the administration was a graphic example. Due to their advanced educational qualifications, the Bengali Hindus were preferred to any other group for the white collar jobs by the government.  The resentment led to an organized campaign called 'Bongal Kheda', literally meaning 'drive away the Bongals', which resulted in [[ethnic cleansing]] of [[Bengali Hindus]] from parts of Assam.&lt;ref name="horowitz209-210"&gt;{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Donald L.|title=The Deadly Ethnic Riot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwA1aaB2WGgC|accessdate=5 September 2009|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520224476}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ethnic cleansing]] started in the early 1960s continued through the sixties into the seventies and eighties. In the seventies it spread to [[Meghalaya]] and [[Tripura]].

From [[Indian independence movement|independence]] in 1947 to 1965, the protection of India's international boundaries was the responsibility of local police belonging to each border state, with little inter-state coordination. BSF was created as a Central government-controlled security force to guard all of India's borders, thus bringing greater cohesion in border security. BSF is charged with guarding India's land border during peacetime and preventing transnational crime. It is a Union Government Agency under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.

== Formation ==
During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], the border management system was in the hands of the individual state police forces, and these proved incapable of properly dealing with border threats. Following these episodes, the government created the Border Security Force as a unified central agency with the specific mandate of guarding India's international boundaries. [[K F Rustamji]], from the Indian Police Service, was the first Director General of BSF. Till 1965 India’s borders with Pakistan were manned by the State Armed Police Battalion. Pakistan attacked Sardar Post, Chhar Bet, and Beria Bet on 9 April 1965 in Kutch. This exposed the inadequacy of the State Armed Police to cope with armed aggression due to which the Government of India felt the need for a specialized centrally controlled Border Security Force, which would be armed and trained to man the International Border with Pakistan. As a result of the recommendations of the Committee of Secretaries, the Border Security Force came into existence on 1 Dec 1965 with K F Rustamji as its first Director General.&lt;ref name="bsf.nic.in1"/&gt;

The BSF's capabilities were used in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] against [[Pakistani Armed Forces|Pakistani forces]] in areas where the [[Military of India|Regular Forces]] were thinly spread; BSF troops took part in several operations including the famous [[Battle of Longewala]]. In fact, for BSF the war on eastern front had started well before the war actually broke out in Dec '71. BSF had trained, supported and formed part of "[[Mukti Bahini]]" and had entered erstwhile East Pakistan before the actual hostilities broke out. BSF had played a very important role in [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation of Bangladesh]] which [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Sheikh Mujibur Rehman]] had also acknowledged.

The BSF, long considered a male bastion, has now deployed its first batch of women personnel at the border to carry out regular frisking of women as well as other duties performed by their male counterparts, including guarding the border. Over 100 women have been deployed on the highly volatile [[Indo-Pakistani border|Indo-Pak border]], while around 60 will be deployed on the [[India–Bangladesh border|Indo-Bangla border]]. In total, 595 women constables will be deployed on the border in different phases.

== Wagah Border Flag Lowering Ceremony ==
[[File:Wagah border indian bsf.jpg|thumb|BSF at [[Wagah]]]]
{{Main|Wagah border ceremony}}
Every evening, at the [[Wagah]] border, which is the international border of India and Pakistan, the BSF together with the neighbouring country's border guarding, the [[Pakistan Rangers]] conduct a military drill while lowering the respective national flags. This attracts a good number of spectators from both countries, as well as international tourists. Similar parades are being organised at Mahavir/Sadqi border near Fazilka and Hussainiwala/Gandasinghwala border near Firozpur.

== Counter-Insurgency Operations ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
Although originally charged with guarding India's external boundaries, the BSF has more recently been given the task in [[counter-insurgency]] and [[counter-terrorism]] operations in Jammu And Kashmir, Punjab, North East. While in Punjab BSF took Part in operations like Blue Star, Black Thunder 1 &amp; 2 till 1989 and when the [[insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir]] broke out in 1989, the BSF handover the Counter Insurgency Operations to CRPF and Punjab Police and moved towards state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. In [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state police and the thinly-deployed [[Central Reserve Police Force]] (CRPF) struggled to cope up with the spiraling violence, and the Indian government deployed the BSF to [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to combat [[separatist militants]].

The BSF initially suffered casualties from insurgent attacks but later saw successes, including the arrest of militant leaders, after setting up an [[intelligence]] network and working with local civilians. BSF contribution in reducing militancy in J&amp;K is widely acknowledged. The BSF killed Ghazi Baba—chief of [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]] and the mastermind of the [[2001 Indian Parliament attack]]—in August 2003 along with his deputy commander. The BSF raided Baba's hideout in [[Srinagar]] and he was killed in the ensuing gun battle along with his deputy chief.

Despite the BSF's success in a counter-terrorism role, many in the government felt that this additional burden was leading to a dilution of the BSF's mandate and degrading the force's ability to perform its primary role of guarding the country's borders. In 2006 the Indian government has decided to implement recommendations to restrict each security agency to its mandate. Thus the 16 BSF battalions in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] are gradually being withdrawn from counter-insurgency duties and diverted back to guard the [[Indo-Pakistani border|Indo-Pak border]]. They are being replaced by fresh units from the [[Central Reserve Police Force|CRPF]] that have undergone specialised training in [[counter-terrorism]]. But the CRPF is yet to take over sensitive places like Tral. The 16 battalions being withdrawn from J&amp;K were supposed to provide [[R&amp;R (military)|R&amp;R]] to the battalions already deployed on the border. But with increasing Naxal violence in Central India, the government decided to diversify the Anti-Naxal operation with the induction of ITBP and BSF. BSF was deployed in Kanker district of Chhattisgarh, where Naxal strength is comparatively thinner than that of other parts of Bastar region. At present total 15 battalions of BSF are stationed in different parts of Kanker district to combat the Naxal menace.

[[File: Wagah Border Crossing Guards.JPG|thumb| Border personnel from both countries, during the Wagah Border ceremony.]]

The Border Security Force has its Headquarters at New Delhi and is known as Force Headquarters (FHQ) headed by a Director General. Various Directorates like Operations, Communications &amp; IT, Training, Engineering, General, Law, Provisioning, Administration, Personnel, Armaments, Medical, Finance etc. function under the DG. Each Directorate is headed by an IG. The Eastern Theatre is looked after by Spl DG HQ at Kolkata and the Western Theatre is looked after by Spl DG HQ at Chandigarh. Field Formations in BSF are headed by an IG and are known as Frontiers Headquarters (FtrHQ). There is 10 such Frontier under which Sector Headquarters (SHQ) function headed by a DIG each. There are 31 such Sectors. Each SHQ has under its command 4–5 Duty Battalions. Presently 186 Battalions are sanctioned to BSF. Five major training institutions and 10 Subsidiary Training Centres (STCs) are imparting ab-initio as well as in-service training to its ranks and other CPOs/SPOs including IPS Probationers.

BSF is the only Central Armed Police force to have its own Air Wing, Marine Wing and artillery regiments, which support the General Duty Battalions in their operations. The Financial Adviser of the BSF has been an [[Indian Revenue Service]] officer of the rank of Joint Secretary and also has Dy Advisers from the Indian Audit and Accounts Service and Indian Civil Account Service.

The BSF also has a national level school for breeding and training of dogs. Dogs from other CPOs and State Police are sent to National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD) to be trained in infantry patrol, detection of explosives, tracking and the like.

The BSF maintains a Tear Smoke Unit (TSU), which is unique in India. The TSU is responsible for producing tear gas munitions required for the Anti-Riot Forces. It also exports a substantial quantity to other countries.

Three battalions of the BSF, located at Kolkata, Guwahati, and Patna, are designated as the [[National Disaster Response Force]] (NDRF). Each battalion maintains 18 self-contained specialist search and rescue teams of 45 personnel each, including engineers, technicians, electricians, dog squads and medics and paramedics. The establishment of each battalion is 1,158 personnel. The NDRF is a multi-disciplinary, multi-skilled, high-tech force for all types of disasters and can deploy to disasters by air, sea, and land. The battalions are equipped and trained for all natural disasters including combating Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) disasters.

== BSF's role during peacetime ==
* To promote a sense of security among the people living in the border areas.
* To prevent trans-border crimes, unauthorized entry into or exit from the territory of India.
* To prevent smuggling and any other illegal activities on the Border.
* Anti-infiltration duties.
* To collect trans-border intelligence.

BSF is largely employed for Internal Security Duties and other law and order duties on the requisition of the State Government. Being a Central Armed Police Force it can be entrusted with policing duties at any place apart from its mandate.
&lt;ref name="India 2013"&gt;Page no. 636 &amp; 637 of Chapter 20 India 2013 published by Publications Division of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India&lt;/ref&gt;

== BSF's role during war time ==
* Holding ground in assigned sectors.
* Limited aggressive action against irregular forces of the enemy (Though in 1971 war, several instances of battle with regular Army of Pakistan are also there. In Hot War Scenario, one has to fight whoever is pitched against you, regular or irregular.) 
* Maintenance of Law and Order in enemy territory administered under the Army's control.
* Guarding of Prisoners of War camps.
* Acting as guides to the Army in border areas.
* Assistance in control of refugees.
* Provision of escorts.
* Performing special tasks connected with intelligence including raids.&lt;ref name="India 2013"/&gt;

== Guarding Myanmar (Burma) Border ==
The [[Cabinet Committee on Security]] (CCS) is considering a proposal to entrust the border-guarding duty along the Indo-Myanmar border to the Border Security Force (BSF). Presently, the {{convert|1,640|km}} Indo-Myanmar border is being guarded by [[Assam Rifles]].

The proposed move to guard the Indo-Myanmar border follows a proposal from the BSF to take over the role by raising 45 new battalions, one headquarters of additional director general, four frontier headquarters to be headed by an IG rank official and 12 sector headquarters to be headed by DIG level officials.
But the recent rise in Insurgent Activities on Indo-Myanmar Border has forced the Government of India to delay a Border Guarding Force like BSF on Indo-Myanmar Border.
As of 1 March 2015, it was decided by the Ministry of Home Affairs to keep the authority of this border with Assam Rifles only.

=== Elite Commando Force of Border Security Force ===
Creek Crocodile Commando are the elite commando force of BSF. It is Rann of Kutch (an extensive salt marsh of western India and southeast Pakistan between the Gulf of Kutch and the Indus River delta. It was the scene of major border disputes in 1965 and 1971).
Creek (Gujarat): In order to thwart landing of terrorists through the sea route, BSF has formed its first commando unit—Creek Crocodiles—to man the hostile creek area where India shares a border with Pakistan.

Creeks are a very hostile terrain, constituting numerous raised grounds having mangroves and a network of water channels which are quite shallow where all movements are tide dependent.

"Creek Crocodiles are trained to thwart any evil designs from across the border", BSF commandant Pushpendra Singh Rathore, who had created and trained the commando unit at [[Koteshwar, Kutch|Koteshwar]] outpost of BSF, said.

"We have kept three things in mind while selecting cadets for the commando including swimming and marine diving performance, firing abilities and endurance to work in the rough creek,".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Crocodile units have 42 commandos at present{{When|date=December 2012}} and they are undergoing vigorous training, he said.

=== Mine Protected Vehicles ===
According to the senior BSF officer, some MPVs have already been introduced in a number of BSF units along the border and more MPVs to be added in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-18/guwahati/28377774_1_border-outposts-bops-bangladesh-border | work=The Times of India | title=Choppers, anti-mine vehicles new teeth for BSF | date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversy ==

=== Condemnation by Canada ===
In 2010, some Canadian visa officials rejected the immigration application of a retired BSF soldier Fateh Singh Pandher, terming BSF a ''"notoriously violent paramilitary unit engaged in systematic attacks on civilians and responsible for torturing suspected criminals"''. This accusation did not go down well with the Indian government. The Indian External Affairs Ministry was asked by the Home minister to take up the issue with Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Canada-calls-BSF-a-violent-paramilitary-unit/H1-Article1-546685.aspx |title=Canada calls BSF a 'violent paramilitary unit' |date=21 May 2010 |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |accessdate=21 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524052010/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Canada-calls-BSF-a-violent-paramilitary-unit/H1-Article1-546685.aspx |archivedate=24 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Terming-BSF-notoriously-violent-Canada-rejects-ex-constables-visa/article16303160.ece|title=Terming BSF|first=Vinay|last=Kumar|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008160348/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Terming-BSF-notoriously-violent-Canada-rejects-ex-constables-visa/article16303160.ece|archivedate=8 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Home ministry of India, as well as the Indian public in general and several of India's political parties, expressed outrage at this attack and called Canada's actions [[Indophobia|discriminatory]] and spurious, and their charges against the BSF as baseless and unproven.

Following complaints made by the Indian government and criticism of Canada's actions against India, the [[Harper government]] retracted their earlier accusations against BSF security officials. Canada's Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, [[Jason Kenney]], Termed as "unfortunate" the incidents involving use of ''"foul language by the [[Canadian High Commission]] in [[visa (document)|visa]] rejection letters to some individuals"'', Kenney said, ''"This language, or the inaccurate impression it has created, in no way reflects the policy or position of the [[Government of Canada]]."''&lt;ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh border killings ===
According to the Bangladeshi government, 136 civilians were killed and a further 170 others suffered injuries in 2009. The Indian government has said that 67 were killed and 80 injured in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=179091|title=BSF killed 136 Bangladeshis since 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangladesh government and Bangladeshi organizations protested heavily against these alleged killings. Media reports claim that in August 2008, Indian BSF officials admitted that they killed 59 persons (34 Bangladeshis, 21 Indians, rest unidentified) who were trying to cross the border illegally during the prior six months.&lt;ref name="bsf killing"&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-35156020080824 India says 59 killed over last six months on Bangladesh border] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026110404/http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-35156020080824 |date=26 October 2008 }}, Reuters, 24 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian media claimed that, in 2001, [[Border Guards Bangladesh|Bangladeshi Border Force]] kidnapped and murdered 16 BSF personnel because they chased some Bangladeshi goons back to Bangladesh.

In July 2009 [[Channel 4 News]] reported that apparently "hundreds" of Bangladeshis and Indians are indiscriminately killed by the BSF along the [[Indo-Bangladeshi Barrier]]. The BSF claims that the barrier's main purpose is to check [[Illegal immigration in India|illegal immigration to India]], and prevent [[Terrorism in India|cross-border terrorism]] from [[Islamist]]s.&lt;ref name="India-Bangladesh 'security' fence"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/indiabangladesh+apossecurityapos+fence/3281357|title=Channel 4 News|date=24 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228183555/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/international_politics/indiabangladesh+apossecurityapos+fence/3281357|archivedate=28 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
    
Bangladeshi media accused the BSF of abducting 5 Bangladeshi children, aged between 8 and 15, from the [[Haripur Upazila]] in [[Thakurgaon District]] of Bangladesh, in 2010. The children were setting fishing nets near the border.&lt;ref name="dstar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=148029|title=BSF abducts 5 children from border|date=24 July 2010|newspaper=The Daily Star|accessdate=24 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726180826/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=148029|archivedate=26 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
    
In 2010, [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) issued an 81-page report which alleged "over 900 of abuses by the BSF" in the first decade of the 21st century. The report was compiled from interviews with victims of BSF shootings, witnesses and members of the BSF and its [[Border Guards Bangladesh|Bangladeshi counterpart]]. According to HRW, while most of them were killed when they crossed into Indian territory for indulging in [[cattle raiding]] or other [[smuggling]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/12/06/indiabangladesh-indiscriminate-killings-abuse-border-officers|title=India/Bangladesh: Indiscriminate Killings, Abuse by Border Officers|work=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=21 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123104243/http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/12/06/indiabangladesh-indiscriminate-killings-abuse-border-officers|archivedate=23 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the BSF website was hacked by Bangladeshi hackers in retaliation. The hackers later shared the news in the internet and also in the other social sites where they claimed to have defaced the sites asking the BSF to stop killing Bangladeshis at border. The site became normal sometime on 15 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-15/india/31062663_1_pakistani-hackers-indian-websites-indian-hackers|title=Bangladesh group hacks BSF website to 'avenge border killings' - The Times of India|date=15 February 2012|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/20000-indian-websites-come-under-attack-bangladesh-hackers-999 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229224318/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/20000-indian-websites-come-under-attack-bangladesh-hackers-999 |archivedate=29 February 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111040807/http://www.amardeshonline.com/pages/details/2013/01/02/180831#.UOYNVORLWX11|archivedate=11 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amardeshonline.com/pages/details/2013/01/03/181008#.UOYN4ORLWX0|title=বেপরোয়া বিএসএফ : ২৪ ঘণ্টার ব্যবধানে চাঁপাই সীমান্তে আরও দুই বাংলাদেশীকে হত্যা|publisher=আমার দেশ|accessdate=11 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111042741/http://www.amardeshonline.com/pages/details/2013/01/03/181008#.UOYN4ORLWX0|archivedate=11 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Association for Shooting and Conservation''' ('''BASC''') is a registered society under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, whose mission is to promote and protect sporting [[shooting]] and the well-being of the [[countryside]] throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and overseas. With a membership of over 150,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://basc.org.uk/blog/press-releases/latest-news/membership-hits-a-record-breaking-150000/|title=BASC {{!}} Membership hits a record-breaking 150,000|website=basc.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 110 staff BASC is the largest and best resourced country sports organisation in the UK. Its magazine "Shooting and Conservation" has the largest circulation of any shooting magazine in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.org.uk/product/16555|title=Shooting and Conservation - media information - ABC {{!}} Audit Bureau of Circulations|website=www.abc.org.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sporting shooting includes [[wildfowling]], [[Game (food)|game]], and rough shooting, [[deer stalking]], [[Shooting sports|target shooting and air gunning]], [[pigeon]] shooting and [[pest control]], [[gundog]]s and promoting practical habitat [[conservation ethic|conservation]]. BASC is also involved in the political representation of shooting - training and the setting of standards in shooting sports and the association undertakes research in its area of interest.

== History ==

=== WAGBI ===
BASC began as the '''Wildfowlers Association of Great Britain and Ireland''', (WAGBI) founded by Stanley Duncan, an engineer and gun shop owner from [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], in 1908. Duncan was a highly experienced wildfowler and naturalist who  feared for the future of wildfowling which was under threat from attempts to control the foreshore. He was also concerned to protect coastal habitats to preserve wildfowl and defend shooting from "protectionist" extremists wishing to ban the sport. The first president was [[Sir Ralph Frankland-Payne-Gallwey, 3rd Baronet|Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey]], a notable [[Edwardian]] shot and author of several books on shooting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/421758307|title=A sporting century : the history of the British Association for Shooting &amp; Conservation|last=Graham.|first=Downing,|date=2007|publisher=Quiller|isbn=9781846890260|location=Shrewsbury|oclc=421758307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan remained the secretary of WAGBI until 1946.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Duncan was also a member of the Zoological Society.&lt;ref name=Fieldsportschannel&gt;{{cite web|first=Fieldsports|last1= Channel|title=Shooting Politics, episode 13, 17th February 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eQh9w3gIM4&amp;feature|publisher=fieldsportschannel.tv|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his fowling expeditions Duncan stayed at the Black Hut on Patrington Haven on the [[Humber]]. Legend credits this as the place where WAGBI was founded and the hut became iconic to generations of fowlers. The truth is more prosaic. The first WAGBI meeting was held in an hotel in Hull. The Black hut was allegedly washed away by a big tide in 1969 but was more likely destroyed by a digger clearing the site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

WAGBI nearly died due to the losses sustained by its members during the world wars. By 1953 the association was in sufficiently good shape to mount a formidable defence of wildfowling against the Protection of Birds Bill which threatened to impose unnecessary and restrictive controls on the sport. WAGBI’s successful lobbying resulted in legislation that was far more balanced and which was dubbed by the sports' opponents as "The Wildfowlers’ Charter".&lt;ref name="basc.org.uk"&gt;http://basc.org.uk/about-basc/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this victory WAGBI appointed its first full-time director, a former naval officer and [[Liverpool]] businessman, Commander John Anderton, who summed up his agenda as "doing one’s best for something one likes – backed by the conviction that what one is doing is right."  Under Anderton WAGBI focused its efforts on raising standards among wildfowlers and establishing a network of wildfowling clubs to preserve local shooting and maintain records of wildfowl populations.

In 1975 the Gamekeepers Association merged with WAGBI and in 1977, the association was a founding member of [[Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU|FACE]] the federation for shooting sports in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== BASC ===
The association had always been inclusive and welcomed those who participated in other areas of shooting. In addition shooting had become more open with individuals pursuing several forms of the sport. The change of name to the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) was agreed at the Annual General Meeting in 1981 in recognition that shooting sports required a single representative body and that WAGBI was the most suitably placed organisation to take on the role.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Modern day ==

BASC is a representative body for shooting sports and is a registered society under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014. Each member has one share in the association. BASC is governed by a council elected from the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://basc.org.uk/about-basc/basc-constitution-and-objects/|title=BASC {{!}} BASC Council and Constitution and Objects|website=basc.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Council is advised by a series of committees for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, game shooting, deer stalking and wildfowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://basc.org.uk/about-basc/basc-constitution-and-objects/basc-constitution/|title=BASC {{!}} BASC constitution|website=basc.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; BASC has a membership of over 150,000.&lt;ref name="basc.org.uk"/&gt;

Marford Mill, the association’s headquarters was acquired in 1976. The property is a former water mill at [[Rossett]], in [[Wrexham County Borough|Wrexham]]. Among the collections held by BASC are several firearms of note such as Irish Tom, a punt gun of unusual length and bore and Colonel Hawker’s double punt gun.  
   
The association has country offices in [https://basc.org.uk/basc-scotland/ Scotland], [https://basc.org.uk/basc-wales/ Wales] and [https://basc.org.uk/northern-ireland/ Northern Ireland] as well as four English regional directors and their staff based in the [https://basc.org.uk/basc-north/ North], [https://basc.org.uk/central/ Central], the [https://basc.org.uk/basc-south-east/ South East] and the [https://basc.org.uk/basc-south-west/ South West].

While the main purpose of the association is the protection and promotion of country shooting and its associated conservation activities, members benefit from a range of services. These include £10 million of public liability insurance for country sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://basc.org.uk/join-basc/basc-members-insurance/|title=BASC {{!}} BASC Members Insurance|website=basc.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [https://basc.org.uk/wildfowling/wildfowling-permit-scheme/ wildfowling permit scheme], [https://basc.org.uk/deer-management/stalking-schemes/ deer stalking schemes] and the [http://goshooting.org.uk/ Goshooting] initiative that links those looking for a shooting opportunity with those providing them. Members also receive the benefit of advice from BASC’s expert staff on issues involving shooting and firearms certification and licensing, land management and gamekeeping.

Among BASC’s notable projects are Green Shoots, which links members to local biodiversity plans, Young Shots, which seeks to educate young people about field sports, and Taste of Game which promotes game meat. BASC is a signatory to the [http://www.codeofgoodshootingpractice.org.uk/ Code of Good Shooting Practice] and produces a series of codes of practice on aspects of shooting.

In politics BASC operates on an all-party basis and has scored notable recent victories in ensuring that shooting was not damaged by the [[Hunting Act 2004]], preserving the legal right for young people to continue to go shooting with airguns, where they have the permission of the landowner, and securing an exemption from the ban on the cosmetic docking of dogs tails for working gundogs. Currently all the major political parties in Britain are pledged to support shooting sports. BASC provides the secretariat for the All Party Parliamentary Group on Shooting and Conservation and, at the request of MPs, organises the annual Lords v. Commons clay pigeon shoot.

Over the years BASC has demonstrated a willingness to engage constructively with others from outside the sport such as [[Natural England]], the [[Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust]], and the [[RSPB]]. While this has been criticised by those who would prefer to demonise the opponents of shooting BASC has never wavered from the belief that it is better to win your opponent over to a constructive solution rather than engage in negative battles. {{POV statement|2=Neutrality|date=December 2012}}}

The patron of the association is [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], who has held the office since 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://basc.org.uk/blog/press-releases/latest-news/prince-philip-opens-bascs-communications-centre/&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Ali succeeded John Swift as chief executive of the association in 2013, a position he held until March 2017, when the association announced his dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://basc.org.uk/blog/press-releases/basc-chief-executive-dismissed-gross-misconduct/|title=BASC chief executive dismissed for gross misconduct - BASC website|last=|first=|date=2017-03-02|work=BASC|access-date=2017-03-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; BASC has announced that Ian Bell took over as chief executive in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://basc.org.uk/blog/press-releases/latest-news/basc-appoints-new-chief-executive/|title=BASC {{!}} BASC appoints new chief executive|website=basc.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BASC opposes attempts to ban the use of lead shot, despite the stance of its former chief executive, arguing that further restrictions do not have a robust evidence base and that compliance with the law and proper processing of game meat manages the risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://basc.org.uk/about-basc/basc-policies/basc-policy-on-lead-ammunition/|title=BASC {{!}} BASC Policy on Lead Ammunition|website=basc.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuvajmo bratstvo i jedinstvo kao zenicu oka svoga.jpg|thumb|"Let us protect brotherhood and unity like the pupil of our eye", inscription on a building in [[Mostar]] destroyed during the [[Yugoslav Wars]].]]
'''Brotherhood and Unity'''{{Cref2|a}} was a popular [[slogan]] of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] that was coined during the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War]] (1941–45), and which evolved into a guiding principle of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]'s post-war inter-ethnic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Mesic, Stipe. 2004. The Demise of Yugoslavia: A Political Memoir. Central European University Press. P. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; In Slovenia, the slogan "Brotherhood and Peace" ({{lang|sl|bratstvo i mir}}) was used in the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Slovenia and the Slovenes: A Small State in the New Europe |last=Gow |first=James |author2=Carmichael, Cathie |edition=Revised and updated |year=2010 |publisher=Hurst Publishers Ltd |isbn=978-1-85065-944-0 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] by Axis forces in April 1941, the occupying powers and their helpers sought to systematically incite hatred among the many national, ethnic and religious groups of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Communist Party successfully publicized the brotherhood and unity of Yugoslavia's [[nation]]s (''narodi'') and [[national minorities]] (''nacionalne manjine'', later renamed to ''narodnosti'') in their struggle against the fascist enemy and domestic collaborators. The decision of the second session of [[AVNOJ]] on the [[federalism|federalization]] of Yugoslavia in 1943 was regarded as the recognition of this Brotherhood and Unity principle.

After the war, the slogan designated the official [[policy]] of inter-ethnic relations in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], as embodied in its [[1963 Yugoslav Constitution|federal constitutions of 1963]] and [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|of 1974]]. The policy prescribed that Yugoslavia's nations ([[Serbs]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Croats]], [[Slovenes]], [[Montenegrins]], [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]]) and national minorities ([[Albanians]], [[Hungarians]], [[Romanians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Jews]], [[Italians]], and others) are equal groups that coexist peacefully in the federation, promoting their similarities and interdependence in order to overcome national conflicts and hatred. Every individual was entitled to the expression of their own culture, while the ethnic groups had an oath to one another to maintain peaceful relations.  Citizens were also encouraged and allowed to declare their nationality as Yugoslav, which usually polled at 10%. The policy also led to the adoption of national quota systems in all public institutions, including economic organizations, in which national groups were represented by their republic's or province's national composition.

Throughout Yugoslavia many factories, schools, public venues, folklore ensembles and sporting teams used to be named "Brotherhood and unity", as well as the [[Ljubljana]]-[[Zagreb]]-[[Beograd]]-[[Skopje]] highway ([[Highway "Brotherhood and Unity"]]). The country had a decoration called the [[Order of the Brotherhood and Unity]].

Several prominent persons from former Yugoslavia were convicted for activities deemed to threaten the brotherhood and unity, such as acts of [[chauvinism|chauvinist]] propaganda, [[separatism]] and [[irredentism]]. Among people who needed and strived for their country's independence were former presidents of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Alija Izetbegović]]) and [[Croatia]] ([[Franjo Tuđman]] and [[Stjepan Mesić]]), Croatian army general of Albanian descent [[Rahim Ademi]] and many others. One [[Kosovo]] Albanian, [[Adem Demaçi]], was imprisoned for almost 30 years for allegations of [[espionage]] and [[irredentism]].

In 1946, the [[Grazing Service]] was merged with the [[General Land Office]] to form the Bureau of Land Management within the [[Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=varied /&gt; It took several years for this new agency to integrate and reorganize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Muhn|title=Opportunity and Challenge: The Story of BLM|date=September 1988|publisher=BLM|location=Denver|page=52|url=https://archive.org/stream/opportunitychall00muhn/opportunitychall00muhn_djvu.txt|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the Bureau of Land Management became less focused on land disposal and more focused on the long term management and preservation of the land.&lt;ref name=varied /&gt; The agency achieved its current form by combining offices in the western states and creating a corresponding office for lands both east of and alongside the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Muhn|title=Opportunity and Challenge: The Story of BLM|date=September 1988|publisher=BLM|location=Denver|pages=160–172|url=https://archive.org/stream/opportunitychall00muhn/opportunitychall00muhn_djvu.txt|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of course,  the BLM's emphasis fell on activities in the western states as most of the mining, land sales, and federally owned areas are located west of the Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Muhn|title=Opportunity and Challenge: The Story of BLM|date=September 1988|publisher=BLM|location=Denver|pages=104–106|url=https://archive.org/stream/opportunitychall00muhn/opportunitychall00muhn_djvu.txt|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BLM personnel on the ground have typically been oriented toward local interests, while bureau management in Washington are led by presidential guidance.&lt;ref name=montana2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Clayton R.|title=Innovation in the U.S. Bureau of Land Management: Insights from Integrating Mule Deer Management with Oil and Gas Leasing (Masters Thesis)|date=August 2010|publisher=[[University of Montana]]|pages=5, 51–52|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/77588|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By means of the [[Federal Land Policy and Management Act]] of 1976, Congress created a more unified bureau mission and recognized the value of the remaining public lands by declaring that these lands would remain in public ownership.&lt;ref name=gpo /&gt; The law directed that these lands be managed with a view toward "multiple use" defined as "management of the public lands and their various resource values so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=43 U.S. Code § 1702(c)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/1702|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] years of the 1980s, Republicans have often given priority to local control and to grazing, mining and petroleum production, while Democrats have more often emphasized environmental concerns even when granting mining and drilling leases.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Skillen, ''The Nation's Largest Landlord'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1996, then President [[Bill Clinton]] used his authority under the [[Antiquities Act]] to establish the [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]] in southern Utah, the first of now 20 national monuments established on BLM lands and managed by the agency.&lt;ref name=BLMconservation/&gt; The establishment of Grand Staircase-Escalante foreshadowed later creation of the BLM's [[National Landscape Conservation System]] in 2000. Use of the Antiquities Act authority, to the extent it effectively scuttled a coal mine to have been operated by [[UtahAmerican Energy|Andalex Resources]], delighted recreation and conservation enthusiasts but set up larger confrontations with state and local authorities.&lt;ref name=headwaters&gt;{{cite web

This approach strengthens American energy security, supports job creation, and strengthens America’s energy infrastructure. We are also taking steps to make energy development on public lands easier by reviewing and streamlining our business processes to serve industry and the American public.[https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals&amp;#x3C;/ref&amp;#x3E; https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals] Even under the current administration's america first and energy independence the total mining claims on lands owned by the BLM has decreased while also the amount of rejected claims has increased. too put some context on this, the BLM oversees over 3.8 million mining claims. However, approximately 89% are closed mines with just over 10% of claims still being active. Of these active claims Nevada currently has the most at 203,705. The next closest state is California with 49,259. [https://thediggings.com/usa/blm-admin-areas&amp;#x3C;/ref&amp;#x3E; https://thediggings.com/usa/blm-admin-areas]

In 1973, BLM began a pilot project on the [[Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range]] known as the Adopt-A-Horse initiative.&lt;ref name="Pitt528"&gt;Pitt, Kenneth. "The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act: A Western Melodrama." ''Environmental Law.'' 15:503 at 528 (Spring 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The program took advantage of provisions in the WFRHBA to allow private "qualified" individuals to "adopt" as many horses as they wanted if they could show that they could provide adequate care for the animals.&lt;ref name="Glover11111112"&gt;Glover, Kristen H. "Managing Wild Horses on Public Lands: Congressional Action and Agency Response." ''North Carolina Law Review.'' 79:1108 (May 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, title to the horses remained permanently with the federal government.&lt;ref name="SterbaRevived"/&gt; The pilot project was so successful that BLM allowed it to go nationwide in 1976.&lt;ref name="Pitt528"/&gt; The Adopt-a-Horse program quickly became the primary method of removing excess feral horses from BLM land given the lack of other viable methods.&lt;ref name="Glover11111112"/&gt; The BLM also uses limited amounts of contraceptives in the herd, in the form of [[Porcine zona pellucida|PZP]] vaccinations; advocates say that additional use of these vaccines would help to diminish the excess number of horses currently under BLM management.&lt;ref name=RaiaFuture&gt;Raia, Pat (March 1, 2009). [http://www.thehorse.com/articles/22892/blm-horses-whats-their-future "BLM Horses: What's Their Future."] ''The Horse''. Accessed 2013-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the early successes of the adoption program, the BLM has struggled to maintain acceptable herd levels, as without natural predators, herd sizes can double every four years.&lt;ref name=QF/&gt; As of 2014, there were more than 49,000 horses and burros on BLM-managed land, exceeding the BLM's estimated "appropriate management level" (AML) by almost 22,500.&lt;ref name=QF/&gt;

The Bureau of Land Management has implemented several programs and has developed partnerships as part of their management plan for preserving wild burros and horses in the United States. There are several herds of horses and burros roaming free on 26.9 million acres of range spread out in ten western states. It is essential to maintain a balance that keeps herd management land and animal population healthy. Some programs and partnerships include the Mustang Heritage Foundation, U.S. Border Patrol, Idaho 4H, Napa Mustang Days and Little Book Cliffs Darting Team. These partnerships help with adoption and animal population as well as education and raising awareness about wild horses and burros.  &lt;ref&gt;"Programs: Wild Horse and Burro | BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT."

'''Béla Biszku''' (13 September 1921 – 31 March 2016) was a Hungarian [[communist]] politician, who served as Minister of the Interior from 1957 to 1961. He was charged of suspicion of committing war crimes during the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], becoming the first and to date only former top-official in Hungary who has been prosecuted because of political role in the [[Hungarian People's Republic|communist era]].

==Early life==
Béla Biszku was born in [[Márokpapi|Márok]], [[Bereg County]] (today [[Márokpapi]], [[Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County]]) on 13 September 1921 as the son of György Biszku and Etelka Debreczeni, who were farm workers. After finishing six years of elementary studies and four years of state civil school, he came afterwards to the locksmith's apprenticeship for the Wertheim Elevator &amp; Machine Manufacture in 1937. Already in 1938 Biszku was active in the youth organisation of the metalworkers in the workers' area of [[Angyalföld]] in [[Budapest]]. From 1941 to 1942, he worked at Marx &amp; Mérei Scientific Instruments Plant, and from 1942 to 1945, he was employed by Hungarian Philips Works.&lt;ref name="Bölöny"&gt;Bölöny József: ''Magyarország kormányai. 1848–1992''. 4. bőv. és jav. kiad., Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1992. 269. p.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Biszku joined ''Vasas Szakszervezet'', the metalworker's trade union and participated energetically in organizing work.

Biszku joined the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] (MKP) in 1944 and participated in the Angyalföld resistance movement that fought against the [[Operation Margarethe|Nazi German occupation force]] and against the collaborationist pro-fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]] government during the end of [[World War II]]. After the war, he played a role in the organization of the Budapest Police, then he established the Angyalföld branch of the communist party. He had worked for the MKP's Budapest Party Committee since 1946.

==Political career==
For six weeks, he functioned as deputy head of the Cadre Department of the Central Leadership of the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] (MDP) in May 1949. By the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1949|1949 parliamentary election]], the MDP had established a single party state and Soviet-type totalitarian dictatorship. Biszku worked for the Cadre Department of the Budapest Party Committee until 1951, when he was replaced. Following that, he became the secretary of the Party Committee of the [[Kőbánya]] branch. He had attended the party's Political College (PF) since September 1953. He was appointed First Secretary of the Angyalföld branch's Party Committee in the Spring of 1955.

[[File:Kádár és Biszku fortepan 41336.jpg|thumb|left|Communist politicians in 1960, including Biszku (right) and Kádár (middle)]]

During the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he recruited local pro-communist armed groups among party members and workers against the freedom fighters in the first days of the popular uprising. As a result, he was awarded with Medal for Worker-Peasant Power in April 1958, after the suppression of the revolution. Following long years of work in party organizations, Biszku sprang into prominence after the events of 1956.

Between 1957 and 1961 he served as Minister of the Interior in the [[Government of Hungary|government]] of [[János Kádár]]. In this capacity, he became known for the severity he showed in suppressing and punishing after the 1956 revolution, which was one of the largest revolt against the communist government in the [[Eastern Bloc]] and its Soviet-imposed policies, was defeated. Between 1961&amp;ndash;1962 Biszku became the deputy prime minister, alongside [[Antal Apró]], [[Jenő Fock]] and [[Gyula Kállai]]. He was replaced by [[Lajos Fehér]] on 27 November 1962.&lt;ref name="Bölöny2"&gt;Bölöny József: ''Magyarország kormányai. 1848–1992''. 4. bőv. és jav. kiad., Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 1992. 211. p.&lt;/ref&gt; Biszku was also elected Member of Parliament during the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1958|1958 parliamentary election]], representing Constituency I in Szabolcs-Szatmár County. He was MP until April 1971, when did not stand for re-election in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1971|1971 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name="tortenelmitar"&gt;[http://www.tortenelmitar.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3571&amp;catid=43:b&amp;Itemid=67&amp;lang=en Történelmi Tár]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1962 until 1978, he was the Secretary of the Central Committee of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSZMP).&lt;ref name="szabo"&gt;Szabó Miklós, M.: Adalékok a Magyar Néphadsereg 1961–1962. évi történetéhez. 1. rész. In.: Új Honvédségi Szemle. LXI. évf., 2007/9. sz., 96. p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kádár János és Biszku Béla.jpg|thumb|left|Kádár and Biszku in 1985]]

Biszku, as a hard-line communist, strongly opposed the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (ÚGM) which was imposed by the Kádár regime in 1968 and contained "capitalist elements". In 1972, together with [[Zoltán Komócsin]], and other fellow communists, he became involved in a plot to force János Kádár to resign from virtually all of his public functions in an effort to return [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] to a more orthodox Soviet-style line. To achieve his goals, Biszku tried to convince [[Yuri Andropov]] of the rightness of his cause, who immediately alerted Kádár.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.neb.hu/asset/phpNHPmgG.pdf Komócsin Zoltán - Nemzeti Emlékezet Bizottsága]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards Kádár slowly removed Biszku from power. Biszku was again MP between 1975 and 1985, representing Constituency II in Szabolcs-Szatmár County.&lt;ref name="tortenelmitar"/&gt;

He was forced into retirement in 1978, when [[Károly Németh]] replaced him as Secretary of the Central Committee. From 1980 to 1989, he served as Chairman of the Audit Committee of the National Council of Trade Unions (SZOT).&lt;ref name="szabo"/&gt; The MSZMP's leadership adopted a new electoral system for the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1985|1985 parliamentary election]] which imposed a multiple candidacy system in each constituency. Biszku was defeated by another MSZMP member and lost his parliamentary seat.&lt;ref name="tortenelmitar"/&gt;

==Retirement==
From 1989, the [[End of Communism in Hungary (1989)|end of communism]] and transition to democracy until 2011, he successfully evaded any kind of prosecution for human rights abuses committed under the Kádár regime while living in relative obscurity, and sought to portray the regime in a favorable light.

In the summer of 2008, Hungarian blogger and documentary filmmaker Fruzsina Skrabski published a post with the title "''Kommunisták, reszkessetek!''", where she announced a search for still living former Communist politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mandiner.blog.hu/2008/06/12/kommunistak_reszkessetek Kommunisták, reszkessetek!]&lt;/ref&gt; Skrabski and Tamás Novák presented themselves as members of a non-existent local organization to Biszku, claiming that they intended to make a movie about him, "Márokpapi's famous son". They disclosed their true intention only during their last meeting, after organizing a fake celebration with background performers in the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nagyitas.hu/common/main.php?pgid=cikk&amp;cikk_id=1919&amp;tema_id=31 Márokpapi előkerül]&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Biszku did not reject his contribution and answered sensitive political questions also. There, Biszku called the 1956 revolution a "counter-revolution" and added he had not felt any regret or remorse for the death penalties and retaliatory measures. He also said that [[Imre Nagy]], prime minister of the revolution, had "deserved his fate".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hetek.hu/fokusz/201006/biszku_nagy_imre_megerdemelte Biszku: Nagy Imre megérdemelte]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biszku first consented to the premiere but after major media coverage, withdrew his permission. His family also protested against screening in a cinema in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hetivalasz.hu/itthon/biszku-bela-letiltotta-a-rola-keszult-film-bemutatojat-29985/ Biszku Béla letiltotta a róla készült film bemutatóját], [[Heti Válasz]], 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary movie entitled "''Crime Without Punishment''" was screened in June 2010. Later, Biszku's daughters, after seeing the movie  contributed to the projection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mult-kor.hu/20100616_levetitettek_a_biszku_belarol_szolo_dokumentumfilmet Levetítették a Biszku Béláról szóló dokut] Múlt-kor, 2010-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20100616-biszku-bela-dokumentumfilm-1956rol-mesel-es-tagad-a-volt-belugyminiszter.html „Senkitől nem kérek bocsánatot!” - levetítették a Biszku Béláról szóló dokumentumfilmet], Origo, 2010-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentary Committee on Culture and Media also supported the screening and the national assembly later adopted a law that historical documentaries in general should not be banned from public showing on grounds of rights to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hvg.hu/Tudomany/20100630_biszku_vita_parlament_film Biszku-film: monstre vita a Parlamentben] – [[Heti Világgazdaság]], 2010-06-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal investigation and trial==
The National Assembly adopted a so-called "lex Biszku" bill, which aims to prosecute former leading communist politicians and law enforcement officials who are seen as responsible for the deterring of the 1956 uprising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkogy.hu/internet/plsql/ogy_irom.irom_adat?p_ckl=39&amp;p_izon=4714 T/4714: Az emberiesség elleni bűncselekmények elévülhetetlenségéről]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hir24.hu/belfold/2011/10/18/gulyas-gergely-kuldte-a-fidesz-biszku-belara/ Hír24: Gulyás Gergelyt küldte a Fidesz Biszku Bélára]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gergely Gulyás]] told a press conference in October 2011 that the bill is constitutional and consistent with international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.hu/20111019/fidesz-plans-to-hold-people-who-ordered-post-1956-reprisals-accountable/ Fidesz plans legislation aimed at individuals involved in post-1956 reprisals], ''Politics.hu'', 19 October 2011; accessed 21 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A criminal investigation against Biszku was opened in 2011. He is being charged with "denial of communist crimes" that may result in a three-year jail sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/364561,charged-denying-communist-crimes.html|title=Denying communist crimes|publisher=Earth Times |date= |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2012, Biszku was placed under house arrest on charge of suspicion of committing [[war crimes]]. He is the first politician of the 1956 Communist leadership to face a criminal inquiry. He is accused of failing to protect civilians in wartime. In addition, he needs to hold responsibility for ordering the security forces to open fire on crowds. In case, he is found guilty of the charges brought up against him, which he himself has denied, he could face a life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20120910/hungary-1956-counter-revolutionary-bela-biszku-arrested/|title=Hungary 1956 counter-revolutionary Béla Biszku arrested|publisher=Politics.hu |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His trial was scheduled to begin on 18 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20140304/92-year-old-former-communist-leader-biszku-to-be-tried-in-march/|title=92-year-old former communist leader Biszku to be tried in March|publisher=Politics.hu |date=2014-03-04 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2014, he has been found guilty of war crimes during the suppression of the 1956 uprising. He was convicted of ordering security forces to open fire on civilians, killing 49 people, and was sentenced to five years and six months in prison. Biszku was also found guilty of other charges, including "denial of communist crimes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27398373|title=Hungary 1956 revolt: Bela Biszku jailed for war crimes|publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2014-05-13|accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Metropolitan Court of Appeals set aside the first degree sentence and ordered a new trial on 1 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20150601_Gyorshir_Uj_eljarast_rendeltek_al_Biszku|title=Új eljárást rendeltek el Biszku Béla ügyében|publisher=[[Heti Világgazdaság]] |date=2015-06-01|accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeals argued that there were "essential and substantive differences between establishing historical responsibility and criminal responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/high-ranking-hungarian-communist-bela-biszku-dies-at-94/2016/04/01/852ae050-f803-11e5-958d-d038dac6e718_story.html|title=High-ranking Hungarian communist Bela Biszku dies at 94|publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2016-04-01|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the repeat procedure, the Metropolitan Court of Budapest sentenced Biszku to two years in prison, suspended for three years for complicity in war crimes on 17 December 2015. The court also ruled, however, that there was insufficient evidence that Biszku as Minister of the Interior and member of the MSZMP's so-called Provisional Executive Committee had issued the order to fire on 49 protesters in [[Salgótarján]] in December 1956 or beat up academics in March 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magyaridok.hu/belfold/felfuggesztettet-kapott-biszku-bela-237427/|title=Felfüggesztettet kapott Biszku Béla|publisher=Magyar Idők|date=2015-12-17|accessdate=2016-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185503/http://magyaridok.hu/belfold/felfuggesztettet-kapott-biszku-bela-237427/|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biszku died in Budapest on 31 March 2016 at the age of 94,&lt;ref name="indexdeath"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miklósi|first1=Gábor|title=Meghalt Biszku Béla|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2016/04/01/meghalt_biszku_bela/|website=[[Index.hu|Index]]|accessdate=1 April 2016|language=Hungarian|date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the potential sentence of the repeat procedure's second degree. Fruzsina Skrabski, who made that documentary film which brought Biszku's impunity and high pension salary to the surface, said the Hungarian jurisdiction "are awaiting his death [...] to prevent the start of an avalanche [...] with regard to the impeachment of former high-ranking Communist politicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20160401_skrabski_fruzsina_kivartak_biszku_halalat|title=Skrabski Fruzsina: Kivárták Biszku halálát|publisher=Mandiner |date=2016-04-01|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9886">'''CRYPTREC''' is the '''Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees''' set up by the Japanese Government to evaluate and recommend [[cryptographic]] techniques for government and industrial use. It is comparable in many respects to the [[European Union]]'s [[NESSIE]] project and to the [[Advanced Encryption Standard process]] run by [[NIST]] in the [[United States|U.S.]].

== Comparison with NESSIE ==
There is some overlap, and some conflict, between the NESSIE selections and the CRYPTREC draft recommendations. Both efforts include some of the best cryptographers in the world{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} therefore conflicts in their selections and recommendations should be examined with care. For instance, CRYPTREC recommends several 64 bit block ciphers while NESSIE selected none, but CRYPTREC was obliged by its terms of reference to take into account existing standards and practices, while NESSIE was not. Similar differences in terms of reference account for CRYPTREC recommending at least one [[stream cipher]], [[RC4]], while the NESSIE report specifically said that it was ''notable'' that they had not selected any of those considered. RC4 is widely used in the [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] protocols; nevertheless, CRYPTREC recommended that it only be used with 128-bit keys. Essentially the same consideration led to CRYPTREC's inclusion of 160-bit message digest algorithms, despite their suggestion that they be avoided in new system designs. Also, CRYPTREC was unusually careful to examine variants and modifications of the techniques, or at least to discuss their care in doing so; this resulted in particularly detailed recommendations regarding them.

== Background and sponsors ==
CRYPTREC includes members from Japanese [[academia]], [[industry]], and [[government]]. It was started in May 2000 by combining efforts from several agencies who were investigating methods and techniques for implementing 'e-Government' in Japan. Presently, it is sponsored by
*the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry,
*the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs and Post and Telecommunications,
*the Telecommunications Advancement Organization, and
*the Information-Technology Promotion Agency.

== Responsibilities ==
It is also the organization providing technical evaluation and recommendations in regard to regulations implementing Japanese laws: examples include that on Electronic Signatures and Certification Services (Law 102 of FY2000, taking effect as from April 2001), the Basic Law on the Formulation of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Network Society of 2000 (Law 144 of FY2000), and the Public Individual Certification Law of December 2002. Furthermore, CRYPTEC has responsibilities with regard to the Japanese contribution to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] JTC 1/SC27 standardization effort.

== Selection ==

| title=e-Government recommended ciphers list

| accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; many Japanese ciphers were selected for "e-Government Recommended Ciphers List"; [[CIPHERUNICORN-E]] ([[NEC]]), [[Hierocrypt|Hierocrypt-L1]] ([[Toshiba]]), [[MISTY1]] ([[Mitsubishi Electric]]) as 64 bit block ciphers, [[Camellia (cipher)|Camellia]] ([[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]]), [[CIPHERUNICORN-A]] (NEC), [[Hierocrypt|Hierocrypt-3]] (Toshiba), [[SC2000]]([[Fujitsu]]) as 128 bit block ciphers, [[MUGI]], [[MULTI-S01]] ([[Hitachi]]) as stream ciphers.

| title=Specifications of e-Government Recommended Ciphers

| accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; list was divided to three, "e-Government Recommended Ciphers List", "Candidate Recommended Ciphers List", and "Monitored Ciphers List". Most of Japanese ciphers listed in previous list (except for Camellia) have moved from "Recommended Ciphers List" to "Candidate Recommended Ciphers List". There were several new proposals like [[CLEFIA]] ([[Sony]]) as 128 bit block cipher, [[KCipher-2]] ([[KDDI]]), [[Enocoro-128v2]] (Hitachi) as stream ciphers, however, only KCipher-2 has been listed on "e-Government Recommended Ciphers List". The reason why most of Japanese ciphers have not been selected as "Recommended Ciphers" is not that these ciphers are unsafe, but that these ciphers are not widely used in commercial products, open-source projects, governmental systems, international standards. There is possibility that ciphers listed on "Candidate Recommended Ciphers List" will be moved to "e-Government Recommended Ciphers List" when they are used in many systems.

In addition, 128 bit [[RC4]] and [[SHA-1]] are listed on "Monitored Ciphers List". These are unsafe and only permitted to keep compatibilities with old systems.

The '''California Desert Protection Act of 1994''' is a federal law ({{USPL|103|433}}), signed by President [[Bill Clinton]], and passed by the [[United States Congress]] on October 8, 1994, that established the [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park|Joshua Tree]] [[National Park]]s and the [[Mojave National Preserve]] in the [[California]] [[desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wheat | first = Frank | title = California Desert Miracle | publisher = Sunbelt Publications | year = 1999 | location = San Diego | isbn = 0-932653-27-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
===Wilderness===
Designated 69 wilderness areas as additions to the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]] within the California Desert Conservation Area (CDCA), the Yuma District, the Bakersfield District, and the California Desert District of the [[Bureau of Land Management]]. Permits grazing in such areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = S.21 Bill Summary &amp; Status | publisher = The Library of Congress | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:SN00021:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp; | accessdate = June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death Valley National Park===
The Act abolished Death Valley National Monument, established in 1933 and 1937, and incorporated its lands into a new Death Valley National Park administered as part of the National Park System. Grazing of domestic livestock was permitted to continue at no more than the then-current level. The Act also required the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to study the suitability of lands within and outside the boundaries of the park as a reservation for the [[Timbisha Shoshone Tribe]].

===Joshua Tree National Park===
The Act abolished Joshua Tree National Monument, established in 1936, and incorporated its lands into Joshua Tree National Park.

===Mojave National Preserve===
The Act established the Mojave National Preserve, consisting of approximately {{convert|1419800|acre|km2 sqmi}}, and abolished the East Mojave National Scenic Area, which was designated in 1981. The preserve was to be administered in accordance with National Park System laws.  Hunting, fishing and trapping were permitted as allowed by federal and state laws, with certain exceptions. Mining claims were governed by the National Park System laws, and grazing was permitted to continue at no more than the then-current level.

===Native American uses===
The Act required the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that indigenous people have access to the lands designated under the Act for traditional cultural and religious purposes, in recognition of their prior use of these lands for these purposes. Upon the request of an indigenous tribe or religious community, the Secretary must temporarily close specific portions to the general public to protect the privacy of traditional cultural and religious activities.

===Military overflights===
Flights by military aircraft over the lands designated by the Act were not restricted or precluded, including overflights that can be seen or heard from these lands.

===Appropriations===
The Act authorized Congress to appropriate to the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management, for the fiscal year 1995-1999 period, sums not to exceed $36,000,000 more than that provided in fiscal year 1994 for additional administrative and construction costs, and $300,000,000 for land acquisition costs...

===Additional findings and policy===
Congress found that federally owned desert lands of southern California constitute a public wildland resource of extraordinary and inestimable value for current and future generations; these desert wildlands have unique scenic, historical, archeological, environmental, ecological, wildlife, cultural, scientific, educational and recreational values; the California desert public land resources are threatened by adverse pressures which impair their public and natural values; the California desert is a cohesive unit posing difficult resource protection and management challenges; statutory land unit designations are necessary to protect these lands. 

Congress declared as its policy that appropriate public lands in the California desert must be included within the [[National Park System]] and the National Wilderness Preservation System in order to preserve the unrivaled scenic, geologic and wildlife values of these lands; perpetuate their significant and diverse ecosystems; protect and preserve their historical and cultural values; provide opportunities for compatible outdoor public recreation, protect and interpret ecological and geological features, maintain wilderness resource values, and promote public understanding and appreciation; retain and enhance opportunities for scientific research in undisturbed ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = California Desert Protection Act | publisher = The [[National Park Service]] | url = http://www.nps.gov/jotr/parkmgmt/caldesprotect.htm | accessdate = June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9564">The '''Commissioners of the Republic''' (''commissaires de la République'') or '''Regional Commissioners of the Republic''' (CRR) were government officials appointed as representatives of [[Charles de Gaulle]] by the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF) between 1944 and 1946. They had a rank equivalent to that of minister (like other commissioners of the GPRF) and were charged with re-establishing Republican legality and freedoms and the state's authority after the [[Liberation of France]], answering only to de Gaulle.  Most of them originated from [[Free French Forces]], though some also came from the [[French Resistance]].

&lt;!---
Leur mission fut de rétablir les libertés républicaines et l'autorité de l'État, en empêchant toute vacance du pouvoir, et par là, l'installation d'une administration militaire alliée (voir [[AMGOT]]).

Ils doivent restaurer les lois démocratiques, limiter les violences spontanées de l'[[Epuration]] sauvage, assurer l'épuration légale des administrations, des magistrats et des particuliers compromis avec les Allemands. Fait exceptionnel dans l'histoire de la France contemporaine, les commissaires de la République ont disposé pendant quelques mois du [[droit de grâce]], pouvoir régalien dont l'exercice exclusif est normalement dévolu au chef de l'État. Leurs pouvoirs furent donc très étendus, mais de courte durée, car ils en perdaient dès que le pouvoir central reprenait la contrôle direct des administrations. Dès novembre 1944, ils avaient perdu le contrôle de la justice et de certaines affaires économiques.

Ils durent faire le lien entre le gouvernement parisien et les autorités locales issues de la Résistance ([[Comité départemental de Libération|Comités départementaux]] et locaux de Libération). Si nécessaire, ils devaient empêcher ces dernières d'outrepasser leur mission et d'instaurer des pouvoirs parallèles - ce dernier danger ne se concrétisa pas, le [[Parti communiste français|Parti communiste]] et les [[Francs-tireurs et partisans|FTP]] se montrant globalement loyaux et disciplinés, et [[Maurice Thorez]] approuvant sur ordre de [[Joseph Staline|Staline]] la dissolution des ''Milices patriotiques'' dès le 28 octobre 1944. 

Les CRR eurent à assurer le ravitaillement de leur région et la remise en route de l'économie locale. Enfin, en 1945, ils durent gérer le retour des prisonniers, des déportés politiques et juifs, et des requis du [[Service du travail obligatoire|STO]].

&lt;!---
Le GPRF définit 18 régions désignées par leur chef-lieu. En fait ce furent les mêmes chefs-lieux que pour les régions définies par Vichy, avec les modifications suivantes : la région de Vichy était supprimée, et deux régions étaient crées pour les départements qui avaient été soustraits au contrôle de Vichy, celle de Lille pour les départements du Nord  et du Pas de Calais, et celle de Strasbourg pour le Bas Rhin, le Haut Rhin et la Moselle. Les régions étaient rééquilibrées par la suppression de la ligne de démarcation.

Le décret du 3 octobre 1943 désignait déjà 17 CRR, 3 commissaires hors cadre et 50 préfets. Les CRR devaient rejoindre leur poste avant la Libération, mais à la suite d'arrestations par les Allemands, ou d'erreurs de la Résistance qui exécuta un CRR et en blessa un autre, il y eut de nombreuses réaffectations. Dans la liste suivante, le '''CRR indiqué en caractères gras''' est celui qui était en fonction au moment de la libération de sa région. 

Citons en premier le cas particulier de [[François Coulet]], le premier à entrer en fonction : il est installé à [[Bayeux]] par le général de Gaulle peu après le [[jour J]], lors de la première visite de ce dernier sur le sol français, le 14 juin 1944, car celui de Rouen ne pouvait pas rejoindre son poste. Son succès a valeur de test. En s'imposant sans grand mal aux autorités de Vichy et surtout aux armées alliées, François Coulet permet au général de Gaulle d'enterrer les ultimes velléités américaines de mettre l'[[AMGOT]] en place.

Par ordre alphabétique des chefs-lieux :
* Angers : René Brouillet ; '''[[Michel Debré]]''' le 10 août 1944 ; Alain Savary le 1er avril 1945.
* Bordeaux (départements : [[Gironde (département)|33]], [[Landes|40]], [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques|64]], [[Lot-et-Garonne|47]]) : '''[[Gaston Cusin]]''' ; [[Jacques Soustelle]] en mai 1945 ; Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury en juin 1945.  
* Chalons-sur-Marne : Michel Debré ; '''Marcel Gégoire''' le 29 août 1944.
* Clermont-Ferrand : Émile Laffon ; '''[[Henry Ingrand]]'''.
* Dijon (départements : [[Côte-d'Or|22]], [[Doubs (département)|25]], [[Jura (département)|38]], [[Nièvre (département)|58]], [[Haute-Saône|70]], [[Saône-et-Loire|71]], [[Yonne (département)|89]], [[Territoire de Belfort|90]]) : le professeur Reuter ; [[Jean Bouhey]] en mars 1944, mais il est gravement blessé par un maquis le 4 septembre 1944, Jean Mairey assure l'intérim. 
* Laon (départements : [[Aisne (département)|02]], [[Ardennes|09]], [[Oise (département)|60]], [[Somme (département)|80]]) : M. Ségalat ; M. Vivant (arrété) ; [[Pierre Pène]].
* Lille (départements : [[Nord (département)|59]], [[Pas-de-Calais|62]]) : [[Francis-Louis Closon]].
* Limoges (départements :[[Corrèze (département)|19]], [[Creuse (département)|23]], [[Dordogne (département)|24]], [[Indre (département)|36]], [[Haute-Vienne|87]]) : [[Jean Bouhey]] ; André Fourcade (alias Vergnaud dans la Résistance des Hautes Pyrénnées, arrêté en juin 1944 par la Gestapo, fusillié le 27 août 1944) ; [[Pierre Boursicot]].
* Lyon (actuels départements de la région [[Rhône-Alpes]]) : [[Pierre-Henri Teitgen]] ; '''[[Yves Farge]]''', Henri Longchambon en septembre 1945.
* Montpellier (départements : [[Aude (département)|11]], [[Aveyron (département)|12]], [[Gard (département)|32]], [[Hérault (département)|34]], [[Pyrénées-Orientales|66]]) : '''Jacques Bounin'''.
* Marseille : '''[[Raymond Aubrac]]''' ; [[Paul Haag]] en janvier 1945.
* Nancy : [[Paul Chaillet-Bert]] qui eut du mal a s'imposer mais fut aidé par le Délégué militaire [[Gilbert Grandval]].
* Orléans : [[André Mars]].
* Poitiers (départements : [[Charente (département)|16]], [[Charente-Maritime|17]], [[Deux-Sèvres|79]], [[Vendée|85]], [[Vienne (département)|86]]) : quatre CRR successifs, puis '''Jean Schuhler'''.
* Rennes (départements : [[Côtes-du-Nord|21]], [[Finistère (département)|29]], [[Ille-et-Vilaine|35]], [[Morbihan|56]]) : '''[[Victor Le Gorgeu]]'''.
* Rouen : René David, [[Henri Bourdeau de Fontenay]].
* Strasbourg : M. Fonlupt Espéraber ; [[Charles Blondel]] en octobre 1944 ; [[Emile Bollaert]]  en juin 1945.
* Toulouse : [[Édouard Depreux]] qui fut rapidement remplacé ; [[François Verdier]] qui fut arrêté en décembre 1943 et fusillé en janvier 1944 ; [[Jean Cassou]], très grièvement blessé dans une embuscade allemande le 20 aout 1944 ; '''[[Pierre Bertaux]]''', il fut au cœur des rumeurs dénonçant (exagérément) l'installation d'une "république rouge" à Toulouse, libérée par les [[Forces françaises de l'intérieur|FFI]] du colonel [[Serge Ravanel]].

Commissaires de la République en mission : [[François Coulet]], qui après sa mission à Bayeux fut commissaire aux liaisons interalliées ; [[Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel]].

Commissaires hors cadre : [[Claude Bouchinet-Serreulles]], [[Pierre Tissier]] et Raymond Auguste Valabrègue.
 
[[Charles Luizet]] fut nommé Préfet de police de Paris.

Les CRR qui eurent la responsabilité des régions les plus isolées, en particulier celles du Sud  : Bordeaux, Toulouse et Marseille eurent le plus de difficultés. A Bordeaux Gaston Cusin eut à  fusionner les différents mouvements de résistance qui s'opposaient, et dut imposer un Délégué militaire. A Toulouse certain mouvements de résistance voulaient prendre le pouvoir. A Marseille, Raymond Aubrac dut mobiliser tous les dockers pour travailler nuit et jour au déchargement des divisions américaines et des approvisionnements pour les forces américaines en Allemagne (600 tonnes par jour et par division.) Il avait des difficultés énormes dues à l'épuration sauvage et pour approvisionnner la population.
Les commissaires de la République furent supprimés en janvier 1946, le retour à la normalité démocratique étant achevé, mais certains restèrent en poste avec des pouvoirs réduits jusqu'en mars 1946, en attendant la relève  des préfets.

Tous furent très marqués par cette expérience et le général de Gaulle leur porta toute son estime. La majorité d'entre eux furent ensuite nommés à d'autres hautes fonctions : secrétaire d'État ou ministre.

'''''East vs. West – A Hearts of Iron Game''''' was a planned [[grand strategy wargame]] set during the [[Cold War]] era between 1946–1991.&lt;ref name=Cancellation /&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''East vs. West'' was not an expansion for ''[[Hearts of Iron III]]'', but rather intended as a standalone game.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

''East vs. West'', like many of its predecessors in the ''Hearts of Iron'' series, would have allowed for the player to take control of and manage a country including its political, diplomatic, espionage, economic, military, and technological aspects. In contrast to previous installments in the ''Hearts of Iron'' series, the game was to be set in the Cold War era, and not focus mainly on [[Total war|large-scale warfare]]. The use of [[nuclear weapons]] in game would have been possible, but limited by a [[DEFCON|nation's state of emergency]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

=== Features ===
The main focus of the game were the diplomatic, political, economic, military and espionage aspects of countries during the Cold War period and the decisions the player make in regards to them.

Confirmed features included:
* New espionage system utilizing "spy cards".&lt;ref name=espionage&gt;{{cite web|title=East vs West Developer Diary 8 - Espionage: HUSH HUSH|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?727362-East-vs-West-Developer-Diary-8-Espionage-HUSH-HUSH|publisher=Paradox Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An extended political module.&lt;ref name=politics&gt;{{cite web|title=East vs West Developer diary 5 - The Essence of your People|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?679302-East-vs-West-Developer-diary-5-The-Essence-of-your-People|publisher=Paradox Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Doomsday Clock]] indicating how close the in game world is to total destruction.
* The presence of the [[United Nations]] to intervene in global events.
* The ability to customize ships.&lt;ref name=shipeditor&gt;{{cite web|title=East vs West Developer diary 4 - Master of the Seas|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?669564-East-vs-West-Developer-diary-4-Master-of-the-Seas|publisher=Paradox Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nuclear arms race]] and [[Nuclear warfare|warfare]] is expanded by a nuclear mapmode, [[uranium]] as a resource, factories ([[centrifuge]]s) to produce enriched fission material, [[ICBM]]s that can be launched from silos, [[nuclear submarine]]s, and a [[Big red button|red button]].&lt;ref name=nuclear&gt;{{cite web|title=East vs West Developer diary 7 - The Big Bang|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?688670-East-vs-West-Developer-diary-7-The-Big-Bang|publisher=Paradox Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was expected to retain many features included in ''Hearts of Iron III'', such as control over the armed forces, the strategic warfare system, user mods-friendliness, and a multiplayer system with up to 32 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East vs. West Features|url=http://www.paradoxplaza.com/games/east-vs-west|publisher=Paradox Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cancellation ==
No release date was scheduled for ''East vs. West'' after the initial Q1 2013 release date was missed, though following a decision to cut major features including multiplayer functionality from the game, Paradox hoped to offer a pay-what-you-want public beta in March 2014.&lt;ref name="beta "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?749660-Regarding-the-future-of-East-vs-West-The-Beta-and-Release-Date|title=Regarding the future of East vs West - The Beta and Release Date|publisher=Paradox Plaza}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation of ''East vs. West'' was announced in a joint statement on 6 March 2014 by BL Logic and Paradox Interactive, citing multiple delays in the project.&lt;ref name=Cancellation/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5586">{{About|election recount|the 2008 film|Recount (film)}}

An '''election recount''' is a repeat tabulation of votes cast in an [[election]] that is used to determine the correctness of an initial count. Recounts will often take place in the event that the initial vote tally during an election is extremely close.

Election recounts will often result in changes in contest tallies. Errors can be found or introduced from [[Human reliability|human factors]], such as transcription errors, or machine errors, such as misreads of paper ballots. Alternately, tallies may change because of a reinterpretation of voter intent. 

==United States==
Of the 4,687 statewide general elections held from 2000 to 2015, 27 were followed by a recount, and only three resulted in a change of outcome from the original count: [[Washington gubernatorial election, 2004]], [[Vermont Auditor of Accounts election, 2006]], and [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/recounts-rarely-reverse-election-results/ Recounts Rarely Reverse Election Results]. [[FiveThirtyEight]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recount methods===
[[File:2008recountMN.JPG|thumb|right|256px|Recounting [[optical-scan ballot]]s by hand in the [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008]].]]

====Machine recount====
A machine recount is a retabulation of ballots cast during the election. This can be done using an [[optical scan voting system]], [[punched card]] system or [[DRE voting machine]]. With [[Voting_machine#Document-based_ballot_voting_systems|document-based Ballot Voting Systems]], ballots are counted a second time by some form of [[machine]]. With [[Voting_machine#Non-document-based_ballot_voting_systems|Non-document-based Ballot Voting Systems]] officials will recollect vote data from each voting machine which will be combined by a central tabulation system.

====Manual recount====
A manual or "hand" recount involves each individual physical representation of voter intent being reviewed for voter intent by one or more individuals. 

With DRE voting machines, a [[voter-verified paper audit trail]] (VVPAT) is examined from each voter. For some DREs that do not generate a VVPAT, images can be printed for each ballot cast and counted individually.{{Clarify me|December 2008|date=February 2009}}

===Legal requirements===
Recounts can be '''mandatory''' or '''optional'''. In some jurisdictions, recounts are mandatory in the event the difference between the top two candidates is less than a percentage of votes cast or of a fixed number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-recount-thresholds.aspx |title=Automatic Recounts |publisher=[[National Conference of State Legislatures]] |date=October 26, 2016 |accessdate=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory recounts are paid for by the elections official, or the state. Mandatory recounts can usually be waived by the apparent losing candidate. The winning side will usually encourage the loser to waive the recount in a show of unity and to avoid spending taxpayer money.

Each jurisdiction has different criteria for optional recounts. Some areas permit recounts for any office or measure, while others require that the margin of victory be less than a certain percentage before a recount is allowed. In all instances, optional recounts are paid for by the candidate, their political party, or, in some instances, by any interested voter. The person paying for the recount has the option to stop the recount at any time. If the recount reverses the election, the jurisdiction will then pay for the recount.

===Not recounts===
Loosely called "recounts" are actually first counts of various kinds of votes like those cast with [[absentee ballot]]s and provisional ballots. Because they occur after regular ballots are counted and because most elections are not close enough for these other ballots to affect the outcome, when these additional ballots are being tabulated, many media sources incorrectly call them "recounts."

===Notable recounts===
*[[Florida election recount]] - [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]]
*[[Washington gubernatorial election, 2004]]
*[[Vermont Auditor of Accounts election, 2006]]
*[[United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2006#District 13]] - [[Florida's 13th congressional district]]
*[[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008]]
*[[Virginia Attorney General election, 2013]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/herring-wins-virginia-attorney-general-race-elections-board-announces/2013/11/25/7b661082-55e7-11e3-835d-e7173847c7cc_story.html
&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[2016 United States presidential election recounts]]&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.gregpalast.com/ for an investigative journalist's report of what the "recount" uncovered.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinton campaign counsel: We'll participate in recount|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/clinton-campaign-counsel-well-participate-in-recount/ar-AAkNhuS?li=BBmkt5R&amp;ocid=spartandhp|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
It is possible for a defeated candidate denied a recount by the Returning Officer, to request one from the court by means of an [[election petition]]. There are [[List of UK Parliamentary election petitions|several cases]] where a Parliamentary election has been the subject of a court-ordered recount.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">In network security, '''evasion''' is bypassing an information security device in order to deliver an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]], [[Attack (computing)|attack]], or other form of [[malware]] to a target network or system, without detection. Evasions are typically used to counter network-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IPS, IDS) but can also be used to by-pass firewalls and defeat [[malware analysis]]. A further target of evasions can be to crash a network security device, rendering it in-effective to subsequent targeted attacks.

==Description==
Evasions can be particularly nasty because a well-planned and implemented evasion can enable full sessions to be carried forth in packets that evade an IDS. Attacks carried in such sessions will happen right under the nose of the network and service administrators.

The security systems are rendered ineffective against well-designed evasion techniques, in the same way a stealth fighter can attack without detection by radar and other defensive systems.

A good analogy to evasions is a system designed to recognize keywords in speech patterns on a phone system, such as “break into system X”. A simple evasion would be to use a language other than English, but which both parties can still understand, and wishfully a language that as few people as possible can talk.

==Evasion attacks==
Various advanced and targeted evasion attacks have been known since the mid-1990s:

* A seminal text describing the attacks against IDS systems appeared in 1997.&lt;ref name="50ways"&gt;[http://all.net/Analyst/netsec/1997-12.html 50 Ways to Defeat Your Intrusion Detection System]&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the first comprehensive description of attacks was reported by Ptacek and Newsham in a technical report in 1998.&lt;ref name="ptacek"&gt;Ptacek, Newsham: Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding Network Intrusion Detection, Technical report, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1998, also an article in the Phrack Magazine describes ways to by-pass network intrusion detection.&lt;ref name="phrack"&gt;[http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=54&amp;id=10 Defeating Sniffers and Intrusion Detection Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==
The 1997 article&lt;ref name=50ways/&gt; mostly discusses various shell-scripting and character-based tricks to fool an IDS. The Phrack Magazine article&lt;ref name=phrack/&gt; and the technical report from Ptacek et al.&lt;ref name=ptacek/&gt; discusses TCP/IP protocol exploits, evasions and others. More recent discussions on evasions include the report by Kevin Timm.&lt;ref name="timm"&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/ids-evasion-techniques-and-tactics IDS Evasion Techniques and Tactics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protecting against evasions==
The challenge in protecting servers from evasions is to model the end-host operation at the network security device, i.e., the device should be able to know how the target host would interpret the traffic, and if it would be harmful, or not. A key solution in protecting against evasions is traffic normalization at the IDS/IPS device.&lt;ref name="handley"&gt;M. Handley, V. Paxson, C. Kreibich, Network intrusion detection: evasion, traffic normalization, and end-to-end protocol semantics, Usenix Security Symposium, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately there has been discussions on putting more effort on research in evasion techniques. A presentation at [[Hack.lu]] discussed some potentially new evasion techniques and how to apply multiple evasion techniques to by-pass network security devices.&lt;ref name="hacklu"&gt;[http://2009.hack.lu/index.php/Workshops#Advanced_Network_Based_IPS_Evasion_Techniques Advanced Network Based IPS Evasion Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Bannon was inspired to create the documentary after seeing [[Governor of Alaska|former Alaskan governor]] [[Sarah Palin]] run as [[John McCain|John McCain's]] vice president running mate in the [[2008 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name=FN&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKay|first1=Hollie|title=Filmmaker Spotlights Role of Women in Conservative Movement|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/10/04/fire-heartland-sarah-palin-conservative-women-bannon/|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In exploring the [[Tea Party movement]], the film interviews only women. The sole male voice heard in the film is from a clip of an on-air rant by [[CNBC]]'s [[Rick Santelli]] from a February 2009 broadcast.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The documentary looks at the idea of the conservative political female in the United States and how they have impacted and been impacted by the [[Tea Party movement]]. Bannon interviews women from different socioeconomic backgrounds and how this has had an effect on their outlook on life and in politics, as well as what they believe what the future will bring and their opinions on how conservative politics and the Tea Party is portrayed in the media.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[John Fund]]|title=Why Mama Grizzlies Run the Tea Party|url=http://archive.li/MK1RI|accessdate=24 July 2018|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forza Europa''' (translation: "Forward Europe", '''FE''')  is a [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[pro-Europeanism|pro-Europeanist]] [[list of political parties in Italy|political party]] in [[Italy]].

Its leader and president is [[Benedetto Della Vedova]], an [[economist]] and long-time [[Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|Radical]] politician, who has been [[member of the European Parliament|member]] of the [[European Parliament]] for the [[Bonino List]] (1999–2004), candidate for [[President of Lombardy]] (2000), president of the [[Italian Radicals]] (2001–2003), founder and president of the [[Liberal Reformers]] (2005–2009), member of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] for [[Forza Italia]] (2006–2008), [[The People of Freedom]] (2008–2011) and [[Future and Freedom]] (2011–2013), member of the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate]] for Future and Freedom (2013), [[Civic Choice]] (2013–2015) and the [[Mixed Group]] (2015–2018), and undersecretary at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in [[Renzi Cabinet]] (2014–2016) and [[Gentiloni Cabinet]] (2016–2018).

The party took part to the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]] within [[More Europe]] (+E).

==History==
FE was originally launched as a pro [[European Union]] campaign during a convention in [[Milan]] on 11 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/499815/forza-europa|title=Forza Europa (Convention)|agency=Radio Radicale|date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event saw the participation of leading public figures, including [[Mario Monti]], [[Francesco Rutelli]], [[Emma Bonino]] (leader of the [[Italian Radicals]], who had recently parted ways from the [[Transnational Radical Party]]), [[Carlo Scognamiglio]] (leader of [[The Liberals (Italy)|The Liberals]]), as well as some members of the [[Civics and Innovators]] (CI) group in the Chamber of Deputies ([[Andrea Mazziotti]], [[Gianfranco Librandi]] and [[Stefano Dambruoso]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/02/11/forza-europa_n_14690928.html|title=Forza Europa, Monti, Rutelli e Bonino a Milano con Della Vedova|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign soon became a structured association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dire.it/04-05-2017/119324-della-vedova-vi-spiego-forza-europa-radicali-pro-ue-video|title=Della Vedova: "Vi spiego Forza Europa, radicali pro-Ue"|agency=Dire|date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carretta|first=David|url=http://www.ilfoglio.it/esteri/2017/05/09/news/elezione-macron-francia-vista-da-bruxelles-133617|title=L'Ue è più timida dei neoeuropeisti entusiasti organizzati e in marcia|newspaper=Il Foglio|date=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Signore|first=Adalberto|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/bandiera-europeista-non-stata-ammainata-solo-berlusconi-lha-1389452.html|title=La bandiera europeista non è stata ammainata: solo Berlusconi l'ha capito|newspaper=il Giornale|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an active role played by [[Piercamillo Falasca]] and [[Carmelo Palma]], who had been part of Della Vedova's inner circle since the years as Radical.

In June 2017 Della Vedova introduced FE to the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] (ALDE Party) in [[Brussels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/07/26/il-sovranismo-europeo-si-riunisce-a-roma-per-arginare-di-maio_a_23048836|title=Calenda "benedice" il movimento europeista di Della Vedova|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, for their part, ALDE leaders had also been trying to unite FE, [[Civic Choice]] (SC), the Radicals and other left-leaning liberals, in order to build the Italian section of the ALDE Party, a goal they have long missed, most notably with the SC-dominated [[European Choice]] list in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Italy)|2014 European Parliament election]] (0.7% of the vote).

In July 2017 FE organised a convention in [[Rome]], which was seen as the beginning of its transformation into a full-fledged party. The event was attended by Bonino, Mazziotti, Librandi, [[Umberto Ranieri]] and [[Carlo Calenda]] ([[Italian Minister of Economic Development|minister of Economic Development]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.affaritaliani.it/affari-europei/forza-europa-della-vedova-lancia-il-nuovo-movimento-con-calenda-bonino-491711.html|title=Forza Europa, Della Vedova lancia il nuovo movimento con Calenda e Bonino|website=affaritaliani.it|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carugati|first=Andrea|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/07/30/italia/cronache/debutta-il-partito-forza-europa-calenda-si-toglie-labito-da-tecnico-NQeYcmNuOHykojZcqFpi1I/premium.html|title=Debutta il partito “Forza Europa”.

In November 2017 FE, the Radicals and some CI members launched [[More Europe]] (+E), a pro-Europeanist list for the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]], led by Bonino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carugati |first= Andrea|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/11/23/italia/politica/i-radicali-alle-elezioni-da-soli-la-nuova-lista-si-chiamer-europa-9vVPiGh2xoYXqExCOow4cP/pagina.html |title=I radicali alle elezioni da soli: la nuova lista si chiamerà “+ Europa” |newspaper=La Stampa |date= 23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Paudice |first=Claudio |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/23/bonino-vara-europa-e-lascia-la-porta-aperta-al-pd-ma-sulle-firme-e-missione-impossibile_a_23286375 |title=Bonino vara +Europa e lascia la porta aperta al Pd.

The list won 2.6% of the vote in the election, falling short of the 3% threshold, and no FE member was elected neither in single-seat constituencies (Della Vedova missed the election in the constituency of [[Prato]], [[Tuscany]] for 1.5% of the vote).&lt;ref&gt;https://elezionistorico.interno.gov.it/index.php?tpel=C&amp;dtel=04/03/2018&amp;tpa=I&amp;tpe=L&amp;lev0=0&amp;levsut0=0&amp;lev1=12&amp;levsut1=1&amp;lev2=1&amp;levsut2=2&amp;lev3=1&amp;levsut3=3&amp;ne1=12&amp;ne2=121&amp;ne3=1211&amp;es0=S&amp;es1=S&amp;es2=S&amp;es3=S&amp;ms=S&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018 FE's first assembly elected Della Vedova president, Mazziotti vice president, Falasca secretary and Palma coordinator of the national board.&lt;ref name="FE_2018-04-22"/&gt;

In July 2018 +E started to organise itself as a full-fledged party. It was decided that a committee, presided by [[Gianfranco Spadaccia]] (a long-time Radical), would lead +E until the founding congress, scheduled for January 2019. The newly-formed committee appointed Della Vedova as coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forzaeuropa.it/europa-e-ripartita&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free Breakfast for School Children Program''' was a community service program run by the [[Black Panther Party]] as an early manifestation of the social mission envisioned by founders [[Huey P. Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] along with their founding of the Oakland Community School, which provided high-level education to 150 children from impoverished urban neighborhoods. Inspired by contemporary research about the essential role of breakfast for optimal schooling, the Panthers would cook and serve food to the poor inner city youth of the area. Initiated in January 1969 at St. Augustine's Church in [[Oakland, California]], the program became so popular that by the end of the year, the Panthers set up kitchens in cities across the US, feeding over 10,000 children every day before they went to school.&lt;ref name=Rise&gt;{{cite web|title=Rise of the Black Panther Party|publisher=Black Panther Party.org|url=http://www.blackpanther.org/legacytwo.htm|accessdate=December 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212065642/http://www.blackpanther.org/legacytwo.htm|archivedate=December 12, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free Breakfast Program became the central organizing activity of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Susan (2008) School Lunch Politics: The Surprising History of America's Favorite Welfare Program. Princeton University Press: Princeton, p.139. https://books.google.ca/books?id=21RB4wX5HdAC&amp;lpg=PA139&lt;/ref&gt; The reach and success of the program in so many communities underscored the inadequacies of the federal government's then-flagging and underresourced lunch programs in public schools across the country. Despite its successes, Federal authorities attempted to discredit and derail the Free Breakfast Program. Among other actions, authorities raided breakfast program locations while children were eating&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J., &amp; Martin, W. E. (2012). Black against Empire : The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party. Berkeley, CA, USA: University of California Press. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

As depicted in the 2015 documentary ''[[The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution]]'', it was [[Huey P. Newton]], upon release from jail in 1970, who revitalized the breakfast program as a key social focus for the Panthers in Oakland; from exile in Algeria, [[Eldridge Cleaver]] protested that prioritizing the breakfast program diluted the true mission of the Black Panther Party, which Cleaver emphasized had to remain an "any means necessary" political opposition to U.S. government practices, thus concretizing a schism in the leadership of the Black Panther Party – into Cleaver vs. Newton factions – that led to its eventual demise.

==Survival Programs==
The Free Breakfast for Children Program was one among more than 60 community social programs created by the Black Panther Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Panther Party Community Programs (1966-1982)|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/blackpanthers/programs.shtml|publisher=The Black Panther Party Research Project|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were renamed Survival Programs in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Churchill|first1=Ward|authorlink1=Ward Churchill|editor1-last=Cleaver|editor1-first=Kathleen|editor2-last=Katsiaficas|editor2-first=George|title=Liberation, Imagination and the Black Panther Party: A New Look at the Black Panthers and Their Legacy|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=1-135-29832-7|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_tNQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=%22Free%20Breakfast%20for%20Children%22%20black%20panther&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter='To Disrupt, Discredit and Destroy' The FBI's Secret War against the Black Panther Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These were operated by Party members under the slogan "survival pending revolution." Another Survival Program started by the Black Panther Party was referred to as "medical self-defense" with the creation of healthcare clinics and their own ambulance services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/black-panther-party-stands-health|title=The Black Panther Party Stands for Health {{!}} Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|website=www.mailman.columbia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago==
[[Fred Hampton]], leader of the Chicago local, helped organize a number of community programs. These included five different breakfast programs on the West Side, a free medical center, a door to door program of health services (which offered testing for sickle cell anemia), and blood drives for the [[Cook County Hospital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spieler|first1=Geri|title=Taking Aim at the President: The Remarkable Story of the Woman Who Shot at Gerald Ford|date=2009|publisher=St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-61023-1|page=99|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=eg2Ed3efhEMC&amp;lpg=PA99|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Chicago party also reached out to local gangs to clean up their acts, get them away from crime and bring them into the class war. The Party's efforts met with wide success, and Hampton's audiences and organized contingent grew by the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Baggins| first =Brian| title =History of the Black Panther Party |publisher =Marxists Internet Archive| url =http://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/| accessdate =2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galician Party of the Proletariat''' (PGP) was a party galician [[Galician nationalism|independentist]] and [[Marxism-leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] party formed in March 1978, as a continuation of [[Galician People's Union-Proletarian Line]], a split of the original [[Galician People's Union]]. The Central Committee was clandestine, and even the party militants didn't know the members of it. Tha party supported armed struggle, which considered as [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] and anti-oligarchic. Its official magazine was called Sempre en Galiza.&lt;ref&gt;''Always in Galiza'', a clear reference to the book of [[Alfonso Daniel Rodríguez Castelao]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1979 [[Galician Unity]] included, as independent candidates, several militants of the PGP in their lists for the [[Spanish local elections, 1979|municipal elections]]. In those elections the PGP got three of its members elected as town councillors ([[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Monforte de Lemos]] and [[Vilaboa]]). The PGP also constituted a platform that ran the elections in the municipality of [[Vigo]]&lt;ref&gt;The list gained 1,926 votes (2.22%) and no seats in [[Vigo]]. http://www.infoelectoral.interior.es/min/busquedaAvanzadaAction.html&lt;/ref&gt; and supported other lists, obtaining 2 town councillors in [[Salvaterra de Miño]].&lt;ref&gt;With the name [[Asemblea de Viciños do Condado]], that also included independent candidates. [http://www.novasgz.com/pdf/ngz103.pdf Novas da Galiza. 15 de JunHo a 15 de JulHo de 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The PGP also presented several lists, under the common name of ''Agrupación Electoral Galicia Ceibe'' in other towns, without gaining any representation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muros, A Coruña]], [[As Pontes de García Rodríguez]], [[O Barco de Valdeorras]], [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[A Coruña]] and [[Ourense]]. [http://www.novasgz.com/pdf/ngz103.pdf Novas da Galiza. 15 de JunHo a 15 de JulHo de 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Spanish municipal elections, 1979|local elections]], the party formed [[Galiza Ceibe-OLN]] as its ''mass front'' and [[Loita Armada Revolucionaria]] as its ''armed wing''. The emergence of [[Loita Armada Revolucionaria]] caused the police arrest in 1980 of several leaders of the organization, including [[Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín]]. The party also had a remarkable influence in the [[Intersindical Nacional dos Traballadores Galegos]].

The party stopped working in 1980.

'''Geniocracy''' is the framework for a [[Government#Forms of government|system of government]] which was first proposed by Raël (leader of the [[Raëlian Church|International Raëlian Movement]]) in 1977 and which advocates problem-solving, creative [[intelligence]] and compassion as criteria for [[governance]].&lt;ref name="Geniocracy"&gt;Raël, ''[http://rael.org/download.php?view.182 Geniocracy]''. ''Nova Distribution'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Raëlism}}
==Definition==
{{See also|Intelligence|Genius}}
[[Image:Geniocracy.gif|178px|thumb|The book cover of [[Claude Vorilhon|Rael]]'s book ''Geniocracy: Government of the People, for the People, by the Geniuses'' (Printed for the first time in English: 2008  Nova Distribution.)]]
The term ''geniocracy'' comes from the word ''[[genius]]'', and describes a system that is designed to select for [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and compassion as the primary factors for governance. While having a democratic electoral apparatus, it differs from traditional [[liberal democracy]] by instead suggesting that candidates for office and the body electorate should meet a certain minimal criterion of problem-solving or creative intelligence. The thresholds proposed by the Raëlians are 50% above the mean for an electoral candidate and 10% above the mean for an elector.&lt;ref name="Geniocracy"/&gt;

===Justifying the method of selection===
This method of selectivity is deliberate so as to address what the concept considers to be flaws in the current systems of [[democracy]]. The primary object of criticism is the inability of majoritarian consensus to provide a reasonable platform for intelligent decision making for the purpose of solving problems permanently. Geniocracy's criticism of this system is that the institutions of democracy become more concerned with appealing to popular consensus through [[Emotive (sociology)|emotive]] issues than they are in making long-term critical decisions, especially those that may involve issues not immediately relevant to the electorate. It asserts that political mandate is something far too important to simply leave to popularity, and asserts that the critical decision making required for government, especially in a world of [[globalization]], cannot be based on criteria of emotive or popular decision making. In this respect, Geniocracy derides liberal democracy as a form of "[[Mediocracy]]".&lt;ref name="Geniocracy"/&gt; In a geniocracy Earth would be ruled by a worldwide Geniocratic government.&lt;ref name="Sitting down with Raelians, awaiting aliens"&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-7869250.html Sitting down with Raelians, awaiting aliens], ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''. 10 September 2001. Retrieved 6 October 2007. [https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Someday%2C+Pinsonneault+says%2C+Earth+will+be+a+worldwide+%22geniocracy%2C%22+ruled+by+geniuses.+they+will+be+elected%2C+But+only+intelligent+people+will+have+The+right&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 ''(highlight)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins in Ancient Greece ===
An early precursor to geniocracy is the [[Political philosophy|political ideas]] of [[Plato]]. Considered to be the first political scientist, Plato believed government should be ruled by "[[Philosopher king|philosopher kings]]" with high intelligence and compassion. His ''[[Allegory of the Cave]]'' exemplifies these ideas. He believed the masses to be too uneducated to rule. 

==Agenda==
{{Raelian books}}
{{See also|Economic humanitarianism (Raëlianism)}}
Part of the geniocratic agenda is to purport the idea of a [[world government]] system, deriding the current state-system as inadequate for dealing with contemporary [[global issue]]s that are typical of globalisation, such as [[environmentalism]], [[social justice]], [[human rights]], and the current economic system. In line with this, geniocracy proposes a different economic model called [[Economic humanitarianism (Raëlianism)|Economic Humanitarianism]].&lt;ref name="Geniocracy"/&gt;

===Response to criticism===
As a response to its controversial attitudes about selectivity one of the more general responses is to point out that [[universal suffrage]], the current system, already discriminates to some degree and varyingly in different countries, in who is allowed to vote. Primarily, this discrimination is against minors, foreigners, incarcerated [[felony|felon]]s, and the mentally incapacitated. This is on the basis that their ability to contribute to the decision making process is either flawed or invalid for the purpose of the society.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Status===
{{Forms of government}}
The current difficulty in the ideas of geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. One idea offered by Raël in ''Geniocracy'' is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, a series of tests that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.

Other components deemed necessary for a more rounded understanding of intelligence include concepts like [[emotional intelligence]]. As such, geniocracy's validity cannot really be assessed until better and more objective methods of intelligence assessment are made available.

The matter of confronting moral problems that may arise is not addressed in the book ''Geniocracy''; many leaders may be deeply intelligent and charismatic (having both high emotional/social intelligence and IQ) according to current means of measuring such factors, but no current scientific tests are a reliable enough measure for one's ability to make humanitarian choices (although online tests such as those used by retail chains to select job applicants may be relevant).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The lack of scientific rigour necessary for inclusion of geniocracy as properly testable political ideology can be noted in number of modern and historical [[dictatorships]] as well as [[oligarchy|oligarchies]]. Because of the controversies surrounding geniocracy, Raël presents the idea as a classic utopia or provocative ideal and not necessarily a model that humanity will follow.&lt;ref name="Raelians and Cloning: Are They for Real?"&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2003/mi_rael.htm Raelians and Cloning: Are They for Real?], ''Zenit News Agency''. 16 January 2003. Retrieved 25 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratically defined regions===
The author of ''Geniocracy'' recommends (though does not necessitate) a world government with 12 regions. Inhabitants would vote for which region they want to be part of. After the regions are defined, they are further divided into 12 sectors after the same principle of democracy is applied.  While sectors of the same region are defined as having equal numbers of inhabitants, the regions themselves may have different levels of population, which would be proportional to its voting power.&lt;ref name="Geniocracy"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6803">The '''Hammarskjöld family''', also known as '''Hammarskiöld family''', is a Swedish noble family, enrolled in ''Riddarhuset'' (English: "[[House of Nobility (Sweden)|House of Nobility]]") with the number of 135.

The founder of the family was Peder Mikaelsson (c. 1560–1646), the Governor of [[Borgholm Castle]]. He fought for [[Sigismund III Vasa|King Sigismund]] at [[Stångebro]] in 1598 and was knighted in 1610 with the name of ''Hammarskiöld''. He was married twice.  His first wife was Beata Körning, daughter of the ''slottslov'' ("castle commander") Erik Matsson Körning and Kjerstin Hand. His second wife, a cousin of Beata, was Christina Stjerna, the daughter of Peder Månsson Stjerna (number 77 in ''Riddarhuset'') and Karin Hand. The two marriages produced children but the issue from his first wife went out early on the "sword side" (''svärdssidan'', literally "without any male heirs").

As early as 1607 Peder Mikaelsson Hammarskiöld received as his properties the manors in the present [[Oskarshamn Municipality]] – Misterhult, Virbo and Fårbo – and, in the present [[Vimmerby Municipality]], Tuna, all in the modern [[Kalmar County]] for providing five fully armed men for the defense.  Tuna is still a family estate for the Hammarskjölds, and the church there houses the family mausoleum for them. The family was introduced to ''Riddarhuset'' in 1628. The son of the second marriage, Major Arvid Hammarskjöld, married Anna Dorothea Patkull. The Hammarskjöld dynasty continued with their son, Colonel Carl Gustaf Hammarskjöld, who married Baroness Hedvig Ulfsparre of Broxvik, whose mother belonged to the Stake family (number 47 in ''Riddarhuset'').

A younger branch of the family has been partners and managing directors of [[Skultuna mässingsbruk|Skultuna Messingbruk]], a Swedish manufacturer of cuff links in [[Skultuna]] near [[Västerås]] in [[Västmanland]], by intermarriage with the Adlerwald family. In 2014, there are 61 persons who bear the Hammarskjöld or Hammarskiöld surname in Sweden.

[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|400px|Territories colonized by European, Russian, Turkish, American, and Japanese powers since 1492]]
The historical phenomenon of [[colonization]] is one that stretches around the globe and across time.  Modern [[sovereign state|state]] global colonialism, or [[imperialism]], began in the 15th century with the "[[Age of Discovery]]", led by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], and then by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] exploration of the [[Americas]], the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, India and [[East Asia]]. The  
[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish empires]] were the first [[List of largest empires|global empires]] because they were the first to stretch across different continents, covering vast territories around the globe. In 1492, notable [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (Italian)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/columbus "Columbus"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Columbus Columbus - Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] and his [[Castilian people|Castilian]] (Spanish) crew discovered the [[Americas]] for the [[Crown of Castile]]. The phrase "[[the empire on which the sun never sets]]" was first used for the Spanish Empire in the 16th century. During the late 16th and 17th centuries, [[Kingdom of England|England]], France and the [[Dutch Republic]] also established their own overseas empires, in direct competition with each other. 

The end of the 18th and early 19th century saw the first era of [[decolonization]], when most of the European colonies in the Americas gained their independence from their respective [[metropole]]s. Spain was irreversibly weakened after the loss of their [[New World]] colonies, but the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (uniting Scotland with England and Wales), France, Portugal, and the Dutch turned their attention to the Old World, particularly South Africa, India and [[South East Asia]], where coastal enclaves had already been established. 
The [[second industrial revolution]], in the 19th century, led to what has been termed the era of [[New Imperialism]], when the pace of colonization rapidly accelerated, the height of which was the [[Scramble for Africa]], in which Belgium, Germany and Italy were also participants.

There were conflicts between colonizing states and revolutions from colonized areas shaping areas of control and establishing independent nations. During the 20th century, the colonies of the defeated central powers in [[World War I]] were distributed amongst the victors as [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]], but it was not until the end of [[World War II]] that the second phase of decolonization began in earnest.

{{Main|Portuguese Empire|Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
European colonization of both [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere]]s has its roots in Portuguese exploration. There were financial and religious motives behind this exploration. By finding the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]], the Portuguese could reap its profits for themselves. They would also be able to probe the existence of the fabled Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]], with an eye to encircling the Islamic [[Ottoman Empire]], itself gaining territories and colonies in Eastern Europe. The first foothold outside of Europe was gained with the conquest of [[Ceuta]] in 1415. During the 15th century, Portuguese sailors discovered the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]], [[Azores]], and [[Cape Verde]], which were duly populated, and pressed progressively further along the west African coast until [[Bartolomeu Dias]] demonstrated it was possible to sail around Africa by rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, paving the way for [[Vasco da Gama]] to reach India in 1498.

Portuguese successes led to Spanish financing of a mission by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 to explore an alternative route to Asia, by sailing west. When Columbus eventually made landfall in the Caribbean [[Antilles]] he believed he had reached the coast of India, and that the people he encountered there were Indians with red skin. This is why [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been called Indians or red-Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-are-native-Americans-called-Indians-or-red-Indians|title=Why are native Americans called Indians or red Indians? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In truth, Columbus had [[Discovery of the Americas|arrived on a continent]] that was new to the Europeans, the Americas.

After Columbus' first trips, competing Spanish and Portuguese claims to new territories and sea routes were solved with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which divided the world outside of Europe in two areas of trade an exploration, between the Iberian kingdoms of Castile and Portugal along a north-south meridian, 370 leagues west of [[Cape Verde]]. According to this international agreement, the larger part of the Americas and the [[Pacific Ocean]] were open to Spanish exploration and colonization, while [[Africa]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and most of Asia were assigned to Portugal.

The boundaries specified by the Treaty of Tordesillas were put to the test in 1521 when [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and his Spanish sailors (among other europeans)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2210-7886_asc-27452|title=27452, 1863-07-22, [FOSSETT ; et a.]|website=Art Sales Catalogues Online|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sailing for the Spanish Crown became the first European to cross the Pacific Ocean,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=history.com|title=Ferdinand Magellan|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/ferdinand-magellan|website=history.com|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching [[Guam]] and the Philippines, parts of which the Portuguese had already explored, sailing from the Indian Ocean. The two by now global empires, which had set out from opposing directions, had finally met on the other side of the world. The conflicts that arose between both powers were finally solved with the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]] in 1529, which defined the areas of Spanish and Portuguese influence in Asia, establishing the anti meridian, or line of demarcation on the other side of the world.

During the 16th century the Portuguese continued to press both eastwards and westwards into the Oceans. Towards Asia they made the first direct contact between Europeans and the peoples inhabiting present day countries such as [[Mozambique]], [[Madagascar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[East Timor]] (1512), China, and finally Japan. In the opposite direction, the Portuguese colonized the huge territory that eventually became Brasil, and the Spanish [[conquistadores]] established the vast Viceroyalties of [[New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]], and later of [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]] (Argentina) and [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (Colombia). In Asia, the Portuguese encountered ancient and well populated societies, and established a seaborne empire consisting of armed coastal trading posts along their trade routes (such as [[Goa]], [[Malacca]] and [[Macau]]), so they had relatively little cultural impact on the societies they engaged. In the Western Hemisphere, the European colonization involved the emigration of large numbers of settlers, soldiers and administrators intent on owning land and exploiting the apparently primitive (as perceived by Old World standards) [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The result was that the colonization of the New World was catastrophic: native peoples were no match for European technology, ruthlessness, or their diseases which decimated the [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population]].

Spanish treatment of the indigenous populations caused a fierce debate, the [[Valladolid Controversy]], over whether Indians possessed souls and if so, whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind. [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], author of ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'', championed the cause of the native peoples, and was opposed by [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda|Sepúlveda]], who claimed [[Amerindians]] were "natural slaves".

The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] played a large role in Spanish and Portuguese overseas activities. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Jesuits]], and [[Franciscans]], notably [[Francis Xavier]] in Asia and [[Junípero Serra]] in North America, were particularly active in this endeavour. Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau]] and the [[La Santisima Trinidad de Paraná|Santisima Trinidad de Paraná]] in [[Paraguay]], the latter an example of the [[Jesuit Reductions]]. The Dominican and Franciscan buildings of [[Spanish missions in California|California's missions]] and [[Spanish missions in New Mexico|New Mexico's missions]] stand restored, such as [[Mission Santa Barbara]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and [[San Francisco de Asis Mission Church]] in [[Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico]].

[[File:Colonization of the Americas 1750.PNG|thumb|200px|Map indicating the territories colonized by the European powers over the Americas in 1750 (mainly Spain, Portugal and France at the time).]]
As characteristically happens in any colonialism, European or not, previous or subsequent, both Spain and Portugal profited handsomely from their newfound overseas colonies: the Spanish from gold and silver from mines such as [[Potosí]] and [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacateca]] in [[New Spain]], the Portuguese from the huge markups they enjoyed as trade intermediaries, particarlarly during the [[Namban]] [[Japanese history|Japan]] trade period. The influx of precious metals to the Spanish monarchy's coffers allowed it to finance costly [[religious war]]s in Europe which ultimately proved its economic undoing: the supply of metals was not infinite and the large inflow caused inflation and debt, and subsequently affected the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Levack, Muir, Veldman, Maas, Brian (2007).

===Northern European challenges to the Iberian hegemony===
It was not long before the exclusivity of Iberian claims to the Americas was challenged by other up and coming European powers, primarily the Netherlands, France and England: the view taken by the rulers of these nations is epitomized by the quotation attributed to [[Francis I of France]] demanding to be shown the clause in Adam's will excluding his authority from the New World.

This challenge initially took the form of piratical attacks (such as those by [[Francis Drake]]) on Spanish treasure fleets or coastal settlements, but later the Northern European countries began establishing settlements of their own, primarily in areas that were outside of Spanish interests, such as what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, or islands in the Caribbean, such as [[Aruba]], [[Martinique]] and [[Barbados]], that had been abandoned by the Spanish in favour of the mainland and larger islands.

Whereas Spanish colonialism was based on the religious conversion and exploitation of local populations via [[encomienda]]s (many Spaniards emigrated to the Americas to elevate their social status, and were not interested in manual labour), Northern European colonialism was bolstered by those emigrating for religious reasons (for example, the ''[[Mayflower]]'' voyage). The motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat or to spread one's faith but to start a new society afresh, structured according to the colonists wishes. The most populous emigration of the 17th century was that of the English, who after a series of wars with the Dutch and French came to dominate the [[Thirteen Colonies]] on the eastern coast of the present day United States and other colonies such as Newfoundland and Rupert's Land in what is now Canada.

However, the English, French and Dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the Spanish and Portuguese, and whilst their areas of settlement in the Americas proved to be devoid of the precious metals found by the Spanish, trade in other commodities and products that could be sold at massive profit in Europe provided another reason for crossing the Atlantic, in particular furs from Canada, tobacco and cotton grown in [[Virginia]] and sugar in the islands of the Caribbean and Brazil. Due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour, plantation owners had to look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops. They turned to the centuries-old slave trade of west Africa and began transporting Africans across the Atlantic on a massive scale – historians estimate that the [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought between 10 and 12 million African (mostly black skinned) slaves to the New World. The islands of the Caribbean soon came to be populated by slaves of African descent, ruled over by a white minority of plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their home country to spend it.

===Role of companies in early colonialism===
From its very outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture. Columbus' voyages to the Americas were partially funded by Italian investors, but whereas the Spanish state maintained a tight rein on trade with its colonies (by law, the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special [[Spanish treasure fleet|convoys]]), the English, French and Dutch granted what were effectively trade [[monopolies]] to [[Joint stock company|joint-stock companies]] such as the [[East India Company|East India Companies]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] had no state sponsored expeditions or colonization in the Americas, but did charter the first Russian joint-stock commercial enterprise, the [[Russian America Company]], which did sponsor those activities in its territories.

===European colonies in India===
[[File:Clive.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Clive]] meeting with [[Mir Jafar]] at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, painted by [[Francis Hayman]]]]
{{Main|European colonies in India}}

In May 1498, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] set foot in [[Kozhikode]] in [[Kerala]], making them the first Europeans to sail to India. Rivalry among reigning European powers saw the entry of the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[English overseas possessions|English]], [[French India|French]], [[Danish India|Danish]] and others. The kingdoms of [[History of India|India]] were gradually taken over by the Europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet rulers. In 1600, Queen [[Elizabeth I]] accorded a [[charter]], forming the [[East India Company]] to trade with India and eastern Asia. The English landed in India in [[Surat]] in 1612. By the 19th century, they had assumed [[British India|direct]] and [[Princely states|indirect]] control over most of India.

==Independence in the Americas (1770–1820)==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
{{See also|Colonization of Canada}}
During the five decades following 1770, Britain, France, Spain and Portugal lost many of their possessions in the Americas.

===Britain and the Thirteen Colonies===
{{Main|Thirteen Colonies|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War|United States Declaration of Independence}}

After the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, Britain had emerged as the world's dominant power, but found itself mired in debt and struggling to finance the Navy and Army necessary to maintain a global empire. The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]'s attempt to raise taxes from North American colonists raised fears among the Americans that their rights as "Englishmen", and particularly their rights of self-government, were in danger.

From 1765, a series of disputes with Parliament over taxation led to the [[American Revolution]], first to informal [[committees of correspondence]] among the colonies, then to coordinated protest and resistance, with an important event in 1770, the [[Boston Massacre]]. A [[standing army]] was formed by the [[Thirteen Colonies|United Colonies]], and [[United States Declaration of Independence|independence was declared]]  by the Second [[Continental Congress]] on 4 July 1776.

The Patriots fought the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Formal acts of rebellion against British authority began in 1774 when the Patriot Suffolk Resolves effectively abolished the legal government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and expelled all royal officials. The tensions caused by this would lead to the outbreak of fighting between Patriot militia and British regulars at Lexington and Concord in April 1775.

The [[American War of Independence]] continued until 1783, when the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed. Britain recognised the sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded by the British possessions to the North, [[Florida]] to the South, and the Mississippi River to the west.

===France and the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804)===
The [[Haitian Revolution]], a slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]], established [[Haïti]] as a free, black [[republic]], the first of its kind. Haiti became the second independent nation that was a former European colony in the [[Western Hemisphere]] after the United States. Africans and people of African ancestry freed themselves from slavery and colonization by taking advantage of the conflict among whites over how to implement the reforms of the [[French Revolution]] in this slave society. Although independence was declared in 1804, it was not until 1825 that it was formally recognized by [[King Charles X of France]].

===Spain and the Wars of Independence in Latin America===
[[File:Independence in the Americas c.1830.png|thumb|Independent republics in the Americas, c. 1830.]]
{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Latin American wars of independence}}
The gradual decline of Spain as an imperial power throughout the 17th century was hastened by the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14), as a result of which it lost its European imperial possessions. The death knell for the Spanish Empire in the Americas was Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian peninsula in 1808. With the installation of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] on the Spanish throne, the main tie between the metropole and its colonies in the Americas, the Spanish monarchy, had been cut, leading the colonists to question their continued subordination to a declining and distant country.

With an eye on the events of the American Revolution forty years earlier, revolutionary leaders began bloody wars of independence against Spain, whose armies were ultimately unable to maintain control. By 1831, Spain had been ejected from the mainland of the Americas, leaving a collection of independent republics that stretched from Chile and Argentina in the south to Mexico in the north. Spain's colonial possessions were reduced to [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], the Philippines and a number of small islands in the Pacific, all of which she was to lose to the United States in the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]] or sell to Germany shortly thereafter.

===Portugal and Brazil===
Brazil was the only country in Latin America to gain its independence without bloodshed. The invasion of Portugal by [[Napoleon]] in 1808 had forced King [[João VI]] to escape to Brazil and establish his court in Rio de Janeiro. For thirteen years, Portugal was ruled from Brazil (the only instance of such a reversal of roles between colony and metropole) until his return to Portugal in 1821. His son, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro]], was left in charge of Brazil and in 1822 he declared independence from Portugal and himself the Emperor of Brazil. Unlike Spain's former colonies which had abandoned the monarchy in favour of republicanism, Brazil therefore retained its links with its monarchy, the [[House of Braganza]].

The next to arrive were the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], the [[English overseas possessions|English]]—who set up a trading-post in the west-coast port of [[Surat]] in 1619—and the French. The internal conflicts among Indian Kingdoms gave opportunities to the European traders to gradually establish political influence and appropriate lands. Although these continental European powers were to control various regions of southern and eastern India during the ensuing century, they would eventually lose all their territories in India to the British, with the exception of the French outposts of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] and [[Chandannagar|Chandernagore]], the Dutch port in [[Travancore]], and the Portuguese colonies of [[Goa]], [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], and [[Diu, India|Diu]].

This was the first political foothold with territorial implications that the British had acquired in India.

The East India Company monopolized the trade of Bengal. They introduced a land taxation system called the [[Permanent Settlement]] which introduced a [[feudalism|feudal]]-like structurea (See ''[[Zamindar]]'') in Bengal. By the 1850s, the East India Company controlled most of the Indian sub-continent, which included present-day Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]]. Their policy was sometimes summed up as [[Divide and Rule]], taking advantage of the enmity festering between various princely states and social and religious groups.

The first major movement against the British Company's high handed rule resulted in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], also known as the "Indian Mutiny" or "Sepoy Mutiny" or the "First War of Independence". After a year of turmoil, and reinforcement of the East India Company's troops with British soldiers, the Company overcame the rebellion. The nominal leader of the uprising, the last Mughal emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]], was exiled to Burma, his children were beheaded and the Moghul line abolished. In the aftermath all power was transferred from the East India Company to the [[British Crown]], which began to administer most of India as a colony; the Company's lands were controlled directly and the rest through the rulers of what it called the [[Princely states]]. There were 565 princely states when the Indian subcontinent gained independence from Britain in August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1762146.stm Kashmir: The origins of the dispute], BBC News, 16 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other European Empires in India ===
{{Main|French India|Portuguese India}}

Like the other European colonists, the French began their colonisation via commercial activities, starting with the establishment of a factory in Surat in 1668. The French started to settle down in India in 1673, beginning with the purchase of land at Chandernagore from the Mughal Governor of Bengal, followed by the acquisition of Pondicherry from the Sultan of Bijapur the next year. Both became the centres of the maritime commercial activities that the French conducted in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/a-french-colony-that-fought-the-british/article3595158.ece|title=A French colony that fought the British|last=Ganesan|first=V.

Similar to the situation in Tahiti and Martinique, the French colonial administrative area was insular, but, in India, the French authority was isolated on the peripheries of a British-dominated territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=50ZWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=french+colonization+in+india&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nxq_Qtfl5a&amp;sig=8m50kw7FUIDBVaAqxr0Vm_Wf-pA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir99C876LXAhWIMo8KHckqCS04ChDoAQhAMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20colonization%20in%20india&amp;f=false|title=Narratives of the French Empire: Fiction, Nostalgia, and Imperial Rivalries, 1784 to the Present|last=Marsh|first=Kate|date=2013-08-28|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739176573|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early eighteenth century, the French had become the chief European rivals of the British. During the eighteenth century, it was highly possible for the Indian subcontinent to have succumbed to French control, but the defeat inflicted on them in the Seven Years War (1756–1763) permanently curtailed French ambitions. The Treaty of Paris of 1763 restored the original five  to the French while making it clear that France could not expand its control beyond these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=50ZWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=french+colonization+in+india&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nxq_Qtfl5a&amp;sig=8m50kw7FUIDBVaAqxr0Vm_Wf-pA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir99C876LXAhWIMo8KHckqCS04ChDoAQhAMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20colonization%20in%20india&amp;f=false|title=Narratives of the French Empire: Fiction, Nostalgia, and Imperial Rivalries, 1784 to the Present|last=Marsh|first=Kate|date=2013-08-28|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739176573|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the Portuguese occupation of India can be traced back to the arrival of Vasco da Gama near Calicut on 20 May 1498. Soon after this, other explorers, traders and missionaries followed. By 1515, the Portuguese were the strongest naval power in the Indian Ocean and the Malabar Coast was dominated by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=R.

==New Imperialism (1870–1914)==
{{Main|New Imperialism}}
[[File:World empires and colonies around World War I.png|thumb|right|Empires of the world in 1910]]

The policy and ideology of European colonial expansion between the 1870s (circa opening of [[Suez Canal]] and [[Second Industrial Revolution]]) and the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 are often characterised as the "[[New Imperialism]]." The period is distinguished by an unprecedented pursuit of what has been termed "empire for empire's sake," aggressive competition for overseas territorial acquisitions and the emergence in colonising countries of doctrines of racial superiority which denied the fitness of subjugated peoples for self-government.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison M. Wright, ed. ''The "New Imperialism": Analysis of Late Nineteenth Century Expansion'' (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Seton-Watson, ''The new imperialism'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Europe's powers added nearly 8,880,000 square miles (23,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²) to their overseas colonial possessions. As it was mostly unoccupied by the Western powers as late as the 1880s, Africa became the primary target of the "new" imperialist expansion (known as the [[Scramble for Africa]]), although conquest took place also in other areas — notably south-east Asia and the East Asian seaboard, where Japan joined the European powers' scramble for territory.&lt;ref&gt;Parker Thomas Moon, ''Imperialism and world politics'' (1926), online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berlin Conference]] (1884–1885) mediated the imperial competition among Britain, France and Germany, defining "effective occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of colonial claims and codifying the imposition of [[wikt:direct rule|direct rule]], accomplished usually through armed force.

In Germany, rising [[pan-Germanism]] was coupled to imperialism in the ''[[Alldeutsche Verband]]'' ("Pangermanic League"), which argued that Britain's world power position gave the British unfair advantages on international markets, thus limiting Germany's economic growth and threatening its security.

Asking whether colonies paid, economic historian Grover Clark argues an emphatic "No!"  He reports that in every case the support cost, especially the military system necessary to support and defend the colonies outran the total trade they produced.  Apart from the British Empire, they were not favored destinations for the immigration of surplus populations.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Leslie Buell,  "Do Colonies Pay?"   [http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1936aug01-00006?View=PDF ''The Saturday Review,'' August 1, 1936 p 6 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The scramble for Africa===
[[File:Colonial Africa 1913 map.svg|thumb|European territories in Africa, 1914, following the [[Scramble for Africa]].]]
{{Main|Scramble for Africa}}

Africa was the target of the third wave of European colonialism, after that of the Americas and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham, ''The scramble for Africa: The White Man's conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Many European statesmen and industrialists wanted to accelerate the [[Scramble for Africa]], securing colonies before they strictly needed them. As a champion of [[Realpolitik]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] disliked colonies and thought they were a waste of time, but his hand was forced by pressure from both the elites and the general population which considered the colonization a necessity for German prestige. German colonies in [[Togo]]land, [[Samoa]], [[South-West Africa]] and [[New Guinea]] had corporate commercial roots, while the equivalent German-dominated areas in East Africa and China owed more to political motives. The British also took an interest in Africa, using the [[East Africa Company]] to take over what are now Kenya and Uganda. The British crown formally took over in 1895 and renamed the area the East Africa Protectorate.

[[Leopold II of Belgium]] personally owned the [[Congo Free State]] from 1885 to 1908, When round after round of international scandal regarding the abusive treatment of native workers forced the Belgium government to take full ownership and responsibility. The [[Dutch Empire]] continued to hold the [[Dutch East Indies]], which was one of the few profitable overseas colonies.

In the same manner, [[Italian Empire|Italy]] tried to conquer its "[[place in the sun]]," acquiring [[Somaliland]] in 1899–90, [[Eritrea]] and 1899, and, taking advantage of the "[[Sick man of Europe]]," the [[Ottoman Empire]], also conquered [[Tripolitania]] and [[Cyrenaica]] (modern [[Libya]]) with the 1911 [[Italo-Turkish War|Treaty of Lausanne]]. The conquest of [[Ethiopia]], which had remained the last African independent territory, had to wait till the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] in 1935–36 (the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] in 1895–96 had ended in defeat for Italy).

The [[Portuguese colonial empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish colonial empire]] were smaller, mostly legacies of past colonization. Most of their colonies had acquired independence during the [[Latin American wars of independence|Latin American revolutions]] at the beginning of the 19th century.

===Imperialism in Asia===
{{Main|Western imperialism in Asia}}

In Asia, [[The Great Game]], which lasted from 1813 to 1907, opposed the British Empire against [[Imperial Russia]] for supremacy in [[central Asia]]. [[History of China|China]] was opened to Western influence starting with the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s (1839–1842; 1856–1860). After the visits of Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1852–1854, Japan opened itself to the Western world during the [[Meiji Era]] (1868–1912).

Imperialism also took place in Burma, Indonesia (Netherlands East Indies), Malaya and the Philippines. Burma had been under British rule for nearly a hundred years, however, it was always considered an “imperial backwater”. This accounts for the fact that Burma does not have an obvious colonial legacy and is not a part of the Commonwealth. In the beginning, in the mid-1820s, Burma was administered from Penang in Britain’s Straits Settlements. However, it was soon brought within British India, of which it remained a part until 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=H5qxOL6w5p4C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=,+in+the+mid-1820s,+Burma+was+administered+from+Penang+in+Britain%E2%80%99s+Straits+Settlements&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jBiKd_ImoZ&amp;sig=N4jxovuulbm2KKm8Bz4NHIUmaqQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiowZ3DxaXXAhUOO7wKHTuMAmQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=,%20in%20the%20mid-1820s,%20Burma%20was%20administered%20from%20Penang%20in%20Britain%E2%80%99s%20Straits%20Settlements&amp;f=false|title=Burma Redux: Global Justice and the Quest for Political Reform in Myanmar|last=Holliday|first=Ian|date=2012-03-06|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231504249|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burma was governed as a province of India, not considered very important, and barely any accommodation was made to Burmese political culture or sensitivities. As reforms began to move India towards independence, Burma was simply dragged along.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/3558192/The-shared-history-of-Britain-and-Burma.html|title=The shared history of Britain and Burma|last=Myint-U|first=Thant|date=2008-05-10|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-War Period (1918–1939)==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
{{Further|Aftermath of World War I|League of Nations Mandate}}

The colonial map was redrawn following the defeat of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First World War]] (1914–18). Colonies from the defeated empires were transferred to the newly founded [[League of Nations]], which itself redistributed it to the victorious powers as [[League of Nations Mandate|"mandates"]].

The secret 1916 [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] partitioned the Middle East between Britain and France. French mandates included [[French mandate of Syria|Syria]] and [[French mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]], whilst the British were granted [[British mandate of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. The bulk of the Arabian peninsula became the independent Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1922. The discovery of the world's largest easily accessible crude oil deposits led to an influx of Western [[oil companies]] that dominated the region's economies until the 1970s, and making the emirs of the oil states immensely rich, enabling them to consolidate their hold on power and giving them a stake in preserving Western hegemony over the region.

During the 1920 and 1930s [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] moved towards independence, although the British and French did not formally depart the region until they were forced to do so after World War II.

===Japanese imperialism===
{{Main|Japanese imperialism|Empire of Japan}}

For Japan, the second half of the nineteenth century was a period of internal turmoil succeeded by a period of rapid development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinacke|first=Harold M.|date=1933|title=Japanese Imperialism|jstor=1875849|journal=The Journal of Modern History|volume=5|issue=3|pages=366–380|doi=10.2307/1875849}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being closed for centuries to Western influence, Japan opened itself to the West during the [[Meiji Era]] (1868–1912), characterized by swift modernization and borrowings from European culture (in law, science, etc.) This, in turn, helped make Japan the modern power that it is now, which was symbolized as soon as the 1904–1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]]: this war marked the first victory of an Asian power against a European imperial power, and led to widespread fears among European populations (first appearance of the "[[Yellow Peril]]"). During the first part of the 20th century, while China was still subject to various European imperialisms, Japan became an imperialist power, conquering what it called a "[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]".

With the final revision of treaties in 1894, Japan may be considered to have joined the family of nations on a basis of equality with the western states. From this same time imperialism became a dominant motive in Japanese policy.

Japan ruled over and governed Korea and Taiwan from 1895 when the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was concluded to 1945 when Japan was defeated. In 1910, Korea was formally annexed to the [[Japanese Empire]]. According to the Korean, The [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonization of Korea]] was particularly brutal, even by 20th-century standards. This brutal colonization included the use of Korean "[[comfort women]]" who were forced to serve as sex slaves in Japanese Army brothels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ki-Jung|first=Kim|title=The Road to Colonization: Korea Under Imperialism, 1897-1910|journal=Korea Journal|date=1998-01-01|volume=38|issue=4|pages=36–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Japanese army units based in [[Manchuria]] seized control of the region; full-scale war with China followed in 1937, drawing Japan toward an overambitious bid for Asian hegemony (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere), which ultimately led to defeat and the loss of all its overseas territories after World War II (see Japanese expansionism and Japanese nationalism). As in Korea, the Japanese treatment of the Chinese people was particularly brutal as exemplified by the Nanjing Massacre.

==Second Decolonization (1945–99)==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|Dates of [[Decolonization of Africa|independence of African countries]].]]
{{Main|Decolonization}}

Anticolonialist movements had begun to gain momentum after the close of World War I, which had seen colonial troops fight alongside those of the metropole, and U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s speech on the [[Fourteen Points]]. However, it was not until the end of World War II that they were fully mobilised. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1941 [[Atlantic Charter]] declared that the signatories would "respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live". Though Churchill subsequently claimed this applied only to those countries under Nazi occupation, rather than the British Empire, the words were not so easily retracted: for example, the legislative assembly of Britain's most important colony, India, passed a resolution stating that the Charter should apply to it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=boimCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT249&amp;lpg=PT249&amp;dq=india+resolution+atlantic+charter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S29xRmUcJs&amp;sig=G6Me9v9Vg-E_NlGt50qa17AXtWE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN9ebIz5DXAhULKY8KHUR6Biw4ChDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=india%20resolution%20atlantic%20charter&amp;f=false|title=India's War: The Making of Modern South Asia, 1939-1945|last=Raghavan|first=Srinath|date=2016-03-31|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9781846145438|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, the United Nations (UN) was founded when 50 nations signed the [[Charter of the United Nations|UN Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/decolonization/charter.shtml|title=The United Nations and Decolonization|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included a statement of its basis in the respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. In 1952, demographer [[Alfred Sauvy]] coined the term "[[Third World]]" in reference to the French [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16329442|title=Seeing the world differently|date=2010-06-10|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-27|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression distinguished nations that aligned themselves with neither the [[Western world|West]] nor the [[Soviet Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. In the following decades, decolonization would strengthen this group which began to be represented at the United Nations. The Third World's first international move was the [[Bandung Conference|1955 Bandung Conference]], led by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] for [[History of India|India]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] for [[History of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]] for [[History of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The Conference, which gathered 29 countries representing over half the world's population, led to the creation of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/bandung-conf|title=Milestones: 1953–1960 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the U.S. had first opposed itself to colonial empires, the Cold War concerns about Soviet influence in the Third World caused it to downplay its advocacy of popular sovereignty and decolonization. France thus had a free hand in the [[First Indochina War]] (1946–54) and in the [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954–62). Decolonization itself was a seemingly unstoppable process. In 1960, after a number countries gained independence, the UN had reached 99 members states: the [[decolonization of Africa]] was almost complete. In 1980, the UN had 154 member states, and in 1990, after [[Namibia]]'s independence, 159 states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth in United Nations Membership, 1945–2005 |publisher=United Nations |year=2000 |accessdate=8 October 2006 |url=https://www.un.org/Overview/growth.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117212320/http://www.un.org/Overview/growth.htm |archivedate=17 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the USSR and China===
The [[Soviet Union]] was a main supporter of decolonization movements. While the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], created in 1961 following the [[Bandung Conference|Bandung 1955 Conference]], was supposedly neutral, the "Third World" being opposed to both the "First" and the "Second" Worlds, [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] concerns, as well as the refusal of the U.S. to support decolonization movements against its NATO European allies, led the national liberation movements to look increasingly toward the East. However, [[History of China|China's]] appearance on the world scene, under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]], created a rupture between the Soviet Union and independentists movements. Globally, the non-aligned movement, led by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (India), [[Josip Broz Tito]] (Yugoslavia) and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] (Egypt) tried to create a block of nations powerful enough to be dependent on neither the United States nor the Soviet Union, but finally tilted towards the U.S.S.R, while smaller independence movements, both by strategic necessity and ideological choice, were supported either by Moscow or by Peking. The Cuban government, led by [[Fidel Castro]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, was at first neutral before turning itself towards Moscow. Cuba also sponsored independence movements in Angola and Mozambique. Few independence movements were totally independent from foreign aid.

== Postcolonialism ==
{{Main|Postcolonialism}}
Postcolonialism is a term used to recognise the continued and troubling presence and influence of colonialism within the period we designate as after-the-colonial. It refers to the ongoing effects that colonial encounters, dispossession and power have in shaping the familiar structures (social, political, spatial, uneven global interdependencies) of the present world. Postcolonialism, in itself, questions the end of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jazeel|first=Tariq|date=2012|title=Postcolonialism: Orientalism and the geographical imagination|jstor=24412174|journal=Geography|volume=97|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.2307/24412174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10757">[[Tonga]] is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a population of approximately 130,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;2010 Human Rights Reports: Tonga (US State Department).&lt;/ref&gt; Politics and the economy are dominated by the king, the nobility, and a few prominent commoners. Economic, social and cultural rights are generally well respected. There are, however, a number of issues concerning protection of [[civil and political rights]], particularly freedom of expression, and rights to political participation. [[Violence against women]] is a serious issue.

==International treaties==
Tonga joined the [[United Nations]] in 1999. It is party to two of the nine core human rights treaties - the Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]) and the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayefsky.com/html/tonga_t1_ratifications.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927132455/http://www.bayefsky.com/html/tonga_t1_ratifications.php |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, during its [[Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], Tonga accepted recommendations to ratify some of the other treaties including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]), and the Convention Against Torture ([[Convention Against Torture|CAT]]).&lt;ref&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Tonga A/HRC/8/48 (5 June 2008), para 63(3)(5)(6)(7).&lt;/ref&gt; Although public consultation has taken place in relation to ratification of CEDAW, opponents are concerned and protested that it could open the way for same-sex marriage and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;www.radionz.co.nz[http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/323856/tonga-govt-sends-cedaw-back-to-the-public]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional protections==
Domestic human rights protections include a Declaration of Rights in the 1875 [[Constitution of Tonga]].  This protects a number of civil and political rights such as prohibition of slavery (clause 2), equality before the law (clause 4), freedom of religion (clause 5), freedom of speech (clause 7), and a number of criminal procedure rights (clauses 9-16). Notable omissions from the Declaration of Rights are the [[right to life]], freedom from [[torture]], [[freedom from discrimination]] and comprehensive protections for economic and social rights.

==Women's rights==
{{See|Women's rights in Tonga}}

Along with [[Palau]], Tonga is one of only two countries in the Pacific region (and seven countries in the world) which is yet to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]]). In September 2009, the Tongan Legislative Assembly voted 18 to 1 with 4 abstentions not to ratify CEDAW. In announcing the decision not to ratify, the Tongan Prime Minister stated that ratification 'would cut across our cultural and social heritage that makes up the Tongan way of life.' &lt;ref&gt;"Tongan Parliament decides not to ratify CEDAW" (Press Release, 18 September 2009), para 3. Retrieved 2011-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Tonga did not want to ratify with reservations or undertake a 'ratification of convenience.' &lt;ref&gt;"Tongan Parliament decides not to ratify CEDAW" (Press Release, 18 September 2009), para 4. Retrieved 2011-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Tonga enacted the ''Family Protection Act 2013''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crownlaw.gov.to/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/2013/2013-0018/FamilyProtectionAct2013_1.pdf |format=PDF |title=FAMILY PROTECTION ACT 2013 |website=Crownlaw.gov.to |accessdate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against women appears to be pervasive in Tonga, although there is limited empirical data available. According to the Tongan [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] Legal Literacy Project of the Catholic Women's League, estimates suggest that between 31% and 62% of women are victims of violence by an intimate partner.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Summary of Stakeholder Submissions: Tonga A/HRC/ WG.6/2/TON/3 (11 April 2008), para 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marital rape]] was criminalised in 2013. &lt;ref&gt; Section 29 of the ''Family Protection Act 2013'' reads: "Subject  to  clause  12  of  the  Constitution,  in  addition  to  liability under this  Act,  a  respondent  may  also  be  prosecuted  under  other  criminal laws for  the  time  being  in  force for  his acts if the facts disclose the commission of a  separate  criminal offence  under those provisions. ''Note'': For  example,  (without  limitation),  assault,  offences  endangering  life  and  health, grievous bodily harm, '''rape''', other sexual offences, murder and manslaughter  and sexual exploitation through people trafficking and smuggling" [http://crownlaw.gov.to/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/2013/2013-0018/FamilyProtectionAct2013_1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are able to lease land, but they are unable to own land. Inheritance to land title passes through male heirs. This is a significant barrier to economic empowerment of women in Tonga.&lt;ref&gt;"Female economic empowerment in Tonga has a long way to go" (Women and Child Crisis Centre, Tonga, 1 September 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of expression==
Although the Constitution provides for [[freedom of speech]] and of the press, these rights are not always protected in practice. Politicians and media outlets seeking greater democracy often have their rights curtailed. For example, since 2008, the board of the government-owned Tonga Broadcasting Commission has directed that all programming be reviewed by TBC appointed censors prior to broadcast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There are also a number of cases where attempts to limit media freedom have been challenged. See for example, ''Utoikamanu v Lali Media Group Ltd'' &lt;ref&gt;''Utoikamanu v Lali Media Group Ltd'' [2003] TOCA; 6 CA 4/03 &amp; 10/03 (25 July 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Taione v Kingdom of Tonga''.&lt;ref&gt;''Taione v Kingdom of Tonga'' [2004] TOSC 47; CV 374/ 2004 (15 October 2004 Webster CJ).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political participation==

An ongoing issue in Tonga for many years has been the absence of full representative democracy. After a process of constitutional reform, in the November 2010 elections, a majority of the seats (17 out of 26) in the Tongan Parliament were elected by [[universal suffrage]], with the remaining nine seats being reserved for members of Tonga's nobility. This marked a shift away from the 165-year rule of the monarchy towards a fully representative democracy.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Strong showing for Tonga democrats in election|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11845570|date=2010-11-26|newspaper=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Times of Tonga|Taimi Media Network]] described it as "Tonga’s first democratically elected Parliament".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taimionline.com/articles/4154 "Absence of PM from opening of Parliament questioned"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316143322/http://www.taimionline.com/articles/4154 |date=2012-03-16 }}, Taimi Media Network, 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual minorities==
{{See|LGBT rights in Tonga}}

Sodomy is illegal in Tonga, with a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment, although there have been no prosecutions for such offences in recent years. During its Universal Periodic Review in 2008, Tonga rejected three recommendations from the Netherlands, Canada and the Czech Republic to decriminalise same-sex conduct and one recommendation from Bangladesh to continue to criminalise same-sex conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Tonga A/HRC/8/48 (5 June 2008), para 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Tonga noted that “[w]hilst current laws might criminalise certain consensual sexual conduct, Tonga is a Christian society that believes in tolerance and respect across difference. A respect for difference allows the widest margin of appreciation to lawmakers as well as other stakeholders and encourages robust debate about equality within society.”&lt;ref&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on Universal Periodic Review: Tonga A/HRC/8/48 (8 June 2008), para 65.&lt;/ref&gt; This response leaves Tonga's position open for  future UPR reviews which may eventually result in a positive human rights outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Baird "The Universal Periodic Review as a Legacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Potential Pacific Impact" in NZIIA and NZHRC ''Celebrating Human Rights: Sixty Years of the Universal Declaration'' (2009) at p 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National human rights institution==
Tonga does not have a national human rights institution. There is however a Public Complaints Commissioner who receives and investigates complaints about government departments. The Tongan Government has also indicated that it is considering establishing a national human rights institution.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Tonga A/HRC/8/48 (5 June 2008), para 63(23) and (24).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital punishment==
{{See|Capital punishment in Tonga}}
The death penalty is legal in Tonga, but has not been imposed since 1982. Tonga is considered an abolitionist in practice. Tonga and [[Papua New Guinea]] are the last Pacific Island countries to retain the death penalty.

'''Human rights issues in northeast India''' have been widely reported in the press and by human rights activists.&lt;ref name=Bendangjungshi&gt;{{cite book|last=Bendangjungshi|title=Confessing Christ in the Naga Context: Towards a Liberating Ecclesiology|year=2012|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3643900715|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakma&gt;{{cite book|last=Chakma|first=Suhas|title=Racism Against Indigenous Peoples|year=2001|publisher=International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|isbn=978-8790730468|editor=Marianne Jensen|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northeast India]] refers to the easternmost region of [[India]] consisting of the states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Manipur]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]], [[Sikkim]], and [[Tripura]], as well as parts of northern [[West Bengal]] (districts of [[Darjeeling]], [[Jalpaiguri]], and [[Koch Bihar]]).

==Background==
An ongoing separatist struggle has continued in the region since the late 1940s, making it the longest running separatist struggle in [[South Asia]]. There are multiple parties involved in the struggles including different ethnic groups and states, some of whom want total independence from India while others call for a restructuring of the states.&lt;ref name=Nepram&gt;{{Cite report

There are existing territorial conflicts within the Northeastern states, including between [[Manipur]] and [[Nagaland]], Nagaland and Assam, Meghalaya and Assam, and Mizoram and Assam. These are often based on historical border disputes and differing ethnic, tribal or cultural affinities.{{citation needed |date=August 2012}} There has been a number of [[Insurgency|insurgent activities]] and regional movements in all parts of the northeast, often unique in character to each state. Military action by the armed and paramilitary forces and political action have led to the intensity of these insurgencies fluctuating and to the resolution of the insurgency in Mizoram.{{citation needed |date=August 2012}}

Human rights abuses on the part of Indian forces in the area are frequently traced to immunity granted to Indian security forces under the [[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act|Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958]]. The act has been criticized by [[Human Rights Watch]] as a "tool of state abuse, oppression and discrimination".&lt;ref name=CouncilForeignRelations&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/17155/crisis_in_kashmir.html "Crisis in Kashmir"] [[Council on Foreign Relations]] &lt;!--retrieved September 29, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Documentation Centre|The South Asian Human Rights Documentation Centre]] argues that the governments' call for increased force is part of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/08/17/india-repeal-armed-forces-special-powers-act India: Repeal Armed Forces Special Powers Act; 50th Anniversary of Law Allowing Shoot-to-Kill, Other Serious Abuses. [[Human Rights Watch]]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|"This reasoning exemplifies the vicious cycle which has been instituted in the North East due to the AFSPA. The use of the AFSPA pushes the demand for more autonomy, giving the people of the North East more reason to want to secede from a state which enacts such powers and the agitation which ensues continues to justify the use of the AFSPA from the point of view of the Indian Government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/resources/armed_forces.htm AFSPA] South Asian HRDC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A report by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis points to multiple occurrences of violence by security forces against civilians in Manipur since the passage of the Act.&lt;ref name=IDSAmAFSPA&gt;[http://www.idsa.in/strategicanalysis/ManipurandArmedForcesSpecialPowerAct1958_akamboj_1004 Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, 'Manipur and Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958'] "the alleged rape and killing of Manjab Manorama", "security forces have destroyed homes", "arrests without warrants", "widespread violations of humane rights", "The cases of Naga boys of Oinam village being tortured before their mothers by Assam rifles Jawans in July 1987; the killing of Amine Devi and her child of Bishnupur district on April 5, 1996 by a CRPF party; the abduction, torture and killing of 15-year-old Sanamacha of Angtha village by an Assam Rifles party on 12th February 1998; the shooting dead of 10 civilians by an Assam Rifles party in November 2000 are some of the glaring examples that are still fresh in the mind of Manipuris."&lt;/ref&gt; The report states that residents believe that the provision for immunity of security forces urge them to act more brutally.&lt;ref name=IDSAmAFSPA1&gt;[http://www.idsa.in/publications/strategic-analysis/2004/oct/Anil%20Khamboj.pdf  Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, 'Manipur and Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712213448/http://www.idsa.in/publications/strategic-analysis/2004/oct/Anil%20Khamboj.pdf |date=12 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Violence broke out between [[Bodo people|Bodo]] tribes and [[Muslim]] migrant settlers in the [[Kokrajhar]] district of Assam on 20 July 2012, leaving at least 45 people dead and approximately 300,000 displaced in the month of July. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the fighting has led to a strict curfew, with police being given "shoot at sight" orders for curfew violators. Multiple police shootings were reported after the order was given.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/27/india-rescind-shoot-sight-orders-assam India: Rescind "Shoot at Sight" Orders in Assam], 27 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of sexual assault==

Women are mostly raped during army crackdowns where men of the villages or towns are gathered outside their homes and women are forced to stay indoors.

'''Jacob Leisler''' (ca. 1640 – May 16, 1691) was a German-born colonist in the Province of New York. He gained wealth in [[New Amsterdam]] (later New York City) in the [[fur trade]] and tobacco business. In what became known as [[Leisler's Rebellion]] following the [[Glorious Revolution|English Revolution of 1688]], he took control of the city, and ultimately the entire province, from appointees of deposed King [[James II of England|James II]], in the name of the Protestant accession of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].

Beginning in 1689, Leisler led an insurrection and seized control of the city by taking over [[Fort Amsterdam|Fort James]] at the lower end of Manhattan. He took over control of the entire province, appointing himself as acting Lieutenant Governor of the [[Province of New York]], which he retained until March 1691, refusing to yield power until the newly appointed governor himself finally arrived. While Leisler claimed to have acted to support the Protestant accession against [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] officeholders in New York, he was arrested by the newly appointed governor of New York in March 1691. With opponents active against him, he was condemned and executed in [[New York City]] for [[treason]] against the English monarchs William III and Mary II. His estate was forfeited to the Crown.

During his period of control, Leisler completed a major purchase of property from [[John Pell]], lord of Pelham Manor, to set up a [[French Huguenot]] settlement north of Manhattan. This developed as the city of [[New Rochelle, New York]].

Leisler's son and supporters found the trial and conviction most unjust; it was mounted by his enemies. They worked to clear the names of Leisler and [[Jacob Milborne]] (his son in law) and for the restoration of their estates to their heirs, which was achieved in 1695 by an act of Parliament. Remains of the two men were reinterred with honors at the Dutch Reformed Church in Manhattan.

==Early life==
Leisler was born in the village of [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]], now a central part of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], in March 1640, the son of [[Calvinist]] French Reformed minister Jacob Victorian Leisler. After his father's death in 1651, Leisler was sent to military school.&lt;ref name="voorhees"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voorhees|first1=David|title=The 'fervent zeale' of Jacob Leisler|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 1994|volume=51|issue=3|page=455|jstor=2947438|doi=10.2307/2947438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to [[New Amsterdam]] (later New York) in 1660 as a soldier in the service of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. Leaving the company's employ soon after his arrival, Leisler engaged in the lucrative [[fur trade]] and tobacco trade, and became a wealthy man.&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Leisler, Jacob|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York tax records from 1676 list Leisler as the third wealthiest man in the city.&lt;ref name="voorhees2"&gt;{{harvnb|Voorhees|1994|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1674, Leisler was one of the administrators of a forced loan imposed by [[Anthony Colve]].&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; While residing in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in 1676, Leisler engaged in a theological dispute with the Rev. [[Nicholas van Rensselaer (minister)|Nicholas van Rensselaer]], who had been appointed to the Reformed pulpit by James, Duke of York (later King [[James II of England|James II]]).&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt; His finances and reputation both suffered from this encounter, as he and a fellow dissenter [[Jacob Milborne]] were forced to pay all the costs of a lawsuit they had initiated in the dispute.&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Leisler, Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on a voyage to Europe in 1678, he was captured by [[Moorish]] [[pirate]]s, and was compelled to pay a ransom of 2,050 [[pieces of eight]] to obtain his freedom.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

Leisler had endeared himself to the common people by befriending a family of French [[Huguenot]]s who had been landed on [[Manhattan island]]. They were so destitute that a public tribunal had decided they should be sold into [[slavery]] in order to pay their ship charges. Leisler prevented the sale by purchasing the freedom of the widowed mother and son before the sale could be held. French Huguenots were arriving in New York as refugees from religious persecution by Catholics in France. Under [[Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick|Thomas Dongan's]] administration in 1683, Leisler was appointed one of the judges, or "commissioners," of the court of admiralty in New York, a [[justice of the peace]] for New York City and County, and a militia captain.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

==Leisler's rebellion==
{{main|Leisler's Rebellion}}
The [[Glorious Revolution|English Revolution of 1688]] also played out in [[New York (state)|New York]], where people of a wide variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds divided into two well-defined factions. In general, the small shopkeepers, small farmers, sailors, poor traders and artisans allied against the [[patroon]]s (landholders), rich [[fur trade|fur-traders]], merchants, lawyers and crown officers. The former were led by Leisler (himself a wealthy man), the latter by [[Peter Schuyler]], [[Nicholas Bayard]], [[Stephen Van Cortlandt]], William Nicolls and other representatives of the aristocratic [[Hudson Valley]] families. The Leislerians claimed greater loyalty to the [[Protestant]] accession.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

In 1688, Governor Dongan was succeeded by Lieutenant-Governor [[Francis Nicholson]]. In 1689, the military force of the city of New York consisted of a regiment of five companies, with Leisler as one of the company captains. He was popular with the men and was probably the only wealthy resident in the province who sympathized with the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] lower classes. At that time, the latter were agitated owing to the attempts of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] office-holders to retain power in spite of the [[Glorious Revolution|revolution in England]] and the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] to the throne.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt; When news was received that Governor Sir [[Edmund Andros]] had been imprisoned in [[Boston]] by the opposition, the Leislerians took possession, on May 31, 1689, of [[Fort Amsterdam|Fort James]] at the southern end of [[Manhattan Island]]. They renamed it Fort William and announced their determination to hold it until the arrival of a governor commissioned by the new sovereigns.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

On a report that supporters of [[James II of England|King James II]] were about to seize the fort and massacre their Dutch fellow-citizens, an armed mob gathered on the evening of 2 June 1689 to overthrow the existing government. The cry of "Leisler" was raised, and the crowd rushed to his house. At first, he refused to lead the movement, but when the demand was reiterated he acceded, and within an hour received the keys of the fort, which had been seized. The revolutionaries took advantage of the fort containing all the public funds, which  return Lieutenant Governor Nicholson demanded in vain.

Four hundred of the new party signed an agreement to hold the fort "for the present Protestant power that reigns in England," while a committee of safety of ten of the city freeholders assumed the powers of a provisional government, of which they declared Jacob Leisler to be the head. They commissioned him as "captain of the fort." In this capacity, he began to repair the fort, strengthening it with a battery of six guns beyond its walls. This was the origin of the public park known as [[Battery Park|the Battery]] in Lower Manhattan.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt; Thus began [[Leisler's Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

===Leisler as acting lieutenant-governor===
The aristocrats also favored deposing James, but preferred to continue the provincial government established by his authority rather than risk the danger of an interregnum.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Nicholson and the council of the province, with the authorities of the city, headed by Mayor Stephen van Cortlandt, attempted to prevent the uprising, but without effect. Finally, becoming alarmed for his own safety, Lieutenant-Governor Nicholson sailed for England on the 24th of June. The New York City mayor and other officials retired to Albany.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

Albany held out against Leisler's authority for a time. In November, Leisler sent Jacob Milborne to Albany with an armed force to assist in its defense against any Indians.  Milborne was directed to withhold aid unless Leisler's authority was recognized. This was refused, and Milborne returned unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;  But after the [[Schenectady massacre|destruction of Schenectady]] on February 19, 1690, by the French and their allied Indians, Christian Mohawk among them, Albany submitted to Leisler's authority.&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Leisler, Jacob|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under authority of a letter from the home government addressed to Nicholson, "or in his absence, to such as for the time being takes care for preserving the peace and administering the laws in His Majesty's province of New York," Leisler had assumed the title of lieutenant-governor in December 1689.  He dissolved the committee of safety, appointed a council, and took charge of the government of the entire province.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Leisler, Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed [[Jacob Milborne]] as Clerk to the Council, Attorney-General, Advocate General and his Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nycourts.gov/history/legal-history-new-york/history-new-york-legal-eras-01.html| title= The Supreme Court of the Province of New York 1674-1776|publisher= Historica Society of the New York Courts|accessdate = 5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milborne married Leisler's daughter Mary.

Leisler summoned the first Intercolonial Congress in America, which met in New York on May 1, 1690, to plan concerted action against the [[France|French]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in [[King William's War|the ongoing conflict]] in North America.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; The congress planned an expedition against [[Canada, New France|Canada]]. It equipped and dispatched against Quebec the first fleet of men-of-war ever sent from the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|Port of New York]]. However, the expedition was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="americana"/&gt;

In the meantime, Colonel [[Henry Sloughter]] had been commissioned Governor of the Province of New York by William and Mary on September 3, 1689, but he did not reach New York until March 19, 1691.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

===Leisler and the Huguenots===
Acting on behalf of a group of [[Huguenots]] in New York, Leisler brokered the purchase of land upon which they could settle. In 1689 [[John Pell]], Lord of Pelham Manor, officially deeded 6,100 acres (25&amp;nbsp;km²) to Leisler for the establishment of a Huguenot community north of Manhattan. On September 20, 1689, Leisler donated a third of this land to Huguenot refugees.&lt;ref name="voorhees3"&gt;{{harvnb|Voorhees|1994|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the purchase money, Leisler and his heirs and assigns were to yield and pay unto John Pell and his heirs and assigns (Lords of the Pelham Manor) one "Fat Calf" yearly, as acknowledgment of their feudal obligation to the Manor.&lt;ref&gt;''New York - A Guide to The Empire State'', [[Work Projects Administration]] of New York, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement developed as the city of [[New Rochelle, New York]].&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

===End of the rebellion===
[[Image:LeislersDeathWarrant.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Howard Pyle]]'s depiction of Governor Sloughter signing Leisler's death warrant]]
On January 28, 1691, English Major [[Richard Ingoldesby]], who had been commissioned Lieutenant Governor of the province, landed with two companies of soldiers in Manhattan and demanded possession of Fort James. Leisler refused to surrender the fort without an order from the king or the governor. After some controversy, Ingoldesby attacked the fort on 17 March, during which Leisler's forces killed two of his soldiers and wounded several.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

When Governor Sloughter finally arrived in New York the following March, he immediately demanded Leisler's surrender. Leisler refused to surrender the fort until he was convinced of Sloughter's identity and the governor had sworn in his council. As soon as the latter event occurred, he wrote the governor a letter resigning his command.

Sloughter responded by arresting Leisler and nine of his colleagues, including his son-in-law Jacob Milborne. All but Milborne were released after trial. Leisler was imprisoned, charged with treason and murder. Shortly afterward he was tried and condemned to death. His son-in-law and secretary, Milborne, was condemned on the same charges. Leisler's son and other supporters were outraged by the trials, as they were considered unjust. The judges were the personal and political enemies of the prisoners, and their acts were described as "gross." &lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;&lt;!-- This needs expansion - who was acting against Leisler at the time? --&gt;

Governor Sloughter was said to have hesitated to sign the death-warrants, but was trying to stabilize politics in the colony and did not have sufficient influence among the elite of New York City. He was said to finally sign the warrants under the influence of wine.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

On the 16 May 1691, Leisler and Milborne were executed.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; The court had sentenced them to be hanged "by the Neck and being Alive their bodyes be Cutt downe to Earth and Their Bowells to be taken out and they being Alive, burnt before their faces. . ."{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} (In fact, the real villain [Robert Livingston] later bragged in writing that the pair were spared the disemboweling and were cut down before dead and decapitated by sword. The crowd then began fighting over their heads to acquire hair as a souvenir.) and by the English law of treason, their estates were forfeited to the Crown. Leisler's son and other supporters appealed for justice from the committee of the [[Privy Council]]; it reported that, although the trial was in conformity to the forms of law, they nevertheless recommended the restoration of the estates to their heirs.

==Restitution==
In 1695, by an act of Parliament, achieved through the efforts of Leisler's son and supporters, the names of Jacob Leisler and Milborne were cleared. Leisler's estate was restored to his heirs. Three years later the [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|Earl of Bellomont]], who had been one of the most influential supporters of Leisler's son, was appointed as governor of New York. Through his influence the assembly voted an indemnity to Leisler's heirs.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Elsie Tymens, the widow of Pieter Cornelisz van der Veen in 1663.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mary Leisler, who married [[Jacob Milborne]] (c.1648-1691)
As stated above, Leisler, along with Milborne were executed in New York on 16 May 1691.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

Some descendants of Leisler use his surname as a middle name. The most prominent of them is [[Walther Leisler Kiep]], a [[Christlich Demokratische Union|CDU]] politician.

==Legacy and honors==
*Governor Bellomont authorized the honorable reburial of Leisler and his son-in-law at the Dutch Reformed Church in New York City.&lt;ref name="appletons"/&gt;
*In June 1913 a monument to Jacob Leisler was dedicated in New Rochelle, New York, by the Huguenot Chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and the Huguenot Association of New Rochelle, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of its founding and honor his role. Leisler has been described as the "first Governor of Colonial New York to owe his position to the popular suffrage."&lt;ref name="play"/&gt; 
*In June 1913 William O. Bates published his play, ''Jacob Leisler: A Play of Old New York,'' about the leader and the dramatic events of his life.&lt;ref name="play"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/06/29/100272243.pdf "Jacob Leisler; New Rochelle's Founder Taken as Hero in Drama"], ''New York Times'', 29 June 1913, accessed 13 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirkpatrick Sale''' (born June 27, 1937) is an [[independent scholar]] and [[author]] who has written prolifically about political decentralism, [[environmentalism]], [[luddism]] and technology. He has been described as having a "philosophy unified by [[decentralism]]"&lt;ref&gt;John F. Mongillo, Bibi Booth, Editors, ''Environmental activists,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n42Rf_ibaMcC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=kirkpatrick+sale+decentralist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XXWYTfv9MOfI0QHtoPCADA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=16&amp;ved=0CHUQ6AEwDw#v=onepage&amp;q=deentralist&amp;f=false p. 245], 2001, {{ISBN|0-313-30884-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30884-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as being "a leader of the [[Neo-Luddite]]s,"&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kevin Kelly, [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/saleskelly_pr.html Interview with the Luddite], ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; an "[[anti-globalization]] [[Left-wing politics|leftist]],"&lt;ref name=Untied&gt;Schwenkler, John (2008-11-03) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2008/nov/03/00019/ Untied{{Not a typo}} States], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and "the [[:wikt:theoretician|theoretician]] for a new [[secession]]ist movement."&lt;ref name=Applebome&gt;[[Peter Applebome]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/nyregion/18towns.html A Vision of a Nation No Longer in the U.S.], ''[[New York Times]]'', October 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Sale grew up in [[Cayuga Heights]], [[Ithaca, New York]], and would later say of the village that he "spent most of my first twenty years there, and that has made an imprint on me—on my philosophy, social attitudes, certainly on my politics—that has lasted powerfully for the rest of my life."&lt;ref&gt;Sale, Kirkpatrick. [http://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2009/05/the-importance-of-growing-up-village/ The Importance of Growing Up Village], ''[[Front Porch Republic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Cornell University]], majoring in English and history, in 1958.&lt;ref name=Farina&gt;[http://www.richardandmimi.com/cornell.html Richard and Mimi Farina "fan site"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thinkquest&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/26026/People/kirkpatrick_sale.html Biography of Kirkpatrick Sale], [[Thinkquest]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328153712/http://library.thinkquest.org/26026/People/kirkpatrick_sale.html |date=2008-03-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as associate editor and editor-in-chief of the student-owned and managed newspaper, the ''[[Cornell Daily Sun]]''. Sale was one of the leaders of the May 23, 1958, protest against university policies forbidding male and female students fraternizing and its ''[[in loco parentis]]'' policy. Sale and his friend and roommate [[Richard Fariña]], and three others, were charged by Cornell. The protest was described in Fariña's 1966 novel, ''[[Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me]].''&lt;ref name=Applebome/&gt; In 1958 he collaborated with [[Thomas Pynchon]] on an unproduced futuristic musical called ''Minstrel Island''.&lt;ref name="Harry Ransom Center"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00442.xml | title=Thomas Pynchon: An Inventory of His Collection | publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] | work=[[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]] | accessdate=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduating in 1958, Sale married Faith Apfelbaum, who later worked as an editor with Thomas Pynchon, [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Joseph Heller]] and [[Amy Tan]]. Faith died in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Weber, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E4DE1031F930A25751C1A96F958260 Obituary: Faith Sale, 63, a Fiction Editor Known as a Writers' Advocate], ''New York Times'', December 13, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sale worked initially in [[journalism]] for the leftist journal ''[[New Leader]]'', "a magazine founded in 1924 in part by [[Socialism|socialists]] [[Norman Thomas]] and [[Eugene Debs]],"&lt;ref name=Radical&gt;[[Jack Hunter (radio host)|Hunter, Jack]] (2011-06-16) [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/radical-kirk/ Radical Kirk], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', before becoming a [[freelance|freelance journalist]]. He spent time in [[Ghana]] and wrote his first book about it. His second book, ''SDS'', was about the radical 1960s group [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]].&lt;ref name=Untied/&gt; The book "is still considered one of the best sources on the youth activist organization that helped define [[New Left#1960s in the United States|1960s radicalism]]."&lt;ref name=Radical/&gt; In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent books explored radical [[decentralist|decentralism]], [[bioregionalism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Truett Anderson|Anderson, Walter Truett]].

==Views==

===History===
In his 1990 book, ''The Conquest of Paradise: Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy'', Sale argued that [[Christopher Columbus]] was an [[imperialist]] bent on conquest from his first voyage. In a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' book review, historian and member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Committee [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote about Sale: "he has set out to destroy the heroic image that earlier writers have transmitted to us. Mr. Sale makes Columbus out to be cruel, greedy and incompetent (even as a sailor), and a man who was perversely intent on abusing the natural paradise on which he intruded." However, McNeill also declares Sale's work to be "unhistorical, in the sense that [it] selects from the often cloudy record of Columbus's actual motives and deeds what suits the researcher's 20th-century purposes." In McNeill's opinion, Columbus' advocates and detractors  present a "sort of history [that] caricatures the complexity of human reality by turning Columbus into either a bloody ogre or a plaster saint, as the case may be."&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DD1739F934A35753C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Review of Kirkpatrick Sale's ''The Conquest of Paradise''], ''[[New York Times]]'', October 7, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Sale "has written extensively and skeptically about technology," and has said he is "a great admirer" of [[Anarchoprimitivism|anarchoprimitivist]] [[John Zerzan]].&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Kenneth (1995-05-07) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DD113FF934A35756C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=zerzan&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all Prominent Anarchist Finds Unsought Ally in Serial Bomber], ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He has described personal computers as "the devil's work"&lt;ref name=Applebome/&gt; and in the past opened personal appearances by smashing one.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; During promotion of his 1995 book ''Rebels Against the Future: The Luddites and Their War on the Industrial Revolution'', Sale debated with ''[[Newsweek Magazine]]'' senior editor and technology columnist [[Steven Levy]] "about the relative merits of the communications age".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njit.edu/v2/News/Releases/3336.htm Kirkpatrick Sale-Steven Levy Debate At New Jersey Institute of Technology Will Address Merits of Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415121632/http://www.njit.edu/v2/News/Releases/3336.htm |date=2008-04-15 }}, February 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sale has said that he does not "care much for [[popular music]] outside some of the [[Tin Pan Alley]] era tunes of the early 20th century."&lt;ref name=Radical/&gt; For example, "he once heard a 'racket' in a nightclub during his left activist days in the 1960s from some 'young man' everyone told him was a 'big deal.' That 'young man' turned out to be [[Bob Dylan]]." Kirk recalls that "he'd never heard anything so awful in his life."&lt;ref name=Radical/&gt;

In 1995, Sale agreed to a public bet with [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] that by the year 2020, there would be a convergence of three disasters: global [[currency]] collapse, significant warfare between rich and poor, and [[environmental disaster]]s of some significant size.  The bet was turned into a claim on the FX [[prediction market]], where the probability has hovered around 25%.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideafutures.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=NLud&amp;uid=2 FX Claim NLud (Claim NLud - Neo-Luddite K. Sale wins bet)], [http://ideafutures.com The Foresight Exchange Prediction Marke] web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secession===

Sale has been described as "one of the intellectual godfathers of the secessionist movement."&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Hedges]], [http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=57734  The New Secessionists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620191612/http://worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=57734 |date=2010-06-20 }}, (also at [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig4/hedges8.html LewRockwell.com], April 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that the major theme of contemporary history, from the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] to the expansion of [[United Nations]] membership from 51 in 1945 to {{UNnum}} nations today, is the breakup of great empires. Some on both left and right call for smaller, less powerful government.&lt;ref name=Applebome/&gt;

In 2004, Sale and members of the [[Second Vermont Republic]] formed the Middlebury Institute which is dedicated to the study of [[separatism]], [[secession]], and [[self-determination]]. Sale is director of the institute. In 2006, Middlebury sponsored the First North American Secessionist Convention, which attracted 40 participants from 16 secessionist organizations and was described as the first gathering of secessionists since the [[American Civil War]]. Delegates issued a statement of principles of secession which they presented as the Burlington Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://middleburyinstitute.org/secessionconvention2006.html Information on the 2006 secession convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121080503/http://middleburyinstitute.org/secessionconvention2006.html |date=2013-01-21 }} and [http://middleburyinstitute.org/burlingtondeclaration2006.html Burlington Declaration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101203754/http://middleburyinstitute.org/burlingtondeclaration2006.html |date=2015-11-01 }} at [http://MiddleburyInstitute.org MiddleburyInstitute.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' interviewed Sale about the Second North American Secessionist Convention, co-hosted by the Middlebury Institute. Sale told the interviewer, "The virtue of small government is that the mistakes are small as well." He went on to say, "If you want to leave a nation you think is corrupt, inefficient, militaristic, oppressive, repressive, but you don't want to move to Canada or France, what do you do? Well, the way is through secession, where you could stay home and be where you want to be."&lt;ref name=Applebome/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://middleburyinstitute.org/secessionconvention2007.html.html Information on the 2007 Secession convention]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at [http://MiddleburyInstitute.org MiddleburyInstitute.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  The convention received worldwide media attention.&lt;ref name="Poovey"&gt;Bill Poovey,

News stories about the Second North American Secessionist Convention in 2007 mentioned the controversial [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]'s allegations that the other co-sponsor, [[The League of the South]], was a "[[racism|racist]] hate group." Sale responded, "They call everybody racists. There are, no doubt, racists in the League of the South, and there are, no doubt, racists everywhere."&lt;ref name="Poovey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt; The Southern Poverty Law Center later criticized ''The New York Times''{{'}} October 2007 Peter Applebombe interview of Sale for not covering its allegations.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Potok, [http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2007/10/23/times-feature-on-sale-left-out-a-fact-or-two/ New York Times Feature on Sale Left Out a Fact or Two], October 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sale wrote the foreword to [[Thomas Naylor]]'s 2008 book ''Secession: How Vermont and all the Other States Can Save Themselves from the Empire.''&lt;ref&gt;''Secession: How Vermont and all the Other States Can Save Themselves from the Empire'', Port Townsend, WA: Feral House, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sale, Thomas Naylor and four others issued "The Montpelier Manifesto" in September, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">The '''Law on Control and Transparency in Business''' ({{lang-de|Gesetz zur Kontrolle und Transparenz im Unternehmensbereich}}) (abbr. '''KonTraG''') is a comprehensive law passed by the German [[Bundestag]] on 5 March 1998. It entered into force on 1 May 1998, although some provisions were adopted at later dates. It set new standards of corporate governance for German publicly listed companies. It is similar to the U.S. [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002.

==Aims and content==
The aim of the KonTraG is to improve [[corporate governance]] in German companies. Several provisions of commercial and company law have been amended by this Act. The KonTraG specifies and expands mainly the provisions of the German [[Commercial code (law)|Commercial Code]] and the [[Stock Corporation Act]]. KonTraG has extended the liability of the management boards, supervisory boards and auditors in companies. The core of the KonTraG is a regulation that forces corporate management to implement and operate a company-wide early risk identification system, as well as to publish statements on risks and the company's risk structure in the management report of the company financial statements.

Section 91(2) of the Law stipulates that the executive board is required to "take appropriate measures, in particular to set up a monitoring system so that developments that jeopardize the continued existence of the company are quickly recognized." Such "existence-threatening developments" usually result from the combined effects of individual risks, which obliges companies to carry out regular risk analysis and risk aggregation. Auditors are also required to review compliance with the new requirements by listed companies, in particular with regard to the existence and operation of a risk management system and the related internal audit activities, and to make them part of the audit report. The basis is the IDW test standard 340 (IDW PS 340).

Additionally, the law requires the supervisory board to appoint the auditors, to receive the audit reports, and to include the auditors in the board's balance sheet meeting. All members of the supervisory board or the audit committee must be provided with the audit reports.

KonTraG does not exclusively concern public limited companies, but also covers the limited partnership on shares (KGaA) and many limited liability companies (GmbH), in particular if there is a codetermined or optional supervisory board. In contrast, the so-called small AG's are largely exempted from compliance with the KonTraG provisions.

The establishment and operation of a company-wide risk management system - such as Management Risk Controlling (MRC) - are critically scrutinized and examined by the banks per [[Basel II]]. For companies that work on the basis of projects (construction companies, large architectural firms, IT system houses), risk management is therefore also part of the project management tasks.

Furthermore, for the first time, the granting of subscription rights to employees and members of the management board from a contingent capital increase pursuant to Section 192 AktG was placed on a legal footing.

'''Layered security''', also known as '''layered defense''', describes the practice of combining multiple mitigating security controls to protect resources and data.

The term bears some similarity to [[Defense in Depth (computing)|defense in depth]], a term adopted from a military strategy that involves multiple layers of defense that resist rapid penetration by an attacker but yield rather than exhaust themselves by too-rigid tactics.  As the incursion progresses, resources are consumed and progress is slowed until it is halted and turned back.  The [[information assurance]] use of the term "defense in depth" assumes more than merely technical security tools deployment; it also implies policy and operations planning, user training, physical access security measures, and direct information assurance personnel involvement in dealing with attempts to gain unauthorized access to information resources.  Within a defense in depth security strategy, layered security is regarded by some{{who|date=February 2012}} as merely a delaying tactic used to buy time to bring security resources to bear to deal with a malicious security cracker's activities.

== Philosophy ==

Layered security is an example of the [[Swiss Cheese model]] (or "cumulative act effect"), used in [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and [[risk management]]. In this model, security systems are likened to multiple slices of [[swiss cheese]], stacked side by side, in which the risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the fact that it must pass through "holes" in the defenses (i.e. not be trapped and detected by each different defense), and these defenses are of different kinds, and locations that are "layered" behind each other.  Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not easily allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a single point of weakness.

=== Commercial ===

For every category of threat, there should be an effective control deployed to mitigate the threat. Security vendors will sometimes cite differing solutions, but most can be grouped under consumer or enterprise categories:

==== Consumer Layered Security Strategy ====
* [[Extended validation]] (EV) SSL certificates
* [[Multifactor authentication]] (also sometimes known as versatile or [[two-factor authentication]])
* [[Single sign-on]] (SSO)
* Fraud detection and [[risk-based authentication]]
* Transaction signing and encryption
* Secure Web and e-mail
* Open fraud intelligence network

==== Enterprise Layered Security Strategy ====
* Workstation application [[whitelisting]]
* Workstation system restore solution
* Workstation and network authentication
* File, disk and removable media encryption
* Remote access authentication
* Network folder encryption
* Secure boundary and end-to-end messaging
* Content control and policy-based encryption

==== Integrated Solutions ====

An "[[ad hoc]]" security strategy, with numerous vendors and an abundance of different, sometimes incompatible security solutions and products can leave gaps in protection, whereas a vertically integrated vendor stack could provide more comprehensive defense. Single-vendor solutions improve [[interoperability]] between [[component architecture|components]] of a complete security strategy, and may offer performance and price benefits over a multi-vendor approach.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==== Best Of Breed Solutions ====

The contrasting commercial security product argument is that a "[[best of breed]]" approach provides more effective protection.  While a single vendor's vertically integrated product stack may be the offering of choice for vendors who want to monopolize a client's or customer's business, it could also be argued that each component of a comprehensive security strategy should be evaluated both for its performance within its niche and its open compatibility with other, non-integrated components of the whole.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

France was a dominant empire possessing many [[colonies]] in various locations around the world. [[First French Empire|The Empire of the French]] (1804–1814), also known as the [[Greater French Empire]] or [[First French Empire]], but more commonly known as the [[Napoleonic Empire]], was the empire of Napoleon I in France. It was the dominant power of much of continental Europe during the early 19th Century.

Napoleon became [[Emperor of the French]] (L'Empereur des Français) on 18 May 1804 and crowned Emperor 2 December 1804, ending the period of the French Consulate, and won early military victories in the War of the Third Coalition against Austria, Prussia, Russia, Portugal, and allied nations, notably at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] (1805) and the [[Battle of Friedland]] (1807). The [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in July 1807 ended two years of bloodshed on the European continent. Subsequent years of military victories known collectively as the Napoleonic Wars extended French influence over much of Western Europe and into Poland. At its height in 1812, the French Empire had 130 ''départements'', ruled over 50 million subjects, maintained extensive military presence in Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Duchy of Warsaw, and could count Prussia and Austria as nominal allies.

Early French victories exported many ideological features of the French Revolution throughout Europe. Napoleon gained support by appealing to some common concerns of French people. These included dislike of the emigrant nobility who had escaped persecution, fear by some of a restoration of the ancien régime, a dislike and suspicion of foreign countries had tried to reverse the Revolution – and a wish by Jacobins to extend France's revolutionary ideals. [[Seigneurial system of New France]] and [[Seigneurial system of New France]] were abolished, aristocratic privileges were eliminated in all places except Poland, and the introduction of the [[Napoleonic Code]] throughout the continent increased legal equality, established jury systems, and legalized divorce. Napoleon placed relatives on the thrones of several European countries and granted many noble titles, most of which expired with the fall of the Empire.

Historians have estimated the death toll from the Napoleonic Wars to be 6.5 million people, or 15% of the French Empire's subjects. The [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain and a number of German States finally defeated France and drove Napoleon Bonaparte into exile on Elba. After Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia, the continental powers joined Russia, Britain, Portugal and the rebels in Spain. With their armies reorganized, they drove Napoleon out of Germany in 1813 and invaded France in 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate and restoring the Bourbons.{{clear}}

[[File:Italy 1454 after the Peace of Lodi.jpg|thumb|Italy during the Peace of Lodi]]
Italy saw a period of great prosperity during the [[Renaissance]], especially as a result of the [[Peace of Lodi]], but a large part of the peninsula fell under [[foreign domination]] after the [[Italian Wars]]. Some larger states were able to retain their independence and maintain a significant role for the balance of power.

The [[Republic of Florence]], later the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], was a major economic and banking power under the rule of the [[Medici Family]].

The [[Republic of Venice]], in control of the rich trade between Europe and the [[Levant]], began a phase of a long, but also gradual and "golden", decline.

The [[Qing Dynasty]] was the last ruling dynasty of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (with a brief, abortive restoration in 1917). It was preceded by the [[Ming Dynasty]] and followed by the Republic of China. The dynasty was founded by the Manchu clan Aisin Gioro in what is today northeast China (also known as Manchuria). Starting in 1644 it expanded into [[China proper]] and its surrounding territories, establishing the [[Empire of the Great Qing]]. Complete pacification of China was accomplished around 1683 under the [[Kangxi Emperor]].
[[File:Fragrant Hills-pagoda.JPG|thumb|upright|right|150px|The [[Fragrant Hills Pagoda]], built in 1780.]]
The dynasty changed its name to "Qing", meaning "clear" or "pellucid" around 1636. In 1644 Beijing was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by Li Zicheng, a minor Ming official turned leader of the peasant revolt. The last Ming emperor, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], committed suicide when the city fell, marking the official end of the dynasty. The Manchus then allied with Ming Dynasty general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing and overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun Dynasty]].

During its reign the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with Chinese culture. The dynasty reached its height in the 18th century, during which both territory and population were increased. However, its military power weakened hereafter and faced with massive rebellions and defeats in wars, the Qing Dynasty declined after the mid-19th century. The Qing Dynasty was overthrown following the [[Xinhai Revolution]].{{clear}}

Safavid Iran was one of the Islamic "[[Gunpowder Empires|gunpowder empires]]". The Safavid empire originated from [[Ardabil]] in [[Northern Iran|Iran]] and had its origins in a long established [[Sufi Order|Sufi order]], called the ''[[Safaviya (sufi order)|Safaviyeh]]''. The Safavids established an independent unified Iranian state for the first time after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] and reasserted Iranian political identity, and established [[Shia Islam]] as the official religion in [[Iran]].

Despite their demise in 1736, the legacy that they left behind was the revival of [[Iran]] as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon "checks and balances", their architectural innovations and their patronage for fine arts. The Safavids have also left their mark down to the present era by [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|spreading Shi'a Islam]] in [[Iran]], as well as major parts of the [[Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Anatolia]].{{clear}}

The [[Dutch Republic]] controlled various territories after the Dutch achieved independence from [[Spain]] in the 16th century. Their skills in [[shipping]] and [[trade|trading]] aided the building of an overseas colonial empire which lasted from the 16th to the 20th century. The Dutch initially built up colonial possessions on the basis of indirect state capitalist [[corporate colonialism]], with the dominant [[Dutch East India Company]]. A cultural flowering roughly spanning the 17th century is known as the [[Dutch Golden Age]], in which Dutch trade, science and art were among the most acclaimed in the world. Dutch military power was at its height in the middle of the 17th century and in that era the [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch navy]] was the most powerful navy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.julianstockwin.com/RNN.htm Royal Netherlands Navy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511065442/http://www.julianstockwin.com/RNN.htm |date=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 17th century, the Dutch had overtaken Portugal as the dominant player in the spice and silk trade, and in 1652 founded a colony at Cape Town on the coast of South Africa, as a way-station for its ships on the route between Europe and Asia. After the first settlers spread out around the Company station, nomadic white livestock farmers, or Trekboers, moved more widely afield, leaving the richer, but limited, farming lands of the coast for the drier interior tableland. Between 1602 and 1796, million Europeans were sent to work in the Asia trade. The majority died of disease or made their way back to Europe, but some of them made the Indies their new home. Interaction between the Dutch and native population mainly took place in Sri Lanka and the modern Indonesian Islands. Through the centuries there developed a relatively large Dutch-speaking population of mixed Dutch and Indonesian descent, known as Indos or Dutch-Indonesians.{{clear}}

The empire began in the 17th century as a combination of factors led to its creation, such as the growth in British trade with [[India]] and the [[Far East]], the success of the [[British East India Company]], numerous British maritime explorations around the world, and the vast [[Royal Navy]]. The British Empire comprised the dominions, [[Crown colony|colonies]], protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. It originated with the overseas colonies and trading posts established by England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. It is widely accepted that during the period known as the [[Pax Britannica]] the Empire was the most powerful unitary authority in human history due to the unprecedented level of predominance which the United Kingdom experienced at this time.

British colonies were created along the east coast of [[North America]] during the 17th and 18th centuries but by the late 18th century most of these colonies rebelled against British rule, leading to the [[American War of Independence]] and formation of the [[United States of America]]. Nevertheless, Great Britain retained significant colonies in [[Canada]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[British India|India]], and shortly thereafter began the settlement of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Following France's defeat in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, Great Britain took possession of many more overseas territories in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and established informal empires of free trade in [[South America]], [[China]] and [[Persia]].{{clear}}

The [[Mughal Empire]] was a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]-[[Mongol]] imperial power from [[Uzbekistan]], that ruled most of the [[Indian subcontinent]] in 16th and 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Mughals/mughals.html|title=The Mughal Empire|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, [[Babur]], a [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurid]] descendant of [[Timur]] and [[Descent from Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]] from [[Fergana Valley]] in Uzbekistan, swept across the [[Khyber Pass]] and established the [[Mughal Empire]], which lasted for over 300 years, ruling 1/4 of the world's population at a time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/mughals/ The Islamic World to 1600: Rise of the Great Islamic Empires (The Mughal Empire)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121217/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/mughals/ |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mughal Dynasty]] rapidly expanded and ruled most of the Indian subcontinent by 1600; it went into a slow decline after 1707 and was finally defeated during the [[1857 War of Independence]] also called the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The famous emperor [[Akbar]], who was the grandson of [[Babur]], tried to establish an inclusive empire. However, later emperors such as [[Aurangazeb]] attempted to expand the empire beyond its previous limitations.

[[File:Allom - Constantinople.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Istanbul]], then called Constantinople or Konstantiniyye became the capital of Ottoman Empire after [[Conquest of Istanbul|its conquest]].]]

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was a [[Turkic people|Turkic]] state, which at the height of its power (16th–17th centuries) spanned three continents (see: [[List of Ottoman Empire dominated territories|extent of Ottoman territories]]) controlling much of [[Southeastern Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and most of [[North Africa]]. The empire has been called by historians a "Universal Empire" due to both [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Islamic]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;H. Inaicik "The rise of the Ottoman Empire" in P.M. Holt, A.K. S. Lambstone, and B. Lewis (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (Cambridge University). pages 295–200&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire was at the center of interactions between the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western world]]s for six centuries. The Ottoman Empire was the only Islamic power to seriously challenge the rising power of [[Western Europe]] between the 15th and 19th centuries. With [[Istanbul]] (or [[Constantinople]]) as its capital, the Empire was in some respects an Islamic [[successor state|successor]] of earlier Mediterranean empires—the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires.

[[Ottoman military reforms|Ottoman military reform efforts]] begin with Selim III (1789–1807) who made the first major attempts to modernize the army along European lines. These efforts, however, were hampered by reactionary movements, partly from the religious leadership, but primarily from the Janissary corps, who had become anarchic and ineffectual. Jealous of their privileges and firmly opposed to change, they created a Janissary revolt. Selim's efforts cost him his throne and his life, but were resolved in spectacular and bloody fashion by his successor, the dynamic Mahmud II, who massacred the Janissary corps in 1826.

The effective military and bureaucratic structures of the previous century also came under strain during a protracted period of misrule by weak Sultans. But in spite of these difficulties, the Empire remained a major expansionist power until the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683, which marked the end of Ottoman expansion into Europe.{{clear}}

Its political structure was formed in 1569 by the [[Union of Lublin]], which united the [[Jagiellon Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and lasted in this form until the adoption of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]]. In the 16th century, the area of the Commonwealth reached almost 1 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;., with a population of 11 million. Poland-Lithuania was a political, military and economic power.

The Union possessed features unique among contemporary states. This political system unusual for its time stemmed from the ascendance of the szlachta [[nobility|noble class]] over other social classes and over the [[political system]] of [[monarchy]]. In time, the szlachta accumulated enough privileges (such as those established by the [[Nihil novi]] Act of 1505) that no monarch could hope to break the szlachta's grip on power. The Commonwealth's political system is difficult to fit into a simple category, but it can be tentatively described as a mixture of:
*[[File:Hołd carów Szujskich.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|[[Shuysky Tribute|Shuysky's tribute]] – homage of the deposed [[List of Russian rulers|Tsar of Russia]] [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasyl IV Shuysky]] and his brothers Dmitri and Ivan before Polish King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and prince [[Władysław IV Vasa|Ladislaus]] in 1611, [[Warsaw]].]][[confederation]] and [[federation]], with regard to the broad autonomy of its regions. It is, however, difficult to decisively call the Commonwealth either confederation or federation, as it had some qualities of both of them;
* [[oligarchy]], as only the szlachta—around 15% of the population—had political rights;
* [[democracy]], since all the szlachta were equal in rights and privileges, and the Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including [[legislation]] (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones). Also, the 15% of Commonwealth population who enjoyed those political rights (the szlachta)&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book |author=David Sneath|title=The headless state: aristocratic orders, kinship society, &amp; misrepresentations of nomadic inner Asia |year=2007|page=188|publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-14054-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OR14qaApQbgC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a substantially larger percentage than in majority European countries;&lt;ref name="books.google_a"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book |author=M.

The [[Portuguese Empire]] was the first [[global empire]] in history, and also the earliest and longest-lived of the [[Western Europe]]an [[Colonialism|colonial]] empires. [[Portugal]]'s small size and population restricted the empire, in the 16th century, to a collection of small but well defended outposts along the African coasts, the main exceptions being Angola, Mozambique and Brazil. For most of the 16th century, the Portuguese [[Carreira da Índia|Indian Armadas]], then the world leader navy in shipbuilding and [[naval artillery]], dominated most of the Atlantic Ocean south of the Canary Islands, the Indian Ocean and the access to the western Pacific. The height of the empire was reached in the 16th century but the indifference of the [[Habsburg]] kings and the competition with new colonial empires like the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empires|French]] and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] started its long and gradual decline. After the 18th century Portugal concentrated in the [[colonization]] of [[Brazil]] and [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|African possessions]].

The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], between Spain and Portugal, divided the world outside of Europe in an exclusive duopoly along a north-south meridian 370 leagues, or {{convert|970|mi|km}}, west of the Cape Verde islands. However, as it was not possible at the time to correctly measure longitude, the exact boundary was disputed by the two countries until 1777. The completion of these negotiations with Spain is one of several reasons proposed by historians for why it took nine years for the Portuguese to follow up on Dias's voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, though it has also been speculated that other voyages were in fact secretly taking place during that time. Whether or not this was the case, the long-standing Portuguese goal of finding a sea route to Asia was finally achieved in a ground-breaking voyage commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]].{{clear}}

Prussia attained its greatest importance in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 18th century, it became a [[Europe]]an great power under the reign of [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (1740–86). During the 19th century, Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] pursued a policy of uniting the German principalities into a "[[Kleindeutsche Lösung|Lesser Germany]]" which would exclude the [[Austrian Empire]].

In the 16th century Spain and Portugal were in the vanguard of European global exploration and colonial expansion and the opening of trade routes across the oceans, with trade flourishing across the Atlantic Ocean between Spain and the Americas and across the Pacific Ocean between Asia-Pacific and Mexico via the Philippines. [[Conquistador]]s toppled the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]], [[Inca Empire|Inca]], and [[Maya civilization]]s, and laid claim to vast stretches of land in North and South America. For a long time, the Spanish Empire dominated the oceans with its navy and ruled the European battlefield with its infantry, the famous [[tercio]]s. Spain enjoyed a cultural [[Spanish Golden Age|golden age]] in the 16th and 17th centuries as Europe's foremost power.

From 1580 to 1640 the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]] were conjoined in a [[personal union]] of its [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg monarchs]], during the period of the [[Iberian Union]], though the empires continued to be administered separately.

From the middle of the 16th century silver and gold from the American mines increasingly financed the military capability of [[Habsburg Spain]], then the foremost global power, in its long series of European and North African wars. Until the loss of its American colonies in the 19th century, Spain maintained one of the largest empires in the world, even though it suffered fluctuating military and economic fortunes from the 1640s. Confronted by the new experiences, difficulties and suffering created by empire-building, Spanish thinkers formulated some of the first modern thoughts on natural law, sovereignty, international law, war, and economics — they even questioned the legitimacy of imperialism — in related schools of thought referred to collectively as the [[School of Salamanca]].

Constant contention with rival powers caused territorial, commercial, and religious conflict that contributed to the slow decline of Spanish power from the mid-17th century. In the [[Mediterranean]], Spain warred constantly with the Ottoman Empire; on the European continent, [[France]] became comparably strong. Overseas, Spain was initially rivaled by [[Portugal]], and later by the [[England|English]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. In addition, English-, French-, and Dutch-sponsored privateering and piracy, overextension of Spanish military commitments in its territories, increasing government corruption, and economic stagnation caused by military expenditures ultimately contributed to the empire's weakening.

Spain's European empire was finally undone by the [[Peace of Utrecht]] (1713), which stripped Spain of its remaining territories in Italy and the [[Spanish Netherlands|Low Countries]]. Spain's fortunes improved thereafter, but it remained a second-rate power in Continental European politics. However, Spain maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire until the 19th century, when the shock of the [[Peninsular War]] sparked declarations of independence in Quito (1809), [[Venezuela]] and [[Paraguay]] (1811) and successive revolutions that split away its territories on the mainland (the Spanish Main) of the Americas.{{clear}}

Sweden also had colonial possessions as a minor [[Swedish colonial empire|colonial Empire]] that existed from 1638 to 1663 and later 1784 to 1878. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent during the rule of [[Charles X of Sweden|Charles X]] (1622–1660) after the [[treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658. However, after more than a half century of almost constant warfare the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It would become the lifetime task of Charles' son, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] (1655–1697), to rebuild the economy and refit the army. His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet. Sweden's largest threat at this time, [[Russia]], had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training. The Swedish army crushed the Russians at the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] in 1700, one of the first battles of the [[Great Northern War]]. This led to an overambitious campaign against Russia in 1707, however, ending in a decisive Russian victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709). The campaign had a successful opening for Sweden, which came to occupy half of [[Poland]] and making Charles able to claim the Polish throne. But after a long march exposed by [[cossack]] raids, the Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]'s scorched-earth techniques and the [[Russian Winter|cold Russian climate]], the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered confidence, and enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava. The defeat meant the beginning of the end for Sweden as an empire.{{clear}}

The [[Russian Empire]] formed from what was [[Tsardom of Russia]] under [[Peter the Great]]. Peter I, (1672–1725), played a major role in bringing his country into the European state system, and laid the foundations of a modern state in [[Russia]]. From its modest beginnings in the 14th century, Russia had become the largest state in the world by Peter's time. Three times the size of continental Europe, it spanned the [[Eurasian plate|Eurasian landmass]] from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].{{clear}}

France was a dominant empire possessing many [[colonies]] in various locations around the world. The [[French colonial empire]] is the set of territories outside Europe that were under French rule primarily from the 17th century to the late 1960s (some see the French control of places such as New Caledonia as a continuation of that colonial empire). In the 19th and 20th centuries, the colonial empire of France was the second largest in the world behind the British Empire. The French colonial empire extended over {{convert|12,890,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land at its height in the 1920s and 1930s. Including metropolitan France, the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached {{convert|13,500,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} at the time, which is 8.7% of the Earth's total land area.

France began to establish colonies in North America, the Caribbean and India, following Spanish and Portuguese successes during the [[Age of Discovery]], in rivalry with Britain for supremacy. A series of wars with Britain during the 18th and early 19th centuries which France lost ended its colonial ambitions on these continents, and with it is what some historians term the "first" French colonial empire. In the 19th century, France established a new empire in Africa and South East Asia. Some of these colonies lasted beyond the Second World War.{{clear}}

The [[British Empire]] was the [[World's largest empires|largest empire]] in world history. During the 19th century the [[United Kingdom]] was the first country in the world to industrialise and embrace free trade, giving birth to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This rapid industrial growth transformed Great Britain into the world's largest industrial and financial power, while the world's largest navy gave it undisputed control of the seas and international trade routes, an advantage which helped the British Empire, after a mid-century liberal reaction against empire-building, to grow faster than ever before. The Victorian empire colonised large parts of [[Africa]], including such territories as [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]], [[Kenya]], [[Sudan]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Ghana]], most of [[Oceania]], colonies in the [[Far East]], such as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Hong Kong]], and took control over the whole [[Indian subcontinent]], making it the largest empire in the world.

After victory in the [[First World War]], the empire gained control of territories such as [[Tanzania]] and [[Namibia]] from the [[German Empire]], and [[Iraq]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. By this point in 1920 the British empire had grown to become [[list of largest empires|the largest empire in history]], controlling approximately 25% of the world's land surface and 25% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="Angus Maddison 2001"/&gt; It covered about 36.6 million km² (14.2 million square miles). Because of its magnitude, it was often referred to as [[the empire on which the sun never sets]].

The political and social changes and economic disruption in the United Kingdom and throughout the world caused by First World War followed only two decades later by the [[Second World War]] caused the empire to gradually break up as colonies were given independence. Much of the reason the empire ceased was because many colonies by the mid-20th century were no longer as undeveloped as at the arrival of British control nor as dependent and social changes throughout the world during the first half of the 20th century gave rise to national identity. The British Government, reeling from the economic cost of two successive world wars and changing social attitudes towards empire, felt it could no longer afford to maintain it if the country were to recover economically, pay for the newly created [[welfare state]], and fight the newly emerged [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]].

The influence and power of the British Empire dropped dramatically after the Second World War, especially after the [[Partition of India]] in 1947 and the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] is the successor to the Empire, where the United Kingdom is an equal member with all other states. {{clear}}

After the Napoleonic period the Bourbon dynasty was restored in Spain and over the huge number of Spanish territories around the world. But the shock of the [[Peninsular War]] sparked declarations of independence in the Latin America controlled by Spain and by 1835 [[Spanish American wars of independence|successive revolutions]] had signed the end of the Spanish rule over the majority of this countries. Spain retained fragments of its empire in the Caribbean ([[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]]); Asia ([[Philippines]]); and Oceania ([[Guam]], [[Micronesia]], [[Palau]], and [[Northern Marianas]]) until the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. Spanish participation in the [[Scramble for Africa]] was minimal: [[Spanish Morocco]] was held until 1956 and [[Spanish Guinea]] and the [[Spanish Sahara]] were held until 1968 and 1975 respectively.

The [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated northern [[Germany]] politically, economically, and in terms of population, and was the core of the unified [[North German Confederation]] formed in 1867, which became part of the [[German Empire]] or ''[[Deutsches Reich]]'' in 1871 when the southern German states, excluding Austria, were added. Prussia attained its greatest importance in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 19th century, Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] pursued a policy of uniting the German principalities into a "[[Kleindeutsche Lösung|Lesser Germany]]" which would exclude the [[Austrian Empire]].

Germany rose again in world power status during the [[Third Reich]] (or [[Nazi Germany]]) under the dictatorship of [[Adolf Hitler]] between 1933 and 1945. It seized [[Austria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[invaded Poland]] which launched [[World War II]] in Europe. In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940. Following the German [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, the tide turned against the Third Reich as it suffered major military defeats in 1943; Germany was fully defeated by 1945.

The Russian Empire as a state, existed from 1721 until it was declared a [[republic]] 1 September 1917. The Russian Empire was the successor to the Tsardom of Russia and the predecessor of the Soviet Union. It was one of the largest empires in world history, surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongolian empires: at one point in 1866, it stretched from eastern Europe across Asia and into North America.

At the beginning of the 19th century the Russian Empire extended from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea on the south, from the Baltic Sea on the west to the Pacific Ocean on the east. With 125.6 million subjects registered by the 1897 census, it had the third largest population of the world at the time, after Qing China and the British Empire. Like all empires it represented a large disparity in economic, ethnic, and religious positions. Its government, ruled by the Emperor, was one of the last absolute monarchies in Europe. Prior to the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 Russia was one of the five major Great Powers of Europe. After the [[October revolution]] it was transformed into the [[Soviet Union]].

Following the death of the first Soviet leader, Vladimir Lenin, in 1924, Joseph Stalin eventually won a power struggle and led the country through a large-scale industrialization with a command economy and political repression. In World War II, in June 1941, Germany and its allies invaded the Soviet Union, a country with which it had signed a non-aggression pact. After four years of brutal warfare, the Soviet Union emerged victorious as one of the world's two [[superpower]]s, the other being the United States.

The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states engaged in the Cold War, a prolonged global ideological and political struggle against the United States and its Western Bloc allies, which it ultimately lost in the face of economic troubles and both domestic and foreign political unrest. In the late 1980s, the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform the state with his policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], but the Soviet Union collapsed and was formally dissolved in December 1991 after the abortive August coup attempt. The Russian Federation assumed its rights and obligations.{{clear}}

The Italian colonial empire was created after the [[Kingdom of Italy]] joined other European powers in establishing colonies overseas during the "[[scramble for Africa]]". Modern Italy as a [[Italian unification|unified state]] only existed from 1861. By this time [[French Colonial Empire|France]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], [[British Empire|Britain]], and the [[Dutch Empire|Netherlands]], had already carved out large empires over several hundred years. One of the last remaining areas open to colonisation was on the African continent.

By the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Italy had annexed [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]], and had wrested control of portions of the [[Ottoman Empire]], including [[Libya]], though it was defeated in its attempt to conquer [[Ethiopia]]. The [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime]] under Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] which came to power in 1922 sought to increase the size of the empire further. Ethiopia was successfully taken, four decades after the previous failure, and Italy's European borders were expanded. An official "Italian Empire" was proclaimed on 9 May 1936 following the conquest of Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Lowe, p.289"&gt;Lowe, p.289&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy sided with [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] and initially enjoyed successes. However, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces eventually captured Italian overseas colonies and by the time Italy itself was invaded in 1943, its empire had all but ceased to exist. On 8 September 1943 the Fascist regime of Mussolini collapsed, and a [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]] broke out in [[Italy]] between [[Italian Social Republic]] and [[Italian Resistance Movement]], supported by Allied forces.

{{main article|Empire of Japan}}
[[File:Kokyo0057.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]].]]
The Empire of [[Japan]], officially the Empire of Great Japan or simply Great Japan (Dai Nippon), was an empire that existed from the [[Meiji Restoration]] on 3 January 1868 to the enactment of the post-World War II Constitution of Japan on 3 May 1947.

Imperial Japan's rapid [[industrialization]] and [[militarization]] under the slogan [[Fukoku Kyōhei]] (富国強兵, "Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army") led to its emergence as a great power, eventually culminating in its membership in the [[Axis alliance]] and the conquest of a large part of the Asia-Pacific region. At the height of its power in 1942, the Japanese Empire ruled over a land area spanning 7,400,000 square kilometres (2,857,000 sq mi), making it one of the [[largest maritime empires]] in history.

After winning wars against China ([[First Sino-Japanese War]], 1894–95) and Russia ([[Russo-Japanese War]], 1904–05) the Japanese Empire was considered to be one of the major powers worldwide. The maximum extent of the empire was gained during [[Second World War]], when Japan conquered many Asian and Pacific countries (see [[Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere]]).

After suffering many defeats and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], however, the Empire of Japan surrendered to the Allies on 2 September 1945. A period of occupation by the Allies followed the surrender, and a new constitution was created with American involvement. The constitution came into force on 3 May 1947, officially dissolving the Empire. American occupation and reconstruction of the country continued well into the 1950s, eventually forming the current nation-state whose title is simply that ("the nation of Japan" Nippon-koku) or just "Japan".

Founded in 1776 by thirteen coastal colonies that [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared their independence from Great Britain]], the United States began its [[Expansion of the United States|westward expansion]] following the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the recognition of U.S. sovereignty in the [[1783 Treaty of Paris]]. The treaty bequeathed to the nascent republic all land between the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Mississippi River]], and Americans began migrating there in large numbers at the end of the 18th Century, resulting in the displacement of Native American cultures, often through native peoples' forcible deportation and violent wars of eviction. These efforts at expansion were greatly strengthened by the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], which resulted in the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] and transformed the U.S. from a loose confederation of semi-autonomous states into a federal entity with a strong national core. In 1803, the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|acquired Louisiana from France]], doubling the country's size and extending its borders to the [[Rocky Mountains]].

American population and power grew rapidly, so that by 1823 President [[James Monroe]] felt confident enough to issue his [[Monroe Doctrine]], which proclaimed the Americas as the express sphere of the United States and, working in agreement with Great Britain, threatened military action against any European power that attempted to make advances in the area. This was the beginning of the U.S.'s emergence as a [[regional power]] in North America. That process was confirmed in the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–1848, in which the United States, following a skirmish between Mexican and U.S. forces in land disputed between Mexico and the U.S., invaded Mexico. The war, which included the deployment of U.S. forces into Mexico, the [[Battle of Veracruz|taking of Veracruz by sea]], and the occupation of Mexico City by American troops (which finally resulted in Mexico's defeat), stunned much of the world. In the peace treaty ([[Treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo]]) that followed, the U.S. [[Mexican Cession|annexed the northern half of Mexico]], comprising what is now the [[Southwestern United States]]. During the course of the war, the United States also [[Oregon Treaty|negotiated by treaty]] the acquisition of the Oregon Territory's southern half from Great Britain. Lincoln made the United States a great power because of Europe not intervening in the civil war and the emancipation proclamation and kicking out france from Mexico by his tragic  assination sending man power and aid to Mexico.{{dubious|date=April 2018}}

In 1867, [[William H. Seward]], the [[U.S. Secretary of State]], negotiated the purchase of [[Alaska]] from the [[Russian Empire]]. The United States defeated [[Spain]] in the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, and gained the possessions of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Philippines]].

The United States later participated in [[World War II]], becoming a global power after it helped to secure victory for the allies in 1945; its vast economic and military resources including a short-lived period of monopoly on nuclear weapons made the U.S. one of the world's three remaining superpowers along with the [[USSR]] and the British Empire. After the deconstruction of the British Empire in the latter half of the 20th century (a process termed [[decolonization]]), the United States vied against the Soviet Union as one of the two remaining superpowers in the world in the [[Cold War]]. Upon the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it became the sole superpower in the world, sometimes referred to as a [[hyperpower]].

The '''National Socialist German Workers' Party''' ({{audio-de|Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei|De-Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei.ogg}}, abbreviated '''NSDAP'''), commonly referred to in English as the '''Nazi Party''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|s|i|,_|ˈ|n|æ|t|s|i|}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Daniel|author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician)|year=2003|orig-year=1917|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|editor-last1=Roach|editor-first1=Peter|editor-last2=Hartmann|editor-first2=James|editor-last3=Setter|editor-first3=Jane|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=3-12-539683-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945, that created and supported the ideology of [[Nazism]]. Its precursor, the [[German Workers' Party]] (''Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920.

{{Nazism sidebar|expanded=Organizations}}
The Nazi Party emerged from the [[German nationalism|German nationalist]], [[Racism|racist]] and [[Populism|populist]] ''[[Freikorps]]'' paramilitary culture, which fought against the [[communist]] uprisings in post-[[World War I]] Germany.&lt;ref name="stormtroopers"/&gt; The party was created as a means to draw workers away from communism and into ''[[völkisch]]'' nationalism.&lt;ref name="stormtroopers2"/&gt; Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on [[Big business|anti-big business]], [[Bourgeoisie|anti-bourgeois]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] rhetoric, although such aspects were later downplayed in order to gain the support of industrial entities and in the 1930s the party's focus shifted to [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and anti-Marxist themes.&lt;ref name="mcdonough"/&gt;

[[Nazism and race|Pseudo-scientific racism]] theories were central to Nazism. The Nazis propagated the idea of a "people's community" (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]''). Their aim was to unite "racially desirable" Germans as national comrades, while excluding those deemed either to be political dissidents, physically or intellectually inferior, or of a [[foreign races|foreign race]] (''Fremdvölkische'').&lt;ref name="Wildt2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wildt|title=Hitler's Volksgemeinschaft and the Dynamics of Racial Exclusion: Violence Against Jews in Provincial Germany, 1919–1939|date=15 July 2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-322-8|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis sought to improve the stock of the Germanic people through racial purity and [[eugenics]], broad social welfare programs and a [[collectivism|collective]] subordination of individual rights, which could be sacrificed for the good of the state and the "[[Aryan race|Aryan]] [[master race]]". To maintain the supposed purity and strength of the Aryan race, the Nazis sought to [[Genocide|exterminate]] [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Poles]] along with the vast majority of other [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] and the [[Physical disability|physically]] and [[Developmental disability|mentally handicapped]]. They imposed exclusionary segregation on [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|homosexuals]], [[Nazism and race|Africans]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and political opponents.&lt;ref name="massachusetts"/&gt; The persecution reached its climax when the party-controlled German state organized the systematic genocidal killing of [[Holocaust victims|an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other targeted victims]], in what has become known as [[the Holocaust]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}

The party's leader since 1921, [[Adolf Hitler]], was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on 30 January 1933. Hitler rapidly established a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime&lt;ref name="totalitarianism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="totalitarianism3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="totalitarianism4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="totalitarianism5"/&gt; known as the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Following the defeat of the Third Reich at the conclusion of [[World War II]] in Europe, the party was "declared to be illegal" by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Elzer|editor-first1=Herbert|title=Dokumente Zur Deutschlandpolitik|volume=First half band – Appendix B, Section XI, §39|date=2003|publisher=Oldenbourg Wissenschaftverlag|page=602|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9JaIiRTPwQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=to+be+illegal&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=illegal&amp;f=false|ISBN=3-486-56667-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; who carried out [[denazification]] in the years after the war.

==Etymology==
The term "Nazi" derives from the name given in German to a party member ''{{lang|de|Nationalsozialist}}'' ({{IPA-de|natsi̯oˈnaːlzotsi̯aˌlɪst}}) and was coined in response to the German term ''[[wiktionary:Sozi|Sozi]]'' (pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈzoːtsiː|}}), an abbreviation of ''Sozialdemokrat'' (member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]).&lt;ref name="SZspeak"/&gt;{{r|Mautner}} Members of the party referred to themselves as ''Nationalsozialisten'' (National Socialists), rarely as Nazis. The term ''Parteigenosse'' (party member) was commonly used among Nazis, with the feminine form ''Parteigenossin'' used when it was appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitler|first=Adolf|title=Die Reden des Führers am Parteitag der Ehre, 1936|date=1936|publisher=Zentralverlag der NSDAP|location=Munich|page=10|url=https://archive.org/details/DieRedendesFuehrersamParteitagderEhre1936|language=German|quote="Parteigenossen! Parteigenossinnen! Nationalsozialisten!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was in use before the rise of the party as a colloquial and derogatory word for a backward [[peasant]], characterising an awkward and clumsy person. It derived from Ignaz, being a shortened version of [[Ignatius]],&lt;ref name=Copenhagen&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Henrik|editor2-last=Morgensen|editor2-first=Jens Erik|title=Dictionary Visions, Research and Practice: Selected Papers from the 12th International Symposium on Lexicography, Copenhagen, 2004 |date=2007|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co. |location=Amsterdam |isbn=9789027223340|page=247|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UaggHAJ7jToC&amp;pg=PA247|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=etymonline&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=Nazi|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Nazi |website=etymonline.com |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a common name in [[Bavaria]], the area from which the Nazis emerged. Opponents seized on this and shortened the party's name in intentional association to the long-time existing ''Sozi'' to the dismissive "Nazi".&lt;ref name=etymonline /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sourcebook&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rabinbach|editor1-first=Anson|editor2-last=Gilman|editor2-first=Sander|title=The Third Reich Sourcebook|date=2013|publisher=California University Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=9780520955141|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XhDakMp55i0C&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, when [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed power of the German government, usage of the designation "Nazi" diminished in Germany, although Austrian anti-Nazis continued to use the term derogatorily.{{r|Mautner}} The use of "[[Nazi Germany]]" and "Nazi regime" was popularised by anti-Nazis and German exiles abroad. Thereafter, the term spread into other languages and eventually was brought back to Germany after World War II.&lt;ref name=Sourcebook/&gt; In English, the term is not considered a slang word, and has such derivatives as [[Nazism]] and [[denazification]].

==History==

===Origins and early existence: 1918–1923===
The party grew out of smaller political groups with a nationalist orientation that formed in the last years of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. In 1918, a league called the ''Freier Arbeiterausschuss für einen guten Frieden'' (Free Workers' Committee for a good Peace){{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} was created in [[Bremen]], Germany. On 7 March 1918, [[Anton Drexler]], an avid German nationalist, formed a branch of this league in [[Munich]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} Drexler was a local locksmith who had been a member of the militarist [[Fatherland Party (Germany)|Fatherland Party]]{{sfn|Shirer|1991|p=34}} during World War I and was bitterly opposed to the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] of November 1918 and the revolutionary upheavals that followed. Drexler followed the views of militant nationalists of the day, such as opposing the [[Treaty of Versailles]], having [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], anti-monarchist and anti-Marxist views, as well as believing in the superiority of Germans whom they claimed to be part of the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] "[[master race]]" (''Herrenvolk''). However, he also accused international capitalism of being a Jewish-dominated movement and denounced capitalists for war profiteering in World War I.&lt;ref name="Spector, pp. 137"/&gt; Drexler saw the political violence and instability in Germany as the result of the [[Weimar Republic]] being out-of-touch with the masses, especially the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Spector, pp. 137"/&gt; Drexler emphasized the need for a synthesis of ''völkisch'' nationalism with a form of economic [[Preussentum und Sozialismus|socialism]], in order to create a popular nationalist-oriented workers' movement that could challenge the rise of Communism and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist politics]].&lt;ref name="university6"/&gt; These were all well-known themes popular with various [[Weimar paramilitary groups]] such as the ''[[Freikorps]]''.

[[File:NSDAP-Logo.svg|thumb|left|upright|Nazi Party badge emblem]]
Drexler's movement received attention and support from some influential figures. Supporter [[Dietrich Eckart]], a well-to-do journalist, brought military figure [[Felix Graf von Bothmer]], a prominent supporter of the concept of "national socialism", to address the movement.&lt;ref name="TheodoreFred"/&gt; Later in 1918, [[Karl Harrer]] (a journalist and member of the [[Thule Society]]) convinced Drexler and several others to form the ''[[Politischer Arbeiterzirkel]]'' (Political Workers' Circle).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and racism directed against the Jews.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} In December 1918, Drexler decided that a new political party should be formed, based on the political principles that he endorsed, by combining his branch of the Workers' Committee for a good Peace with the Political Workers' Circle.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}}&lt;ref name="university7"/&gt;

On 5 January 1919, Drexler created a new political party and proposed it should be named the "German Socialist Workers' Party", but Harrer objected to the term "socialist"; so the term was removed and the party was named the [[German Workers' Party]] (''Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', DAP).&lt;ref name="carlsten"/&gt; To ease concerns among potential middle-class supporters, Drexler made clear that unlike Marxists the party supported the middle-class and that its socialist policy was meant to give [[social welfare provision|social welfare]] to German citizens deemed part of the Aryan race.&lt;ref name="Spector, pp. 137"/&gt; They became one of many [[völkisch movement|''völkisch'' movements]] that existed in Germany. Like other ''völkisch'' groups, the DAP advocated the belief that through [[profit-sharing]] instead of [[socialization (economics)|socialisation]] Germany should become a unified "people's community" (''Volksgemeinschaft'') rather than a society divided along class and party lines.&lt;ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/&gt; This ideology was explicitly antisemitic. As early as 1920, the party was raising money by selling a tobacco called ''Anti-Semit''.&lt;ref name="weidenfeld"/&gt;

[[File:Nsdap01.jpg|thumb|upright|NSDAP membership book]]
From the outset, the DAP was opposed to non-nationalist political movements, especially on the left, including the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD). Members of the DAP saw themselves as fighting against "[[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]]" and anyone considered a part of or aiding so-called "[[Antisemitic canard|international Jewry]]". The DAP was also deeply opposed to the [[Versailles Treaty]].{{sfn|Shirer|1991|p=33}} The DAP did not attempt to make itself public and meetings were kept in relative secrecy, with public speakers discussing what they thought of Germany's present [[State of affairs (Sociology)|state of affairs]], or writing to like-minded societies in Northern Germany.&lt;ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/&gt;

The DAP was a comparatively small group with fewer than 60 members.&lt;ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/&gt; Nevertheless, it attracted the attention of the German authorities, who were suspicious of any organisation that appeared to have subversive tendencies. In July 1919, while stationed in [[Munich]] army ''[[Gefreiter]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed a ''Verbindungsmann'' (intelligence agent) of an ''Aufklärungskommando'' (reconnaissance unit) of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' (army) by [[Karl Mayr|Captain Mayr]] the head of the ''Education and Propaganda Department'' (Dept Ib/P) in [[Bavaria]]. Hitler was assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the DAP.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=71–82}} While attending a party meeting on 12 September 1919, Hitler became involved in a heated argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of [[Gottfried Feder]]'s arguments against capitalism; Baumann proposed that Bavaria should break away from [[Prussia]] and found a new South German nation with [[Austria]]. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, Hitler made an impression on the other party members with his oratorical skills; according to Hitler, the "professor" left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}}{{sfn|Mitcham|1996|p=67}} Among the party's earlier members were [[Ernst Röhm]] of the Army's District Command VII; Dietrich Eckart, who has been called the spiritual father of National Socialism;&lt;ref name="Blamires2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Blamires, Cyprian P.|title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=13 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-940-9|pages=185–}}&lt;/ref&gt; then-[[University of Munich]] student [[Rudolf Hess]];{{sfn|Shirer|1991|p=43}} ''Freikorps'' soldier [[Hans Frank]]; and [[Alfred Rosenberg]], often credited as the philosopher of the movement. All were later prominent in the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="RisenFallofN.Germanypg.88"/&gt;

[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|Hitler's membership card in the DAP (later NSDAP)]]
Hitler later claimed to be the seventh party member (he was in fact the seventh executive member of the party's central committee&lt;ref name="WarningfromHistory"/&gt; and he would later wear the [[Golden Party Badge]] number one). Anton Drexler drafted a letter to Hitler in 1940—which was never sent—that contradicts Hitler's later claim:
{{quote|No one knows better than you yourself, my Führer, that you were never the seventh member of the party, but at best the seventh member of the committee... And a few years ago I had to complain to a party office that your first proper membership card of the DAP, bearing the signatures of Schüssler and myself, was falsified, with the number 555 being erased and number 7 entered.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler: 1889–1936 Hubris'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitler's first DAP speech was held in the [[Hofbräukeller]] on 16 October 1919. He was the second speaker of the evening, and spoke to 111 people.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw ''Hitler:1889–1936 Hubris''. Penguin, 1998. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler later declared that this was when he realised he could really "make a good speech".&lt;ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/&gt; At first, Hitler spoke only to relatively small groups, but his considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920.&lt;ref name="RisenFallofN.Germanypg.89"/&gt; Hitler began to make the party more public, and organised its biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people on 24 February 1920 in the ''[[Hofbräuhaus am Platzl|Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München]]''. Such was the significance of this particular move in publicity that [[Karl Harrer]] resigned from the party in disagreement.{{sfn|Shirer|1991|p=36}} It was in this speech that Hitler enunciated the [[National Socialist Program#German Party program|twenty-five points of the German Workers' Party manifesto]] that had been drawn up by Drexler, Feder and himself.{{sfn|Shirer|1991|p=37}} Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem&lt;ref name="RisenFallofN.Germanypg.89"/&gt; with a clear foreign policy (abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles, a [[German question|Greater Germany]], Eastern expansion and exclusion of Jews from citizenship) and among his specific points were: confiscation of [[War profiteering|war profits]], abolition of unearned incomes, the State to share profits of land and land for national needs to be taken away without compensation.&lt;ref name="HistoryoftheModernWorldpg.133"/&gt; In general, the manifesto was [[antisemitic]], [[anti-capitalist]], [[Aristocracy (class)|anti-democratic]], [[anti-Marxist]] and [[Fascism|anti-liberal]].&lt;ref name="Face of the 3rd Reichpg.42"/&gt; To increase its appeal to larger segments of the population, on the same day as Hitler's ''Hofbräuhaus'' speech on 24 February 1920, the DAP changed its name to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' ("National Socialist German Workers' Party", or Nazi Party).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=87}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1997|p=629}} The word "Socialist" was added by the party's executive committee, over Hitler's objections, in order to help appeal to left-wing workers.{{sfn|Mitcham|1996|page=68}}

In 1920, the Nazi Party officially announced that only persons of "pure Aryan descent [''{{lang|de|rein arischer Abkunft}}'']" could become party members and if the person had a spouse, the spouse also had to be a "racially pure" Aryan. Party members could not be related either directly or indirectly to a so-called "non-Aryan".&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich2007"&gt;{{cite book|author = Eric Ehrenreich | title = The Nazi Ancestral Proof: Genealogy, Racial Science, and the Final Solution| year = 2007 | publisher = Indiana University Press | isbn = 0-253-11687-2 | page = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before it had become legally forbidden by the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, the Nazis banned sexual relations and marriages between party members and Jews.&lt;ref name="Weikart2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Weikart|title=Hitler's Ethic|date=21 July 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-62398-9|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Party members found guilty of ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("racial defilement") were persecuted heavily, some members were even sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="Gordon1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Ann Gordon|title=Hitler, Germans, and the "Jewish Question"|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10162-0|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler quickly became the party's most active orator, appearing in public as a speaker 31 times within the first year after his self-discovery.&lt;ref name="Fest1972"/&gt; Crowds began to flock to hear his speeches.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=89}} Hitler always spoke about the same subjects: the Treaty of Versailles and [[the Jewish question]].&lt;ref name="Face of the 3rd Reichpg.42"/&gt; This deliberate technique and effective publicising of the party contributed significantly to his early success,&lt;ref name="Face of the 3rd Reichpg.42"/&gt; about which a contemporary poster wrote: "Since Herr Hitler is a brilliant speaker, we can hold out the prospect of an extremely exciting evening".&lt;ref name="hilterbewegung"/&gt; Over the following months, the party continued to attract new members,&lt;ref name="WarningfromHistory"/&gt; while remaining too small to have any real significance in German politics.{{sfn|Shirer|1991|p=38}} By the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=89}} many of whom Hitler and Röhm had brought into the party personally, or for whom Hitler's oratory had been their reason for joining.&lt;ref name="Face of the 3rd Reichpg.40"/&gt;

Hitler's talent as an orator and his ability to draw new members, combined with his characteristic ruthlessness, soon made him the dominant figure. However, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin in June 1921, a mutiny broke out within the party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival [[German Socialist Party]] (DSP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100, 101}} Upon returning to Munich on 11 July, Hitler angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that his resignation would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP, as his opponents had [[Hermann Esser]] expelled from the party and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser to thunderous applause.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=83, 103}}

His strategy proved successful; at a special party congress on 29 July 1921, he replaced Drexler as party chairman by a vote of 533{{nbsp}}to{{nbsp}}1.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=83, 103}} The committee was dissolved, and Hitler was granted nearly absolute powers as the party's sole leader.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=83, 103}} He would hold the post for the remainder of his life. Hitler soon acquired the title ''[[Führer]]'' ("leader") and after a series of sharp internal conflicts it was accepted that the party would be governed by the ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' ("leader principle"). Under this principle, the party was a highly centralized entity that functioned strictly from the top down, with Hitler at the apex as the party's absolute leader. Hitler saw the party as a revolutionary organization, whose aim was the overthrow of the [[Weimar Republic]], which he saw as controlled by the socialists, Jews and the "[[Stab-in-the-back legend|November criminals]]" who had betrayed the German soldiers in 1918. The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] ("storm troopers", also known as "Brownshirts") were founded as a party militia in 1921 and began violent attacks on other parties.

[[File:Erstausgabe von Mein Kampf.jpg|thumb|''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in its first edition cover]]
For Hitler, the twin goals of the party were always German nationalist expansionism and [[antisemitism]]. These two goals were fused in his mind by his belief that Germany's external enemies&amp;nbsp;– Britain, France and the Soviet Union&amp;nbsp;– were controlled by the Jews and that Germany's future wars of national expansion would necessarily entail a war against the Jews.&lt;ref name="A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz"/&gt; For Hitler and his principal lieutenants, national and racial issues were always dominant. This was symbolised by the adoption as the party emblem of the [[swastika]] or ''Hakenkreuz''. In German nationalist circles, the swastika was considered a symbol of an "[[Aryan race]]" and it symbolized the replacement of the Christian Cross with allegiance to a National Socialist State.

The Nazi Party grew significantly during 1921 and 1922, partly through Hitler's oratorical skills, partly through the SA's appeal to unemployed young men, and partly because there was a backlash against socialist and liberal politics in Bavaria as Germany's economic problems deepened and the weakness of the Weimar regime became apparent. The party recruited former World War&amp;nbsp;I soldiers, to whom Hitler as a decorated frontline veteran could particularly appeal, as well as small businessmen and disaffected former members of rival parties. Nazi rallies were often held in beer halls, where downtrodden men could get free beer. The [[Hitler Youth]] was formed for the children of party members. The party also formed groups in other parts of Germany. [[Julius Streicher]] in [[Nuremberg]] was an early recruit and became editor of the racist magazine ''[[Der Stürmer]]''. In December 1920, the Nazi Party had acquired a newspaper, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', of which its leading ideologist Alfred Rosenberg became editor. Others to join the party around this time were [[Heinrich Himmler]] and World War I flying ace [[Hermann Göring]].

On 31 October 1922, a party with similar policies and objectives came into power in Italy, the [[National Fascist Party]], under the leadership of the charismatic [[Benito Mussolini]]. The Fascists, like the Nazis, promoted a national rebirth of their country, as they opposed communism and liberalism; appealed to the working-class; opposed the [[Treaty of Versailles]]; and advocated the territorial expansion of their country. The Italian Fascists used a straight-armed [[Roman salute]] and wore black-shirted uniforms. Hitler was inspired by Mussolini and the Fascists, borrowing their use of the straight-armed salute as a Nazi salute. When the Fascists came to power in 1922 in Italy through their coup attempt called the "[[March on Rome]]", Hitler began planning his own coup.

In January 1923, France occupied the [[Ruhr]] industrial region as a result of Germany's failure to meet its [[World War I reparations|reparations]] payments. This led to economic chaos, the resignation of [[Wilhelm Cuno]]'s government and an attempt by the German Communist Party (KPD) to stage a revolution. The reaction to these events was an upsurge of nationalist sentiment. Nazi Party membership grew sharply to about 20,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=110}} By November, Hitler had decided that the time was right for an attempt to seize power in Munich, in the hope that the ''Reichswehr'' (the post-war German military) would mutiny against the Berlin government and join his revolt. In this, he was influenced by former General [[Erich Ludendorff]], who had become a supporter—though not a member—of the Nazis.

On the night of 8 November, the Nazis used a patriotic rally in a Munich beer hall to launch an attempted ''putsch'' ("coup d'état"). This so-called [[Beer Hall Putsch]] attempt failed almost at once when the local ''Reichswehr'' commanders refused to support it. On the morning of 9 November, the Nazis staged a march of about 2,000 supporters through Munich in an attempt to rally support. Troops opened fire and 16 Nazis were killed. Hitler, Ludendorff and a number of others were arrested and were tried for treason in March 1924. Hitler and his associates were given very lenient prison sentences. While Hitler was in prison, he wrote his semi-autobiographical political manifesto ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' ("My Struggle").

The Nazi Party was banned on 9 November 1923; however, with the support of the nationalist [[Völkisch-Social Bloc]] (''Völkisch-Sozialer Block''), it continued to operate under the name "German Party" (''Deutsche Partei'' or DP) from 1924 to 1925.&lt;ref name="dissolution"/&gt; The Nazis failed to remain unified in the DP, as in the north, the right-wing [[Völkisch movement|Volkish]] nationalist supporters of the Nazis moved to the new [[German Völkisch Freedom Party]], leaving the north's left-wing Nazi members, such as [[Joseph Goebbels]] retaining support for the party.&lt;ref name="jablonsky"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-0289, München, Hitler bei Einweihung "Braunes Haus".jpg|thumb|Hitler with Nazi Party members in 1930]]

Adolf Hitler was released from prison on 20 December 1924. On 16 February 1925, Hitler convinced the Bavarian authorities to lift the ban on the NSDAP and the party was formally refounded on 26 February 1925, with Hitler as its undisputed leader. The new Nazi Party was no longer a paramilitary organization and disavowed any intention of taking power by force. In any case, the economic and political situation had stabilized and the extremist upsurge of 1923 had faded, so there was no prospect of further revolutionary adventures. The Nazi Party of 1925 was divided into the "Leadership Corps" (''Korps der politischen Leiter'') appointed by Hitler and the general membership (''Parteimitglieder''). The party and the SA were kept separate and the legal aspect of the party's work was emphasized. In a sign of this, the party began to admit women. The SA and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members (the latter founded in 1925 as Hitler's bodyguard, and known originally as the ''Schutzkommando'') had to all be regular party members.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=26–29}}{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=34}}

In the 1920s, the Nazi Party expanded beyond its Bavarian base. Catholic Bavaria maintained its right-wing nostalgia for a Catholic monarch;{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} and [[Westphalia]], along with working-class "Red Berlin", were always the Nazis' weakest areas electorally, even during the Third Reich itself. The areas of strongest Nazi support were in rural Protestant areas such as [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Mecklenburg]], [[Pomerania]] and [[East Prussia]]. Depressed working-class areas such as [[Thuringia]] also produced a strong Nazi vote, while the workers of the [[Ruhr]] and [[Hamburg]] largely remained loyal to the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], the [[Communist Party of Germany]] or the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]. Nuremberg remained a Nazi Party stronghold, and the first [[Nuremberg Rally]] was held there in 1927. These rallies soon became massive displays of Nazi paramilitary power and attracted many recruits. The Nazis' strongest appeal was to the lower middle-classes&amp;nbsp;– farmers, public servants, teachers and small businessmen&amp;nbsp;– who had suffered most from the inflation of the 1920s, so who feared Bolshevism more than anything else. The small business class was receptive to Hitler's antisemitism, since it blamed Jewish big business for its economic problems. University students, disappointed at being too young to have served in the War of 1914–1918 and attracted by the Nazis' radical rhetoric, also became a strong Nazi constituency. By 1929, the party had 130,000 members.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=194}}

The party's nominal Deputy Leader was [[Rudolf Hess]], but he had no real power in the party. By the early 1930s, the senior leaders of the party after Hitler were [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Hermann Göring]]. Beneath the Leadership Corps were the party's regional leaders, the ''[[Gauleiter]]s'', each of whom commanded the party in his ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' ("region"). Goebbels began his ascent through the party hierarchy as ''Gauleiter'' of Berlin-Brandenburg in 1926. Streicher was ''Gauleiter'' of [[Franconia]], where he published his antisemitic newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]''. Beneath the ''Gauleiter'' were lower-level officials, the ''[[Kreisleiter]]'' ("county leaders"), ''[[Zellenleiter]]'' ("cell leaders") and ''[[Blockleiter]]'' ("block leaders"). This was a strictly hierarchical structure in which orders flowed from the top and unquestioning loyalty was given to superiors. Only the SA retained some autonomy. Being composed largely of unemployed workers, many SA men took the Nazis' socialist rhetoric seriously. At this time, the [[Hitler salute]] (borrowed from the [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascists]]) and the greeting "Heil Hitler!" were adopted throughout the party.

[[File:1930-election.jpg|thumb|Nazi Party election poster used in [[Vienna]] in 1930 (translation: "We demand freedom and bread")]]
The Nazis contested elections to the national parliament (the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'') and to the state legislature (the ''[[Landtag]]e'') from 1924, although at first with little success. The "National-Socialist Freedom Movement" polled 3% of the vote in the [[German election, December 1924|December 1924 ''Reichstag'' elections]] and this fell to 2.6% in [[German election, 1928|1928]]. State elections produced similar results. Despite these poor results and despite Germany's relative political stability and prosperity during the later 1920s, the Nazi Party continued to grow. This was partly because Hitler, who had no administrative ability, left the party organization to the head of the secretariat, [[Philipp Bouhler]], the party treasurer [[Franz Xaver Schwarz]] and business manager [[Max Amann]]. The party had a capable propaganda head in [[Gregor Strasser]], who was promoted to national organizational leader in January 1928. These men gave the party efficient recruitment and organizational structures. The party also owed its growth to the gradual fading away of competitor nationalist groups, such as the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). As Hitler became the recognized head of the German nationalists, other groups declined or were absorbed.

Despite these strengths, the Nazi Party might never have come to power had it not been for the [[Great Depression]] and its effects on Germany. By 1930, the German economy was beset with mass unemployment and widespread business failures. The Social Democrats and Communists were bitterly divided and unable to formulate an effective solution: this gave the Nazis their opportunity and Hitler's message, blaming the crisis on the Jewish financiers and the [[Bolshevik]]s, resonated with wide sections of the electorate. At the [[German election, 1930|September 1930 ''Reichstag'' elections]], the Nazis won 18.3% of the votes and became the second-largest party in the ''Reichstag'' after the Social Democrats. Hitler proved to be a highly effective campaigner, pioneering the use of radio and aircraft for this purpose. His dismissal of Strasser and his appointment of Goebbels as the party's propaganda chief were major factors. While Strasser had used his position to promote his own leftish version of national socialism, Goebbels was totally loyal to Hitler and worked only to improve Hitler's image.

The 1930 elections changed the German political landscape by weakening the traditional nationalist parties, the DNVP and the DVP, leaving the Nazis as the chief alternative to the discredited Social Democrats and the Zentrum, whose leader, [[Heinrich Brüning]], headed a weak minority government. The inability of the democratic parties to form a united front, the self-imposed isolation of the Communists and the continued decline of the economy, all played into Hitler's hands. He now came to be seen as ''de facto'' leader of the opposition and donations poured into the Nazi Party's coffers. Some major business figures, such as [[Fritz Thyssen]], were Nazi supporters and gave generously{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=372}} and some Wall Street figures were allegedly involved,&lt;ref name="reformed-theology"/&gt; but many other businessmen were suspicious of the extreme nationalist tendencies of the Nazis and preferred to support the traditional conservative parties instead.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=224}}

[[File:Wahl zum Preussischen Landtag, NSDAP-Wahlspendenmedaille 1932.jpg|thumb|left|German NSDAP Donation Token 1932, Free State of Prussia elections]]
During 1931 and into 1932, Germany's political crisis deepened. Hitler ran for President against the incumbent [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in March 1932, polling 30.1% in the first round and 36.8% in the second against Hindenburg's 49% and 53%. By now the SA had 400,000 members and its running street battles with the SPD and Communist paramilitaries (who also fought each other) reduced some German cities to combat zones. Paradoxically, although the Nazis were among the main instigators of this disorder, part of Hitler's appeal to a frightened and demoralised middle class was his promise to restore law and order. Overt antisemitism was played down in official Nazi rhetoric, but was never far from the surface. Germans voted for Hitler primarily because of his promises to revive the economy (by unspecified means), to restore German greatness and overturn the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and to save Germany from communism. On 24 April 1932, the [[Elections in the Free State of Prussia|Free State of Prussia elections]] to the [[Landtag of Prussia|Landtag]] resulted in 36.3% of the votes and 162 seats for the NSDAP.

On 20 July 1932, the Prussian government was ousted by a coup, the ''[[Preußenschlag|Preussenschlag]]''; a few days later at the [[German election, July 1932|July 1932 ''Reichstag'' election]] the Nazis made another leap forward, polling 37.4% and becoming the largest party in parliament by a wide margin. Furthermore, the Nazis and the Communists between them won 52% of the vote and a majority of seats. Since both parties opposed the established political system and neither would join or support any ministry, this made the formation of a majority government impossible. The result was weak ministries governing by decree. Under [[Comintern]] directives, the Communists maintained their policy of treating the Social Democrats as the main enemy, calling them "[[social fascism|social fascists]]", thereby splintering opposition to the Nazis.&lt;ref name="correspondence" /&gt; Later, both the Social Democrats and the Communists accused each other of having facilitated [[Hitler's rise to power]] by their unwillingness to compromise.

Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] called another ''Reichstag'' election in November, hoping to find a way out of this impasse. The electoral result was the same, with the Nazis and the Communists winning 50% of the vote between them and more than half the seats, rendering this ''Reichstag'' no more workable than its predecessor. However, support for the Nazis had fallen to 33.1%, suggesting that the Nazi surge had passed its peak—possibly because the worst of the Depression had passed, possibly because some middle-class voters had supported Hitler in July as a protest, but had now drawn back from the prospect of actually putting him into power. The Nazis interpreted the result as a warning that they must seize power before their moment passed. Had the other parties united, this could have been prevented, but their shortsightedness made a united front impossible. Papen, his successor [[Kurt von Schleicher]] and the nationalist press magnate [[Alfred Hugenberg]] spent December and January in political intrigues that eventually persuaded President Hindenburg that it was safe to appoint Hitler as Reich Chancellor, at the head of a cabinet including only a minority of Nazi ministers—which he did on 30 January 1933.

====Ascension and consolidation====

In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler directly attacked both left-wing and right-wing politics in Germany.&lt;ref name="politicians"/&gt; However, a majority of scholars identify [[Nazism]] in practice as being a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] form of politics.&lt;ref name="Fritzsche, Peter 1998" /&gt; When asked in an interview in 1934 whether the Nazis were "bourgeois right-wing" as alleged by their opponents, Hitler responded that Nazism was not exclusively for any class and indicated that it favoured neither the left nor the right, but preserved "pure" elements from both "camps" by stating: "From the camp of bourgeois tradition, it takes national resolve, and from the materialism of the Marxist dogma, living, creative Socialism".&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt;

The votes that the Nazis received in the 1932 elections established the Nazi Party as the largest parliamentary faction of the Weimar Republic government. Hitler was appointed as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933.

The [[Reichstag fire|''Reichstag'' fire]] on 27 February 1933 gave Hitler a pretext for suppressing his political opponents. The following day he persuaded the Reich's President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to issue the [[Reichstag Fire Decree|''Reichstag'' Fire Decree]], which suspended most [[civil liberties]]. The NSDAP won the [[German federal election, March 1933|parliamentary election on 5 March 1933]] with 43.9 percent of votes, but failed to win an absolute majority. After the election, hundreds of thousands of new members joined the party for opportunistic reasons, most of them civil servants and white-collar workers. They were nicknamed the "casualties of March" ({{lang-de|link=no|Märzgefallenen}}) or "March violets" ({{lang-de|link=no|Märzveilchen}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page=259|title=The Fateful Alliance: German Conservatives and Nazis in 1933: The ''Machtergreifung'' in a New Light|last=Beck|first=H|isbn=9780857454102|date=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; To protect the party from too many non-ideological turncoats who were viewed by the so-called "old fighters" ''(alte Kämpfer)'' with some mistrust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hermann Beck|title=The Fateful Alliance: German Conservatives and Nazis in 1933—The ''Machtergreifung'' in a New Light|publisher=Beghahn Books|year=2008|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party issued a freeze on admissions that remained in force from May 1933 to 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian Ingrao|title=Hitlers Elite: Die Wegbereiter des nationalsozialistischen Massenmords|publisher=Propyläen|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March, the parliament passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which gave the cabinet the right to enact laws without the consent of parliament. In effect, this gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Now possessing virtually absolute power, the Nazis established [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] control as they abolished labour unions and other political parties and imprisoned their political opponents, first at ''wilde Lager'', improvised camps, then in [[concentration camp]]s. [[Nazi Germany]] had been established, yet the ''Reichswehr'' remained impartial. Nazi power over Germany remained virtual, not absolute.

===After taking power: intertwining of party and state===
During June and July 1933, all competing parties were either outlawed or dissolved themselves and subsequently the Law against the founding of new parties of 14 July 1933 legally established the Nazi Party's monopoly. On 1 December 1933, the Law to secure the unity of party and state entered into force, which was the base for a progressive intertwining of party structures and state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dieter Kuntz |title=Hitler and the functioning of the Third Reich |work=The Routledge History of the Holocaust |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this law, the SA—actually a party division—was given quasi-governmental authority and their leader was co-opted as an ''ex officio'' cabinet member. By virtue of a 30 January 1934 Law concerning the reorganisation of the ''Reich'', the ''Länder'' (states) lost their statehood and were demoted to administrative divisions of the ''Reich'''s government ''([[Gleichschaltung]])''. Effectively, they lost most of their power to the ''[[Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|Gaue]]'' that were originally just regional divisions of the party, but took over most competencies of the state administration in their respective sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Schaarschmidt|title=Mobilizing German Society for War: The National Socialist ''Gaue''|work=Visions of Community in Nazi Germany|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Night of the Long Knives (1934)|Röhm Purge]] of 30 June to 2 July 1934 (also known as the "Night of the Long Knives"), Hitler disempowered the SA's leadership—most of whom belonged to the [[Strasserism|Strasserist]] (national revolutionary) faction within the NSDAP—and ordered them killed. He accused them of having conspired to stage a ''coup d'état'', but it is believed that this was only a pretence to justify the suppression of any intraparty opposition. The purge was executed by the SS, assisted by the Gestapo and Reichswehr units. Aside from Strasserist Nazis, they also murdered anti-Nazi conservative figures like former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Richard J. Evans |title=The Third Reich in History and Memory |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2015 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the SA continued to exist but lost much of its importance, while the role of the SS grew significantly. Formerly only a sub-organisation of the SA, it was made into a separate organisation of the NSDAP in July 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chris McNab |title=Hitler's Elite: The SS 1939–45 |publisher=Osprey |year=2013 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of President Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Hitler merged the offices of party leader, head of state and chief of government in one, taking the title of ''[[Führer]] und Reichskanzler''. The [[Hitler's Chancellery|Chancellery of the Führer]], officially an organisation of the Nazi Party, took over the functions of the Office of the President (a government agency), blurring the distinction between structures of party and state even further. The SS increasingly exerted police functions, a development which was formally documented by the merger of the offices of ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' and Chief of the German Police on 17 June 1936, as the position was held by [[Heinrich Himmler]] who derived his authority directly from Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dieter Kuntz |title=Hitler and the functioning of the Third Reich |work=The Routledge History of the Holocaust |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD, formally the "Security Service of the Reichsführer-SS") that had been created in 1931 as an intraparty intelligence became the ''de facto'' intelligence agency of Nazi Germany. It was put under the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA) in 1939, which then coordinated SD, Gestapo and [[Kriminalpolizei|criminal police]], therefore functioning as a hybrid organisation of state and party structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jacques Delarue |title=The Gestapo: A History of Horror |publisher=Frontline Books |year=2008 |pages=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat and abolition===
Officially, the Third Reich lasted only 12 years. The first [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] was signed by representatives of Nazi Germany at [[Reims]], France on 7 May 1945. The war in Europe had come to an end. The defeat of Germany in World War II marked the end of the [[Nazi Germany]] era.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=25}} The party was formally abolished on 10 October 1945 by the [[Allied Control Council]] and [[denazification]] began, along with [[Nuremberg trials|trials of major war criminals]] before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) in Nuremberg.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=25, 26}} Part of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] called for the destruction of the Nationalist Socialist Party alongside the requirement for the reconstruction of the German political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The German Question and the Origins of the Cold War|last=Lewkowicz|first=Nicolas|publisher=Ipoc Press|year=2008|isbn=9788895145273|location=Milan|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Control Council Law no. 2 Providing for the Termination and Liquidation of the Nazi Organization specified the abolition of 52 other Nazi affiliated and supervised organisations and prohibited their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democracies and the Shock of War: The Law as a Battlefield|last=Cogen|first=Marc|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409443636|location=Oxon|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denazification was carried out in Germany and continued until the onset of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945|last=Judt|first=Tony|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2006|isbn=9781440624766|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990: A Handbook, Volume 1|last=Junker|first=Detlef|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521791120|location=Cambridge|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1939 and 1945, the Nazi Party led regime, assisted by [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborationist]] governments and recruits from occupied countries, was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million people,{{sfn|Rummel|1994|p=112}}{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=416}} including 5.5 to 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe),{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}{{sfn|Fischel|1998|p=87}}{{sfn|Bauer|Rozett|1990|p=1799}} and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 [[Porajmos|Romani people]].{{sfn|Hancock|2004|pp=383–396}}{{sfn|Holocaust Memorial Museum}} The estimated total number includes the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|Poles]],{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}} over three million [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet prisoners of war]],{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=184}} [[communist]]s, and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=45}}{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=290}}

==Political programme==
{{Main|National Socialist Program}}
The National Socialist Programme was a formulation of the policies of the party. It contained 25 points and is therefore also known as the "25-point plan" or "25-point programme". It was the official party programme, with minor changes, from its proclamation as such by Hitler in 1920, when the party was still the German Workers' Party, until its dissolution.

==Party composition==

===Command structure===

====Top leadership====
At the top of the Nazi Party was the party chairman ("''Der Führer''"), who held absolute power and full command over the party. All other party offices were subordinate to his position and had to depend on his instructions. In 1934, Hitler founded a separate body for the chairman, [[Hitler's Chancellery (Kanzlei des Führers)|Chancellery of the Führer]], with its own sub-units.

Below the Führer's chancellery was first the "Staff of the [[Deputy Führer]]", headed by [[Rudolf Hess]] from 21 April 1933 to 10 May 1941; and then the "Party Chancellery" (''[[Parteikanzlei]]''), headed by [[Martin Bormann]].

====''Reichsleiter''====
Directly subjected to the Führer were the ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' ("Reich Leader(s)"—the singular and plural forms are identical in German), whose number was gradually increased to eighteen. They held power and influence comparable to the Reich Ministers' in [[Cabinet Hitler|Hitler's Cabinet]]. The eighteen ''Reichsleiter'' formed the "Reich Leadership of the Nazi Party" (''Reichsleitung der NSDAP''), which was established at the so-called [[Brown House, Munich, Germany|Brown House]] in Munich. Unlike a ''[[Gauleiter]]'', a ''Reichsleiter'' did not have individual geographic areas under their command, but were responsible for specific spheres of interest.

===Nazi Party offices===
The Nazi Party had a number of party offices dealing with various political and other matters. These included:
* ''[[NSDAP Office of Racial Policy|Rassenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP]]'' (RPA): "NSDAP Office of Racial Policy"
* ''[[NSDAP Office of Foreign Affairs|Außenpolitische Amt der NSDAP]]'' (APA): "NSDAP Office of Foreign Affairs"
* ''[[NSDAP Office of Colonial Policy|Kolonialpolitisches Amt der NSDAP]]'' (KPA): "NSDAP Office of Colonial Policy"
* ''[[NSDAP Office of Military Policy|Wehrpolitisches Amt der NSDAP]]'' (WPA): "NSDAP Office of Military Policy"
* ''[[Amt Rosenberg]]'' (ARo): "[[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] Office"

===Paramilitary groups===
In addition to the Nazi Party proper, several paramilitary groups existed which "supported" Nazi aims. All members of these paramilitary organizations were required to become regular Nazi Party members first and could then enlist in the group of their choice. An exception was the [[Waffen-SS]], considered the military arm of the SS and Nazi Party, which during the Second World War allowed members to enlist without joining the Nazi Party. Foreign volunteers of the Waffen-SS were also not required to be members of the Nazi Party, although many joined local nationalist groups from their own countries with the same aims. Police officers, including members of the [[Gestapo]], frequently held SS rank for administrative reasons (known as "rank parity") and were likewise not required to be members of the Nazi Party.

A vast system of [[Nazi Party paramilitary ranks]] developed for each of the various paramilitary groups. This was part of the process of ''Gleichschaltung'' with the paramilitary and auxiliary groups swallowing existing associations and federations after the Party was flooded by millions of membership applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives|last=Steber|first=Martina|last2=Gotto|first2=Bernhard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780199689590|location=New York|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The major Nazi Party paramilitary groups were as follows:
* ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS): "Protection Squadron" (both [[Allgemeine SS]] and [[Waffen-SS]])
* ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA): "Storm Division"
* ''[[National Socialist Flyers Corps|Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps]]'' (NSFK): "National Socialist Flyers Corps"
* ''[[National Socialist Motor Corps|Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrerkorps]]'' (NSKK): "National Socialist Motor Corps"

The [[Hitler Youth]] was a paramilitary group divided into an adult leadership corps and a general membership open to boys aged fourteen to eighteen. The [[League of German Girls]] was the equivalent group for girls.

===Affiliated organizations===
Certain nominally independent organizations had their own legal representation and own property, but were supported by the Nazi Party. Many of these associated organizations were labour unions of various professions. Some were older organizations that were nazified according to the ''Gleichschaltung'' policy after the 1933 takeover.
* Reich League of German Officials (union of civil servants, predecessor to [[German Civil Service Federation]])
* [[German Labour Front]] (DAF)
* National Socialist German Physicians' League (NSDÄB)
* National Socialist League for the Maintenance of the Law (NSRB, 1936–1945, earlier National Socialist German Lawyers' League)
* [[NSKOV|National Socialist War Victim's Care]] (NSKOV)
* [[National Socialist Teachers League]] (NSLB)
* [[National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV)
* [[Reich Labour Service]] (RAD)
* [[German Faith Movement]]
* [[German Colonial League]] (RKB)
* [[German Red Cross]]
* [[Kyffhäuserbund|Kyffhäuser League]]
* [[TENO|Technical Emergency Relief]] (TENO)
* [[Reichsbund der Kinderreichen|Reich's Union of Large Families]]
* [[Reichsluftschutzbund]] (RLB)
* [[Reichskolonialbund]] (RKB)
* [[Bund Deutscher Osten]] (BDO)
* [[German American Bund]]

The employees of large businesses with international operations such as [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Dresdner Bank]], and [[Commerzbank]] were mostly party members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Crimes of the Deutsche Bank and the Dresdner Bank: Office of Military Government (U.S.) Reports|last=Simpson|first=Christopher|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2002|isbn=9780841914070|location=London|pages=149, 257, 299}}&lt;/ref&gt; All German businesses abroad were also required to have their own Nazi Party ''Ausland-Organization'' liaison men, which enabled the party leadership updated and excellent intelligence on the actions of the global corporate elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi International: The Nazis' Postwar Plan to Control Finance, Conflict, Physics and Space|last=Farrell|first=Joseph|publisher=SCB Distributors|year=2008|isbn=9781931882934|location=Kempton, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Regional administration==

[[File:NS administrative Gliederung 1944.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Administrative units of the Nazi Party in 1944]]
{{See also|Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|List of Gauleiters}}

For the purpose of centralization in the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process a rigidly hierarchal structure was established in the Nazi Party, which it later carried through in the whole of Germany in order to consolidate total power under the person of [[Hitler]] (''Führerstaat''). It was regionally sub-divided into a number of ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]]'' (singular: ''Gau'') headed by a ''[[Gauleiter]]'', who received their orders directly from Hitler. The name (originally a term for sub-regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] headed by a ''Gaugraf'') for these new provincial structures was deliberately chosen because of its [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] connotations. The term is approximately equivalent to the English ''[[shire]]''.

While the Nazis maintained the nominal existence of state and regional governments in Germany itself, this policy was not extended to territories acquired after 1937. Even in German-speaking areas such as Austria, state and regional governments were formally disbanded as opposed to just being dis-empowered. After the ''[[Anschluss]]'' a new type of administrative unit was introduced called a ''[[Reichsgau]]''. In these territories the Gauleiters also held the position of [[Reichsstatthalter]], thereby formally combining the spheres of both party and state offices. The establishment of this type of district was subsequently carried out for any further territorial annexations of Germany both before and during [[World War II]]. Even the former territories of [[Prussia]] were never formally re-integrated into what was then Germany's largest state after being re-taken in the 1939 Polish campaign.

The ''Gaue'' and ''Reichsgaue'' (state or province) were further sub-divided into ''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]'' (counties) headed by a ''Kreisleiter'', which were in turn sub-divided into ''Zellen'' (cells) and ''Blocken'' (blocks), headed by a ''Zellenleiter'' and ''Blockleiter'' respectively.

A reorganization of the ''Gaue'' was enacted on 1 October 1928. The given numbers were the official ordering numbers. The statistics are from 1941, for which the ''Gau'' organization of that moment in time forms the basis. Their size and populations are not exact; for instance, according to the official party statistics the ''Gau'' Kurmark/Mark Brandenburg was the largest in the German Reich.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; By 1941, there were 42 territorial ''Gaue'' for Germany,&lt;ref&gt;The 43rd ''Gau'' known as the [[NSDAP/AO|Auslandsorganisation]] is non-territorial.&lt;/ref&gt; 7 of them for Austria, the [[Sudetenland]] (in [[Czechoslovakia]]), [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] and the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]], along with the unincorporated regions under German control known as the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia and the [[General Government]], established after the joint [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939 at the onset of World War II.{{r|GHI2008}} Getting the leadership of the individual ''Gaue'' to cooperate with one another proved difficult at times since there was constant administrative and financial jockeying for control going on between them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Broszat, ''The Hitler State: The Foundation and Development of the Internal Structure of the Third Reich'' (London and New York: Longman, 1985), pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below uses the organizational structure that existed before its dissolution in 1945. More information on the older ''Gaue'' is in the second table.

===Associated organizations abroad===
{{See also|NSDAP/AO}}

====''Gaue'' in Switzerland====
The irregular Swiss branch of the Nazi Party also established a number of Party ''Gaue'' in that country, most of them named after their regional capitals. These included ''Gau [[Canton of Basel|Basel]]-[[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]]'', ''Gau [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]]'', ''Gau [[Canton of Luzern|Luzern]]'', ''Gau [[Canton of Bern|Bern]]'' and ''Gau [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]]''.&lt;ref name="google9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Examples of NSDAP and National Front meetings and agendas in northern Switzerland, 1935, 1937"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archiv des Historischen Vereins des Kantons Bern, vol 57–60"/&gt; The ''Gau Ostschweiz'' (East Switzerland) combined the territories of three cantons: [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Canton of Thurgau|Thurgau]] and [[Canton of Appenzell|Appenzell]].&lt;ref name="Die Nationale front"/&gt;

==Membership==

===General membership===
[[File:Parteibuch der NSDAP.jpg|thumb|Membership of the Nazi Party from 1939]]
{{Main|List of Nazi Party members}}
The general membership of the Nazi Party mainly consisted of the urban and rural [[lower middle class]]es. 7% belonged to the upper class, another 7% were [[peasant]]s, 35% were industrial workers and 51% were what can be described as middle class. In early 1933, just before Hitler's appointment to the chancellorship, the party showed an under-representation of "workers", who made up 29.7% of the membership but 46.3% of German society. Conversely, white-collar employees (18.6% of members and 12% of Germans), the self-employed (19.8% of members and 9.6% of Germans) and civil servants (15.2% of members and 4.8% of the German population) had joined in proportions greater than their share of the general population.&lt;ref name="Panayi 2007, p. 40"/&gt; These members were affiliated with local branches of the party, of which there were 1,378 throughout the country in 1928. In 1932, the number had risen to 11,845, reflecting the party's growth in this period.&lt;ref name="Panayi 2007, p. 40"/&gt;

When it came to power in 1933, the Nazi Party had over {{Nowrap|2 million}} members. In 1939, the membership total rose to 5.3&amp;nbsp;million with 81% being male and 19% being female. It continued to attract many more and by 1945 the party reached its peak of 8 million with 63% being male and 37% being female (about 10% of the German population of 80&amp;nbsp;million).{{sfn|McNab|2011|pp=22, 23}}&lt;ref name="Population"/&gt;

===Military membership===
Nazi members with military ambitions were encouraged to join the Waffen-SS, but a great number enlisted in the ''Wehrmacht'' and even more were drafted for service after World War&amp;nbsp;II began. Early regulations required that all ''Wehrmacht'' members be non-political and any Nazi member joining in the 1930s was required to resign from the Nazi Party.

However, this regulation was soon waived and there is ample evidence that full Nazi Party members served in the ''Wehrmacht'' in particular after the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II. The ''Wehrmacht'' Reserves also saw a high number of senior Nazis enlisting, with [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Fritz Todt]] joining the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', as well as [[Karl Hanke]] who served in the army.

===Student membership===
In 1926, the party formed a special division to engage the student population, known as the [[National Socialist German Students' League]] (NSDStB). A group for university lecturers, the [[National Socialist German University Lecturers' League]] (NSDDB), also existed until July 1944.

===Women membership===
The [[NS-Frauenschaft|National Socialist Women's League]] was the [[women's wing|women's organization]] of the party and by 1938 it had approximately 2 million members.

===Membership outside Germany===
Party members who lived outside Germany were pooled into the ''Auslands-Organisation'' ([[NSDAP/AO]], "Foreign Organization"). The organization was limited only to so-called "[[Imperial Germans]]"; and "Ethnic Germans" (''[[Volksdeutsche]]''), who did not hold German citizenship were not permitted to join.

Under [[Beneš decrees|Beneš decree]] [[Beneš decrees#List of decrees|No. 16/1945 Coll.]], in case of citizens of Czechoslovakia membership of the Nazi Party was punishable by between five and twenty years of imprisonment.

====''Deutsche Gemeinschaft''====
''Deutsche Gemeinschaft'' was a branch of the Nazi Party founded in 1919, created for Germans with ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' status.&lt;ref name="Fakty"/&gt; It is not to be confused with the post-war right-wing ''{{lang|de|{{Interlanguage link multi|Deutsche Gemeinschaft|de|3=Deutsche Gemeinschaft (Deutschland)}}}}'', which was founded in 1949.

Notable members included:&lt;ref name="gemeinschaft"&gt;Wolfgang Rosar: ''Deutsche Gemeinschaft. Seyss-Inquart und der Anschluß''. Europa-Verlag, Wien 1971. {{ISBN|3-203-50384-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oswald Menghin]] ([[Vienna]])
* [[Herbert Czaja]] ([[Province of Silesia]] inside [[Prussia]]){{fact|date=September 2018}}
* [[Hermann Neubacher]] who was responsible for invading Yugoslavia.
* [[Rudolf Much]] ([[Vienna]])
* [[Arthur Seyß-Inquart]] ([[Vienna]])

==Party symbols==
* [[Flag of Germany|Nazi flags]]: The Nazi Party used a right-facing [[swastika]] as their symbol and the red and black colours were said to represent ''[[Blood and soil|Blut und Boden]]'' ("blood and soil"). Another definition of the flag describes the colours as representing the ideology of National Socialism, the swastika representing the Aryan race and the Aryan nationalist agenda of the movement; white representing Aryan racial purity; and red representing the socialist agenda of the movement. Black, white and red were in fact the colours of the old [[North German Confederation]] flag (invented by [[Otto von Bismarck]], based on the Prussian colours black and white and the red used by northern German states). In 1871, with the foundation of the German Reich the flag of the North German Confederation became the German ''Reichsflagge'' ("Reich flag"). Black, white and red became the colours of the nationalists through the following history (for example [[World War I]] and the [[Weimar Republic]]).
:The [[:File:Flag of the NSDAP (1920–1945).svg|''Parteiflagge'']] design, with the centred swastika disc, served as the party flag from 1920. Between 1933 (when the Nazi Party came to power) and 1935, it was used as the National flag (''Nationalflagge'') and Merchant flag (''Handelsflagge''), but interchangeably with the [[:File:Flag of German Reich (1933–1935).svg|black-white-red horizontal tricolour]]. In 1935, the black-white-red horizontal tricolour was scrapped (again) and the [[:File:Flag of German Reich (1935–1945).svg|flag with the off-centre swastika and disc]] was instituted as the national flag, and remained as such until 1945. The flag with the centred disk continued to be used after 1935, but exclusively as the ''Parteiflagge'', the flag of the party.
* [[Coat of arms of Germany|German eagle]]: The Nazi Party used the traditional [[Coat of arms of Germany|German eagle]], standing atop of a swastika inside a wreath of oak leaves. It is also known as the "Iron Eagle"''.'' When the eagle is looking to its left shoulder, it symbolises the Nazi Party and was called the ''Parteiadler''. In contrast, when the eagle is looking to its right shoulder, it symbolises the country (''[[Reich]]'') and was therefore called the ''[[Reichsadler]]''. After the Nazi Party came to national power in Germany, they replaced the traditional version of the German eagle with the modified party symbol throughout the country and all its institutions.

&lt;ref name="politicians"&gt;Hitler stated: "Today our left-wing politicians in particular are constantly insisting that their craven-hearted and obsequious foreign policy necessarily results from the disarmament of Germany, whereas the truth is that this is the policy of traitors […] But the politicians of the Right deserve exactly the same reproach. It was through their miserable cowardice that those ruffians of Jews who came into power in 1918 were able to rob the nation of its arms." Adolf Hitler. ''Mein Kampf''.

'''Nonpartisanism''' is a lack of affiliation with, and a lack of bias toward, a [[political party]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Merriam-Webster's]]'' dictionary defines ''nonpartisan'' as: Not partisan; free from party affiliation, [[bias]], or designation. {{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonpartisan | title=Webster: Nonpartisan | accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an Oxford English Dictionary definition of ''partisan'' includes adherents of a party, cause, person, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd. ed, partisan&lt;/ref&gt; in most cases, nonpartisan refers specifically to political party connections rather than being the strict [[antonym]] of "partisan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/nonpartisan Cambridge Dictionary - nonpartisan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/nonpartisan Macmillan Dictionary - nonpartisan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonpartisan American Heritage Dictionary - nonpartisan&lt;br&gt;Collins English Dictionary - nonpartisan&lt;br&gt;Websters College Dictionary - nonpartisan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{main|Nonpartisanism in the United States}}
Today, nonpartisan elections are generally held for [[municipal]] and [[county]] offices, especially [[board of education|school board]], and are also common in the election of [[judge]]s.  The [[unicameral]] [[Nebraska State Legislature]] is the only state legislature that is entirely officially nonpartisan.

Although elections may be officially nonpartisan, in some elections (usually involving larger cities or counties, as well as the Nebraska Unicameral) the party affiliations of candidates are generally known, most commonly by the groups endorsing a particular candidate (e.g., a candidate endorsed by a labor union would be generally affiliated with the Democratic Party, while a candidate endorsed by a business coalition would be generally affiliated with the Republican Party).{{cn|date=June 2017}}

===Churches and other 501(c)(3) organizations===
Churches and charities in the United States were mainly formed under US [[Internal Revenue Service]] tax code [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization.  To maintain that [[tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status, and the ability for donors to take a tax deduction, they were required to remain nonpartisan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbtlj.org/v08p1/v08p1elacquaar.pdf Eyes wide shut: The ambiguous "political activity" prohibition and its effects on [[501(c)(3)]] organizations, Houston Business and Tax Journal, by Amelia Elacqua, 2008, pages 118, 119 and 141, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

This has caused some to question the ability of organizations that have the appearance of partisanship.  Some predominantly [[African-American]] churches promote  Democratic candidates. Some predominantly [[whites|white]] [[evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches were seen as promoting Republican candidates.  Most churches regardless of color were seen to promote ballot measures that defined marriage as being between one man and one woman.

The [[Brookings Institution]] is a [[Washington, D.C.]] [[think tank]] and [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit, nonpartisan organization.  Since its founding in 1916, it has had both identifiable Republicans and Democrats among its leadership. Owing to leadership changes such as this, some argue that it is a good example of a nonpartisan organization. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has at times listed the organization as being [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], liberal-centrist, [[centrist]], and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/americas/16iht-gitmo.1.17859399.html?_r=2 | work=The New York Times | first=William | last=Glaberson | title=Closing Guantánamo may not be easy | date=November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/politics/14heritage.html Next Generation of Conservatives (By the Dormful)] by Jason DeParle, ''New York Times'',  June 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E4D61F3FF936A25756C0A96F958260 Silicon Valley's New Think Tank Stakes Out 'Radical Center'] by Neil A.

Robinson, 83, Former Foundation Chief, Dies] by Wolfgang Saxon, ''New York Times'', January 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''The New York Times'' published an article where it referred to the "conservative Brookings Institution".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Nonpartisan League===
In [[U.S. history]], the [[Nonpartisan League]] was an influential [[socialist]] political movement, especially in the Upper [[Midwest]], particularly during the 1910s and 1920s. It also contributed much to the ideology of the former [[Progressive Party of Canada]]. It went into decline and merged with the Democratic Party of North Dakota to form the [[North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party]] in 1956.

=== Milwaukee ===
In the [[history of Milwaukee]], the "Nonpartisans" were an unofficial but widely recognized coalition of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who cooperated in an effort to keep Milwaukee's [[Sewer Socialists]] out of as many offices as possible, including in elections which were officially non-partisan, but in which Socialists and "Nonpartisans" were clearly identified in the press.&lt;ref&gt;"School Board Returns Even: Both Nonpartisans and Socialists Pick Five Candidates Each" ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' March 18, 1931; p. 1, col. 7&lt;/ref&gt; (Such candidates were sometimes called "fusion" candidates.&lt;ref&gt;"Fusion In Many Districts; Old Parties Unite On Legislative Candidates" ''Milwaukee Journal'' November 1, 1918; p. 9, col. 2&lt;/ref&gt;) This lasted from the 1910s&lt;ref&gt;Avella, Steven M. "Milwaukee Catholicism: Essays on Church and Community" Milwaukee: Milwaukee Knights of Columbus, 1991; pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; well into the 1940s. (The similar effort in 1888 to prevent [[Herman Kroeger]]'s election as a [[Labor Party (United States, 19th century)|Union Labor]] candidate had been conducted under the banner of a temporary "Citizen's Party" label.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Robert W. ''This Is Milwaukee'' New York: Doubleday, 1970; p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;) During the period of Socialist-[[Wisconsin Progressive Party|Progressive]] cooperation (1935-1941), the two sides were called "Progressives" and "Nonpartisans".&lt;ref&gt;Cibulka, James G. and Olson, Frederick I. "The Organization of the Milwaukee Public School System" in ''Seeds of Crisis: Public Schooling in Milwaukee since 1920'' Rury, John L. and Cassell, Frank A., eds. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993; p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

== India==
In India, the [[Jaago Re! One Billion Votes]] campaign was a non-partisan campaign initiated by [[Tata Tea]], and [[Janaagraha]] to encourage citizens to vote in the [[Indian general election, 2009]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The campaign was a non-partisan campaign initiated by [[Anal Saha]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14972">[[File:Zar Nikolaus 1.jpg|thumb|[[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (reigned 1825–55) made '''Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality''' the main doctrine of his reign]]
'''Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality''' ({{lang-ru|Правосла́вие, самодержа́вие, наро́дность, Pravoslávie, samoderzhávie, naródnost'}}), also known as '''Official Nationality''',&lt;ref name="R132"&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nationality in this context starts with a capital letter to differentiate it from nationality/''{{lang|ru|narodnost}}'' as one of its three parts&lt;/ref&gt; was the dominant [[ideology|ideological]] [[doctrine]] of [[Russia]]n emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. It was "the Russian version of a general European ideology of restoration and reaction" that followed the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name="R133"&gt;Riasanovsky, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Triad" of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education [[Sergey Uvarov]] in his April 2, 1833&lt;ref&gt;Date as in Riasanovsky, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; circular letter to subordinate educators.&lt;ref name="H146"&gt;Hosking, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like [[Mikhail Pogodin]],&lt;ref name="R1389"&gt;Riasanovsky, pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fyodor Tyutchev]]&lt;ref name="R135"/&gt; and [[Nikolai Gogol]].&lt;ref name="R135"&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the policy saw this principle as a call for [[Russification]]. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia's first statewide political ideology since the 16th century,&lt;ref name="H146"/&gt; indicated the nation's brewing transition to [[modernity]].&lt;ref name="K54"&gt;Hoffmann, Kotsonis, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quest for ideology==

Nicholas I emerged as the emperor in the wake of [[Decembrist revolt]]; subsequent investigation proved that disloyalty was deeply rooted within the noble estate – the sole foundation of the [[House of Romanov]].&lt;ref name=H145&gt;Hosking, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Paul I of Russia|father]] and [[Peter III of Russia|grandfather]] were killed by their own guards and statesmen in palace coups. Keen to eradicate the rebels and ensure his own physical security, Nicholas carefully studied proceedings of the Decembrists investigation and was aware of defects in [[Alexander I of Russia|his predecessor]]'s government that fueled the mutiny.&lt;ref name=H145/&gt; "In one sense, the reign of Nicholas I was a protracted [[epilogue]] to the Decembrist rising."&lt;ref name=H144&gt;Hosking, p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas, acting in line with his [[Autocracy|absolutist]] predecessors of the [[Russian Enlightenment|Age of Enlightenment]], developed a state education system and completed codification of the law.&lt;ref name=H1445&gt;Hosking, pp.144-145,148&lt;/ref&gt; He installed a highly regulated but ultimately inefficient government system of "anxious centralization", himself being the chief arbiter between rivalling statesmen.&lt;ref name=H146&gt;Hosking, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately the system created by Nicolas I was unsound and ineffective, since the Emperor did not have any physical possibility to oversee personally all the business and to personally look through all papers to be signed. The Emperor found himself a prisoner of his own system, so he could only rely on his high officials in most of his day-to-day activity. Higher officials relied on officials of lower rank. In most cases government officials, even ministers, did things on their own and paid little attention to general instructions given by the Emperor in one case or another. The autocracy was exploited by government officials (''chinovniki'') for their own benefit. The autocracy in fact turned out to be a cover to hide the acts made by officials at all levels. Back in those days, it was ''chinovniki'' who had real power, but not the Emperor, who was nothing more but a promulgator of laws. Nevertheless, if a certain law was not lucrative or was disadvantageous for government officials, it was not a problem to make legal obstacles to enforce such law. Sometimes a law was simply abolished without the Emperor knowing about it, as it was usually the case with the Emperor’s acts regulating commercial activity of Saint Petersburg negotiants (''kuptsy''). In any case the Emperor always got a report that everything went well and all his instructions had been implemented. But he also attributed the nobles' disloyalty to a Europe-wide conspiracy aimed at destroying ruling monarchies, religion and morale.&lt;ref name=H146/&gt; Russia, according to his point of view, succeeded in [[Napoleonic Wars]] while more advanced regimes failed, and saved Europe from plunging into decay and [[atheism]].&lt;ref name=H146/&gt;

==Forging the triad==
[[File:Sergey Uvarov by Utkin.jpg|thumb|[[Sergey Uvarov]] in the 1830s. Engraving by [[Nikolai Utkin]].]]
[[Sergey Uvarov]], Minister of Education and President of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] since 1818, was also a writer, a scholar and at times was considered a [[freethought|freethinker]]. Yet, with a change in domestic politics, he easily adjusted to a tightened regime.&lt;ref name="R132"&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 Uvarov forged the emperor's program into a brief statement of ideology:

{{Quote|It is our common obligation to ensure that the education of the people be conducted, according to Supreme intention of our August Monarch, '''in the joint spirit of Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality'''. I am convinced that every professor and teacher, being permeated by one and the same feeling of devotion to the throne and fatherland, will use all his resources to become a worthy tool for the government and to earn its complete confidence.&lt;ref name="H146"/&gt;}}

Tsar Nicholas I had remembered the [[Decembrist revolt]] for all his life. He always suspected secret societies and uprisings to be plotted around him. Such personal feelings of the Tsar had great influence on the development of Russia. In order to meet the demands of the new state of affairs under Nicholas I, the Minister of Public Education S. Uvarov proposed to give new original shape to the national educational system. He said that Russia needs such educational system which could produce skilled, professional, well prepared executors of the Emperor’s wishes. Such educational system should not only provide knowledge to people, but also made them unconditionally loyal to the Emperor. Briefly speaking, Uvarov tried to deprive education of its most important integral part – analytical and critical approach to environment (specifically to political environment).

According to Uvarov’s theory, the Russian folk (''narod'') is very religious and devoted to the Emperor, the Orthodox religion and autocracy are unconditional bases of the existence of Russia. ''Narodnost'' (nationality) is deemed to be the necessity to follow independent national traditions and to fight foreign influence. The theory stated that it was necessary to reject western ideas – freedom of thinking, freedom of personality, individualism, rationalism which were considered by Orthodox religion as dangerous and rebel thinking. The chief of Russian political police (the III Department of His Majesty's Personal Chancellery) A. Benckendorff wrote that “the past of Russia was wonderful, the present is splendid and the future is above all dreams”. These three concepts were considered as "pillar-walls" of the Russian Empire. Uvarov's triad was the first explicit statement of government ideology in Russian history since the 16th century.&lt;ref name="H146"/&gt; He repeated the triad and elaborated on the topic throughout the 16 years of his ministry&lt;ref name="R132"/&gt; and was eventually awarded the title of a [[Count]]. "Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality" became the Uvarov family motto, decreed by Nicholas.&lt;ref name="R133"/&gt; Yet he also did much as a true educator, raising educational standards, establishing new colleges, increasing the number of scholarships for overseas training. Under Uvarov, the "Russian educational system, with all its fundamental flaws, came to emphasize academic thoroughness and high standards", although it also became more exclusive at all levels.&lt;ref name="R146"&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; It means that only less than 1% of Russian population (only noble ones, many of them of foreign descent) had the possibility to get the education, it was almost impossible for Russian non-nobles to get access to education. Within this meaning, the ''Narodnost'' (nationality) meant that Russian folk had to stay away from education (Western influence) in order to preserve the folk's pure Russian national character.

==Components==
The three components of Uvarov's triad were:
* [[Orthodoxy]] — Orthodox Christianity and protection of [[Russian Orthodox Church]].
* [[Tsarist autocracy|Autocracy]] — unconditional loyalty to [[House of Romanov]] in return for [[paternalism|paternalist]] protection for all [[Social estates in the Russian Empire|social estates]].
* [[Nationality]] — ''{{lang|ru|Narodnost}}'' has been also translated as ''nationality,'' ''national spirit,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutchings |first=Stephen C. |title=Russian Literary Culture in the Camera Age: The Word as Image |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=86|ISBN= 041530668X }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''populism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Ewa M. | authorlink = Ewa Thompson|title=The Search for Self-definition in Russian Literature |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |year=1991 |page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before its adoption by Nicholas I, ''{{lang|ru|narodnost}}'' was a central tenet of [[Russian Romantic writers]], the Russian expression of a principle more often called [[Romantic nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aatseel.org/100111/pdf/program/2007/30a5_1frazier_melissa.pdf O. I. Senkovskii and Romantic Empire]&lt;/ref&gt; The word represents exact translation of term [[Volkstum]] and describes the same ideas. Narodnost means recognition of the state-founding role on the Russian nationality and equal citizen rights for all other peoples inhabiting Russia, with [[Antisemitism in the Russian Empire|exclusion of Jews]] because of their "imminent hate towards Russian people and anti-human nature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krotov.info/acts/20/1900/1906anti.html Program of Union of Russian people]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of three parts of the triad remained fixed in all circumstances even when the words themselves changed: military cadets were instructed to be "Christians, loyal subjects and Russians", the common public motto called "For Faith, Tsar and Fatherland".&lt;ref name="R135"&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The triad was inherently unbalanced in favor of centralized autocracy. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was impoverished and incapable of being an independent political force.&lt;ref name="H147"&gt;Hosking, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The Government remained wary of ''any'' philosophy, including [[theology]].&lt;ref name="R135"/&gt; [[Nationality]] through empowerment of the people was not a choice from the start and became even less probable after the dreaded [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[Revolutions of 1848]] "reduced Nicholas to a state of almost [[catatonia|catatonic]] fear".&lt;ref name="H149"&gt;Hosking, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; It also ran against the ever-increasing role of [[Baltic Germans]] in the government system; even converted to Orthodoxy, they retained their distinct ethnicity.&lt;ref name="H149"&gt;Hosking, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reception==
The press, [[censorship|censored]] by the state, eagerly embraced the new doctrine and was dominated by it until the end of Nicholas's reign.&lt;ref name="R134"&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stepan Shevyryov]], editor of ''{{lang|ru|[[Moskvityanin]]}}'' magazine, asserted that "even if we did pick certain unavoidable blemishes from the West, we have on the other hand preserved in ourselves, in their purity, three fundamental feelings which contain the seed and guarantee of our future development."&lt;ref name="R134"/&gt;

[[Slavophilia|Slavophiles]], in particular, accepted the anti-European, anti-absolutist, paternalistic side of the doctrine. [[Mikhail Pogodin]] explained the paternalistic, peaceful nature of autocracy as seen by Slavophiles: "the secret of Russian history, the secret which not a single Western sage is able to comprehend: Russian history always depicts Russia as a single family in which the ruler is the father and the subjects are children. The father retains full authority over children while he allows them to have full freedom ... there can be no suspicion, no treason; their fate, their happiness, their peace they share in common. This is true in relation to the state as a whole..."&lt;ref name="R1389"&gt;Riasanovsky, pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Nadezhdin]], who initially entertained the westernized, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schellingian]] notion of ''nationality'', radically changed his mind in favor of Official Nationality in the wake of the [[Pyotr Chaadayev|Chaadayev affair]] (1837), writing that "nationality had always consisted of love of the Tsar and obedience, and which in the future should display in itself, to Europe's dismay, a brilliant lesson of how from the holy unity of autocracy, must arise an exemplary and splendid national enlightenment...".&lt;ref name="K55"&gt;Hoffmann, Kotsonis, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Gogol]] in his final work ''[[Selected Passages from Correspondence with his Friends]]'' (1847) extended Official Nationality to relationships between landlords and serfs: "Make them [serfs] see clearly that in everything that concerns them you are acting in accordance with the will of God and not in accordance with some European or other fancies on your own."&lt;ref name="R136"&gt;Riasanovsky, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''PeaceMaker''''' is a [[video game]] developed by ImpactGames, and published in February 2007 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]. It is a [[government simulation game]] which simulates the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. Labelled as a [[serious game]], it is often pitched as "a video game to promote peace".

The game was originally a university project started in 2005 by a small team from the [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. After graduating, two of the members founded a game development company in order to finish the project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

''Peacemaker'' players can choose to represent either the leader of [[Israel]] or [[the Palestinian Authority]]. They have to deal with events presented using real world pictures and footage. They have to react and make social, political, and military decisions that their position entails within a gameplay system similar to [[turn-based strategy]]. The goal of the game is to solve the conflict with the [[two-state solution]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

''PeaceMaker'' was well received by both the gaming and general press and won several awards. Critics praised its gameplay and the accuracy of the conflict representation. It is seen as an important game for the serious game movement and is becoming a flagship of the genre. Its educational value allows for a better understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promotes peace.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

== Gameplay ==
[[File:PeaceMaker - Game interface.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Screenshot of the main screen of ''PeaceMaker''|The game interface includes a map of the region, reminiscent of the [[turn-based strategy]] conventions.]]

''PeaceMaker'' is a [[government simulation game]] that incorporates elements of [[turn-based strategy]]. The player choose to be either the [[Prime Minister of Israel]] or the [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]], and must resolve the conflict peacefully. The game interface includes a map, like ''[[Civilization]]'', showing the [[Gaza Strip]], the [[Galilee]], the [[West Bank]] and the north of the [[Negev]].&lt;ref name="Eurogamer-Critique" /&gt; After each turn, the events of the week are pointed on the map. By clicking on it, the player views a news report, with real-world pictures and footage, of a demonstration or a bomb attack.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

Each week, the player makes a decision regarding security, construction or politics. He may seek the advice of two advisers with differing opposite views. The Palestinian President is helped by a national and a foreign adviser. The Israeli Prime Minister has the views of a [[hawk]], advocating repressive measures, and a [[dove]], willing to help the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; The player has access to panel of decision, such as making a speech, negotiating with other leaders or staging military operations. Reflecting the [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] conflict, the two leaders cannot make the same decisions. The Israeli Prime Minister has major financial and military power, and can for example order missile strikes or a curfew. The Palestinian President is much more helpless, and has to ask the third-party help for most of his actions.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer-Critique" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt;

[[File:PeaceMaker - Speech action.jpg|thumb|left|The player performs one actions at each turn, such as giving his people a political speech.]]

A key-point of the game is that the actions of the players do not always have the expected outcome. For example, an Israeli proposal for medical aid shortly after an air strike will be turned down, and will deteriorate even further the relation with the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt;
The player actions provoke immediate reactions, such as public protest or political critics. They also influence several long-term variables, classified into two categories. The first is the approval of the policy of the player by different groups and leaders. The second covers economical, social or political indicators. Their values are displayed on the screen as thermometers.&lt;ref name="Tutorial" /&gt;

Each leader must take into account the approval of his counterpart, of both people, of the [[Organisation des Nations unies|United Nations]], the [[United States]] and the [[Arab world]]. The Palestinian President also has to deal with the [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]] ; and the Israeli Prime Minister with the [[Yesha Council]] (representing the settlers) and all the Palestinian militant organisations (such as the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]], the [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]] and the [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]]).&lt;ref name="Tutorial" /&gt; The player has access to polls, which represent the different indicators. Each leader is informed of his [[leadership]] and the quality of his relations with the other party. On the Palestinian side, the polls cover the authority of the President, the opinion of the man of the street towards Israel, economic health and national independence. On the Israeli side, they reflect the insecurity, the suppression, and the Israeli compassion towards the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="Tutorial" /&gt;

The opinions of the different parties are summarised by two counters displayed on the screen. Ranging from −100 to 100, they measure the approval of two groups. In the role of the Prime Minister of Israel, those two groups are the Israeli and Palestinian people ; in the role of Palestinian President, of its citizens and the [[international community]]. The game starts with both counters at zero. Any of them dropping too low cause the [[game over]]: either the leader is removed from office, or the new [[:wikt:intifada|intifada]] begins. When both counters are up to the maximum, the conflict is solved by the [[two-state solution]].&lt;ref name="Tutorial" /&gt;

== Development ==
''PeaceMaker'' started as a university project in 2005. It was carried out by a small team of students of the Master of Entertainment Technology at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], a course mixing fine arts and computing. American Eric Brown and former Israeli officer Asi Burak were the [[Video game producer|producers]] of the game. Tim Sweeney was the lead [[game designer]], working with Olive Lin, writer Victoria Webb and composer Ross Popoff. Eric Keylor and Lin were the programmers. The team was supervised by two professors of the university.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SeriousGameSource"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SeriousGamesRise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarnegieMellonPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Team2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Team2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ETC-Nov2005"/&gt;

{{quote|The goal of this group was to create a meaningful interactive experience about one of the most serious political conflicts in the world. Our mission was to prove that such an experience could reach new audiences and convey the message of understanding in a fresh way.|Asi Burak}}

To prototype the [[game design]], the team used [[board game]]s. They helped to "model the stakeholders in the conflict". They were then converted into a [[dice game]] which could be coded.&lt;ref name="PDF-DesignProcess"/&gt; The [[Logic programming|logic engine]] and the [[artificial intelligence]] were developed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. The [[graphical user interface]] used [[Adobe Flash]] and [[QuickTime]].&lt;ref name="PDF-Components"/&gt; The different graphic elements were made by Patrick Bannan. He used the software [[3ds Max]], [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]], starting with [[3D modeling]], [[texture mapping]] and lighting.&lt;ref name="BannanPortfolio"/&gt;

[[File:PeaceMaker - Main menu.jpg|thumb|right|Having the choice of the leader, between the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian National Authority, is a central part of the educative side of the game.]]

A prototype of the game was presented at the [[Game Developers Conference]] in 2005. Given the excellent reception, Brown and Burak decide to complete the project, in order to distribute it to the general public and educators. After graduating, they founded the studio ImpactGames and planned to produce other games of the same kind. Their objective is to "impact society and promote change through interactive media". They also want to change the industry, by "making something that compares to the role documentaries play in the movie industry".&lt;ref name="SeriousGameSource"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SeriousGamesRise"/&gt; In order to make an unbiased game, they wanted the contribution of Palestinians ; two joined the team.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Initially, the developers did not want to "define the end-solution", in order to avoid controversy. Victory was then defined by the lowering of violence. Early players' reactions showed the necessity for "a more meaningful outcome". With the input of experts from both sides and the United States, they chose the [[two-state solution]]. It was mainly because of the support of the [[United Nations Security Council resolution]], the [[roadmap for peace]] and the [[Arab peace initiative]].&lt;ref name="Two-State Solution"/&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref name="Design Assumptions"/&gt;

This choice was one of the design assumptions made by the developers. Game designer Tim Sweeney, although he admitted they are debatable, claimed his right to define the scope of the work. He considered that they do not favour any side, but rather peace. The developers assumed that both sides wanted peace and that the player can make a difference, but does not have total control of their side, and that peace could be achieved through small, concrete actions.&lt;ref name="Design Assumptions"/&gt;

The first stable version of ''PeaceMaker'' was released on 1 February 2005, downloadable from the company website. A box version was published on [[Amazon.com]] four months later.&lt;ref name="OnAmazon"/&gt; The game is playable in [[English language|English]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]], to "strengthen the multiple point-of-views".&lt;ref name="Three Languages"/&gt; The game was sold for twenty dollars. ImpactGames was criticised for this, from people considering that such a game should be free of charge. This had been a major debate at the beginning of the development. Eric Brown explained that being for-profit allowed to find investors more easily. Moreover, they wanted to make an example of commercially viable game within the industry.&lt;ref name="WhyMoney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WhyMoney2"/&gt; On 4 November 2013, Brown updated the ImpactGames blog to announce that ''PeaceMaker'' was now free to download and play, hoping this would "allow the game to find an even larger audience in schools, community centers, and the general public.".&lt;ref name="ImpactGames"/&gt; It can be downloaded from the [http://peacemaker.en.softonic.com Softonic site].

''PeaceMaker'' received positive reviews from both the gaming and general press. In an article published in ''[[Gamasutra]]'', [[Ernest W. Adams]] stated that the game is "fun and challenging", and holds a deep level of subtlety. He compares it to ''[[Balance of Power (video game)|Balance of Power]]'', a simulation of geopolitics during the [[Cold War]], published by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] in 1985. Adams claimed that while ''Balance of Power'' can be summarised as a [[zero-sum game]], ''PeaceMaker'' is "a richer and more difficult challenge".&lt;ref name="AsymmetricPeacefare"/&gt;

''[[Eurogamer]]''’s Oliver Clare noted a few minor [[game design]] flaws, which he attributed to "Impact Games' inexperience with interface design". According to him, "the narrow theme" limits the [[replay value]] and appeal of the game. He stressed that the game shows no bias, and holds an "amazingly positive educational potential". Clare claimed he suffered viewing all the tragedies in the game, and that the first time he won the game, tears came to his eyes : "For a few poignant moments you get an inkling of what peaceful co-existence in the Middle East might actually feel like, what it might mean".&lt;ref name="Eurogamer-Critique"/&gt; Judy Siegel-Itzkovich from ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' had a similar opinion, stating that the game is "immersive" and that "learning the background of this endless dispute could be very educational".&lt;ref name="JerusalemPost2"/&gt; Her colleague Calev Ben-David was impressed by the graphics and texts. He also appreciated the winning condition: according to him, setting a time limit would have been unrealistic.&lt;ref name="JerusalemPost"/&gt;

Critics agreed that the game model is relevant. Alexander Gambotto-Burke from ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as "an astonishingly sophisticated simulation of the Israel/Palestine conflict".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; In a column published in July 2009, [[Steven Poole]] claimed that the game "provides a roughly accurate model of the political and security options on both sides of an actual conflict", and that it was rightly praised. Poole pointed out the game's most educational side is that the intentions of the player do not always lead to the expected outcome. According to him, ''PeaceMaker'' makes the player understand that "even people who do have power cannot control everything, and they, too, can be at the mercy of events".&lt;ref name="Poole"/&gt; ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''’s Marc MacKinnon agreed, stating that "it gives players a feel for the impossibility of [[Mahmoud Abbas]] and [[Ehud Olmert]]’s jobs".&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail"/&gt;

In July 2007, ''PeaceMaker'' was the most sold second PC game of the week in North America on [[Amazon.com]]. The website mentioned a "suddenly high level of demand", that Asi Burak attributed to an interview at the [[National Public Radio]] the same month.&lt;ref name="TopAmazon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TopAmazon2"/&gt; As of February 2008, the game had sold {{formatnum:100000}} copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="PittsburghBusiness"/&gt;

== Impact ==
The rise of Internet allows alternative distribution channels, such as downloading [[freeware]] or through platforms such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]], and later [[Xbox Live Arcade]], [[PlayStation Network]] or [[WiiWare]]. New mainstream developments tools, like [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], allow a democratization of game production. These elements have given rise to new dynamics in the industry, such as [[fangame]], [[Independent video game development|independent game]] and [[serious game]]. This last category refers to games tackling serious issues like war, [[global warming]] or [[gerrymandering]]. In the 2000s, these games receive more coverage by both gaming and general press. They have however a bad reputation because of widely criticised gameplay and game design flaws.&lt;ref name="SeriousGamesRise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GenreMuddle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortin"/&gt;

''PeaceMaker'' has become a flagship of the serious game, and a major step for the acknowledgement of the genre. In 2006, it took the award in a competition organized by the [[University of Southern California]], entitled "Reinventing [[public diplomacy]] through games".&lt;ref name="USCPublicDiplomacy"/&gt; It won the " Best Transformation Game" award in 2007. This prize rewards "the best game which engages players on a deep and meaningful level around an important social issue, whose aims and outcomes are no less than to foster a powerful intellectual or behavioural transformation in it users". It is awarded by the association [[Games for Change]], whose mission is to promote "games that engage contemporary social issues in meaningful ways to foster a more just, equitable and tolerant society". [[Suzanne Seggerman]], co-founder of the association, stated in 2009 that just like ''[[Darfur is Dying]]'', ''[[Food Force]]'' and ''[[Ayiti: The Cost of Life]]'', ''PeaceMaker'' was just such a game, "having had an impact".&lt;ref name="G4C-Awards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SeggermanSpeech"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G4C-News"/&gt;

[[File:Annapolis Logo.jpg|thumb|right|For the [[Annapolis conference]], the [[Peres Center for Peace]] funded a large-scale distribution of the game in Israel and Palestine.]]
''PeaceMaker'' is described by its creators as "a video game to teach peace", and is primarily intended for Israeli and Palestinian students.&lt;ref name="PDF-CoreTarget"/&gt; In November 2007, the [[Peres Center for Peace]] funded the distribution of {{formatnum:100000}} copies in Israel and Palestine. {{formatnum:75000}} copies are sent to the subscribers of the Israeli daily  ''[[Haaretz]]'', {{formatnum:10000}} to subscribers to the Palestinian daily ''[[Al-Quds (newspaper)|Al-Quds]]''. The remaining {{formatnum:15000}} are distributed in high-schools of both sides. This action is made in conjunction with the [[Annapolis conference]], during which all parties agree on the [[two-state solution]].&lt;ref name="PeresCenter-PR"/&gt; Shortly after the Centre set up the "PeaceMaker Educational Program". It consists in using the game in Israeli and Palestinian schools, and to lead a supervised debate with the students. Over fifty workshops were held in 2008, involving {{formatnum:1600}} students from two states.&lt;ref name="PeresCenter-Bulletin"/&gt; This total amounts to {{formatnum:3000}} students in September 2009.&lt;ref name="PeresCenter-Bulletin-September"/&gt;

{{Quote|Can PeaceMaker achieve peace? No. That depends on the hearts and minds of the people who live in the Middle East – both in the affected areas and the neighboring countries too. Can it promote peace, which it states as its goal? Definitely, if it reaches a wide enough audience. Impact Games wants PeaceMaker to be more than merely a classroom tool; they hope it will be a genuinely popular game and a springboard for discussion among many people.|[[Ernest W. Adams]]|The Designer's Notebook: Asymmetric Peacefare&lt;ref name="AsymmetricPeacefare"/&gt;}}

== Legacy ==
In February 2008 ImpactGames launched the program ''Play the News''. It is a web-based platform used to publish [[mini-game]]s based on the news. The idea is that interactivity allows a better understanding of an event, rather than passive reading. A game is designed to be played for ten to twenty minutes, and to be developed in a day.&lt;ref name="IGJournalists"/&gt;

The game is divided into three steps. The player firstly has access to information about the event and its context, using timelines and maps.&lt;ref name="Poynter"/&gt; Then, they can play successively as the different protagonists of the event. They are asked to make a decision, following what they think the stakeholder should do. Finally, the player predicts which decision the protagonist will make. When the player returns later, he is informed of the decisions that were made in the real world.&lt;ref name="IGJournalists"/&gt; ''Play the News'' is built around a community, where every player has a profile. He may read statistics on the accuracy of his predictions and the tendency of his opinions (mainstream or fringe within the community).&lt;ref name="PTN-Tutorial"/&gt;

Shortly after the launch, [[Ian Bogost]] described ''Play the News'' as "very casual", and feared that it could be summarised as a simple quiz. He claimed that the game had some potential to engage people with the news, "by making them think about what will happen next and by creating a natural reason to read stories one otherwise might not".&lt;ref name="PTN-Bogost"/&gt; The game won in May 2009 the first "Knight News Game Awards", awarded by the association [[Games for Change]]. It rewards "news game", games that "[enhance] people's ability to make decisions in a democracy".&lt;ref name="KnightNewsGameAward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KnightNewsGameAwardPR"/&gt;

==History==
The origins of Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura (PKMS) were rooted in the [[List of political parties in Malaysia#Singapore Malay Union|Singapore Malay Union]] (KMS) which was founded in 1926&lt;ref name="WilliamRoff"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Malay Nationalism |last=Roff |first=William R. |authorlink=|author2= |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press (USA) |location=New York |isbn=967-65-3059-X |pages=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1201_2010-05-03.html Mohamed Eunos bin Abdullah] to represent Malay interests.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761580116 |title=Muhammad Eunos Bin Abdullah |accessdate=25 June 2008 |work=MSN Encarta |date= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5sOqgV?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761580116 |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Second World War]], the KMS opposed the proposed [[Malayan Union]] and merged into the [[United Malay National Organization]] (UMNO), which would become dominant in federal politics.

Despite the KMS's connections to UMNO, the modern PKMS organisation originated as an extension of the [[Johor Bahru]] branch of UMNO. It contested the [[Singaporean general election, 1955|1955 Singapore general election]] where it secured one seat at [[Bedok|Ulu Bedok]].&lt;ref name="General Election 1955"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-elections.com/lega-1955-ge/|title=Singapore Legislative Assembly General Election 1955|year=|work=|publisher=Singapore Elections|accessdate=8 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202231/http://www.singapore-elections.com/lega-1955-ge/|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Singaporean general election, 1959|1959 Singapore general election]], UMNO had gained three seats in the Malay-dominated electorates of [[Geylang Serai]], [[Kembangan, Singapore|Kampung Kembangan]], and the Southern Islands.&lt;ref name="General Election 1959"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-elections.com/lega-1959-ge/|title=Singapore Legislative Assembly General Election 1959|year=|work=|publisher=Singapore Elections|accessdate=8 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709090222/http://www.singapore-elections.com/lega-1959-ge/|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 February 1961, it became officially registered as the Singapore United Malay National Organization (SUMNO).&lt;ref name="General Election 1955" /&gt;

SUMNO subsequently joined the [[Singapore Alliance Party]], which also was an extension of the larger federal [[Alliance Party (Malaya)|Alliance Party]] and encompassed the Singapore Malay Union along with local branches of the [[Malayan Chinese Association]] and the [[Malayan Indian Congress]], and former [[Chief Minister of Singapore|Chief Minister]] [[Lim Yew Hock]]'s [[Singapore People's Alliance]].&lt;ref name="A Moment of Anguish"&gt;{{Cite book
  | last =Lau  | first =Albert  | title =A Moment of Anguish: Singapore in Malaysia and the Politics of Disengagement  | publisher =Times Academic Press  | year =1998  | location =Singapore  | url =  | isbn = 981-210-1349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the pro-Malay communal policies of its parent organisation, PKMS became a vocal opponent of [[Lee Kuan Yew]]'s [[People's Action Party]] which it accused of promoting [[Han chauvinism|Chinese chauvinism]] and discriminating against Malays. However, it also shared some of the PAP's policies like supporting merger with [[Malaysia]] and [[anti-Communism]].&lt;ref name="A Moment of Anguish" /&gt;

Under the Singapore Alliance umbrella, SUMNO contested the [[Singaporean general election, 1963|1963 general election]] but performed poorly and lost all its three seats. In total, the Alliance lost all its seven seats. The fallout from this electoral defeat contributed to [[PAP-UMNO relations|sharply deteriorating relations]] between the federal government in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the Singapore state government which culminated in [[1964 race riots in Singapore|racial rioting]] that resulted in Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia in September 1965.&lt;ref name="A Moment of Anguish" /&gt;

On 19 March 1967, the party assumed its current name Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura after the Singapore government passed a new law banning local parties from operating as branches of foreign organisations.  However, PKMS continued to maintain ties with its parent organisation UMNO.&lt;ref name="PKMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-elections.com/political-parties/pkms-umno.html|title=Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura|year=|work=|publisher=Singapore Elections|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Singaporean general election, 1968|1968 general election]], the PKMS did not file any nominations and supported [[Barisan Sosialis]]'s electoral boycott of the [[Parliament of Singapore|Singapore Parliament]]. While the PKMS would contest future elections, it has never won a seat since 1959.

On 3 July 2001, the PKMS joined a political coalition known as the [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] which included the [[Singapore Justice Party]], [[Singapore People's Party]], the [[Singapore National Front]] and the [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]].&lt;ref name="Singapore Democratic Alliance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singapore-elections.com/political-parties/sda.html|title=Singapore Democratic Alliance|year=|work=|publisher=Singapore Elections|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, the party has experienced substantial internal infighting.&lt;ref name="A Moment of Anguish" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PKMS" /&gt; However, it all ended with a court order on 22 March 2012 giving Mr Abu Mohamed and his Supreme Council the rights to administer the office. Since then, PKMS are making up for lost time, making progress to be the voice of not just [[Malay Singaporeans|Malays in Singapore]] but the voice of the younger generations (regardless of race) against any form of colonialism (uphold and safeguard the principles of parliamentary and democratic form of government)and foster goodwill and harmony amongst the citizens of various races in Singapore towards the growth of a strong,united nation without marginalising the locals(born and bred Singaporeans).

The '''Puntland Intelligence Agency''' ({{lang-so|Hay’ada Sirdoonka Buntlaand}}, {{lang-ar|وكالة الاستخبارات بونتلاند}}) is an [[intelligence agency]] based in [[Puntland]], [[Somalia]]. It was officially established in 2001 as '''Puntland Intelligence Service''' during the rule of President [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]], with assistance from the United States.&lt;ref name=GOVOAPIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia: Puntland's Govt Blasts VOA Report As 'Appeasing Al Shabaab'|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201010010192.html|website=Garowe Online|publisher=allAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency operates throughout [[Somalia]], but principally in the autonomous Puntland region, where it serves as the main intelligence and counter-terrorism wing of the [[Puntland Security Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvni.net/radio/nsnl/nsnl136/nsnl136so.html|title=NSNL 136 - Intelligence profle : Somalia|publisher=Cvno.net|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency took the name Puntland Intelligence Agency in 2010 after undergoing extensive reform to streamline it to work side by side with other government agencies across Somalia. These reforms were instituted by former Puntland President [[Abdirahman Farole]].&lt;ref name=ALWAPIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Puntland First Anniversary Report 2009|url=http://www.readbag.com/alwafaagroup-report-puntland-first-anniversary-report-2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recording at the edge''' is the recording of video and storing it either in camera or to a directly connected storage device instead of transporting it across the network to a centralized recording facility such as a [[digital video recorder]].

Recording at the edge is a distributed or de-centralized approach to storage—the video is spread across a number of edge-storage devices as opposed to centralized on one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resource.boschsecurity.com/documents/Application_note_enUS_1575912459.pdf Bosch: Recording at the Edge Solution Brief]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network bandwidth-friendly==
Recording at the edge is a network bandwidth-friendly approach because it does not use any [[Bandwidth (computing)|network bandwidth]] in order to record video—instead the network is only used to play back audio or video from the edge at some review station. When the network includes a WAN or, worse still, the Internet, by definition Recording at the Edge becomes the only way to ensure high quality recordings.

==Reliability==
Recording at the edge is more reliable because recording is independent of the network's health and degree of congestion. Even if the network grinds to a halt recording continues unaffected. However, you have to be very cautious while only recording at the edge. SD cards in these cameras are  continuously filled with data, written over, and over-worked -They burn out very quickly, compared to a normal Hard Drive.

==Simple Deployment==
Recording at the Edge can be achieved by deploying PC-based DVRs at the edge, however with vulnerable [[operating system]]s these are more challenging to maintain than a simple purpose built embedded appliance. Embedded DVRs are better suited to this role, although conventional DVRs traditionally focus on recording, searching and playback than scalable live streaming over the network, which is a primary function of an IP-based CCTV architecture.

==Surveillance System Fault Tolerance==
One of the concerns about IP-based CCTV is the dependence on the network. In a network outage in a centralized storage model both live video and the ability to record is lost. With Recording at the edge this is less of an issue because network outage only impacts live video.

In a centralized approach, if the central recording station fails, all cameras cease to be recorded. With recording at the edge, if one edge recorder fails then only those cameras connected to that unit stop recording.

==Pre-alarm recording==
For added security centralized storage is frequently used to record alarm video for easy alarm verification and long-term secure storage. Pre-alarm recording is offered by introducing a buffer in the encoder so that the seconds or minutes of video before and after an alarm can be automatically transmitted to the centralized storage. Because of the huge edge storage capacities of some encoders, ranging from 256 MB to 800 GB, you can continuously record video at high frame rates and high resolutions, and still take advantage of pre-alarm recording. For instance, if you continuously transmit a 1 Mbit/s stream (30 IPS at 4 CIF) to a central recorder in the anticipation that an alarm event will occur, you will consume 1 Mbit/s of network bandwidth, or send about 11 Gigabytes of video data. If, however, you use recording at the edge, and use pre-alarm recording configured to 5 seconds pre- and 10 seconds post-alarm, then assuming 20 alarms per day you will transmit a much lower total of around 40 Megabytes of video. The same 11 GB will still be recorded locally but only 40 MB, or 0.4% of it, will touch the network.

In those instances where the pre-alarm video is not long enough, it is comforting to know that the original complete video is always available, recorded at the edge.

==Dual Streaming==
In situations where the network bandwidth is severely limited, recording at the edge is a savior for high quality recorded video but it does not solve the challenge of needing to view live video over a restricted network. Some encoders support dual streaming. This is a concept that enables the encoder to deliver two totally independent streams of video, separately configured for different frame rates and video resolutions. Typically for limited bandwidth networks one high quality stream is used for local recording, and a lower quality, which translates to a lower [[Bitrate|bit rate]], is used for viewing live. Conversely for high bandwidth networks, the same stream will be used to record locally and centrally, and Automatic Network Replenishment is used to fill any gaps in the centralized recording dues to network interruptions.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://resource.boschsecurity.com/documents/Application_note_enUS_1575912459.pdf Bosch: Recording at the Edge Solution Brief]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economies of Scale==
A major justification for centralized storage is that we can use enormous RAID disk arrays, reducing the cost per terabyte. These cost savings must be balanced against the advantages above. The [[ideal solution]] is to seamlessly combine both approaches—when the network bandwidth is available and reliable then use it, but when it is severely limited or intermittent, then use recording at the edge.

==System Management==
Another significant benefit of centralized systems is the relative simplicity of [[system management]], because everything is [[Colocation (business)|co-located]] in one room or [[data center]] rather than dispersed across hundreds or thousands of miles. For recording at the edge to be a pragmatic solution it is critical to include centralized health monitoring and associated system management utilities. These include SNMP compatibility to [[network management system]]s such as Tivoli and HP Open View, and the ability to reconfigure and upgrade [[multiple unit]]s simultaneously.

==Digital video recorders in recording at the edge==
Analog-to-DVR systems do not offer edge recording.  This is because the analog cameras must first record to a central DVR; the video is then compressed into a digital format, and then stored typically on a [[Hard disk|hard drive]] inside the unit.  All of this must be done before it can record to SD or attached hard drive.

IP Camera systems on the other hand do not require analog to digital conversion so can record digital video directly to SD cards inside the camera, or to attached hard drive.

The '''Rivonia Trial''' took place in [[South Africa]] between 9 October 1963 and 12 June 1964. The Rivonia Trial led to the imprisonment of [[Nelson Mandela]] and the others among the accused who were convicted of sabotage and sentenced to life at the [[Palace of Justice, Pretoria]].&lt;ref name="university of missouri kansas city"&gt;{{cite web|author=Linder, Douglas O.|date=2010|title=The Nelson Mandela(Rivonia) Trial: An Account|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City|url=https://law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mandela/accused11.html|accessdate=2 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720163051/https://law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mandela/accused11.html|archivedate=20 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/rivonia-trial-1963-1964|title=Rivonia Trial 1963 -1964|date=31 March 2011|publisher=|access-date=2018-07-30|website= SA History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The Rivonia Trial was named after [[Rivonia]], the suburb of [[Johannesburg]] where leaders had been arrested (and documents discovered) at [[Liliesleaf Farm]], privately owned by [[Arthur Goldreich]],  on 11 July 1963. The farm had been used as a hideout by various people and groups including the [[African National Congress]]. Among others, [[Nelson Mandela]] had moved onto the farm in October 1961 and evaded security police while masquerading as a gardener and cook called David Motsamayi (meaning "David the walker").

== The defendants ==
Arrested were:
* [[Lionel Bernstein]], architect and member of the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP)
* [[Denis Goldberg]], a [[Cape Town]] engineer and leader of the [[South African Congress of Democrats|Congress of Democrats]]
* [[Arthur Goldreich]]
* [[Bob Hepple]]
* [[James Kantor]], brother-in-law of Harold Wolpe
* [[Ahmed Kathrada]]
* [[Nelson Mandela]]
* [[Govan Mbeki]]
* [[Raymond Mhlaba]]
* [[Andrew Mlangeni]]
* [[Elias Motsoaledi]], [[trade union]] and ANC member
* [[Walter Sisulu]]
* [[Harold Wolpe]], prominent attorney and activist

Goldberg, Bernstein, Wolpe, Kantor and Goldreich were [[History of the Jews in South Africa|Jewish South Africans]]; Hepple was an [[British diaspora in Africa|Englishman]]; Kathrada an [[Asian South African|Indian Muslim]]; Mandela, Mbeki and Mhlaba were [[Xhosa people]]; Motsoaledi and Mlangeni were [[Pedi people]] and Sisulu was [[Coloured]] (he had an English father and an [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] mother).{{sfn| Beresford |2003}}

The leaders who were prosecuted in the Rivonia Trial also included [[Nelson Mandela]], who was already in Johannesburg's Fort prison serving a five-year sentence for inciting workers to strike and leaving the country illegally.  Most of the Rivonia defendants were to be convicted, and in turn sentenced to life imprisonment.

The government took advantage of legal provisions allowing for accused persons to be held for 90 days without trial, and the defendants were held incommunicado. Withstanding beatings and torture, Goldreich and Wolpe escaped from jail on 11 August.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Their escape infuriated the prosecutors and police who considered Goldreich to be "the arch-conspirator".

The chief prosecutor was Dr. [[Percy Yutar]], deputy attorney-general of the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]].

The presiding judge was Dr. [[Quartus de Wet]], judge-president of the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]].

== Defence&lt;!-- South Africa uses 'defence' spelling; please do not change to 'defense' --&gt; lawyers ==

[[Nat Levy]] was attorney of record in Pretoria for Mandela and the other accused, with the exception of Kantor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa-people.com/2011/05/27/james-kantor-rivonia-trial-george-bizos/ "Jimmy, the Rivonia Trial…and George Bizos’ lamb-on-the-spit"], ''SA People'', 27 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Bernstein]] (wife of Rusty Bernstein) approached Joffe, after being rebuffed by other lawyers who claimed to be too busy or afraid to act for her husband. Joffe was subsequently also approached by [[Albertina Sisulu]] (wife of Walter Sisulu), Annie Goldberg (mother of Dennis Goldberg) and [[Winnie Mandela]] (wife of Nelson Mandela). Joffe agreed to act as attorney for all of the accused except Kantor, who would require separate counsel, and Bob Hepple.{{sfn|Joffe|2013|pp=12-13}}{{sfn|Broun|2012|p=15}}

Joffe initially secured the services of advocates Arthur Chaskalson and George Bizos, then persuaded [[Bram Fischer]] to act as lead counsel. Vernon Berrangé was also later recruited to join the team of advocates.{{sfn|Broun|2012|p=18}} The defence line-up for the majority of the accused was:

* [[Vernon Berrangé]] (advocate)
* [[George Bizos]] (advocate)
* [[Arthur Chaskalson]] (advocate)
* [[Bram Fischer]] (advocate, lead counsel)
* [[Harold Hanson]] (advocate)
* [[Joel Joffe]] (attorney)

The accused all agreed that Kantor's defence could share nothing in common with the rest of the accused. He thus arranged a separate defence team.{{sfn|Joffe|2013|p=29}} While Harold Hanson primarily represented Kantor, he was also invited to deliver the plea for mitigation for the other 9 accused.{{sfn|Broun|2012|pp=122-3}} The defence line-up for Kantor was

* [[John Coaker]] (advocate)
* [[Harold Hanson]] (advocate)
* [[George Lowen]] (advocate)
* [[H. C. Nicholas]] (advocate)
* [[Harry Schwarz]] (advocate)

== Charges ==

Charges were:

* recruiting persons for training in the preparation and use of explosives and in guerrilla warfare for the purpose of violent revolution and committing acts of sabotage
* conspiring to commit the aforementioned acts and to aid foreign military units when they invaded the Republic,
* acting in these ways to further the objects of communism
* soliciting and receiving money for these purposes from sympathizers in [[Algeria]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Tunisia]], and elsewhere.

"Production requirements" for munitions for a six-month period were sufficient, the prosecutor [[Percy Yutar]] said in his opening address, to blow up a city the size of [[Johannesburg]].{{sfn|Frankel|2011|p=258}}

Kantor was discharged at the end of the prosecution's case.

The trial was condemned by the [[United Nations Security Council]] and nations around the world, leading to [[international sanctions]] against the South African government in some cases.

== Escapes ==

* [[Arthur Goldreich]] and [[Harold Wolpe]] escaped from The Fort prison in Johannesburg while on remand after bribing a prison guard. After hiding in various safe houses for two months they escaped to [[Swaziland]] dressed as priests with the aid of [[Manni Brown]] who posed as a tour operator as a cover to deliver weapons to the ANC. From Swaziland, [[Vernon Berrangé]] was to charter a plane to take them on to [[Lobatse]], a small town in south-eastern [[Botswana]].{{sfn|Sisulu|2011|p=202}}
* Wolpe's escape saw his brother-in-law [[James Kantor]], who had been serving as a member of the defence team, arrested and charged with the same crimes as Mandela and his co-accused. [[Harry Schwarz]], a close friend and a well-known politician, acted as his defence. After being dealt with aggressively by the prosecutor [[Percy Yutar]], who sought to portray him as a vital cog of MK, Kantor was discharged by Judge [[Quartus de Wet]], who ruled that he had no case to answer.  Following his release, Kantor fled the country.  He was to die of a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1975.

{{Nelson Mandela series}}

== Mandela's speech ==
{{main|I Am Prepared to Die}}

At the beginning of the defence's proceedings, Nelson Mandela gave a three-hour speech from the defendant's dock, in which he explained and defended the ANC's key political positions.  He justified the movement's decision, in view of the increasing restrictions on permitted political activity on the part of non-White Africans, to go beyond its earlier use of constitutional methods and Gandhian non-violent opposition to the state, embracing a campaign of sabotage against property (designed to minimize risks of injury and death), while also starting to train a military wing for possible future use. He also discussed in some detail the relationship between the ANC and the SACP, explaining that, while the two shared a commitment to action against the [[apartheid]] system, he was wedded to a model of constitutional democracy for South Africa (he singled out the British political model for particular praise), and also supported a market economy rather than a communist economic model.  The speech is considered one of the founding moments of South African democracy.{{sfn|Clarkson|2013|p=85}}{{sfn|Davis &amp; Le Roux|2009|pp=48-50}}

Mandela's closing words have been much-quoted.  They were reportedly spoken looking the judge full in the eyes. His statement that he was prepared to die for the cause was strongly resisted by his lawyers, who feared it might itself provoke a death sentence.  In a concession to their concerns, Mandela inserted the words "if it needs be". Nelson Mandela, speaking in the dock of the court on 20 April 1964, said:{{sfn|Mandela|1979|p=}}

{{cquote|During my lifetime I have dedicated my life to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal for which I hope to live for and to see realised. But, my Lord, if it needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.}}

== Results ==

Although the prosecution did not formally request the [[death penalty]], close observers of the trial considered such a sentence to be implicit in the prosecutor's presentation of his case.{{sfn|Frankel|2011|p=258}}  Opposition to the death penalty included both public campaigns internationally and the defence's arguments within the courtroom.  Harold Hanson was called upon to argue in mitigation. He compared the African struggle for rights to the earlier Afrikaans struggle, citing precedents for temperate sentencing, even in cases of treason. Eight defendants were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]; [[Lionel Bernstein]] was acquitted. Unsubstantiated evidence suggests that Hanson, in a private hearing with de Wet, persuaded him to commute the death sentence for high treason to life imprisonment.

: There was no surprise in the fact that Mandela, Sisulu, Mbeki, Motsoaledi, Mlangeni, and Goldberg were found guilty on all four counts. The defence had hoped that Mhlaba, Kathrada, and Bernstein might escape conviction because of the skimpiness of evidence that they were parties to the conspiracy, although undoubtedly they could be prosecuted on other charges. But Mhlaba too was found guilty on all counts, and Kathrada, on one charge of conspiracy. Bernstein, however, was found not guilty. He was rearrested, released on bail, and placed under house arrest. Later he fled the country.

Denis Goldberg went to [[Pretoria Central Prison]] instead of [[Robben Island]] (at that time the only security wing for white political prisoners in South Africa), where he served 22 years.

Nelson Mandela spent 27 years and eight months in prison as a result of the Rivonia trial (18 years of which were spent on Robben Island). He was released on 11 February 1990 by order of President [[F. W. de Klerk]].

== Restoration of the Rivonia Trial sound archive ==
The Rivonia Trial was  recorded on [[Dictabelt]]s, a now obsolete audio recording format. Nearly 250 hours of the trial proceedings were recorded on 591 Dictabelts, kept by the [[National Archives and Records Service of South Africa|National Archives and Records Service of South Africa (NARSSA)]]. In 2001 seven of the Dictabelts were digitised by the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.bl.uk/sound-and-vision/2013/12/rescuing-the-rivonia-trial-recordings.html|title=Rescuing the Rivonia Trial recordings - Sound and vision blog|website=blogs.bl.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included 'I am prepared to die' Nelson Mandela's statement from the dock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atom.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/za-nmcom-mr-s-10|title=I am prepared to die : Nelson Mandela's statement from the dock at the opening of the defence case in the Rivonia Trial - NMF Archive|website=atom.nelsonmandela.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 documents relating to the Criminal Court Case No. 253/1963 (State Versus N Mandela and Others) were recommended for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-2/criminal-court-case-no-2531963-state-versus-n-mandela-and-others/|title=Criminal Court Case No. 253/1963 (State Versus N Mandela and Others) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 NARSSA approached the French Institute of South Africa (IFAS) and the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|French National Audiovisual Institute (INA)]] to start a process of digitisation and restoration of the rest of the Rivonia Trial sound archive. French engineer, historian and inventor, [[:da:Henri Chamoux|Henri Chamoux,]] took a little over 15 months to edit and digitize 230 hours of recording&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sowetolifemag.co.za/rivonia-trial-audio-archive-digitized/|title=Rivonia Trial audio archive digitized » Soweto Life Magazine|website=sowetolifemag.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; using his own invention the [[Archéophone|Archeophone]].

The digitised recordings were officially returned to South Africa, in 2018, as part of Nelson Mandela's Centenary, a one-day international colloquium "[http://www.ifas.org.za/research/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-Rivionia-programme-WEB2.pdf Listening to the Rivonia Trial : Courts, Archives and Liberation Movements]" was organised to commemorate, discussing issues relating to the act of collecting, mapping, digitising and restoring archives and raising ethical questions that, in turn, become historical questions.

A '''sacrificial lamb''' is a [[metaphor]]ical reference to a person or animal [[sacrifice]]d for the common good. The term is derived from the traditions of [[Abrahamic religion]] where a [[domestic sheep|lamb]] is a highly valued possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwQn6zIbCHwC|title=A Dialogue on Christianity|last=Hoerner|first=Ernest Milner; Frank|date=2010-09-03|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781450249256|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
{{main|Paper candidate}}
In [[politics]], a sacrificial lamb candidate is a candidate chosen to contest an [[election]] despite the fact that he or she has little chance of victory. The [[political party]] thus appoints the person as a sort of "sacrifice" to the stronger opponent.

In some cases, fielding a sacrificial lamb candidate can serve as an opportunity for the party to be more creative in choosing a candidate than would normally be considered acceptable in a closely contested race. [[Alan Keyes]] and [[Geraldine A. Ferraro]] are examples in American politics.  In [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] was considered a sacrificial lamb candidate for [[President of the United States|president]] against [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. In [[United States Senate election in New York, 2004|2004]], [[Howard Mills]] was considered a sacrificial lamb candidate for the [[U.S. Senate]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] against [[Chuck Schumer]].

==In the arts==
In [[film|cinema]] and [[literature]], the term sacrificial lamb refers to a [[character (arts)|supporting character]] whose sole dramatic purpose is to die, thus galvanizing the protagonist to action and simultaneously demonstrating how evil the [[villain]] is. Very often, the sacrificial lamb is a family member, partner, or "old buddy" of the protagonist, with whom he or she has an assumed intimacy, thus requiring no real character development. The term is almost always used critically, with the implication that the character was used transparently as a plot device.

An example of this in early literature is [[Macaria]] in ''[[Heracleidae (play)|Heracleidae]]'' by [[Euripides]]. A more modern example is [[Anthony Edwards]]' character, "Goose", in ''[[Top Gun]]'' as well as ''[[Phil Coulson]]'' in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.

==In husbandry==

When escorting cattle across a river suspected of having piranhas, farmers will sometimes sacrifice a sick or injured cow downstream before letting the herd enter the water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/worst_case_scenarios/1289301.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010232130/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/worst_case_scenarios/1289301.html |date=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|"'''The Peace!'''"|ザ☆ピ〜ス！|Za Pīsu!}} is the twelfth single of [[J-pop]] idol group [[Morning Musume]] and was released July 25, 2001. It sold a total of 682,320 copies and reached number one on the [[Oricon Charts]]. This song is also a personal favorite of ex-[[Morning Musume]] member, [[Rika Ishikawa]], as the monologue spoken by her towards the end of the song became one of her favorite moments of being in [[Morning Musume]].

The single version (later preserved on the ''[[Best! Morning Musume 2]]'' anthology) contains a fade-out, suggesting to the listener that the song's multiple [[false ending]]s continued infinitely. The version heard on the album ''[[4th Ikimashoi!]]'' is billed as the "Complete Version" and does not fade out, instead coming to a stop several seconds beyond the single version's fadeout.

[[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] '''Thomas Moody''' (1779–1849), {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|ADC|JP|}}, [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Knight of the Order of Military Merit of France]], was a British [[Colonial Office|Aide-de-camp to the Colonial Office]], [[Royal Engineer]], and merchant. He served as the Commander of the [[Royal Engineers]] in the [[West Indies]], as the Director of several trading companies in the [[City of London]], and as an Advisor to the [[East India Company]].

Moody was [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary Commissioner]] into the conditions of African slaves in the [[West Indies]], as which he engaged in a feud with [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]]. Moody's ultimate conclusion was that the indentured [[Africans]] in the West Indies should be taken back to West Africa.

In 1828, Moody and his friend [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]] offered to [[Australia|colonise Australia]] using their own capital, but were prohibited from doing so by the British Government.

He was the father of [[Richard Clement Moody|Major-General Richard Clement Moody]], the founder of [[British Columbia]] and first British [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]], and [[Hampden Clement Blamire Moody|Colonel Hampden Clement Blamire Moody CB, the Commander of the Royal Engineers in China]], amongst others.

==Family and early life==
Thomas was born into a family with an extensive history of military service to the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He was the third son of Thomas Moody (1732–1796)&lt;ref name="royalengineers.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalengineers.ca/Moody.html|title=The Royal Engineers: Colonel Richard Clement Moody|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Blakey Smith, ed., 'The Journal of Arthur Thomas Bushby, 1858–1859,' British Columbia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalengineers.ca/SapperJune1958.html|title=The Sapper Vol. 5 No. 1 June 1958|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Blamire (1740–1806),&lt;ref name="longtown19.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longtown19.co.uk/some_longtown_families.84.html|title=The Moody Family, Some Longtown Families|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a member of the Blamire family of [[Cumberland]] and a cousin of [[William Blamire|William Blamire MP, High Sheriff of Cumberland]], and a cousin of the poet [[Susanna Blamire]].&lt;ref name="longtown19.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; He was born in [[Longtown, Cumbria]].&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; His eldest brother, Charles, was a merchant in the [[West Indies]], and his other brother, George, was a surgeon.

===Character and society===
In character, Moody was obsessed with social hierarchy, discipline, and surveillance:&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; with what he termed 'the bonds of respect and subordination'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Moody was a [[Freemason]] and was described by [[Humphrey Fleming Senhouse|Sir Humphrey Fleming Senhouse]] as 'an Officer of high character and reputation'.&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt;
Moody was incorporated in diverse factions of the London establishment.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Inside the Colonial Office, Moody had 'all its archives open to him'.&lt;ref name="Pardue"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pardue|first=Jeffrey David|title=Agent of Imperial Change: James Macqueen and the British Empire, 1778-1870|year=1996|publisher=University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[City of London]], Moody was an Advisor to the [[East India Company]]; a Director of the Crown Life Assurance Company, of [[Blackfriars, London|33 Bridge Street, Blackfriars]];&lt;ref name="Kalendar"/&gt; and a Director of the [[New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company]], of 5 Coptball Court, London.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=19706|page=269|date=12 February 1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was a member of the [[Political Economy Club]], at which he disputed with both [[James Mill]] and [[John Ramsay McCulloch]], and at which he admired the philosophy of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]].&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody’s other friends included [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]], with whom he had an extensive private correspondence,&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; and after
whom he named one of his sons;&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; [[Shute Barrington|Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham]], after whom he named another of his sons;&lt;ref name="Shute Barrington correspondence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence with Major Moody, of Barrington, Shute (1734 - 1826), Bishop of Durham|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/N13994364}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Leith (British Army officer)|Sir James Leith]], after whom he named another of his sons;&lt;ref name="DFB James Leith Moody"/&gt; [[Humphrey Fleming Senhouse|Sir Humphrey Fleming Senhouse]];&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]];&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; [[James Macqueen]];&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; [[James Mangles (Royal Navy officer)|James Mangles]];&lt;ref name="Ambition's Fire"/&gt; [[Thomas Hyde Villiers]];&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; and [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]].&lt;ref name="Wakefield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stirling letter"/&gt;

Moody was a [[polymath]] who read in several languages, and in diverse subjects, including philosophy, climatology, sociology, economics, history, and physics.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; His reading included the works of [[Montesquieu]]; [[William Petty]]; [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] (whom he knew personally, and of whom he was a fervent admirer);&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;[[Johannes van den Bosch]]; and those of the [[Africans]] [[Toussaint Louverture]] and [[Henri Christophe]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He was also influenced by the [[Africa]]n [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], the [[President of Haiti]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; He disputed the economic philosophy of [[James Mill]], that of [[John Ramsay McCulloch]], and that of [[Adam Smith]], and admired the philosophy of [[Jean-Baptiste Say]].&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;
Moody was also extensively read in abolitionist literature.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

==West Indies==
===Aide-de-camp (1797 - 1821)===
Moody arrived in Barbados in 1797,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; to serve as mathematics master,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rupprecht|first1=Anita|last2= |first2= |date=September 2012|title='When he gets among his countrymen,they tell him that he is free': Slave Trade Abolition, Indentured Africans and a Royal Commission|journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition|volume=33 |issue=3 |pages= 435–455|doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; writing master,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and Assistant Headmaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codrington.org/site/index.php/important-dates|title=Codrington College, Barbados: Important Dates}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Codrington College]], at which he served until 1805.&lt;ref name="Parry"&gt;{{cite book|title=Codrington College in the Island of Barbados|author=Thomas Parry, Bishop of Barbados|publisher=Society for the Propagation of the Gospel|year=1847|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these positions, Moody demonstrated such an aptitude for mathematics that [[Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth|Lord Seaforth]], the [[List of Governors of Barbados|British General in Barbados]], granted Moody his patronage,&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and procured for Moody a direct commission in the [[Royal Engineers]],&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Barbados|author=Schomburgk, Sir Robert H.|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Moody entered as a Lieutenant on 1 July 1806.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Military Calendar"/&gt; Moody's first duty was to administer the Office of Ordinance in [[Demerara]],&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; and he proceeded, subsequently, to distinguish himself in the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; Moody was promoted to Second Captain on 1 May 1811; to Captain on 20 December 1814; and to Brevet Major on 23 May 1816.&lt;ref name="Royal Military Calendar"/&gt; [[File:LordSeaforthByThomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|upright|Moody was recruited into the [[Royal Engineers]] by [[Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth|Lord Seaforth]]]]

Moody served as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[James Leith (British Army officer)|Sir James Leith]],&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leith Memoirs"&gt;{{cite book|title=Appendix to Memoirs of the Late Lieutenant-General Sir James Leith GCB|author=Leith Hay, Sir Andrew|publisher=William Stockdale|year=1818|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Governor of Barbados]] from May 1815 to October 1816,&lt;ref name="Leith Memoirs"/&gt; and Superintendent of the Crown Plantations in [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody named his son [[James Leith Moody]] after Leith, of whom he was a fervent admirer.&lt;ref name="DFB James Leith Moody"/&gt; During his service as aide-de-camp to Leith, Thomas Moody was involved in the successful [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1815)]], for which he was subsequently knighted, in 1820, by [[Louis XVIII]], in the [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Order of Military Merit]].&lt;ref name="Bulletins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart's Annual Army List, 1844"/&gt; Moody also served as aide-de-camp to both the President of Tortola; and to [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere]], who was Governor of Barbados from 1817 to 1820, after whom Moody named one of his sons.&lt;ref name="Royal Military Calendar"&gt;{{cite book | last =| first = | title = The Royal Military Calendar or Army Service and Commission Book, Third Edition, Vol. V, 1820 | page=333|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Slave Trade.

In 1816, Moody was responsible for the transfer of groups of rescued Africans to the Crown estates in [[Guadeloupe]]. Moody believed that rescued Africans made an 'extremely useful' contribution to the British Empire.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; His competent performance in this appointment may have contributed to his subsequent appointment as a Parliamentary Commissioner on Slavery.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

===Estates===
Moody owned plantations in Barbados by 1816, but he supported the Barbados Slave Rebellions of September and October 1816, which he witnessed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fliphtml5.com/ngat/kjqo|title=Letter of Thomas Moody to H. Goulburn, 14 October 1816, CO. 28/85, as noted in 'The Slave-Drivers' War: Bussa and the 1816 Barbados Slave Rebellion', Hilary McC Beckles, p.20|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which he described as an attempt 'by the mass of the slaves... to gain independence'.&lt;ref name="Empowering Impulse"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Empowering Impulse:The Nationalist Tradition of Barbados|author=Howe, Glenford D.; Marshall, Don.D.|publisher=Canoe Press|year=2001|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas owned extensive plantations and estates in the Caribbean, including in [[Barbados]],&lt;ref name="Empowering Impulse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; [[Guiana]], [[Demerara]], [[Berbice]], and [[Tortola]]. He was a claimant on insolvent estates in Berbice in 1827 (''[[The Times]]'', 4 April 1827, p.&amp;nbsp;4)&lt;ref name="Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/6650|title=Legacies of British Slave-Ownership: Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Moody: Profile and Legacies Summary|publisher=University College London|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the compensation for one enslaved person in British Guiana.&lt;ref name="Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL" /&gt;

===French knighthood (1820)===
In 1820, Moody was knighted by [[Louis XVIII]] in the [[Order of Military Merit (France)|Order of Military Merit]] for defending the French colony of [[Guadeloupe]]. He was permitted by [[George IV]] to wear the Cross of the Order whilst in Britain, but not to use the title 'Sir'.&lt;ref name="Bulletins"&gt;{{cite book | last =| first = | title = Bulletins and Other State Intelligence Compiled and Arranged from the Official Documents published in the London Gazette, 1820| page=220 |publisher=R.

===The Parliamentary Commission on Slavery (1821 - 1828)===
In 1821, [[William Wilberforce]] proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] the creation a Commission to investigate the condition of slaves in the West Indies due to omnipresent reports that the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which had made the trade of slaves illegal, was being universally violated by wealthy plantation owners, who were redesignating their slaves as 'apprentices' and continuing to trade.&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"&gt;{{cite book |title = Slave Trade.

Pty. Ltd., 2001|ISBN=0646417215}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were to be two commissioners who were to report to [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]]. Moody and John Dougan (1765-1826) volunteered for each of the commissionerships and were selected by Bathurst.&lt;ref Name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody was a friend of the President of Tortola, the island on which the commissioners were to commence their investigations.&lt;ref Name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Dougan was the son of an owner of sugar plantations on Demerara: Dougan stated, 'all my nearest relations and friends were either Planters or Owners of slaves'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan had lived on Tortola, where he worked as a merchant, privateer, Prize Agent for the Royal Navy, and Colonial administrator.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan was the uncle of Moody's wife,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Martha Clement,&lt;ref name= "Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL"/&gt; and the son of a slave-plantation owner.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Dougan was influenced by the zealous idealism of [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] agitators in England, such as the [[Quaker]] [[John Barton (Quaker)|John Barton]],&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Slave Trade.

(II)| publisher=House of Commons Parliamentary Papers, 1828}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by the Clapham Sect, with which he was associated.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody, in contradistinction, was influenced by [[Montesquieu]], [[William Petty]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Johannes van den Bosch]], and by the [[Africans]] [[Toussaint Louverture]], [[Henri Christophe]], and [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], the [[President of Haiti]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody was also extensively read in abolitionist literature,&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; and had noted that Stephen's recommendation, in 1802, of a period of indenture had provided the basis for both the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, and for the Orders in Council.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

Moody and Dougan arrived on Tortola in May 1822.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody objected to the interview process recommended by the Commission, in which masters and apprentices were supposed to be interviewed together, because he thought that it were 'calculated to excite complaints of the servant against the master'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Among the ex-slaverowners interviewed by Moody was Abraham Mendes Belisario, the Deputy Provost Marshal of Tortola, who possessed 17 African apprentices.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; As a consequence of the unreliability of the reports of apprentices that such masters provided, which were known as 'Characters' of apprentices, Moody insisted that such reports should not be heard, nor quoted in the official Commission report, but that he and Dougan, the Commissioners, should specify only their own opinions of the masters of the apprentices.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

The Commissioners recorded that many black African apprentices were employed by free black [[Africans]].&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; When ‘apprentices’ employed by H. C. Maclean, a prosperous merchant who served as Comptroller of the Customs on Tortola, complained to the Commission, Macclean had them beaten. Moody refused to criticise Macclean: Dougan objected to Moody's refusal, but received no sympathy amongst the Colonial administration of the islands. This event provoked a spiteful feud between Dougan and Moody: Dougan complained about the 'state of Irritation and Disunion of the Commission'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan attempted to reconcile himself with Moody, but Moody refused to forgive him, and, as a consequence, Dougan was compelled to resign from the Commission,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; in June 1822, to return to England, and to submit his report to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in private.&lt;ref name="Kinsman" /&gt; In this report, dated 20 December 1823, Dougan contends that "free labour in the West Indies is preferable to compulsory labour".&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt; On his resignation, Dougan stated that '[the] repeated attacks, the State of Irritation of Major Moody's Mind, and all hopes of Conciliation [were] ended': however, their 'protracted and unpleasant dispute' continued even after the death of Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; in 1826, subsequent to which his efforts for reform were continued by his daughter, Mary,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; between whom and Moody the feud continued.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

In 1824, Moody's friend [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]], forwarded one of Moody's papers to [[George Canning]], then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Subsequently, in 1825, Moody returned to London and presented to the House of Commons an exposition of the reasons for his refusal to sign the report prepared by Dougan in Tortola, in addition to the official Commission report,&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"/&gt; which he had completed on his own, without Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; and which he submitted without the consent of Dougan,&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; that is dated 2 March 1825,&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"/&gt; and consists of over 200 pages.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's official Commission report contends that "without some species of coercion African labour would be worthless".&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Commission Report of Thomas Moody"&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | title =Parliamentary Abstracts, Containing the Substance of all Important Papers laid before the two Houses of Parliament during the Session of 1825| page=239|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green, 1826|ISBN=0646417215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whig [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] described Moody's report as 'in substance, a defence of West Indian slavery', but Moody described his theories as a 'Philosophy of Labour',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Macaulay | first =Thomas Babington | title =Social and Industrial Capacities of the Negroes (Edinburgh Review, March 1827), collected in Critical, Historical and Miscellaneous Essays, Volume 6 (1860),| pages=361–404|publisher=New York, Sheldon and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; and himself as a 'practical philanthropist'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Lord Macaulay's description is inaccurate because, although Moody desired the employment of Africans, Moody did not desire their employment under conditions of enslavement:&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; indeed, Moody had supported the Barbados Slave Rebellions of September and October 1816, despite owning plantations in Barbados.&lt;ref name="Empowering Impulse"/&gt; 
Moody was influenced by the theory of the climatological determination of the human constitution that was advocated by [[Montesquieu]], and contended that it were a 'physical fact' that only blacks possessed the ability to perform agricultural labour in the 'torrid zone'.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody was also extensively read in abolitionist literature.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

Moody's ultimate conclusion was that the indentured [[Africans]] in the West Indies should be taken back to West Africa.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

Moody submitted a second report, also of over 200 pages, in 1826.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's philosophy also analysed [[Netherlands|Dutch]] agricultural colonies, the [[Bengal]] peasantry, slavery in [[India]], prostitution in [[Sierra Leone]], slavery in the [[United States]], and the American Colonization Society for African-American settlement in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt;

Moody's philosophy, which incorporated innumerable scholarly references,&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; won the advocacy of the director of the Commission, [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]], and of his Under-Secretary, [[Robert Wilmot-Horton|Sir Robert Wilmot Horton]],&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; with whom Moody had an extensive private correspondence;&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; of the [[Tories]]; and of the advocates of Britain's
colonial empire: Parliament declared Moody's ‘great experience in the control of labour, both slave and free, both African and European, in garrison, and in the field’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Slave Trade.

M. R. | title = Ambitions Fire: Agricultural Colonization of Pre-Convict Western Australia | page=38 |ISBN = 0855641967}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Moody's report provoked the Whigs, evangelicals, and abolitionists to ire.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; [[Zachary Macaulay]] and other abolitionists condemned Moody's philosophy in the [[Anti-Slavery Reporter]],&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL"/&gt; and Lord Macaulay cited Moody's reports in an anti-slavery essay that was published in the [[Edinburgh Review]] in
in 1827.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Moody's contentions and his style of expression were condemned by Lord Macaulay,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], ''Social and Industrial Capacities of the Negroes'' ([[Edinburgh]] Review, March 1827), collected in ''Critical, Historical and Miscellaneous Essays, Volume 6'' (1860), pp.361–404.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a series of anonymous letters to the [[Morning Chronicle]] newspaper, all which provoked extensive defensive refutations from Moody.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Throughout the period in which London political society responded to his reports, Moody maintained a continuous dialogue with the Colonial Office, in which he vigorously refuted the criticisms of his reports, and repudiated the doctrines of his critics in private correspondences and in the newspapers.&lt;ref name="Emancipation"/&gt; Moody's friends Sir Robert Wilmot Horton and [[Thomas Hyde Villiers|Thomas Hyde Villiers MP]] also wrote articles - under the pseudonym 'Vindex', which Moody had also used - to the Star newspaper, in which they refuted the objections that others had made to Moody's philosophy and defended Moody.&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; Moody proceeded to testify before the Privy Council, on the matter, in 1828.&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt; Moody's report influenced Lord Bathurst, [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Sir Henry Taylor]], and [[James Stephen (civil servant)|James Stephen]].&lt;ref name="Lamont"/&gt;

Dougan was infuriated when he discovered that Moody had submitted the report without his consent, and began to compose a response, but he died, destitute,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; in September 1826, before he had completed his response.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Dougan's response was completed after his death by his daughter, Mary,&lt;ref name="Kinsman"/&gt; but it was intercepted by Moody, who annotated it extensively with refutations, before it reached Bathurst.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; A feud between Moody and Mary Dougan continued after the death of John Dougan.&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt;

For their efforts, Dougan and Moody were each made a [[Justice of the Peace]].&lt;ref name="Papers Relating to Slaves in the Colonies"/&gt;

===Moody's offer to colonise Australia (1828)===
When the British Government abandoned plans to implement the plans of [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Stirling]] to settle the [[Swan River Colony]], Stirling and Moody, in August 1828, offered form an association of private capitalists that would settle Australia, using their own capital, observing the 'principles' that had been observed by [[William Penn]] in the settlement of [[Pennsylvania]], but this proposal was rejected by the government.&lt;ref name="Wakefield"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Colonization of Australia (1829–42): The Wakefield Experiment in Empire Building| last = Mills | first = Richard Charles |chapter= III, p. 45 | publisher= Sidgwick and Jackson, 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Stirling letter"&gt;{{citation | chapter = Letter by Captain Stirling and Major Moody to Under Secretary Hay. 21st August, 1828, in Official Papers relating to the Settlement at Swan River, West Australia, December 1826 – January 1830 | title= [[Historical Records of Australia]] | series= Series III | volume= Volume VI |pages= 551–640}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Indian Service, 1828 -  1837===
Moody’s residential office at the Colonial Office was abolished in 1828.&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; His departure from this office was a consequence of his 'unpopularity with the saints'.&lt;ref name="Pardue"/&gt; Moody returned to the West Indies in 1828, to perform special service in the Dutch Colonies for Sir Robert Wilmot Horton, which he completed in 1829.&lt;ref name="Lamont"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/30676/1/SP%20Lamont%20thesis%20-%20electronic%20version.pdf|title=Robert Wilmot Horton and Liberal Toryism|author=Lamont, Stephen Peter|publisher=University of Nottingham|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period in which he were in the West Indies, Moody rose from the rank of Major to that of [[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] in the Royal Engineers.&lt;ref name="royalengineers.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20660|supp=y|page=3993|date=10 November 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5715 Richard Clement Moody]" in ''[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] Online''(2002)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Moody served as Commander of the Royal Engineers in the [[West Indies]] from 1829 to 1837:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nautical Magazine and Naval Chronicle: a Journal of Papers on Subjects Connected with Maritime Affairs|volume= 1844|page= 773 | publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was made a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1830&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt; and had been promoted to Colonel by 1847.&lt;ref name="History of Barbados"/&gt;

==Later life (1837 - 1849)==
The British Government considered Moody to be a highly competent civil engineer and consulted him in regard of several important projects, such as the [[Caledonian Railway]], the West Cumberland Railway, and the  [[Furness Railway]], and the embankments at Morecambe Bay and at Duddon Sands. For his civil engineering, Moody received a DCL degree from the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Proceedings of the Caledonian, West Cumberland, and Furness Railway Meeting held at Whitehaven on 10 April 1838|publisher=J. Robinson, Lowthorpe Street, 1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government appointed Moody as the director of two major government manufactories, [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|one making gunpowder]] and the other making small arms, at [[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey]].&lt;ref name="Railway Meeting"/&gt;

Thomas was posted, by the Colonial Office, to [[Guernsey]] in 1846.&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"/&gt;

Thomas Moody's London residences were [[Bedford Square|7 Alfred Place, Bedford Square]], and [[Mayfair|23 Bolton Street, Mayfair]]. He died on 5 September 1849 at Berrywood House, near [[Southampton]].&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"/&gt; In 1852, an advertisement appeared in [[The Times]] (02/06/1852 p.&amp;nbsp;1.) for unclaimed stock of the value of £120 that had been the property of 'Lieutenant-Colonel [sic] Thomas Moody, of Waltham Abbey', and the dividends of which had been unclaimed since 1839.&lt;ref name="Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL" /&gt;

===Reputation at Colonial Office===
It is likely that the illustrious reputation, at the Colonial Office, that Thomas had acquired, contributed to the Office's decision to appoint his son, [[Richard Clement Moody]], to the position of [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Lieutenant-Governor of the Falkland Islands]] when Richard Clement Moody was only the unprecedentedly young age of 28 years.&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"/&gt; Thomas's reputation may also have contributed to the appointment of Richard Clement Moody as the first [[Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia]], by [[Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5715|title= Entry for Richard Clement Moody in Dictionary of Canadian Biography|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and issue==
On 1 January 1809, Thomas married Martha Clement (1764–1868), who was the daughter of Richard Clement (1754–1829), a Dutch landowner of Barbados,&lt;ref name="DFB Richard Clement Moody"&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry for Moody, Richard Clement, in Dictionary of Falklands Biography|url=https://www.falklandsbiographies.org/biographies/moody_richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the niece of John Dougan (1765-1826).&lt;ref name="Rupprecht"/&gt; Thomas's father in law, Richard Clement, after whom Thomas named his son [[Richard Clement Moody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legacies of British Slave Ownership: Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Moody: Imperial Legacy Details|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/imperial/view/1837776487}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the owner of the Black Bess (196 slaves) and Clement Castle (220 slaves) estates on St Peter's Island, which passed to Clement's sole remaining son, Hampden Clement, on his death.&lt;ref&gt;Will of Richard Clement of Barbados, PROB 11/1811/204, University College, London&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and Martha had 10 children, 8 of whom were living at the time of their father's death.&lt;ref name="Will of Major Thomas Moody, UCL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/6650|title=The Will of Major Thomas Moody, PROB 11/2101, Codicil of 09/01/1843; The Carlisle Patriot 22/09/1849, accessed via Legacies of British Slave-Ownership: Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Moody: Profile and Legacies Summary|publisher=University College London|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transnationality Index''' ('''TNI''') is a means of ranking [[multinational corporation]]s that is employed by economists and politicians.  It is calculated as the [[arithmetic mean]] of the following three [[ratio]]s (where "foreign" means outside of the corporation's home country):&lt;ref name=IB&gt;{{cite book|title=International Business|author=Stuart Wall and Bronwen Rees|pages=24|publisher=Pearson Education|date=2004|isbn=9780273685913}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ratio of foreign assets to total assets
* the ratio of foreign sales to total sales
* the ratio of foreign employment to total employment

The Transnationality Index was developed by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041214130037/http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite_dir/docs/wir98br_gray2_en.pdf] ''The International Trade Journal'' August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|format=PDF|title=What do Internationalization Indices Measure?|publisher=Centre for International Business Studies, [[London South Bank University]]|author=Grazia Ietto-Gillies and Tannis Seccombe-Hett|date=1998-10-08|url=http://www.lsbu.ac.uk./cibs/pdf/6-97.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multinational corporations are also ranked by the amount of foreign assets that they own.  However, the TNI ranking can differ markedly from this.  For example, as of 2000, [[General Electric]] was the second largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign assert ownership.  However, it ranked only 73rd by the TNI, with an index of only 40%.  Although the company had large investments outside of the United States, most of its sales, employment, and assets were within the U.S..  In contrast, [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] has a TNI of 68% and [[Vodafone]] has a TNI of 81%.  As of 2001, General Electric ranked 75th, with a TNI of 36.7%.   The 14 most transnational corporations originated in small countries (Switzerland, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada), whereas the largest multinational corporations in terms of foreign asset ownership all had low TNI scores.  [[General Motors]], the fourth largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign asset ownership only ranked 83rd (30.7%) on the TNI top 100.  [[IBM]] ranked 50th (53.7%), [[Volkswagen]] ranked 45th (55.7%), and [[Toyota]], the sixth largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign asset ownership, only ranked 82nd (30.9%) on the broader TNI scale.&lt;ref name=IB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dicken /&gt;

Peter Dicken, an honorary fellow of the School of Environment and Development at the [[University of Manchester]], argues that TNI data refute the assertions of hyperglobalism.  The data, he argues, prove false the claim that multinational corporations are "inexorably, and inevitably, abandoning their ties to their country of origin".  If that were the case, we would expect the largest multinational corporations to have the majority of their assets, sales, and employmnent outside of their countries of origin, and thus the majority of those corporations to have high TNIs.  In fact, in the UNCTAD TNI data for the top 100 multinational corporations for 2001, the mean TNI is 52.6%, 57 of the 100 have a TNI greater than 50%, and only a mere 16 have a TNI greater than 75%.  Thus, he concludes, measured TNI data provide little evidence for multinational corporations having the proportions of their assets, sales, and employees outside of their home countries that one would expect for truly global firms.&lt;ref name=Dicken&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Shift|author=Peter Dicken|pages=221–224|publisher=SAGE|date=2003|isbn=9780761971504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Honey bee in Toronto.jpg|thumb|Honey bee in Toronto]]
'''Urban beekeeping''' is the practice of keeping bee colonies in urban areas. It may also be referred to as '''hobby beekeeping''' or '''backyard beekeeping'''. Bees from city [[apiary|apiaries]] are said to be "healthier and more productive than their country cousins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4621184.stm | title=Bees reared in cities 'healthier' | publisher=BBC | work=bbc.co.uk | date=17 January 2006 | accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presence also provides cities with environmental and economic benefits.

Most cities in North America at one time prohibited the keeping of bees, but in recent years beekeepers have had success in overturning bee bans. Bees pollinate [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|a wide variety of plants]], and the honey they produce is often sold to local restaurants and in local shops.&lt;ref name="regs" /&gt;  Many urban areas now regulate beekeeping,&lt;ref name="regs" /&gt; and while registering beehives is often mandatory, a high proportion of urban beekeepers fail to inform the city.

The popularity of urban beekeeping was growing rapidly [[circa|c.]] 2012&lt;ref name=regs&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://digitalcommons.tourolaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1487&amp;context=scholarlyworks&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fq%3DHONEY%252C%2BIT%2527S%2BALL%2BTHE%2BBUZZ%253A%2BREGULATING%2BNEIGHBORHOOD%2BBEEHIVES.%26btnG%3D%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%252C5%26as_vis%3D1#search=%22HONEY%2C%20ITS%20ALL%20BUZZ%3A%20REGULATING%20NEIGHBORHOOD%20BEEHIVES.%22 | title=Honey, it's all the Buzz: Regulating Neighborhood Beehives | author=Salkin, PE | journal=Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review | year=2012 | volume=55 | issue=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps due to its inclusion in the [[local food movement]].&lt;ref name=london06&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/why-londons-beekeepers-are-a-growing-band-476750.html | title=Why London's beekeepers are a growing band | work=The Independent | date=4 May 2006 | accessdate=June 28, 2012 | author=Barnett, Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1999 and 2012, London saw a 220% increase in beekeepers.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;This statement is supported by multiple sources:

==Urban beekeeping cities==
Some cities are veritable hives of beekeeping activity while others offer plentiful green space but harbor few apiaries.

[[File:Bees.jpg|thumb|Bees producing honey in a hive.]]
=== Detroit ===
In 2016, Detroit natives: Timothy Paule and Nicole Lindsey founded [[Detroit Hives]], a 501C(3) Michigan non-profit organization who's mission is to help spread bee awareness, support the conservation of honey bees and educate communities, schools and businesses about bees and their importance to our environment. [[Detroit Hives]] was the first to practice honey bee conservation from empty vacant lots in Detroit. Their motto "Work Hard, Stay Bumble" resonates the embodiment of Detroit.

=== Chicago ===
In 2003, [[Richard M. Daley]], then [[Mayor of Chicago]], had two [[beehive]]s placed atop City Hall. [[Michael S. Thompson]] was put in charge of their care. Subsequently, the [[bee]] population in the city has grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Potempa|first1=Philip|title=The buzz on urban beekeeping: Chicago high-rises are home to hives flowing with honey|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/niche/shore/food-and-drink/the-buzz-on-urban-beekeeping-chicago-high-rises-are-home/article_77bc5184-53aa-55b6-93f8-f5d92b591c2f.html|website=Shore magazine|publisher=NWI Times|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a ban on beekeeping was defeated in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]]. The village may regulate backyard beekeeping in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellware|first1=Kim|title=Skokie Beekeeping Ban Defeated, Though Village May Look To Regulating Backyard Hives In Future|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/19/skokie-beekeeping-ban_n_3781743.html|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halifax===
Beekeepers in Halifax must register with the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://novascotia.ca/sns/paal/agric/paal020.asp | title=Beekeeper &amp; Apiary Registration | publisher=Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture | work=novascotia.ca | date=August 2014 | accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the downtown area of the city, it has been suggested that beekeeping should be limited to rooftops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.halifax.ca/boardscom/drc/documents/DowntownHalifaxPresentationtoDRC.pdf | title=Proposed Changes to Downtown Halifax Plan and LUB: Presentation to Design Review Committee | publisher=City of Halifax | quote=Beekeeping will only be permitted on rooftops. | date=11 June 2015 | accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Johannesburg ===
[[Johannesburg]] has over 6 million trees and on satellite pictures looks like a rain forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We're living in an urban forest|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=355:were-living-in-an-urban-forest&amp;Itemid=188|website=City Of Johannesburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This environment is highly beneficial for urban beekeepers, who often have higher honey yields per hive than other [[Highveld]] beekeepers.  In [[South Africa]], anyone who handles bees must be registered as a beekeeper with the [[Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (South Africa)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GN R858 15 November 2013 Control Measures Honeybees|url=http://www.brasa.co.za/GN-R858-15-November-2013-Control-Measures-Honeybees.pdf|website=Bee Removers Association of South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===London===
Beekeeping in London has become increasingly popular. The number of beekeepers rose 220% between 1999 and 2012&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; with other figures showing a 200% increase between 2008 and 2013.&lt;ref name=cbeec/&gt; As of 2012, an estimated 3,200 apiaries exist in London, and while registration is mandatory, 75% were thought to operate without license.&lt;ref name="london2012"/&gt; The density of hives in London is much greater than in other areas of the UK, and this has led to concerns that city greenspace may not provide sufficient forage to sustain burgeoning bee populations.&lt;ref name=cbeec&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/rise-in-urban-beekeeping-may-be-bad-for-bees-scientists-warn-1.1377626 | title=Rise in urban beekeeping may be bad for bees, scientists warn | publisher=CBC | work=cbc.ca | date=August 14, 2013 | accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government has aided the rise of keeping bees in cities by releasing a plastic beehive purpose-built for urban beekeeping. Called Beehaus, it is supported by [[quango]] [[Natural England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2009/050809.aspx | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111121191513/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2009/050809.aspx | dead-url=yes | archive-date=21 November 2011 | title=Bringing the buzz back to gardens and rooftops | publisher=Natural England | date=5 August 2009 | quote=A new, contemporary beehive for the urban beekeeper, launched... by Omlet with support from Natural England, will make it easy for anyone... to help bees find a home in urban gardens. | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations supporting best practices for urban beekeeping in London include The London Beekeeper's Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbka.org.uk/lbka.html | title=What we do | publisher=The London Beekeepers' Association | work=lbka.org.uk | accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds monthly meetings, provides mentoring to new beekeepers, and lends out beekeeping supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbka.org.uk/members.html | title=Members | publisher=The London Beekeepers' Association | accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, bees are kept at department store [[Fortnum &amp; Mason]],&lt;ref name=london2012/&gt; [[Lambeth Palace]],&lt;ref name="london06"/&gt; [[Buckingham Palace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2028696/A-unique-insight-Her-Majestys-favourite-honey--backyard.html | title=The real queen bees at Buck House: A unique insight into Her Majesty's favourite honey - made in her own backyard | publisher=Daily Mail | work=Mail Online | date=26 August 2011 | accessdate=7 April 2014 | author=Wilkes, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[London Stock Exchange]],&lt;ref name=london2012/&gt; the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]],&lt;ref name=london06/&gt; the [[Tate Modern]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/19585638 | title=Honey suffers after bad year for bees | publisher=BBC | work=bbc.co.uk | date=27 September 2012 | accessdate=7 April 2014 | author=Briggs, Hannah}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Royal Lancaster Hotel,&lt;ref name=london2012/&gt; etc. Hives once stood atop the [[Bank of England]] as well.&lt;ref name=london06/&gt;

=== Milwaukee ===
[[File:Urban-Beekeeping-with-Beepods.png|alt=Beepods Beekeeping System Rooftop Milwaukee Wisconsin CORE EL CENTRO|thumb|A Beepod Vented-Top-Bar Hive on the roof of a non-profit, CORE/El Centro, overlooks downtown Milwaukee and serves as an education location to teach new beekeepers.]]
In 2010, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, passed a beekeeping ordinance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://milwaukee.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=645187&amp;GUID=B91737F3-DE69-4521-B152-9D7D3B1066EE|title=City of Milwaukee - File #: 091282|last=Tajanko|first=Darius|website=milwaukee.legistar.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing individuals to practice beekeeping in the urban center of the city. Since the ordinance was passed, a variety of urban beekeepers have started taking part in Milwaukee's Community Pollinator Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.beepods.com/advocate/milwaukee-pollinator/|title=Milwaukee's Community Pollinator Initiative - Beepods|newspaper=Beepods|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montreal===
Montreal's beehives are regulated by a governmental agency called MAPAQ, [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Quebec)]]. This agency enforces a set of regulations surrounding the installation of a beehive in order to protect the health of colonies, but these rules are rarely restrictive enough to deter or discourage committed hobbyists.

The Westmount Library, a locus of learning and community, has a public honeybee hive on its roof featuring live inspections every two weeks during the summer months for kids, parents, and the elderly. [[Montreal Botanical Gardens]] hosts honeybees as a part of their summer expositions with introductory workshops and daily tour groups. 

As part of their 135th anniversary, [[Birks Group]] installed three honeybee hives on the roof of their downtown headquarters in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://notable.ca/nationwide/birks/Birks-Marketing-Exec-Eva-Hartling-Offers-Buzz-on-Bee-Inspired-Campaign/ | title=Birks Marketing Exec Eva Hartling Offers Buzz on Bee Inspired Campaign | publisher=Notable | work=notable.ca | date=June 5, 2014 &lt;!-- 6:00 am --&gt;  | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2014, the Accueil Bonneau homeless facility launched a pilot project introducing their itinerant community to the art of beekeeping as a means of re-engaging them in a fulfilling and meaningful hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itineraire.ca/2502-article-des-abeilles-a-l-accueil-bonneau-edition-du-mardi-15-juillet-2014.html|title=Actualité &amp; culture  Des abeilles à l'Accueil Bonneau - L'Itinéraire|work=L'Itinéraire|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the public beekeeping initiatives stem from companies offering beekeeping services that make it more accessible to urban dwellers, such as Alveole, Apiguru, or Miel Montreal. The move towards a comprehensive approach to producing local produce is part of why beekeeping is becoming increasingly popular in this metropolitan city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.themainmtl.com/2014/05/19/local-gets-alveole-brings-beekeeping-back-home | title=As Local As it Gets: Alvéole Brings Beekeeping Back Home | publisher=The Main | date=19 May 2014 | accessdate=15 August 2014 | author=Corroon, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
Until 2010, beekeeping was illegal in New York City, but this had little effect on the many New Yorkers who built and maintained hives. Prior to being recognized by the city, urban beekeeping had become an established hobby, and a support network of organizations, blogs, and supply stores was already in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/science/earth/15bees.html?_r=0 | title=Bees in the City?

===Toronto===
While urban beekeeping is touted as a new trend, hives have been kept discreetly in [[Toronto]] for many years. Several beekeepers kept around fifty hives each along the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] in the beginning of the 20th century, and there was a beekeeping co-op near the [[Don Valley Brick Works]] into the late 1950s. Mayor [[William Dennison (Canadian politician)|William Dennison]] kept nineteen colonies in his Jarvis Street backyard in the 70s.&lt;ref name="Toronto Swarms to Urban Beekeeping"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fane|first1=Kate|title=Toronto Swarms to Urban Beekeeping|url=http://torontoist.com/2015/04/toronto-swarms-to-urban-beekeeping/|website=Torontoist|publisher=Ink Truck Media|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, beekeeping equipment could be bought downtown’s Little Italy / Little Portugal area.

[[Circa|C.]] 2015, Toronto does not have a bylaw governing beekeeping, so the Ontario Bees Act applies. The Act does not address urban beekeeping but contains a 30-meter set back requirement for property lines, and a 10-meter set back requirement for highways;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bees Act|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90b06|website=e-laws|publisher=Government of Ontario|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the rule has gone largely unenforced as few urban lots are spacious enough to meet requirements concerning proximity to property lines, dwellings, and highways. In 2011, there were 107 registered hives in Toronto.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Fran|title=Urban Beekeeping: Good for Cities And Bees|journal=Ontario Bee Journal|date=July–August 2014|volume=33|issue=04|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the many Toronto landmarks host to honeybee hives include: the [[Fort York]] historic site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKechnie|first1=Brian|title=Honey, hives and highrises: Why urban beekeeping is trending in Canada|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2059794/honey-hives-and-highrises-why-urban-beekeeping-is-trending-in-canada/|accessdate=31 July 2016|agency=Global News|date=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rooftop of the [[Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the [[University of Toronto]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the roof of [[Amsterdam Brewing Company]],&lt;ref name="Toronto Swarms to Urban Beekeeping"/&gt; and the [[Fairmont Royal York]] hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Daphne|title=Royal York rooftop garden a hive for bees|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2008/06/05/royal_york_rooftop_garden_a_hive_for_bees.html|accessdate=31 July 2016|agency=The Toronto Star|date=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vancouver===
Often regarded as a green and sustainable city, the City of Vancouver has recognized hobby beekeeping in residential areas by issuing guidelines and requiring hives to be registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/bee-guidelines.pdf | title=Hobby Beekeeping | publisher=City of Vancouver | work=Planning Department | year=2007 | accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vancouver, [[Vancouver Convention Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/the-roof-is-buzzing---literally---at-vancouvers-convention-centre/article1210825/ | title=The roof is buzzing - literally - at Vancouver's convention centre | publisher=The Globe and Mail | work=theglobeandmail.com | date=April 22, 2010 | accessdate=7 April 2014 | author=Scott, Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vancouver City Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/gc2020-targets.pdf | title=Draft Greenest City 2020 Action Plan | publisher=City of Vancouver | work=Deputy City Manager and Director, Sustainability Group | date=January 20, 2011 | accessdate=8 April 2014 | pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two places where bees are kept. 

One hotel chain that uses beekeeping as a point of differentiation in Vancouver is Fairmont. In 2008, Fairmont started placing beehives on hotel rooftop gardens. Today the hotel franchise operates global beekeeping initiatives at over 20 properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/06/02/fairmont-expands-its-bee-hotel-program.html|title=Fairmont expands its ‘bee hotel’ program {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Fairmont Waterfront Vancouver and Fairmont Vancouver Airport have hives either attached to the hotel or residing nearby. At Fairmont Waterfront, hotel guests are treated to a guided tour of the hives and gardens. Currently, the Fairmont Vancouver Airport houses “one million honey bees [...] who produce about 2,400 pounds of honey.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairmont.com/promotions/fairmontbees/|title=Fairmont Bee Sustainable|website=www.fairmont.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Fairmont Waterfront, 500,000 bees work together to “produce 600-800 pounds of honey per year.” The honey from the hives is then used by hotel chefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2014, Fairmont started building empty nesting sites, so-called "bee hotels," to help attract wild mason bees.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2015 Fairmont Waterfront partnered with Hives For Humanity to create a bee pollinator hotel. The practice may not be entirely beneficial as one biologist suggests bee hotels “favor non-native species of bees and wasps over our native species".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Otis, Daniel. "Fairmont expands its 'bee hotel' program." Thestar.com. N.p., 02 June 2015. Web. 27 Jan. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of beekeepers in the city is growing rapidly: 300 in 2010, there are today more than 1000. Young people are more and more interested in the hobby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://guteleutemagazine.com/2017/08/13/the-life-in-hh-of-two-part-time-french-beekeepers/|title=Gute Leute Magazine|first=|date=|website=https://guteleutemagazine.com/2017/08/13/the-life-in-hh-of-two-part-time-french-beekeepers/|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, book beginner courses at the beekeepers and share photos of their work on internet. Beekeeper associations are speaking of a boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zeit.de/2018/31/imker-hobby-honig-hamburg|title=Imker: Goldene Zeiten|work=ZEIT ONLINE|access-date=2018-09-14|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
