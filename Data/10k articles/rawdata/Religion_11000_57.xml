{{Portal|Occult}}
The '''''Arbatel De Magia veterum''''' ({{Lang-en|italic=yes|Arbatel: On the Magic of the Ancients}}) was a [[Latin]] [[grimoire]] of [[Renaissance magic|renaissance]] [[ceremonial magic]] published in 1575 in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Petersonweb"&gt;Arbatel De magia veterum (Arbatel: Of the Magic of the Ancients), Anonymous, ed. Joseph Peterson; 1997. Available online at [http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/arbatel.htm Esoteric Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petersonbook"&gt;Arbatel: ''Concerning the Magic of the Ancients'', Newly translated, edited and annotated by Joseph H. Peterson, Ibis Press/Nicolas Hays, 2009. pp. IX-XXI&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title ==
Waite assumes that the title is from the {{Lang-he|ארבעתאל}} (or ''Arbotal'') as the name of an angel the author would have claimed to have learned magic from.&lt;ref name="Waite"&gt;''The Book of Ceremonial Magic'', part I, chapter II, section 1: "The Arbatel of Magic"; Arthur Edward Waite; London, 1913; available online at [http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/index.htm The Internet Sacred Text Archive], ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm08.htm direct link to section])&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolf Jacoby believed the name to be a reference to the [[Tetragrammaton]], via the Hebrew ARBOThIM (fourfold) and AL (or God).&lt;ref name="Petersonweb" /&gt;

Peterson, mentioning the above possibilities, also suggests that the title might be the author's pseudonym.&lt;ref name="Petersonbook" /&gt;

==Origin==
The ''Arbatel'' is noted for being straightforward in its writing, positive in its contents, and unusually honest regarding its origins. While a number of occult works claim to be from earlier periods and other regions than where they were actually published, textual evidence demonstrates that the book must have been written between 1536 and 1583, which encompasses the claimed date of 1575. The final editing of the book was likely carried out by [[Theodor Zwinger]], and was almost definitely published by [[Pietro Perna]], leaving little doubt to the book's claimed Swiss origin. The author remains unknown, but Peterson believes one Jacques Gohory (1520–1576) to be the most likely possibility. Gohory, like Zwinger and Perna, was a [[Paracelsian]].&lt;ref name="Petersonbook" /&gt;

Some German manuscripts produced shortly after its publication attribute the work to Paracelsus, though without evidence.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Grimoires: A History of Magical Books, by Owen Davies, Oxford UP, 2009. p.52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
The ''Arbatel'' mainly focuses on the relationship between humanity, celestial hierarchies, and the positive relationship between the two. The Olympian spirits featured in it are entirely original.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

[[A. E. Waite]], quite clear of the Christian nature of the work (if dissatisfied with its ideas of practical magic), writes that the book is devoid of black magic and without any connection to the ''[[Key of Solomon|Greater]]'' or ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon|Lesser Keys of Solomon]]''.&lt;ref name="Waite" /&gt; Unlike other grimoires, the ''Arbatel'' exhorts the magus to remain active in their community (instead of isolating themselves), favoring kindness, charity, and honesty over remote and obscure rituals.&lt;ref name="Petersonbook" /&gt;

The [[Bible]] is the source most often quoted and referred to throughout the work (indeed, the author appears to have almost memorized large portions of it, resulting in paraphrases differing from the [[Vulgate]]). The ''Arbatel'' cannot be understood if separated from the philosophy of [[Paracelsus]], who appears to have coined the term "[[Olympian spirits|Olympic spirits]]", and was the inspiration for the ''Arbatel''{{'}}s understanding of [[elemental]]s (including Paracelsus's [[gnome]]s and the uniquely Paracelsian "Sagani"), the [[macrocosm and microcosm]], and [[experiment]]ation combined with respect for ancient authorities. Indeed, the ''Arbatel'' is both broadly and deeply rooted in classical culture, including [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], the [[Sibylline oracles]] and [[Plotinus]], in addition to the contemporaneous theology and occult philosophy of figures such as [[Giovanni Pontano|Iovianus Pontanus]] and [[Johannes Trithemius]]. (All of these traits also feature in the works of Jacques Gohory, which Peterson claims as evidence for his theory of Gohory's authorship.)&lt;ref name="Petersonbook" /&gt;

==Reception and influence==
The ''Arbatel'' was one of the most influential works of its kind from its period, inspiring figures such as [[Johann Arndt]], [[Gerhard Dorn]], [[Adam Haslmayr]], [[Robert Fludd]], [[Heinrich Khunrath]] and [[Valentin Weigel]], in addition to its editor and publisher, Zwinger and Perna.&lt;ref name="Petersonbook" /&gt; It was possibly the first work to use "[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]" in an occult sense (as opposed to a synonym for [[theology]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Theosophy, Imagination, Tradition: Studies in Western Esotericism''; by Antoine Faivre, SUNY Press, 17 Feb 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZW4FtJLNe-kC&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=arbatel%20de%20magia&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; and for distinguishing between human ("anthroposophia") and divine knowledge ("theosophia").&lt;ref name="Baltic" /&gt; Indeed, [[Jakob Böhme]] may have chosen the word "Theosophy" to describe his ideas due to its use in the ''Arbatel''. It was where [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] found the term anthroposophy, later adopted by [[Rudolf Steiner]] to describe his belief system.&lt;ref name="Petersonbook" /&gt; Not all reception was positive, however. The book was condemned by [[Johann Weyer]] in his ''[[De praestigiis daemonum]]''&lt;ref name="Petersonbook" /&gt; as being "full of magical impiety",&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Reformed Church]] censor [[Simon Sulzer]]. In 1617, the [[University of Marburg]] took action against two professors who intended to use the grimoire as a textbook, and expelled a student obsessed with it.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt; In 1623, an accused witch named Jean Michel Menuisier revealed that, despite not owning a copy of the ''Arbatel'', used a few invocations from it.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dee wrote about studying the ''Arbatel'' (among many other occult works of the period). This influence lead Nicholas Clulee to posit that Dee did not see his angelic experiments as magical, but in fact religious, as both Dee's ceremonies and the magical system of the ''Arbatel'' begin with prayers to God that cautiously lead into requests to see heavenly angels.&lt;ref&gt;''John Dee's Five Books of Mystery'', by John Dee, ed. Joseph H. Peterson, Weiser Books, 2003.  p. 11, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Dee also recorded calling upon at least the ''Arbatel''{{'}}s solar Olympian spirit Och.&lt;ref&gt;Dee, ed. Peterson, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden|Swedish]] mystic [[Johannes Bureus]] credited the work for his interest in [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref name="Baltic"&gt;''Rose Cross Over the Baltic: The Spread of Rosicrucianism in Northern Europe''; by Susanna Åkerman, BRILL, 1998, pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=0mxGmeG3mzIC&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=arbatel%20de%20magia&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 53]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=0mxGmeG3mzIC&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=arbatel%20de%20magia&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of the ''Arbatel'' appear in a number of versions of the ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, anonymous, ed. Joseph Peterson, Ibis Press, 2008. p.XIII, XVII&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ebenezer Sibly]] and [[Frederick Hockley]] incorporated a number of elements from Robert Turner's translation of the ''Arbatel'' into their own magical works, including ''The Clavic or Key to the Magic of Solomon'' and ''The Complete Book of Magic Science'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Clavis or Key to the Magic of Solomon'', by Ebenezer Sibley and Frederick Hockley, ed. Joseph Peterson, Ibis press, 2009. p. VIII, XI, XIV, XIX, XX, XXI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergman"&gt;''A Complete Book of Magic Science'', by Frederick Hockley, ed. Dietrich Bergman, Teitan press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of which was one of many later sources for the ''[[Grimoire of Turiel]]''.&lt;ref name="Bergman" /&gt;

A copy of the work was listed in the catalogue for the [[Mercantile Library Association of San Francisco|San Francisco Mercantile Library]] in 1854. Although access to it would have been restricted, its presence indicates that it played a role in American folk beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1898, Arthur Edward Waite undertook the first historical study of grimoires as a genre, detailing the ''Arbatel'' as one of many important works.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of a German translation appeared in the Berlin publishing company Herman Barsdorf Verlag's ''Magische Werke'' in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Occultist Stephen Skinner claims that the [[isopsephy]] of the names of the Olympic Spirits summing to 31, the numeration of "AL" as in Liber AL, may have been responsible for inspiring [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[The Book of the Law|Liber AL vel Legis]]'', although  Skinner admits that the influence on Crowley may not have been conscious.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Magician's Tables'', 5th edition, by Stephen Skinner, Golden Hoard Press, 2015, Tables M42-M47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==
The first edition was published in 1575 in [[Basel]], with no evidence for earlier editions despite some claims otherwise. Other editions include:&lt;ref name="Petersonbook" /&gt;
*A reprint in 1575, [[Basel]].
*English translation by Robert Turner, [[London]], 1655, printed in Turner's translation of the spurious "Fourth" book of [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''. The most popular version in the English-speaking world, though with some mistakes.
*German translation by Andreas Luppius, [[Wesel]], 1686. Reprinted by Johann Scheible's ''[[Das Kloster]]''. Features a number of additions and changes, including a printer's mark mistakenly assumed to be a part of the work. Andreas Luppius also published a version of the ''Arbatel'' as ''Clavicula Salomonis et Theosophia pneumatica''.
*English translation in the [[British Library]]'s [[Hans Sloane|Sloane]] Manuscripts, 1696. A different translation from Turner's, with more corruptions, errors and even missing sections. Copied from the notebook of a physician named Arthur Gauntlet. It does, however, feature a "Seal of Secrets" mentioned in one section that is absent from all other versions. This version (as part of Gauntlet's notebook) was later edited and published by David Rankine and Avalonia press as ''The Grimoire of Arthur Gauntlet'' in 2011.
*Another partial independent English translation in the Sloane MS, 17th century.
*Another German translation by Scheible, [[Stuttgart]], 1855. Mostly follows Luppius, with some corrections to match the original Latin.
*French translation by Marc Haven, [[Nice]], 1945. Claims to be translated from the original Latin, but appears to be a retranslation of Turner's English version.
* Latin text with parallel English translation by Joseph H. Peterson, ''Arbatel: Concerning the Magic of the Ancients''. Newly translated, edited and annotated by Joseph H. Peterson, Ibis Press/Nicolas Hays, 2009.

'''[[Buddhism]]''' is recognized in the '''[[Bahá'í Faith]]''' as one of nine known religions and its scriptures are regarded as predicting the coming of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] ([[Maitreya]]). [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is included in the succession of [[Manifestations of God]]. The authenticity of the current canon of [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scriptures]] is seen as uncertain. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of Bahá'ís from [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] background.&lt;ref name="smith-buddhism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Buddhism |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í scholarship==
The differences between religious concepts in Buddhism and the [[Abrahamic religions]] has caused  questions for Bahá'í scholarship. Jamshed Fozdar presents the Buddhist teaching about an unknowable reality as referring to the concept of [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]],&lt;ref name="smith-buddhism" /&gt; for example in the following passage from the [[Udana]] (v.81) in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]: ''"There is, O monks, an Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed. Were there not, O monks, this Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed, there would be no escape from the world of the born, originated, created, formed. Since, O monks, there is an Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed, therefore is there an escape from the born, originated, created, formed."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fozdar|1995|pp=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Moojan Momen]] shows the many similarities between the ethical teachings in [[Theravada]] Buddhism and the Bahá'í Faith, and states that the metaphysical differences originate from culture-bound terminologies.&lt;ref name="smith-buddhism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1988|pp=185–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eightfold Noble Path==
The [[Bahá'í teachings]] uphold all parts of the [[Eightfold Noble Path]]: right view, right aim or right-mindedness, right speech, right action, right living or livelihood, right effort or endeavour, right mindfulness and right contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1994|pp=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barnett Freedman''' [[CBE]], [[Royal Designers for Industry|RDI]] (19 May 1901 in [[Stepney]], London &amp;ndash; 4 January 1958) was a [[British people|British]] painter, commercial designer, book illustrator, [[typographer]], and [[lithography|lithographer]].&lt;ref name=UOBbf&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/resources/rdis-at-britain-can-make-it,-1946/barnett-freedman |title=Barnett Freedman|date= |accessdate=7 November 2016|work=University of Brighton Design Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Barnett Freedman was born in the east end of London, the son of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Freedman's only formal education was at an elementary school, and from the age of nine he spent much time in hospital. This period was filled by reading and learning how to draw and to play the violin.  At the age of fifteen, he obtained work as an office boy, then turning  to draughtsmanship, initially with a monumental mason and subsequently at an architect's office. The strong interest in [[letterform]]s that grew out of this everyday work was later to stand him in good stead.  He was assiduous in attending evening classes at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], hoping to win a [[London County Council]] scholarship. Although Freedman was initially unsuccessful, [[William Rothenstein]], Principal of the [[Royal College of Art]], was impressed by his potential and used his influence to enable Freedman to be admitted to the College.&lt;ref name=UWAC&gt;{{cite web |author=Elizabeth Dooley|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/art/artist/barnettfreedman |title=Barnet Freedman|date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=8 October 2016|work=University of Warwick Art Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Career==
After leaving the Royal College of Art in 1925, Freedman tried to earn his living as a painter. He married a fellow student, Beatrice Claudia Guercio; and, after hard times, gained an introduction to the publishers, [[Faber and Faber|Faber and Gwyer]], for whom he illustrated [[Laurence Binyon]]'s ''Wonder Night'', in the [[Ariel Poems]] series.  Barnett illustrated two further titles, [[Walter de la Mare]]’s ''News'' and "Behold This Dreamer", and [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]]’s ''Choosing a Mast'', while Claudia did sketches for de la Mare’s poem, ''A Snowdrop''. Barnett designed book jackets for the firm for twenty-five years. Nearly all were auto-lithographed on stone with hand-drawn lettering. During this period, he carried out a wide range of work for other publishers and worked extensively also on package design.

Faber gave Freedman his first major commission, an assignment to design and illustrate [[Siegfried Sassoon]]'s ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]''.  Published in 1931, the book was the subject of controversial reviews but brought him into prominence.  Freedman had by that time become interested in the difficult medium of auto-lithography, where the artist draws his own designs on to the stones without the intervention of trade craftsmen or photomechanical means.  He had received advice from T. E. Griffits, the most influential lithographer of the time, who held sway at [[Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son]].

Following work on an annual report for the Post Office, Freedman was chosen to design the 1935 postage stamp issues to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of [[King George V]].&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|date=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive and handsome nature of this work brought him to wider public notice. His work - which took him just a weekend&lt;ref&gt;"More war artists chosen", ''Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer'', 7 March 1940&lt;/ref&gt; - and the subsequent printing of the stamps was the subject of [[The King's Stamp]], a documentary film by the [[GPO Film Unit]]. Freedman also designed Jubilee postal orders, in various values from sixpence to £1.&lt;ref&gt;"Bigger stamps for Jubilee", ''Dundee Courier'', 24 April 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedman was now recognised as a force in autolithographic printmaking, and his down-to-earth attitude and lack of pretension made him welcome among the craftsmen at the [[Curwen Press]], the Baynard Press and Chromoworks, the leading firms in the industry.&lt;ref name="Buckman"&gt;{{cite web |author=David Buckman|url=http://spitalfieldslife.com/2013/06/02/barnett-freedman-artist/|date=2 June 2013|accessdate=7 November 2013|title=Barnett Freedman, Artist|work=Spitalfields Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Baynard Press, he also designed the ''Baynard Claudia'' typeface, which he named after his wife, Beatrice Claudia Guercio.&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Horne|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1994|title=The Dictionary of 20th Century British Book Illustrators |ISBN=1 85149 1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guercio was also an artist of some repute and had herself been commissioned to design a new GPO greetings telegram to commemorate the 1937 Coronation of George VI.&lt;ref&gt;"New Greetings Telegram Form", ''The Scotsman'', 9 June 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 he illustrated [[George Borrow]]'s ''[[Lavengro]]'' for the Limited Editions Club of New York.  By this time Freedman’s lithography had entered  a new phase, where the unique qualities of the medium were taken into a new dimension with the artist’s rainbow palette.  Freedman developed a technique whereby the black and white illustrations printed by line block simulated lithography, bringing a unity to the book.  Although ''Lavengro'' was poorly subscribed, George Macy, owner of the book club, admired Freedman's work to such an extent that he was subsequently commissioned to illustrate ''Henry IV Part One'', for the Limited Editions Club multi-volume Shakespeare.  Tolstoy's ''War and Peace'' (1938) and ''Anna Karenina'' (1951) are recognised as two of the finest examples of twentieth century book design and have ensured Freedman an honoured place in the history of book production.  For Macy's less exclusive [[Heritage Press]], Freedman illustrated Dickens's ''Oliver Twist'' (1939), Emily Brontë's ''Wuthering Heights'' (1941) and Charlotte Brontë's ''Jane Eyre'' (1942). The Bronte novels are challenging for the illustrator, and Freedman’s interpretations were regarded as among the best.

Freedman was also employed by [[Ealing Films]] to design its 'logo' and provide the publicity for feature films such as ''Johnny Frenchman'' and ''San Demetrio''.  A constant stream of commercial design work provided him with a good living.

==World War II==
[[File:The Gun (1940) (Art.IWM ART LD 391).jpg|thumb|''The Gun'' (1940) (Art.IWM ART LD391)]]
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Freedman was appointed as a full-time salaried war artist by the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] and sent to France in April 1940 to record the work of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref&gt;"Two more official war artists", ''Liverpool Daily Post'' , 7 March 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; He painted a number of works there but was frustrated by a perceived lack of support, particularly transport provision. He was evacuated to England in May 1940 and worked on coastal defence subjects in [[Sheerness]] and the [[Isle of Sheppey]]. His full-time contract with WAAC ended in February 1941 after which WAAC purchased individual pieces from him but also offered him several short-term contracts with the Admiralty.&lt;ref name="Foss"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brain Foss|publisher=Yale University Press|date=2007|title=War paint: Art, War, State and Identity in Britain, 1939-1945 |ISBN=978-0-300-10890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1941, Freedman was on board [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']], and produced the painting ''15 inch Gun Turret, HMS Repulse''. At the end of 1942 he began an album of portraits of aircraft factory workers and then spent time aboard [[HMS Tribune (N76)|HMS ''Tribune'']], which resulted in another album of portraits and the painting ''Interior of a Submarine''(1943), which was briefly displayed at the [[National Gallery]] before being removed from view under wartime censorship regulations. The painting is now in the permanent collection of the [[Tate]].&lt;ref name=Sub&gt;{{cite web |author=Tate Gallery|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/freedman-interior-of-a-submarine-n05694|title=Catalogue entry,''Interior of a Submarine'' (1943)|year=|accessdate=7 November 2013|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1944 Freedman went to Portsmouth, before travelling to France after the D-Day landings. There he recorded scenes around the landing beaches and at the invasion headquarters, but in July was taken ill and sent to hospital in Liverpool.&lt;ref name=bfIWM&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1050000809|title=War artists archive, Barnett Freedman|year=|accessdate=7 November 2013|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In post-war years, as a teacher at the [[Royal College of Art]] and the [[Ruskin School of Art]], he was regarded by many of his students as an inspiring, if unpredictable, mentor who had little regard for time-wasters.&lt;ref name="Buckman"/&gt;

The inimitable style of Freedman's book jackets drew the eye of the ‘bookshop prowlers’, as they were termed by [[Maurice Collis]], an author who realised and admired the important role that Freedman’s art played in bookshop sales. Freedman produced a stream of colourful posters and black-and-white drawings for press advertisements.  At Chromoworks he had total oversight of the production of the Lyons lithographs, a series of fine colour prints by British artists, which were displayed in the teashops of J. Lyons and Co., now regarded as a major achievement in bringing good art to 'the masses'. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who lived and worked into old age, Freedman's precarious health led to an early death, at work in his studio on 4 January 1958.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3529">The roots of '''[[Buddhism]] in [[Lithuania]]''' can be traced to the 20th century, although the time of its first introduction there remains unknown. [[Zen Buddhism]] practiced in [[Lithuania]] today originated in [[Korea]]. There are a few active communities across the country including [[Vilnius]], [[Kaunas]], [[Klaipėda]], [[Šiauliai]], [[Panevėžys]] and [[Šakiai]].

== History ==
The first public [[Dharma talk]] in Lithuania was given in Kaunas in 1990 by Pawel Karppowich, the Polish student of [[Seung Sahn]]. The Kaunas Zen Kwan Um center was officially registered in April 1991, soon followed by a similar group in Vilnius, established after the visit of the Zen Master. The Vilnius Kwan Um Zen community grew under the support of Zen Master [[Wu Bong]]'s frequent visits.

The Vilnius International Kwan Um School of Zen Buddhism was officially registered as a religious community in Lithuania in 1991.

Zen Master Su Bong Sunim, the guiding teacher of the Hong Kong Kwan Um Sangha, opened the first Zen Temple, Ko Bong Sa, in Vilnius in 1993. Daily Zen practice is held at the Kaunas Zen Kwan Um Center since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zen.lt/index.php?page=chronicle-2 Chronicle of Kwan Um School of Zen in Lithuania]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zen Buddhism in Lithuania today ==
The 14th [[Dalai Lama]] [[Tenzin Gyatso]] has visited Lithuania twice and met with the President [[Valdas Adamkus]] and the Catholic Cardinal [[Audrys Juozas Bačkis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.straipsniai.lt/religija/puslapis/736 |title=Jo Šventenybė XIV DALAI LAMA |access-date=2009-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726164106/http://www.straipsniai.lt/religija/puslapis/736 |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 supporters of Tibetan independence suggested giving its name to one of the parks in Vilnius as a gratitude for the Dalai Lama's support for the Lithuanian independence movement of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=20676320 Skverą Vilniuje siūloma pavadinti Tibeto vardu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 ''The Days of Tibetan Culture'' ([[Lithuanian language]]: "Tibeto kultūros dienos") were held in Vilnius, attended by Indian Buddhist monks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.delfi.lt/video/AzBBQFrq/ Vienuoliai iš Indijos Vilniuje kuria smėlio mandalą]&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most prominent Lithuanian Zen Buddhist is a TV journalist and a former head of the international non-governmental organisation [[Transparency International]], [[Rytis Juozapavičius]], who is also the abbot of Vilnius Zen Center, Ko Bong Sa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vakarai.us/news/130/ARTICLE/5219/2008-08-20.html Lietuva ir budizmas: kur kas arčiau vienas kito, nei galėtų pasirodyti]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.lt/new/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=37 Transparency International Lithuania] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113094858/http://www.transparency.lt/new/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=37 |date=January 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10828">[[Community of Christ]] membership and field organization is governed by the scriptures, resolutions and Bylaws of the Community of Christ and administered by the [[First Presidency (Community of Christ)|First Presidency]], [[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)|Council of Twelve]] and others. To be considered a member of the Community of Christ, individuals participate in two sacraments of the church: Baptism and Confirmation. Baptism in the Community of Christ is by full immersion and Confirmation is conferred by the "laying on of hands." 

Membership statistics are maintained by local recorders in each congregation and reported electronically. The [[Community of Christ]] reported 2015 enrollment within Mission Centers a total of 199,485 members, up from 199,268 in 2014. Membership totals for the year 2006, 2013, 2014, and 2015 in each mission center are shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;Carina Lord Wilson and Andrew M. Shields, "Church Membership Report," in 2007 World Conference Monday  Bulletin, March 26, 2007, p.269-276. Community of Christ, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As of the 2016 World Conference, membership had increased to 250,301 with 199,485 members being enrolled with a Mission Center. The number of Priesthood members as of 2015 stands at 20,552 with 10,334 holding the Aaronic Priesthood and 10,218 holding the Melchisedec Priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saturday/Sunday Bulletin World Conference 2016|last=|first=|publisher=Community of Christ|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field organization==
The basic unit of organization in the Community of Christ is the congregation. The congregation is the Community of Christ in its local area and attempts to bring the ministry of Jesus Christ into the surrounding community. Each congregation has a Pastor, Financial Officer and usually several additional, mostly volunteer priesthood members. Congregations belong to mid-level organizational units called a Mission Center. Mission Center Presidents report to a field Apostle who supervises several mission centers in one of eleven mission fields. 

At the 2007 World Conference, a member holding the priesthood office of Seventy was teamed with each of the Apostles, as follows:
* Apostle [[Linda L. Booth]] and Seventy Karin Peter in the Southern USA Mission Field
* Apostle [[Andrew Bolton (Community of Christ)|Andrew Bolton]] and Seventy Sam Kumar in the Asia Mission Field
* Apostle Bunda C. Chibwe and Tanoh Assoi in the Africa and Haiti Mission Field
* Apostle [[Stassi D. Cramm]] and Seventy John Wight in the Central and Michigan USA Mission Field
* Apostle [[Mary Jacks Dynes]] and Seventy Kris Judd in the Canada/North Central (USA) Mission Field
* Apostle [[Ronald D. Harmon Jr.]] and Seventy Larry McGuire in the East Central USA Mission Field
* Apostle [[Dale E. Luffman]] and Robin Linkhart in the West Central USA Mission Field
* Apostle [[Rick W. Maupin]] and Seventy Ruben Landeros in the Caribbean, Mexico and Texas USA Mission Field
* Apostle [[Carlos Enrique Mejia]] and Seventy Bob Kyser in the Central and South America Mission Field
* Apostle [[Susan D. Skoor]] and Seventy Gina Norton in the Pacific Mission Field
* Apostle [[Leonard M. Young]] and Seventy Richard James in the North Atlantic (Europe/USA) Mission Field

'''Contemplation''' is profound thinking about something. In a religious sense, contemplation is usually a type of [[contemplative prayer|prayer]] or [[meditation]].

==Etymology==
The word ''contemplation'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''contemplatio''. Its [[Root (linguistics)|root]] is also that of the Latin word ''templum'', a piece of ground consecrated for the taking of auspices, or a building for worship, derived either from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] base *''tem''- "to cut", and so a "place reserved or cut out",&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|templum|templum}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from the Proto-Indo-European base *''temp''- "to stretch", and thus referring to a cleared space in front of an altar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?&amp;search=temple Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''contemplatio'' was used to translate the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''θεωρία'' (''[[theoria|theōría]]'').

==Greek philosophy==

Contemplation was an important part of the philosophy of [[Plato]]; Plato thought that through contemplation the soul may ascend to knowledge of the [[Form of the Good]] or other divine Forms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veWc15Cd9L4C&amp;pg=PA156 ''Plato: Critical Assessments''], Nicholas D. Smith, Routledge, 1998. {{ISBN|0-415-12605-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]] as a [[neoplatonism|(neo)Platonic]] philosopher also expressed contemplation as the most critical of components for one to reach [[henosis]]. 
To Plotinus the highest contemplation was to experience the vision of God, the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] or the One. Plotinus describes this experience in his works the [[Enneads]]. According to his student Porphyry, Plotinus stated that he had this experience of God four times.&lt;ref&gt;See the Life of Plotinus&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus wrote about his experience in Enneads 6.9.xx....

==Islam==
{{Further|Muhammad's first revelation}}
In Islamic tradition, it is said that [[Muhammad]] would go into the desert, climb a mountain known as [[Mount Hira]], and seclude himself from the world. While on the mountain, he would contemplate life and its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bogle |first= Emory C. |authorlink=Emory C. Bogle. |title= Islam: Origin and Belief |year=1998 |publisher=Texas University Press |location= |isbn=0-292-70862-9 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[File:Antoine-Émile Plassan - Devotion (Contemplation) - Walters 3745.jpg|left|thumb|A woman places [[rosary]] beads on a devotional image mounted on the wall beside her bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/14934 |title= Devotion (Contemplation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
{{Main|Christian contemplation}}
{{See also|Christian meditation|Theoria}}

In [[Eastern Christianity]], contemplation ([[theoria]]) literally means to see God or to have the Vision of God.{{refn|group=note|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "The vision of the uncreated light, which offers knowledge of God to man, is sensory and supra-sensory. The bodily eyes are reshaped, so they see the uncreated light, "this mysterious light, inaccessible, immaterial, uncreated, deifying, eternal", this "radiance of the Divine Nature, this glory of the divinity, this beauty of the heavenly kingdom" (3,1,22;CWS p.80). Palamas asks: "Do you see that light is inaccessible to senses which are not transformed by the Spirit?" (2,3,22). St. Maximus, whose teaching is cited by St. Gregory, says that the Apostles saw the uncreated Light "by a transformation of the activity of their senses, produced in them by the Spirit" (2.3.22).&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos (2005), ''Orthodox Psychotherapy'', section ''The Knowledge of God according to St. Gregory Palamas''. Birth of Theotokos Monastery, Greece, {{ISBN|978-960-7070-27-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The state of beholding God, or union with God, is known as theoria. The process of [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]] which leads to that state of union with God known as theoria is practiced in the [[ascetic]] tradition of [[Hesychasm]]. Hesychasm is to reconcile the heart and the mind into one thing (see [[nous]]).{{refn|group=note|pelagia.org: "Stillness of the body is a limiting of the body. 'The beginning of hesychia is godly rest' (3). The intermediate stage is that of 'illuminating power and vision; and the end is ecstasy or rapture of the nous towards God' (4). St. John of the Ladder, referring to outward, bodily stillness, writes: 'The lover of stillness keeps his mouth shut' (5). But it is not only those called neptic Fathers who mention and describe the holy atmosphere of hesychia, it is also those known as 'social'. Actually in the Orthodox tradition there is no direct opposition between theoria and praxis, nor between the neptic and social Fathers. The neptics are eminently social and those in community are unimaginably neptic."&lt;ref&gt;pelagia.org, [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b02.en.orthodox_psychotherapy.05.htm ''Orthodox Psychotherapy''],  section on ''Stillness and Prayer''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Contemplation in Eastern Orthodoxy is expressed in degrees as those covered in St [[John Climacus]]' [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]. The process of changing from the old man of sin into the newborn child of God and into our true nature as good and divine is called [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]].

This is to say that once someone is in the presence of God, deified with him, then they can begin to properly understand, and there "contemplate" God. This form of contemplation is to have and pass through an actual experience rather than a rational or reasoned understanding of theory (see [[Gnosis]]). Whereas with rational thought one uses logic to understand, one does the opposite with God (see also [[Apophatic theology]]).

Within Western [[Christianity]] contemplation is often related to [[Mystical theology|mysticism]] as expressed in the works of [[Mystical theology|mystical theologians]] such as [[Teresa of Avila]] and [[John of the Cross]] as well as the writings of [[Margery Kempe]], [[Augustine Baker]] and [[Thomas Merton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04324b.htm "Contemplation"], ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', New Advent. Retrieved March 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Dom [[Cuthbert Butler]] notes that contemplation was the term used in the Latin Church to refer to mysticism, and "'mysticism' is a quite modern word".&lt;ref&gt; ''Western Mysticism: Augustine, Gregory and Bernard on Contemplation and the Contemplative Life'', by Dom Cuthbert Butler. Dover: Mineola, NY, 2003, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation===
[[Image:solitude.jpg|thumb|Nature contemplation]]
In Christianity, contemplation refers to a content-free mind directed towards the awareness of [[God]] as a living reality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} This corresponds, in some ways, to what in Eastern religion is called [[samadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/pali/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha1/02-samannaphala-e2.htm], samannaphala sutta Digha-Nikaya-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/Vedic/jhananandaysutra.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504200949/http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/vedic/jhananandaysutra.htm |archivedate=2011-05-04 |df= }}, Patanjali, Yoga Sutras&lt;/ref&gt; Meditation, on the other hand, for many centuries in the Western Church, referred to more cognitively active exercises, such as visualizations of Biblical scenes as in the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatian exercises]] or ''[[lectio divina]]'' in which the practitioner "listens to the text of the Bible with the 'ear of the heart', as if he or she is in conversation with God, and God is suggesting the topics for discussion." &lt;ref&gt;A contemporary discussion of differences between ''meditatio'' and ''contemplatio'' is available in Father Thomas Keating's book on contemplative centering prayer, ''Open Mind, Open Heart: The Contemplative Dimension of the Gospel'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-8264-0696-3}}. Brief descriptions of centering prayer and ''lectio divina'' are available online at http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Catholic Christianity, contemplation is given importance. The Catholic Church's "model theologian", St. Thomas Aquinas wrote: "It is requisite for the good of the human community that there should be persons who devote themselves to the life of contemplation." One of his disciples, [[Josef Pieper]] commented: "For it is contemplation which preserves in the midst of human society the truth which is at one and the same time useless and the yardstick of every possible use; so it is also contemplation which keeps the true end in sight, gives meaning to every practical act of life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zenit.org/article-21671?l=english "Says Pope a Universal Voice for the World"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205004758/http://www.zenit.org/article-21671?l=english |date=2008-02-05 }}, Carrie Gross, February 1, 2008, Zenit.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aquinas, the highest form of life is the contemplative which communicates the fruits of contemplation to others, since it is based on the abundance of contemplation (''contemplari et contemplata aliis tradere'') ([[Summa Theologiae|ST]], III, Q. 40, A. 1, Ad 2).

A '''coven''' {{IPAc-en|k|ʌ|v|ən}} usually refers to a group or gathering of [[witches]]. The word "coven" remained largely unused in [[English language|English]] until 1921 when [[Margaret Murray]] promoted the [[witch-cult hypothesis|idea]], now discredited, that all witches across Europe met in groups of thirteen which they called "covens".&lt;ref name="MurrayWitchCult"&gt;Murray, Margaret (1921). ''The Witch Cult in Western Europe: A Study in Anthropology''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|Murray did not originate|date=January 2015}}

==Neopaganism==
[[File:Beech_trees_in_Mallard_Wood,_New_Forest_-_geograph.org.uk_-_779513.jpg|thumb|[[New Forest]] in Hampshire where the father of [[Wicca]], [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], stated he encountered the [[New Forest coven]].]]
In [[Wicca]] and other similar forms of modern [[neopaganism|neopagan]] [[witchcraft]], such as [[Stregheria]] and [[Feri]], a coven is a gathering or community of [[witch]]es, much like a [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] in [[Christianity|Christian]] parlance. It is composed of a group of believers who gather together for ceremonies of [[worship]] such as [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]], or celebrating the [[Wheel of the Year|Sabbats]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The number of persons involved may vary. Although some consider thirteen to be ideal (probably in deference to [[Margaret Murray|Murray]]'s theories), any group of at least three can be a coven.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} A group of two is usually called a "working couple" (regardless of the sexes). Within the community, many believe that a coven larger than thirteen is unwieldy, citing unwieldy group dynamics and an unfair burden on the leadership.&lt;ref name="KCovenCraft"&gt;[[Amber K|K, Amber]] (2002). ''Coven Craft: Witchcraft for Three or More''. Llewellyn Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; When a coven has grown too large to be manageable, it may split, or "hive". In Wicca, this may also occur when a newly made [[High Priest]] or [[High Priestess]], also called [[Wicca#Organisation within Wicca|3rd Degree]] ordination, leaves to start their own coven.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Wiccan covens are usually jointly led by a [[High Priestess]] and a [[High Priest]], although some are led by only one or the other. In more recent forms of neopagan witchcraft, covens are sometimes run as democracies with a rotating leadership.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

===Online covens===
With the rise of the Internet as a platform for collaborative discussion and media dissemination, it became popular for adherents and practitioners of Wicca to establish "online covens" which remotely teach tradition-specific crafts to students in a similar method of education as non-religious [[virtual school|virtual]] [[distance education|online schools]]. One of the first online covens to take this route is the [[Coven of the Far Flung Net]] (CFFN), which was established in 1998 as the online arm of the [[Church of Universal Eclectic Wicca]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

However, because of potentially-unwieldy membership sizes,{{clarifyme|date=October 2018}} many online covens limit their memberships to anywhere between 10 and 100 students. The CFFN, in particular, tried{{when|date=October 2018}} to devolve its structure into a system of sub-coven clans (which governed their own application processes), a system which ended in 2003 due to fears by the CFFN leadership that the clans were becoming communities in their own right.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Other contemporary forms===
The Urban Coven is a group founded on [[Facebook]] by [[Becca Gordon]] for women in [[Los Angeles]] to gather, hike, and howl at the [[moon]]. It meets monthly and is estimated to have almost 3,500 members. A January 2016 gathering at [[Griffith Park]] drew nearly 1,000 women, and was described as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Many of the women ... were there in groups — mothers and daughters, friends, colleagues. Some arrived solo and struck up conversations with other women or hiked in solitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/full-moon-hike-los-angeles_us_56a66b14e4b0d8cc109ae62a|title=This Is What An 'Urban Coven' Looks Like|first=Antonia|last=Blumberg|date=25 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Usage in literature and popular culture ==
In popular culture, a coven is a group or gathering of witches who work spells in tandem.  Such imagery can be traced back to [[Renaissance]] prints depicting witches and to the [[Three Witches|three "weird sisters"]] in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1606).{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Orgiastic meetings of witches are depicted in the [[Robert Burns]] poem "[[Tam o' Shanter (Burns poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]" (1791) and in the [[Goethe]] play ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1832).{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Films featuring covens include ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), ''[[Suspiria]]'' (1977) and its [[Suspiria (2018 film)|2018 remake]], ''[[The Witches of Eastwick (film)|The Witches of Eastwick]]'' (1987), ''[[Four Rooms]]'' (1995), ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' (1996), ''[[Coven (film)|Coven]]'' (1997), ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' (2003), ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'' (2006), ''[[The Covenant (film)|The Covenant]]'' (2006), ''[[Paranormal Activity 3]]'' (2011), and ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'' (2015).{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In television, covens have been portrayed in the U.S. in supernatural dramas such as ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Witches of East End (TV series)|Witches of East End]]'', ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', ''[[The Secret Circle (TV series)|The Secret Circle]]'', ''[[True Blood]]'', and ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. The third season of ''[[American Horror Story]]'' is entitled ''[[American Horror Story: Coven|Coven]]'' and focuses on witches.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In vampire novels such as ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'' by [[Anne Rice]] and the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series by [[Stephenie Meyer]], covens are families or unrelated groups of vampires who live together.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Covens feature in the video game Dishonored, specifically in the DLC's Knife of Dunwall, and The Brigmore Witches.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

'''Dora Gordine''' (8th June 1895 – 29 December 1991) was an Estonian Jewish [[Modernism|Modernist]] figurative and portraitist sculptor. Her early career was influenced by the [[Young Estonia|Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’)]] group of artists who favoured [[Art Nouveau]]. She moved to Paris and on her second marriage to Hon.Richard Hare (1907–66), her career expanded to the extent that some critics regarded her as amongst the finest sculptors of her generation.&lt;ref name=EJA&gt;In May 1925 Dora exhibited a Bronze (503) at the Salon Nationale (closed at the end of August 1925). She gave her birthplace as 'Libau', her nationality as 'Esthoniene'..." [http://eja.pri.ee/Culture/Gordin%20Dora_en.html Dora Gordine] Estonian Jewish Museum&lt;/ref&gt;She specialized 
in Portrait sculptures attracting international admirers from the: political, social, artistic, literary and theatrical worlds. Her legacy also includes a number of public space pieces. Her latter career was not as prolific or as fated with praise and Gordine was relatively unknown at the time of her death. Major exhibitions in London in 2006 and 2009 have revived her standing and her former home is now a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|publisher=Dorich House Museum|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122005604/http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Early life==
Dora Gordine's childhood has not been well documented. There is confusion over her date of birth with various dates 1895 (likely), 1898 and 1906 mentioned. She was the youngest of four children born to '''Morduch ("Mark") Gordin''' and '''Emma Ester Schepshelewitch''', both Russian Jews, in [[Liepāja|Liepāja, Latvia]], at a time when it was still part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Two of her siblings, Nikolai and Anna, died at the hands of the Nazis in [[Tallinn|Tallinn, Estonia]] in 1941. Another brother, Leopold, escaped and lived in London until his death. The Gordin family evidently belonged to a comfortable middle class. There was money available to pay Gordine’s elder brother, Leopold, to study engineering at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]]. Later, it seems that Gordine’s father was also prepared to pay for Gordine’s elder sister, Anna, to study at one of Tallinn’s leading art schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'', 6th edition Gordin Family Document Archive 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Gordin, application to the Home Secretary for British citizenship, 18 February 1930, HO 144/12019, NAKG&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 the Gordin family had moved to [[Tallinn|Tallinn, Estonia]]. It is clear that Gordine’s approach to sculpture was considerably shaped by the example of the pre-First World War Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’) a group of artists who championed [[Art Nouveau]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Estonia|last=Lauer|first=M.|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=186-187}}&lt;/ref&gt; She exhibited bronze sculptures in Tallinn in 1917, 1920 and 1921. In the autumn of 1924 she came to [[Paris]] to study a course in [[French civilisation]], improving her knowledge of contemporary French sculptural practice. Then, surrounded by galleries and salons, she "instinctively felt a correlation between the rhythms of music and sculpture" and developed her sculptural vision. Gordin gallicised her surname by adding an “e" perhaps in an effort to make it sound more Russian and always denied or deflected suggestions that she was [[Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;In November 1928 printmaker Diana White asked Esther Pissarro (wife of the painter Lucien), who was Jewish by birth, 'Dora Gordine...is she Jewess? Some of her work...made me think she was...' D. White to E. Pissarro, 2 November 1928, Pissarro Papers, Department of Western Art, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford University [AMO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Mackenzie to F. Pearson, 14 February 1994, Archives, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 she worked as a painter on a mural for the [[British Pavilion]] at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, in Paris. It provided the means to cast a bronze for exhibition at the Beaux Arts Society. The following year she was invited to exhibit at the [[Salon des Tuileries]] where her design of the head &amp; torso of a Chinese philosopher earned enthusiastic reviews; The Straits Times (1932) wrote: "Like Byron, one morning Dora Gordine woke up famous". Between 1929 and 1935 she sculpted bronzes for the [[City Hall, Singapore]]. [[Leicester Galleries]] in [[London]] presented Gordine's sculpture in a solo show in 1928. It was a huge success and all her work was sold, amongst which Javanese Head was bought by [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] for the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;Kwok Kian Chow. Channels &amp; Confluences: A History of Singapore Art.

==Marriage==
In 1930 she married her first husband, Englishman Dr [[George Herbert Garlick]] in [[Singapore]]. In 1936 she married her second husband, the Hon. [[Richard Gilbert Hare]] (5 September 1907 – 1966), son of [[Richard Granville Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel]] and Freda Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone on 21 November 1936. Through her marriage she became part of a liberal aristocratic cultural elite, a member of the top ten percent in Britain when three quarters of the nation belonged to the working class.&lt;ref&gt;In 1931 the working class comprised 78% of the British population. Twenty years later this had fallen to 72% though this still constituted of 36 million people. Hennessy P. Having It So Good: Britain in the Fifties (London: Penguin, 2006) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The independent income from Hare allowed Dora to build Dorich House in [[Kingston Vale]], her studio and a showcase for her work. As well as, a showcase for their collections of Indian, Chinese and nineteenth century Russian art and furniture.

==Career==
[[File:Male Torso by Dora Gordine, Senate House, University of London 01.jpg|thumb|''Male Torso'', Dora Gordine, Senate House, University of London.]]
Her husband introduced her to London society figures, many of whom sat for her, Dame [[Edith Evans]], Dame [[Beryl Grey]], [[Dorothy Tutin]], [[Siân Phillips]], [[Emlyn Williams]], Sir [[Kenneth Clark]], [[John Pope-Hennessy]] and Professor F. Brown, Head of the Slade School of Art. There were also overseas commissions including the Philosopher [[Kuu Nim]], whose head sculpture Gordine called 'the Chinese Lady of Peace' and a low-relief at [[Gray's Inn]] to [[Sun Yat-Sen]], the former leader of China.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jonathan Black,Sculptor, artist, Designer: Sculptor, Designer and Artist, Classical serenity in a Troubled Age: Dora Gordine's Commissions During The 1940's, Philip Wilson (London 2009), {{ISBN|0-85667-644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each portrait head had its own patina according to Gordine's vision of her sitter. When interviewed by the [[BBC]] in 1972 Gordine commented that, ''"when you do portrait busts of somebody you do their noses and mouth – but it is nothing. You have to imagine what they are like inside and bring out their inner feeling and then put it in a form"''.&lt;ref&gt;1972 BBC interview subsequently partly repeated in February 2009 on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Gordine’s career was brought to a halt. She no longer had access to Valsuani’s in Paris, her favourite foundry, and bronze quickly became rationed. All foundries in Britain were ordered stop all non-essential activity and concentrate on war production. It was not until late 1943 or early 1944 that she found a new foundry and was able to have some of her latest bronze work exhibited in the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;D. Gordine to Sir S. Cockerell, 7 October 1945, Cockerell Papers, BL, London.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s/50s Gordine's work was exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the Society of Portrait Sculptors and elsewhere. In October 1945 she had a solo exhibition at the [[Leicester Galleries]], in which [[The Times]] described her as having ‘much ability, though she is eclectic in her inspiration, being influenced by works from many schools and periods - Indian and Egyptian among others. Her best works are her portrait heads in bronze which are convincing and straightforward.’&lt;ref&gt;Times, 6 November 1945, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Bronzes from this time have ironic or humorous titles, relating to the pose, such as 'Great Expectations' or 'Mischief' and, of an RAF Officer, 'Above Cloud'. She was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]] in 1949. She occasionally did exotic or erotic pieces (e.g. for Elizabeth Choy). She travelled and lectured in [[United States|America]], working in Hollywood, art lecturing and designing film sets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Alicia|title=Tate Women Artists|year=2004|publisher=Tate Publishing|location=London|isbn=1-85437-311-0|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947 and revisited the USA in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jonathan Black, sculptor, artist, Designer: Sculptor, Designer and Artist, Philip Wilson (London 2009), {{ISBN|0-85667-644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 she was commissioned to produce a sculpture to stand in the new mother and baby unit at [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]] in north London. 'Happy Baby' was largely forgotten by 2009 languishing in an administration block at the prison for many years. Now regarded as an important piece in 'La Gordine's' professional history it formed the centre piece of an exhibition of her work at [[Kingston University]] in February–March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston University Press Office: Jailbreak Baby Goes On the Run from Holloway&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 [[Esso]] commissioned a 7' x 5' low-relief  'Power' for their new [[Milford Haven Refinery]], which was unveiled by the Duke of Edinburgh. Gordine's last public commission, the 8' long 'Mother and Child' was made for the entrance hall of the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]], Surrey, in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Professor R.Y. Goodden to J. Samson, 5 May 1960, Archives, DHM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Widowhood and Death==
Her husband's sudden death in 1966 from a heart attack left Gordine to live out her life alone in Dorich House. She had no children. As Gordine’s client base became smaller and health problems undermined her ability to work to the standard she had during the 1920s, her eyesight deteriorated and she had arthritis in her shoulders and arms causing her career to end in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Balfour, 'Dora Gordine', Independent, 7 January 1992, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; She had a great interest in her garden and, in particular, herbs and plants used for medicinal purposes, such as Tansy. [[Adrian Howells|Adrian Howes]] and [[Robert Ruthven]] were her part-time gardeners for nearly two years in the mid-seventies. She often invited the members of the [[Royal Ballet School]] to Dorich house to pose for her. She died in Dorich House in December 1991, aged around 96.

In subsequent years her work was to be revived by major exhibitions in London in 2006 at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in the [[London Jewish Museum of Art]], and in 2009 at Dorich House and [[Kingston University]].

==Dorich House==
Dorich House was designed by Gordine and completed in 1936. The name chosen for the house was a [[portmanteau]] of Dora and Richard's names. The house is spread across three floors; the ground and first floors devoted to the production and display of Gordine's work, with the upper floor forming the couple's private apartment. In 1994, it was acquired by Kingston University and was refurbished and formally opened as a museum in 1996, housing Gordine's collection of bronze and plaster sculptures and many of her paintings and drawings. There are also items from Hare's Imperial Russian art collection, which includes icons, paintings, ceramics, glassware, metalwork, folk art and furniture dating from the early 18th century to the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|publisher=Dorich House Museum|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122005604/http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''''Echinopsis lageniformis''''' (syn. '''''Trichocereus bridgesii'''''), the '''Bolivian torch cactus''', is a fast-growing columnar [[cactus]] from the high deserts of [[Bolivia]]. 
Among the indigenous populations of Bolivia, it is sometimes called ''achuma'' or ''wachuma'', although these names are also applied to related species such as ''[[Echinopsis pachanoi]]'' which are also used for their [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] effects.&lt;ref name="journalflora"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madsen|first=Jens|title=5. Echinopsis Zucc.|journal=Flora of Ecuador|publisher=Gunnar Harling &amp; Lennart Andersson|issue=35|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The plant has a light green to bluish color and usually has four to eight ribs. It can grow 2–5 m tall with stems of up to 15–20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. Spines can range in coloration from honey-coloured to brown, and are located on the nodes in groups of up to four. These spines can grow up to 6–7&amp;nbsp;cm in length and in fully grown plants are spaced evenly on the ribs, 2.5 to 3&amp;nbsp;cm apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrero-Ducloux|first=Enrique|title=Datos quimicos sobre el Echinopsis eyriesii|journal=Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas Universidad Nacional de La Plata|volume=2|issue=6|pages=43–49|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:T bridgesii flower 05 JPG.jpg|thumb|left|200 pxl|''Echinopsis lageniformis'' flowers]] --&gt;

==Cultivars==
Several varieties of this species are highly prized by ornamental cactus collectors. These include a [[Fasciation|cristate]] variety, two variants of [[:wikt:monstrose|monstrose]] growth, and a more recently developed clone that exhibits both monstrose and cristate growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowley|first=Gordon|title=Reunion of the Genus Echinopsis|publisher=Crown Publishing|location=New York|year=1978|volume=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Succulents|isbn=0-517-53309-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These all tend to be much slower growing than the standard form of the species, but owing to their highly unusual shapes, they are sought after by cactus collectors.

The [[:wikt:monstrose|monstrose]] form of ''Echinopsis lageniformis'' is known as the '''penis plant''' or '''penis cactus'''. Contrary to the typical columnar habit of the species, this [[cultivar]] displays short stem sections that branch avidly, forming a low spiny bush. The upper part of each stem segment is smooth and spineless, resembling a [[penis]]. The lower part is [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spiny]] and shows a tendency to form ribs. The plant is light green.  The [[German language|German]] name for this cultivar, ''frauenglück,'' more [[Euphemism|euphemistic]] than its [[English language|English]] equivalent, translates as "women's joy."

==Psychoactivity==
The plant contains a number of [[psychoactive]] [[alkaloids]], in particular the well-studied chemical [[mescaline]] typically at levels several times lower than ''Echinopsis pachanoi'': it was reported 0.56% dry weight mescaline content for ''E. lageniformis'', while up to 5% for ''E. pachanoi.'' The concentrations for specimens from various locations vary considerably and ''E. lageniformis'' may sometimes contain higher mescaline content than ''E. pachanoi'' although that 0.56% concentration was the highest reported in any research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogunbodede|first=Olabode|last2=McCombs|first2=Douglas|last3=Trout|first3=Keeper|last4=Daley|first4=Paul|last5=Terry|first5=Martin|date=2010-09-15|title=New mescaline concentrations from 14 taxa/cultivars of Echinopsis spp. (Cactaceae) ("San Pedro") and their relevance to shamanic practice|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874110004836|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=131|issue=2|pages=356–362|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2010.07.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical analysis of some variants of this species have shown it may include some of the most potent of the psychedelic ''Trichocereus'' species,&lt;ref name="journalflora" /&gt; although this is not conclusive nor does it apply to all strains of the species. Outside of its native habitat, it is one of the least known and used of the ''Trichocereus'' cacti for either its psychoactive or ornamental uses. This is not true in areas where it is the dominant species, for example, the [[La Paz]] area of [[Bolivia]].

As with related species, it seems to have long [[shamanism|shamanic]] tradition of use throughout its native habitat.

&lt;!--- Attention editors! the long version of the penis plant is clone A. the short version is clone B. Do not change it, they are currently correct and the taxonomy is confusing enough as it is. Sacred Succulents was the first nursery to give these plants the a and b tags- check their website for correct info. --&gt;

The '''European Congress of Ethnic Religions''' ('''ECER''') is an organisation for cooperation among associations that promote the [[ethnic religion]]s of [[Europe]] &lt;ref&gt;"By Ethnic Religion, we mean religion, spirituality, and cosmology that is firmly grounded in a particular people's traditions. In our view, this does not include modern occult or ariosophic theories/ideologies, nor syncretic neo-religions.
[...]The World Congress of Ethnic Religions was established in June 1998 at the initiative of delegates from 16 different countries (Europe, Asia and America). This happened in Vilnius, Lithuania, the last European country to resist the onslaught of Christianity." [http://ecer-org.eu/about/ About ECER].&lt;/ref&gt;
The primary goal of the ECER is the strengthening of pre-Christian ethnic religious traditions of Europe, emphasizing and fostering their ties with [[Neopagan]] movements with ethnic focuses which developed during the 1980s to 1990s.

==History==

===As WCER===
The first "World Pagan Congress" was hosted in June 1998 in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]], organized by [[Jonas Trinkunas]], the founder of [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a Lithuanian neopagan organization. The renaming from "Pagan" to "Ethnic" was the result of a day-long passionate debate.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Strmiska, ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives'', 2005 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qx7Tvd99xVAC&amp;pg=PA276  p. 276].&lt;/ref&gt;
The congress was held under the name "World Congress of Ethnic Religions" during 1999 to 2010.  The 2006 and 2009 conferences were held in [[India]], in the spirit of  collaboration between western Neopaganism and [[Hinduism]].

===As ECER===
The intention of a worldwide scope was "more of a dream than reality", as the congress mostly consisted of representatives of neopagan movements in Europe. To reflect this, the organization was renamed "European Congress of Ethnic Religions" in 2010, acting on a suggestion by Trinkunas.&lt;ref&gt;
"voglio rivalutare e ridefinire il termine con cui ci riferiamo a noi stessi. Mi riferisco a WCER – World Congress of Ethnic Religions (Congresso Mondiale delle Religioni Etniche). C’è una parola che suggerisco di discutere: il cambio del termine ‘mondiale’ con ‘europeo’. Perciò il nome dell’associazione cambierebbe in ECER – European Congress of Ethnic Religions (Congresso europeo delle Religioni Etniche)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member organisations==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2660">'''Flaxman Low''' is a fictional character created by British authors [[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]] and his mother Kate O'Brien Ryall Prichard, published  under the pseudonyms "H. Heron" and "E. Heron". Low is credited with being the first [[psychic detective]] of fiction, and appears in a series of short stories.

==Description==
Flaxman Low is a pseudonym for “one of the leading scientists of the” Victorian era, whose real name is not disclosed in the stories. He was an accomplished athlete in his youth and has turned his interests to a scientific study of the occult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0605811.txt Flaxman Low, Occult Psychologist, Collected Stories in Project Gutenberg Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
From 1898-1899 press baron [[Cyril Arthur Pearson]] published six Flaxman Low stories in his monthly ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', though the authors were disconcerted to find the tales promoted by Pearson as "real".&lt;ref name="Parker_p36-42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Eric|title=Hesketh Prichard|pages=36&amp;ndash;42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collected work was published as ''The Experiences of Flaxman Low'' in 1899.

The stories are as follows:
* The Story of the Spaniards, Hammersmith (1898)
* The Story of Medhans Lea (1898)
* The Story of the Moor Road (1898)
* The Story of Baelbrow (1898)
* The Story of Yand Manor House (1898)
* The Story of the Grey House (1899)
* Ghosts: Being the Experiences of Flaxman Low (1899)
* The Story of Saddler's Croft (1899)
* The Story of Sevens Hall (1899)
* The Story of No. 1 Karma Crescent (1899)
* The Story of Konnor Old House (1899)
* The Story of Crowsedge (1899)
* The Story of Mr Flaxman Low (1899)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?25426 Flaxman Low in The Internet Speculative Fiction Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

===By other authors===
"The Improbable Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" (2009) includes a short story by author Barbara Roden, "The Things That Shall Come Upon Them" which teams up Flaxman Low with Sherlock Holmes who together investigate a haunted house mystery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnjosephadams.com/sherlock-holmes/author-interviews-2/barbara-roden-author-of-the-things-that-shall-come-upon-them/ Interview with BARBARA RODEN, AUTHOR OF “THE THINGS THAT SHALL COME UPON THEM”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of one Gautam Rajput family, from [[Nagar, Uttar Pradesh|Nagar]], the decision by the British [[East India Company]] to dispossess them in favour of another landholder was the cause of them joining in the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=1857: Need for Alternative Sources |first=Pankaj |last=Rag |journal=Social Scientist |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=113–147 |doi=10.2307/3517585 |jstor=3517585 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that rebellion, some Gautam communities, in common with other groups that once held high status and power, were practitioners of [[female infanticide]]. This was in part a result of British policies that led to declining socio-economic fortunes and thus a reduction in their ability to construct favourable marriage alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colonialism as Civilizing Mission: Cultural Ideology in British India |editor1-first=Harald |editor1-last=Fischer-Tiné |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Mann |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-84331-363-2 |pages=126–128 |first=Malavika |last=Kasturi |chapter=Taming the 'Dangerous' Rajput; Family, Marriage and Female Infanticide in Nineteenth-Century Colonial North India |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bMh8CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, some Gautam Rajputs, who also refer to themselves as ''Gautam Thakurs'', are Muslim and others are Hindus. However, their social and religious customs blur the lines that might usually be expected to exist between different religious communities in India. Indeed, their common identity as Rajputs often over-rides their differences in religion and they can be found participating in each other's customs and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20020715/living.shtml |title=Mixed Strains |publisher=India Today |first= Subhash |last=Mishra |date=2002-07-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034445/http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20020715/living.shtml |archivedate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''halaqa''' ({{lang-ar|حلقة}} - 'circle / ring') in [[Islamic terminology]] is a religious gathering or meeting for the study of [[Islam]] and the [[Quran]]. Generally, there are one or more primary speakers that present the designated topic(s) of the halaqa while others sit around them (in an approximate circle) and listen. The attendees may participate in the discussions, ask questions, and voice concerns. Usually, prayers and supplications are part of such programs. Also, meals or snacks may be served to the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sfbasic.org/site/halaqas/index.php |title = The Islamic Halaqas Program |publisher = SF*BASIC |year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] is a minority religion in [[Mexico]]. According to the 2010 census conducted by the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía|National Institute of Statistics and Geography]] (INEGI), there were 3,762 individuals that identified Islam as their religion.&lt;ref name="2010-census"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/TabuladosBasicos/Default.aspx?c=27302&amp;s=est |title=Censo de Población y Vivienda 2010 — Cuestionario básico  |author=Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía|year=2010 |work= |publisher=INEGI |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority are [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] and a minority are [[Shia Islam|Shiite]]s or [[Ahmadiyya]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqOQBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KIlaHfaOMw&amp;sig=cj_z-PGuMFIKxTUD94fXL0MfPkM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U6hWVIyZG8Xg7QaPyoHACw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Routledge Handbook of Islam in the West | page=157 | accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/islam-en-el-mexico-contemporaneo/id704090699?mt=11|author= Fitra Ismu Kusumo | title=Islam en el Mexico Contemporaneo | page= | accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most Mexican Islamic organizations focus on grassroots missionary activities which are most effective at the community level.

The ''Centro Cultural Islámico de México'' (CCIM), a [[Sunni]] organization headed by Omar Weston, a [[United Kingdom|British]] born Mexican convert to Islam, has been active in several big cities in northern and central Mexico. In the state of [[Morelos]], the CCIM built a prayer hall and centre for recreation, learning and conferences, called Dar as Salaam, which also operates Hotel Oasis, a hotel that offers [[halal]] holidays for Muslim travellers and accommodation for non-Muslims sympathetic to Islam. This group was the subject of a study carried out by British anthropologist Mark Lindley-Highfield of the Department of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. Apart from CCIM there is a branch of the [[Nur Ashki Jerrahi Sufi Order|Nur Ashki Jerrahi]] [[Sufi]] Order in Mexico City which is often at odds with the traditionalist Muslim community and is headed by two women, Shaykha Fatima Fariha and Shaykha Amina Teslima. There is also a small [[Salafi]] organization (the Centro Salafi de México) led by Muhammad Abdullah Ruiz (a former deputy to Weston) and an educational centre managed mainly by Muslims from Egypt and the Middle East, el "Centro Educativo de la Comunidad Musulmana en México" (run by Said Louahabi),and centro al hikmah run by Isa Rojas a Mexican convert to Islam, who studied Islamic studies in the University of Medina), within the capital city.

==Demographics==
Islam is reportedly growing from a rise in conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-02-13/mexican-catholics-find-god-islam|title=

The first Christian churches built during the Mexican colonial period, express forms of influence by [[Mudejar]] architecture, which is a post-Moorish, Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] architecture and decoration style that was strongly influenced by Iberian Moorish achitecture and artworks in the High Middle Ages.

In [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas]], a fountain, known locally as "La Corona" or " La Pila " was built to provide the population with water. This architectural work was built in annealed brick with a strong [[Mudejar]] influence. It was built by the Spanish Dominican friars during the Colonial era in the sixteenth century.

The [[Morisco Kiosk]] (Moorish Kiosk) in [[Colonia Santa María la Ribera]] was made by Mr. José Ramón Ibarrola for the Universal Exhibition of New Orleans from 1884-1885, in the neo-Mudejar style that was prevailing in Spain in the 19th century.

{{Sikhism sidebar}}

'''Jathedar''' ({{lang-pa| ਜਥੇਦਾਰ }}), refers to a leader of a [[Jatha]] (a group, a community or a nation).  Among the [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], a Jathedar is an ordained leader of the clergy and leads a [[Takht (Sikhism)|Takht]], a sacred and authoritative seat.

[[Sikh]] clergy consists of five ''Jathedars'', one each from five [[Takht (Sikhism)|takhts]] or sacred seats. The Jathedar of Akal Takht makes all the important decisions after consultations with the Jathedars of the other four Takhts. The highest seat of the Sikh nation is called [[Akal Takht]].

==History==
During the [[18th century]], ''Jathedars'' of [[Takht (Sikhism)|Takhts]] were appointed by the [[Sarbat Khalsa]], a biannual [[Mass meeting|deliberative assembly]] of Sikhs held at [[Amritsar]] in [[Punjab region|Panjab]].

From 1921, ''Jathedars'' of Takhts have been appointed by [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC), an elected body of the Sikhs controlled by [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] (SAD), a political party in the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and an ally of [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP). 

In November 2015, the [[Sikhs]] appointed four interim ''Jathedars'' through the traditional [[Sarbat Khalsa]] at Chabba village on the outskirts of [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab, India|Panjab]]. Some 100,000 &lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{cite news|title=What sounds like a religious schism in Punjab could be a cry for better political leadership|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21679234-what-sounds-religious-schism-punjab-could-be-cry-better-political-leadership-seeking|access-date=15 October 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 500,000 [[Sikh diaspora|Sikhs]] attended the event from around the world. A few [[Sikh]] organizations did not attend and refused to recognize the resolutions of the event. The congregation of [[Sarbat Khalsa|Sarbat Khalsa 2015]] dismissed the SGPC ''Jathedars'' and appointed interim ''Jathedars'' for [[Akal Takht]], [[Takht Sri Damdama Sahib|Damdama Sahib]] and [[Anandpur Sahib]].

'''Khirbet Tibnah''' (alternate spelling: '''Tibneh'''&lt;ref&gt;meaning "straw", Palmer, 1881, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp00conduoft#page/246/mode/1up 246]&lt;/ref&gt;), is located  on the [[West Bank]], between  the villages [[Deir Nidham]] and [[Nabi Salih]].

==History==
According to [[Emil Schürer|Schürer]], Thamna ({{lang-gr|Θαμνά}}) – a city within the district of Diospolis (=[[Lydda]]) and which served once as a toparchy (administrative city) during the [[Roman period]], is to be identified with the biblical city of Timnath-serah, but which is now the ruin Tibnah (Tibneh) in Samaria.&lt;ref&gt;Schürer, 1891, p. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah63dw;view=1up;seq=172 158], note 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1596, the Tibnah (''Tibya'') site was listed as village in the ''[[nahiya]]'' ''[[Al-Quds|Quds]]'', in the administrative district ''[[Sanjak|Liwā`]]'' of Jerusalem, in a [[daftar|tax ledger]] of the "countries of Syria" (''wilāyat aš-Šām'') and which lands were then under [[ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. During that year, Tibna was inhabited by 20 family heads, all [[Muslim]], although the same village ceased to be inhabited in the late mandatory period. The Ottoman authority levied a 33.3% taxation on agricultural products produced by the villagers (primarily on wheat, barley, and olives), besides a marriage tax and supplement tax on goats and beehives. Total revenues accruing from the village of Tibna  for that year amounted to 3700 ''[[akçe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

''Khirbet Tibnah'' is described in 19th century sources as a  [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] overlooking a deep valley (Wady Reiya) on the north and the ancient Roman road to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener,  1882, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp02conduoft#page/374/mode/1up 374]&lt;/ref&gt; A cemetery was situated on a flat hill nearby, and to the  northwest, the spring of ''Ein Tibnah'' emerged from a  rocky channel. On the southwest was an oak tree some 30 or 40 feet high, and two wells, one of them dry. West of the tree were  traces of ruins believed to be those of an Arab village.

[[Charles William Wilson]], who traveled through Palestine in 1866, reported a cemetery containing nine tombs  south of the town, which was once capital of the surrounding district: One of these tombs was large, with a portico supported on piers of rock with very simple capitals. One of the piers was apparently destroyed between 1866 and 1873. There were niches for over 200 lamps at the tomb entrance. Inside was a chamber with fourteen graves, or kok'im, with a passage leading into an inner chamber containing one grave. He also wrote about a 40 foot high oak tree near the tomb, known as Sheikh et Teim, and a village about 3 miles to the east, called [[Kefr Ishu'a]], or Joshua's Village.

The '''{{nihongo|Kumano Kodō|熊野古道}}''' is a series of ancient [[pilgrimage]] routes that crisscross the [[Kii Peninsula|Kii Hantō]], the largest Peninsula of [[Japan]]. These sacred trails were and are used for the pilgrimage to the sacred site "[[Kumano Sanzan]]" (熊野三山) or the Three Grand Shrines of Kumano: [[Kumano Hongū Taisha]] (熊野本宮大社), [[Kumano Nachi Taisha]] (熊野那智大社) and [[Kumano Hayatama Taisha]] (熊野速玉大社). 

The Kumano Kodō pilgrimage routes that lead to Kumano can be categorized into three sub-routes: Kiji, Kohechi and Iseji. The Kumano Kodō and Kumano Sanzan, along with Koyasan and Yoshino and Omine, were registered as [[World Heritage]] sites on July 7, 2004 as the "[[Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UNESCO | title = Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range
| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1142 | accessdate = 2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kiji route==
The "Kiji" route runs along the west coast of the peninsula to the city of [[Tanabe, Wakayama|Tanabe]] where it forks into two: Nakahechi and Ohechi. The Nakahechi route leads into the rugged interior mountains toward Kumano Hongū Taisha and the Ohechi continues south along the coast. The Nakahechi route was the most popular for pilgrimages from Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan. The earliest records of this route dates from the early 10th century. The trail has a long history of use by people with diverse belief backgrounds leading to mixed religious symbolism overlaid and incorporated into the setting and stages of the pilgrimage itself. 

The UNESCO World Heritage registered section begins at Takijiri-oji which is considered to be the point of entry to the sacred area of Kumano. From here it is about 40&amp;nbsp;km of mountainous trail before one reaches the mystical Kumano Hongū Taisha. Most pilgrimages break the journey into a two-day walk. The Chikatsuyu-oji is about halfway and most pilgrims stay the night here at a [[Ryokan (inn)#Minshuku|minshuku]].

In [[Hongū, Wakayama|Hongū]], pilgrims often did purification rites in Yunomine [[Onsen]] (Yunomine hot spring). Tsuboyu is a small cabin on the creek that runs through this isolated village, featuring a small rocky bath that is the only World Heritage hot spring open to visitors. The bath was used for purification rites and its legendary healing effects.

The Kumano Kodō Dainichi-goe route links Kumano Hongū Taisha with Yunomine. It is 2&amp;nbsp;km long and is a steep climb, and descends over a small pass.

From [[Kumano Hongū Taisha]] most pilgrims went by boat on the Kumano River to [[Kumano Hayatama Taisha]] in the coastal town of [[Shingū, Wakayama|Shingū]]. This 40&amp;nbsp;km section of the Kumano Kodō is the only river pilgrimage route that is registered as a World Heritage site. There is an overland route that links Kumano Hongū Taisha with [[Kumano Nachi Taisha]]. Most pilgrims take two days to complete this walk staying in the small town of Koguchi. The section between Hongū and Koguchi is called the Kogumotori-goe and the section between Koguchi and Kumano Nachi Taisha is called Ogumotori-goe.

==Kohechi route==
The "Kohechi" route links Koyasan to the Kumano Sanzan. It runs north to south and is 70&amp;nbsp;km long. It is the shortest route connecting Koyasan to Kumano but is a tough walk that traverses three passes of over 1,000 meters.

==Iseji route==
The "Iseji" route links [[Ise Grand Shrine]] with the Kumano Sanzan. It was not until the 17th century that this route became part of the Saikogu pilgrimage, the first temple being [[Seiganto-ji]], which is closely related with the Kumano Nachi Taisha.

The "Magose Toge" forms the boundary between [[Miyama, Kyoto]] and [[Owase, Mie]]. A moss-covered stone path stretches about 2&amp;nbsp;km into the beautiful cypress forest covered with ferns. This route leads to Tengura-san with a huge stone at the tip. There is a small tunnel below the stone one can enter. From the stone, there is a scenic view of Owase City. Magose-koen Park on the way down the pass is renowned for its cherry blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;Revival of the Ancient Pilgrimage Road&lt;/ref&gt;

It's a new rite because it uses the red liturgical colour by [[Palm Sunday]].]]

A '''Latin Mass''' is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]].

== Tridentine Mass in Latin ==
The term "Latin Mass" is frequently used to denote the [[Tridentine Mass]], that is, the [[Roman Rite|Roman Rite]] liturgy of the Mass celebrated in Latin and in accordance with the successive editions of the [[Roman Missal]] published between 1570 and 1962.

In most countries, the Tridentine Mass was celebrated only in Latin. However, there are exceptions. In early seventeenth-century China, Jesuit missionaries secured permission from Pope Paul V to celebrate the Catholic Mass in Chinese, part of an effort to adapt their work to Chinese cultural norms and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World of Catholic Renewal, 1540-1770|last=Hsia|first=Ronnie Po-Chia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=0521445965|location=New York|pages=210-211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dalmatia]] and parts of [[Istria]], the liturgy was celebrated in [[Church Slavonic]], and authorization for use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935.&lt;ref name="CED"&gt;{{cite web|last= Krmpotic|first= M.D. |title=Dalmatia|year=1908 |accessdate=19 June 2014|publisher= [[Catholic encyclopedia]]|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04606b.htm|quote= The right to use the [[Glagolitic]] {{sic}} language at Mass with the Roman Rite has prevailed for many centuries in all the south-western Balkan countries, and has been sanctioned by long practice and by many popes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRD"&gt;{{cite web|last= Japundžić|first= Marko |title=The Croatian Glagolitic Heritage|year=1997 |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |publisher= Croatian Academy of America|url= http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/japun.html |quote= In 1886 it arrived to the [[Principality of Montenegro]], followed by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1914, and the [[Republic of Czechoslovakia]] in 1920, but only for [[feast days]] of the main [[patron saint]]s. The 1935 concordat with the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] anticipated the introduction of the Slavic liturgy for all Croatian regions and throughout the entire state.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, "Tridentine Mass" was not synonymous with "Latin Mass". 

A further distancing between the concepts of "Tridentine Mass" and "Latin Mass" was brought about by the 1964 Instruction on implementing the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium|Constitution on Sacred Liturgy]] of the [[Second Vatican Council]], which laid down that "normally the epistle and gospel from the Mass of the day shall be read in the [[vernacular]]". [[Episcopal conference]]s were to decide, with the consent of the Holy See, what other parts, if any, of the Mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular.&lt;ref name="EWTN"&gt;{{Cite web | title = ''Inter Oecumenici, Sacred Congregation of Rites | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWINOEC.HTM | accessdate = 2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permissions were thus granted from 1967 onwards to celebrate most of the Tridentine Mass in vernacular languages, including the [[Canon of the Mass|Canon]].

== Roman Rite Mass in Latin ==
Neither the [[Second Vatican Council]] nor the subsequent [[Mass of Paul VI|revision]] of the [[Roman Missal]] abolished Latin as the liturgical language of the Roman Rite: the official text of the Roman Missal, on which translations into vernacular languages are to be based, continues to be in Latin, and Latin can still be used in the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Except in the case of celebrations of the Mass that are scheduled by the ecclesiastical authorities to take place in the language of the people, Priests are always and everywhere permitted to celebrate Mass in Latin | url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html | title = Redemptionis sacramentum | place = Rome, [[Italy|IT]] | publisher = The Vatican | at = 112}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Latin Mass" is sometimes applied to such celebrations, which in some places are part of the normal Sunday schedule.

== Other forms of Mass in Latin ==

Historically speaking, "Latin Mass" can be applied also to the various forms of [[Pre-Tridentine Mass]] from about the year 190 of [[Pope Victor I|Pope Victor]], when the Church in Rome changed from [[Greek language|Greek]] to Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Christianity | first = The Rev. Sidney | last = Spencer | date = 2013-03-05 | url =  http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-67437 | type = encyclopaedia | title = Britannica | edition = online | accessdate = 2014-01-27 | subscription = yes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latin liturgical rites]] other than the Roman Rite have used Latin, and in some cases continue to do so. These include the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]]. Some priests and communities continue to use non-Roman-Rite liturgies that have been generally abandoned, such as the [[Carmelite Rite]] and the [[Dominican Rite]], celebrating them in Latin. Celebration in Latin of such rites is sometimes referred to as "Latin Mass".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = Italian | url = http://www.parrocchie.it/milano/smcaravaggio/ | publisher = Parish of Santa Maria di Caravaggio | place = [[Milan]], IT | title = Messa latina: la santa Messa in latino secondo il rito Ambrosiano Antico |trans-title=Latin Mass: Holy Mass in Latin in accordance with the Ancient Ambrosian Rite}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==

A [[Traditionalist Catholic]] periodical in the United States is entitled ''[[Latin Mass Magazine|The Latin Mass]], the Journal of Catholic Culture and Tradition''.

Various editions of the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]] have been translated into Latin: for example, for use in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (''Liber Precum Publicarum'' of Walther Haddon, 1560). The Church of the Advent of Christ the King, an [[Anglo-Catholic]] parish in [[San Francisco]], regularly celebrates Mass according to the 1979 Prayer Book of its province, the [[Episcopal Church USA|Episcopal Church]], in Latin.

'''Leviticus 18''' is the eighteenth chapter of the [[Book of Leviticus]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] or the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Christian]] [[Bible]]. It narrates part of the instructions which, according to the Bible, were given to [[Moses]] by God on [[biblical Mount Sinai]]. The chapter deals with a number of sexual activities considered unclean or [[Abomination (Bible)|abominable]]. Although the chapter is principally concerned with [[incest]], it also contains laws related to [[bestiality]] and "lying with a man as with a woman." This single reference in verse 22 has, in recent years, been a focus of debate among Christians and Jews regarding [[homosexual]] activity (see [[Homosexuality and Christianity]] and [[Jewish views of homosexuality]]).{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Leviticus 18 is generally regarded as part of the [[Holiness Code]] of Leviticus 11–26, and its sexual prohibitions are largely paralleled by Leviticus 20 (except that chapter has more emphasis on punishment).

== Text ==
The original text of Leviticus 18, like that of most of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was written in Hebrew. The oldest extant versions of the text in Hebrew are found in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], and the [[Masoretic Text]]. An ancient Greek translation from the third century BCE, the [[Septuagint]], also exists. Since the addition of chapter divisions in the thirteenth century CE, this [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|chapter]] is divided into 30 verses.

The chapter begins with God speaking to Moses (verse 1) and giving him a message for the Israelites (2), warning them to keep God's laws rather than Canaanite or Egyptian practices (3–5). Then follows a list of people with whom sex is forbidden to do family relationships (6–19). Verse 20 prohibits sexual relations with a neighbor's wife, and 21 prohibits passing one's children through a fire to [[Moloch]]. 22 is the famous verse about "lying with a man," discussed below, while 23 forbids bestiality. The final verses (24–30) warn that breaking these laws will produce defilement, and that the [[Canaanites]] are about to be displaced from the land of [[Canaan]] as a result of following these practices, and warn of  a similar fate for the Israelites if they fall into these practices.

==Incest==
{{Main|Incest in the Bible}}

The Bible lists several types of relationship which it regards as incestuous unions; one list appears in the [[Deuteronomic Code]], and two lists occur in the [[Holiness Code]] of [[Leviticus]]. These lists only mention relationships with female relatives; excluding [[lesbianism]], which implies that the list is addressed to men. These lists then compare as follows: 

(blue = forbidden for men only, pink = forbidden for women only, purple = forbidden for both men and women):

|}

One feature of all the lists is that sexual activity between a man and his own daughter is not explicitly forbidden. The [[Talmud]] argues that this is because the prohibition was ''obvious'', especially given the proscription against a relationship with a granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Yebamot 3a&lt;/ref&gt;  The shortness of the list in Leviticus 20, and especially of that in Deuteronomy, are explained by classical Jewish scholarship as being due to the ''obviousness'' of the missing prohibitions.&lt;ref name="JewEncInce"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', s.v. ''Incest''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel ben Meir]], ''Commentary'', ad loc.&lt;/ref&gt; Note also that the explicit prohibition against engaging in sexual activity with "both a woman and her daughter",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:17|}}&lt;/ref&gt; implicitly forbids sexual activity between a man and his daughter. Some [[biblical criticism|biblical scholars]] have instead proposed that it was originally in the list, but was then accidentally left out from the copy on which modern versions of the text ultimately depend, due to a mistake by the scribe.&lt;ref name="EncBibChoice"&gt;Cheyne and Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica, ''Marriage : choice of bride''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the questionable case of a man marrying his daughter, the list in Leviticus 18 roughly produces the same rules as were followed in early [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabic]] culture.&lt;ref name="JewEncInce" /&gt; However, most tribal nations also disliked [[exogamy|exogamous]] marriage—marriage to completely unrelated people.&lt;ref name="JewEncInce" /&gt; In several prominent cases in the Torah, the incest rules are ignored in favour of marriage to a close relative; [[Jacob]] is described as having married his first wife's sister,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:16|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:23|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:28|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham]] as having a father in common with [[Sarah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|20:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rather than a mother, which would have been permitted by the list). These are not seen as illegal marriages as the incest laws were not given until Moses.

==Homosexuality==
{{details|The Bible and homosexuality|Biblical law in Christianity}}

The text of 18:22:
{{quote|
"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination." [[King James Version]]

"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."  [[Revised Standard Version]] and [[English Standard Version]]

"Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman: that is detestable". [[Contemporary English Version]]}}

The Hebrew wording of Leviticus 18:22 has been generally interpreted as prohibiting some or all [[Gay sexual practices|homosexual acts]], although which precise acts, and in which situations, is a matter of ongoing scholarly debate.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of some of the scholarly views on the question, see Walsh, Jerome T. "Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13: Who Is Doing What to Whom?" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', vol. 120, no. 2, 2001, pp. 201–209. {{jstor|3268292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg 1988:191, Wenham 1979:259, Kahn 1984:49&lt;/ref&gt; state that verse 22 condemns "[[homosexuality]]" or "homosexual relations" and other authors maintaining that it condemns only males penetrating males ([[Anal sex|anal intercourse]]).&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 54a and b; Josephus, Against Apion 2.199; and Philo, Abraham 135.  Some modern authors stating this view include Alter 2004:623, 632; Boyarin 1995:339, 343; Brooten 1996:61; Cohen 1990:6; Daube 1986:447; Milgrom 2000:1568; Olyan 1994:185; Thurston 1990:16; and Walsh 2001:208.&lt;/ref&gt; The Talmud maintains the law prohibits all male homosexual activity including [[pederasty]]. Since the practice is allotted the death penalty for both the active and the passive partners in Leviticus 20&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0320.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the law appears to have only applied when both participants were men above the age of majority, which is set at 20 years old in the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0327.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lesbian]]ism is not explicitly prohibited in the Torah; however, the rabbi and Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] ruled in the twelfth century that lesbianism was prohibited nonetheless and deserving of punishment by beating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/homosexuality-and-halakhah/ |title=Homosexuality and Halakhah (Jewish Law)|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=2017-03-02 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passing grade 10 in 1947, Bawa went on to get a [[Master of Arts|Master of Art]] degree in history. Bawa expressed interested in art and travelling from a young age.

The '''Missionary Church of Kopimism''' (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''Missionerande Kopimistsamfundet''), is a congregation of [[file sharing|file sharers]] who believe that copying information is a sacred virtue&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="await" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CITROME" /&gt; and was founded by Isak Gerson,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; a 19-year-old philosophy student,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinnreich|first=Aram|date=2016-04-02|title=Sharing in spirit: Kopimism and the digital Eucharist|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1036766|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=4|pages=504–517|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1036766|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gustav Nipe in [[Uppsala, Sweden]] in the autumn of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kopimistsamfundetus.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/press-release-from-the-church-of-kopimism/|title=Press Release from the Church of Kopimism|date=2012-01-09|website=First United Church of Kopimism, US|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church, based in Sweden, has been officially recognized by the [[Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency]] as a religious community in January 2012, after three application attempts.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernesto"/&gt;

Gerson has denied any connection between the Church and filesharing site [[The Pirate Bay]],&lt;ref name="Privitera"&gt;{{cite web|last=Privitera|first=Salvatore|title=File-sharing as a religion, do we really need it?|url=http://pazuzu-uzu.blogspot.com/2012/01/file-sharing-as-religion-do-we-really.html|accessdate=29 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504031906/http://pazuzu-uzu.blogspot.com/2012/01/file-sharing-as-religion-do-we-really.html|archivedate=4 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but both groups are associated with the Swedish art and hacking collective [[Piratbyrån]].

== Name ==
The name Kopimism derives from the words ''copy'' and ''me'' which are the fundamental roots of the Church's beliefs and calls for an invitation to copy information. The work "Kopimi" first showed up on a pirate Agency Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kopimistsamfundetus.wordpress.com/about/|title=About|date=2012-01-09|newspaper=First United Church of Kopimism, US|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isak Gerson, one of the core founders saw something beautiful and theological in this concept of "copy me"&lt;ref&gt;Gerson I (2014a) Interview with Gerson. By Nilsson PE, Upssala, 7 May&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that the digital sharing of data is a fundamental act in our universe through the reproduction and copying of cells, DNA, and genes&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nilsson|first=Per-Erik|last2=Enkvist|first2=Victoria|date=2016-08-01|title=Techniques of religion-making in Sweden: The case of the Missionary Church of Kopimism|url=http://crr.sagepub.com/content/4/2/141|journal=Critical Research on Religion|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=141–155|doi=10.1177/2050303215613145|issn=2050-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the entirety of the internet is essentially for sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Nicholas A.|date=2013-03-01|title=Sharing and Web 2.0: The emergence of a keyword|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/15/2/167|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=167–182|doi=10.1177/1461444812450684|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerson has been credited with once saying, "The only thing we can do as Christians now, I suppose, is to do what Jesus tried doing – and do it better."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dagensseglora.se/2014/01/08/vi-har-ett-lofte-om-att-allting-ska-bli-battre/|title=Dagens Seglora - Vi har ett löfte om att allting ska bli bättre|last=Seglora|first=Dagens|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenets==
The followers of the religion are called ''Kopimists'' from ''copy me''.
A "Kopimist" or "Kopimist intellectual" is a person who has the philosophical belief that all information should be freely distributed and unrestricted. This philosophy opposes the monopolization of knowledge in all its forms, such as copyright, and encourages file sharing of all types of media including music, movies, TV shows, and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revolutimes.com/2012/01/06/sweden-recognizes-file-sharing-as-a-religion/ |title=Sweden Recognizes File Sharing as a Religion |date=4 January 2012 |first=Jenny |last=Worman |publisher=RevoluTimes |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the act of withholding and economizing information through copyright is against the sacredness of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Nicholas A.|last2=Sützl|first2=Wolfgang|date=2016-04-02|title=The rise of ‘sharing’ in communication and media studies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1115888|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=4|pages=437–441|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1115888|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its spiritual emphasis on copying as an ideal, Kopimism shares values with Chinese aesthetic traditions, in which "copying is valued not only as a learning tool (as it is in the West) but as artistically satisfying in its own right," a concept also called ''duplitecture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Thompson |first = Clive |title = Imitation Can Be the Sincerest Form of Innovation |newspaper = Wired |date = 27 February 2013 |url =https://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/02/clive-thompson-imitation/ | accessdate = 2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the church, "In our belief, communication is sacred."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; No belief in gods or supernatural phenomena apart from [[Kopimi]] itself is mentioned on their web site. ''[[Control-C|CTRL+C]]'' and ''[[Control-V|CTRL+V]]'', the common computer shortcut keys for "Copy" and "Paste," are considered sacred symbols. Some groups believe that [[Kopimi]] is considered to be a god,  and others believing it to be a sacred symbol and spirit residing within every living being.

The community also holds a religious service known as "kopyacting" in which information is distributed to the believers using photocopiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neethu|first=R|year=November 2013|title=My Religion: My ‘Copy’ ‘Right’|url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/24560|journal=Journal of Intellectual Property Rights|volume=18|pages=566–575|via=NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Kopimist constitution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kopimistsamfundet.org/main/kopimist-constitution |title=Kopimist Constitution |work=The First Church of Kopimism for the USA |year=2012 |accessdate=1 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513044913/http://www.kopimistsamfundet.org/main/kopimist-constitution |archivedate=13 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Copying of information is ethically right;
* Dissemination of information is ethically right;
* Copymixing is a sacred kind of copying, more so than the perfect, digital copying, because it expands and enhances the existing wealth of information;
* Copying or remixing information communicated by another person is seen as an act of respect and a strong expression of acceptance and Kopimistic faith;
* The Internet is holy (Not generally accepted by churches run by the Maesters);
* Code is law.

On January 5, 2012, Kopimism was accepted by Sweden as a legitimate religion with an estimated 4,000 members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The religion's association with illegal [[Legal aspects of file sharing|file sharing]] has been said not to be a sign that illegal file-sharing will be excused from Sweden's zero-tolerance approach to the controversial matter.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

== International locations ==
Kopimism has also taken root in multiple nations, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/05/09/kopimism-file-sharing/|title=Kopimism: File-Sharing Religion Takes Root in the U.S.|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|website=Mashable|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Canada
* Japan
* Israel
* United States of America (including in the state of Illinois in the United States where Kopimism has registered as a non profit 503(c) organization in the form of a church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=7ea7877c-6d27-4ee4-862a-344a93e38c73@sessionmgr4007&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=295687.20120209&amp;db=bwh|title=A Pirate Walks Into a Church: Kopimism and the Sacred Act of File-Sharing (...: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==First wedding==
On April 28, 2012, the Missionary Church of Kopimism held their first wedding.&lt;ref name="Wedding"/&gt; The wedding took place in [[Belgrade, Serbia]], between a [[Romanian people|Romanian]] woman and an [[Italian people|Italian]] man. The holy ceremony was conducted by a Kopimistic Op, wearing a [[Guy Fawkes mask]], while a computer read vows and some of Kopimism's central beliefs aloud.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/05/07/til-delete-do-us-part-first-couple-married-under-swedish-file-sharing-religion&lt;/ref&gt;

The church declared: "We are very happy today. Love is all about sharing. A married couple shares everything with each other. Hopefully, they will copy and remix some DNA-cells and create a new human being. That is the spirit of Kopimism. Feel the love and share that information. Copy all of its holiness."

Gerson, the missionary leader of the Church of Kopimism, attended as a witness during the wedding.

== Controversies ==
Both founders, Gerson and Nipe have had an extensive background in online activism and served as major players in the Swedish Anti-Piracy Movement&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrom F (2011) Han vill att fildelning ska klassas som religion. Uppsalatidningen, 8 April.&lt;/ref&gt; which caused many journalists and government officials in Sweden to speculate on the real goals of the creation of this organization.

There was severe backlash amongst the media and Christian journals in 2011 after the founders first submitted their application for registering as a religion as journalists condemned the Missionary Church of Kopimism as "a political adventure",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=De vill fildela i skydd av religionen|last=Zetterman|first=J|date=March 22, 2012|work=Dagen|access-date=|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a PR stunt",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=La˚t oss starta en religion!

'''Michael Holt''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. He is the second character to take up the '''[[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mister Terrific]]''' mantle.

[[Echo Kellum]] currently portrays a version of the character named Curtis Holt / Mister Terrific in the shared DC [[Arrowverse]] show ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]].''

==Publication history==
Michael Holt was created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Tom Mandrake]] and first appeared in ''[[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]'' (vol. 3) #54 (June 1997).

==Fictional character biography==
At a very young age, Michael Holt shows remarkable intelligence, reading and assimilating the works of [[Aage Bohr]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Max Planck]] and [[Richard Feynman]], the pantheon of theoretical physics.&lt;ref name="JSA #13, pg.1"&gt;''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #13, pg.1&lt;/ref&gt; Michael grows up with his mentally challenged older brother, Jeffrey, whom he loves dearly. When Jeffrey dies at the age of 15, Michael is devastated.&lt;ref&gt;''52'' #39, pg.22&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt displays "a natural aptitude for having natural aptitudes", as he calls it, easily picking up and retaining complex skills and abilities that others spend their entire lives perfecting. Before he begins his career as a superhero, he already possesses 14 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]s (two in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]—including doctorates and master's degrees in [[law]], [[psychology]], [[chemistry]], [[political science]], and [[mathematics]]&lt;ref name="JSA #28, pg. 11"&gt;''JSA'' #28, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JSA #53, pg. 8"&gt;''JSA'' #53, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;)—is a self-made multi-millionaire&lt;ref name="JSA #13, pg.1"/&gt; with a high tech firm called Cyberwear (subsequently sold to [[Waynetech]]&lt;ref name="JSA #28, pg. 11"&gt;''JSA'' #28, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;), and is a [[gold medal]]-winning [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Decathlon|decathlete]].

The accidental deaths of his wife and unborn child are a devastating blow to Holt. He considers himself responsible for the accident as he made his wife late for church by arguing with her about the value of religion. While contemplating [[suicide]], he is met by the Spectre, who tells him about [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)|Terry Sloane]], the Golden Age superhero known as Mister Terrific. Inspired by Sloane's life story, he takes the name Mister Terrific&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 279 |quote = ''The Spectre'' ongoing series was nearing its end, but that didn't stop writer John Ostrander and artist Tom Mandrake from pooling their creative forces to create one of the DCU's newest shining stars...An inspired and reborn [Michael] Holt then picked up the mantle of Mr. Terrific.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later joins the current [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA), eventually serving as its chairman.

Initially, he wears ordinary clothes and a leather jacket with Sloane's "Fair Play" emblem on the back. Later, he switches to a T-shaped mask composed of electronic [[nanorobotics|nanite]]s, a black and white costume with red trim, and a collarless jacket in the same colors (the black sections of tunic and jacket forming a "'''T'''") with "Fair Play" written on the sleeves and "Terrific" across the back.

For a time, he acts as spokesperson for [[Hourman|Tylerco]] and consults for the company on [[industrial espionage]] and security matters in exchange for it helping fund a youth center Terrific has started.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' #5, pg.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt has a friendly rivalry with [[Batman]], his opposite number in the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (in his identity as Bruce Wayne, Batman owns Holt's business). Holt has encountered Sloane twice through [[time travel]], with Sloane expressing pride in having so worthy a successor. Holt has been noted as the most intelligent member of the JSA in its history, surpassing his predecessor. He is also known as the third-smartest person in the world,&lt;ref name="Infinite Crisis # 5, pg. 1"&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' # 5, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and this notion now appears to be widespread within the DC Universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America (vol. 3)'' # 2, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice Society of America chairmanship===
During a conflict over leadership of the Justice Society between former chairman [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] and then-current chairman [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]], Terrific is elected as the JSA's new chairman by his teammates, despite not actively seeking the office.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' #27, pg.17-18&lt;/ref&gt; He serves in this capacity until the team disbands following the [[Infinite Crisis]].

Mr. Terrific currently remains a member of the reformed Justice Society of America. He resumed his chairmanship from the last incarnation of the team,&lt;ref&gt;''52'' #39, pg. 22, Backup Origin&lt;/ref&gt; but his leadership responsibilities in Checkmate eventually prompt him to relinquish the position to [[Power Girl]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) # 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinite Crisis===
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}
Mr. Terrific is part of the team assembled by Batman for an attack on the [[OMAC (comics)|Brother Eye]] satellite responsible for controlling the OMACs. He plays a critical role as his invisibility to technology allows him to reach the satellite's propulsion system, sending it crashing to Earth. During this time, he meets and befriends another African American superhero—[[Black Lightning]].

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
In the "[[One Year Later]]" storyline, Holt is still a member of the JSA, and he has also become part of the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s intelligence agency, [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]. He holds the position of White King's Bishop initially, but when the previous White King (Alan Scott) is forced to resign, he becomes Checkmate's new White King, complicating his relationship with [[Sasha Bordeaux]], Checkmate's Black Queen. He has also given up his chairman position, which has been taken over by [[Power Girl]]. Mr. Terrific has also established an ill-defined mentorship with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] over the missing year; the specifics of their meeting are yet to be documented.

Holt is forced to face his issues with faith once again when the JSA confront [[Gog (DC Comics)#Thy Kingdom Come|Gog]], a God of the Second World. Not only is Gog incapable of hearing Terrific due to his lack of faith, but during a trip to the Earth-Two of the new multiverse, Holt encounters his Earth-Two counterpart, who is now a devout believer after having a religious experience on the day his wife survived her accident.

===Final Crisis===
{{main|Final Crisis}}
During the ''Final Crisis of Humanity'', the war between [[Darkseid]] and the human world, Mister Terrific, along with [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Snapper Carr]], are left trapped in the ruins of Checkmate headquarters, unable to get past the brainwashed [[metahuman]], and caring for Sasha, who prefers using her [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]] programming to shut down her bodily functions rather than falling prey to the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. Forcefully waking up Sasha, thus condemning her, Michael Holt has no choice but to activate a new OMAC population, programmed to obey him rather than Brother Eye, and to protect the last few humans against the new [[Justifiers]].

===Death and return===
In ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 series, Mr. Terrific takes over the research, just as the low-level villain Tapeworm appears on the news, taking hostages and demanding that Wildcat show himself. [[Jeremy Karne|All-American Kid]] and [[King Chimera]] must remain in the brownstone, Mister Terrific retreats to his lab, and the rest of the team leaves to help Wildcat. All-American Kid goes into the lab and stabs Mister Terrific in the back, pretending to have been mind controlled.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #29 (July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Society members arrive back at headquarters to discover Mr. Terrific has been attacked, and [[Dr. Mid-Nite (Pieter Cross)|Dr. Mid-Nite]] tends to his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #30 (August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Mister Terrific succumbs to his injuries and Alan Scott reports that he has died.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #31 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scott is able to use the power of the Green Flame to slow down time around Mister Terrific's body in the hopes that he can be healed before brain death occurs.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #32 (October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Michael is restored to life by the magic of the new [[Doctor Fate]], and attacks All-American Kid, revealing that he is actually the teenage psychopath known as [[Jeremy Karne|Kid Karnevil]], and subdues him.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #33 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; For a short time during his recovery, Michael is forced to use a wheelchair, although he still finds time to upgrade [[Mister America (Jeffrey Graves)|Mister America]]'s whip.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #34 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
On September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Mister Terrific received a self-titled ongoing series written by Eric Wallace and drawn by Roger Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyde |first=David |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/02/the-new-justice/ |title=The New Justice &amp;#124; DC Comics |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holt begins sporting a new costume designed by [[Cully Hamner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By DCE Editorial |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/09/project-up-up-and-runway/#comments |title=Project: Up Up and Runway &amp;#124; DC Comics |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also in a relationship with Karen Starr.

On January 12, 2012, DC announced that it would be ending six of the lowest selling New 52 titles in April, replacing them with six different titles in the revamp's second wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=Albert Ching|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dc-new-52-new-titles-120112.html|title=Six Titles In, Six Out in 'Second Wave' of DC's NEW 52|publisher=Newsarama|date=January 12, 2012|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mister Terrific'' was cancelled with issue #8 in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author=DC Comics|url=http://www.dccomics.com/dccomics/comics/?dat=20120407|title=On Sale April '12|publisher=DC Comics|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series ends with Mister Terrific being displaced to a parallel universe where he continues to appear in the ''[[Earth-Two#The New 52|Earth-2]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dc-comics-June-2012-solicitations.html |title=DC Comics' FULL June 2012 Solicitations |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DC Rebirth===
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
In ''Dark Days: The Forge'', Mister Terrific returns to Earth Prime as Batman unveils a containment unit in The Lunar Batcave bearing the [[Plastic Man]] logo, and suggests it is time to release him.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Days: The Forge'' #1 (June 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mister Terrific stumbles upon [[Simon Stagg]]'s plot to open a portal to the Dark Multiverse with [[Metamorpho]] transmutated to Nth Metal. While trying to get Simon Stagg to close the portal with the help of Plastic Man, Mister Terrific is sucked in to the portal with Plastic Man and Metamorpho as Plastic Man shields them from the Dark Multiverse energy. Upon arriving on a lifeless world, they encounter [[Phantom Girl]] who has been trapped in her intangible form and had no knowledge of sending a signal. When the four of them find a computer in the gut of a dead giant creature, they are greeted by a hologram of [[Tom Strong]] who states that they are needed to save the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Terrifics'' #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Mister Terrific, Plastic Man, and Metamorpho learn from Phantom Girl that she was stuck in intangible form since she was a child. After the four of them made it back to their world, Mister Terrific tries to leave the three of them at Simon Stagg's compound only to be drawn back to them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Terrifics'' #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the effects of the Dark Multiverse energy, Mister Terrific concludes that they can't go their separate ways due to this bond. Though Mister Terrific was able to come up with a compromise with Simon Stagg by investigating the bond at his facility. This leads to Mister Terrific to find the Tom Strong that sent left the message and find out how to get untethered by the dark energy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Terrifics'' #3. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
While being held captive by [[Onimar Synn]] on an adventure with the Justice Society on [[Thanagar]], Holt first expresses his disbelief in souls and that he is uncomfortable with the notion of [[reincarnation]] after witnessing the return of teammate [[Hawkman]]. Holt states, "when my wife, Paula, was killed in a car accident ... she was gone. I didn't feel her 'soul' around me. Didn't feel anything".&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 26, pg. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; He later elaborates on this by explaining that his lack of faith extends back prior to his wife's death, and states that he blames himself for her death as he delayed her going to church because the two of them argued about the merits of faith. Holt believes that she would have avoided the accident if she had not been arguing with him. He acknowledges the irony of this given such factors as the Spectre's role in his origin, and his encounter with the likes of the [[Spirit King]], but he still maintains his skepticism about faith and religion.

After a [[near-death experience]] where he sees his wife and unborn child (whom he decides to name 'Terry' after the original Mister Terrific), Holt's atheism is shaken and he agrees to attend a church service with teammate [[Doctor Mid-Nite]].&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 62, pg. 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this attempt to find religion apparently is not satisfying as Holt is also seen getting into a theological discussion with [[Ragman (comics)|Ragman]] during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' (Ragman is [[Judaism|Jewish]] while Mr. Terrific describes himself as an [[atheism|atheist]]). When asked if he has faith in anything, Terrific answered, "Sure I do. I've got faith in my team."&lt;ref name="Infinite Crisis # 5, pg. 1"/&gt;

During ''Thy Kingdom Come'', when Power Girl is sent back to the Earth-2 pre-Crisis universe, she meets her world's Michael Holt, who is ironically a priest after he has a religious experience. During the same storyline, 'our' Holt told Doctor Mid-Nite that he feels that his issues with faith actually stem from his own inability to understand it, confessing that he ''wants'' to believe but something inside him will not let him.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
*Holt is described as having "a natural aptitude for having natural aptitudes"; picking up complicated skills quickly and retaining them, such as performing emergency surgery on teammate [[Alan Scott]] after reading about the procedure in a medical textbook and subsequently becoming Dr. Mid-Nite's assistant. As Holt himself put it, "everyone has a talent... Mine is learning."&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 17, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JSA #53, pg. 8" /&gt;
*Holt is also known as the third-smartest man on Earth.&lt;ref name="Infinite Crisis # 5, pg. 1"/&gt;
*He is aided by his "T-Spheres", floating robotic spheres with multiple functions, [[holograph]]ic projection,&lt;ref&gt;''JSA All-Stars'' # 7, pg.4&lt;/ref&gt; projecting [[laser]] grids,&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 61, pg.6&lt;/ref&gt; and recording, communication, linking with and manipulating other electronic devices, from satellites to electronic locks.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA: Classified'' # 29, pg.11&lt;/ref&gt; They allow Terrific to fly by bearing his weight,&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 78, pg.3&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used as weapons, both by exploding with enough force to send [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] flying back,&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 41, pg.19&lt;/ref&gt; generating powerful electric charges,&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 31, pg.16&lt;/ref&gt; and strike as flying, projectile weapons.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 71, pg.4&lt;/ref&gt; They respond to his mental and vocal commands.
*He is [[invisibility|invisible]] to all forms of electronic detection. Despite a claim to Black Lightning in ''Infinite Crisis'' that "I've got one superpower: I'm invisible to technology," in all other instances this ability is tied to nanotechnology woven into his specially designed "T-Mask" (which is molecularly bonded to his face and can appear and disappear at will) and costume. Mr. Terrific was apparently the only superhero whom the [[OMAC (comics)|OMACs]] could not detect. The only exception to his invisibility, however, is that of the [[Red Tornado]], who, for reasons yet unknown, is capable of seeing Terrific despite being an android. Red Tornado's status as a sentient wind elemental merely occupying an android body likely explains his ability to see Holt.
*Through his mask, Holt can change instantaneously into costume and back again.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 84, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; His mask also protects his face from chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA All-Stars'' # 7, pg.6&lt;/ref&gt; The mask works in conjunction with an earpiece to act as a communications system, and also doubles as an encephalic broadcaster, picking up aggregate thought waves, allowing him to communicate with his T-Spheres, and even project a speaking hologram of himself, even if he is injured or too weak to speak.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 49, pg. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; The mask can also form and transmit images on low- or high-band light frequencies visible to his teammate Doctor Mid-Nite.
*He is a black belt in 6 different [[martial arts]] disciplines and an Olympic Gold Medalist in the [[decathlon]].&lt;ref name="JSA #28, pg. 11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 12, pg.6&lt;/ref&gt;
*Holt is also a [[polymath]] who has specialized in multiple fields of medicine, engineering, and science. He possesses fourteen Ph.Ds (two of which are in engineering and physics).&lt;ref name="JSA #28, pg. 11"/&gt;
* Along with teammate and friend [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] and Batman, Mister Terrific is one of the three main superheroes with medical training in the [[DC Universe]]. Although it is not known if he has an M.D., he did participate in the autopsy of [[Sue Dibny]] in ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' # 67, pg.2-6&lt;/ref&gt;
*Holt is also [[Polyglotism|polyglot]], though the extent of this hasn't been revealed. He has been shown to speak the languages of the fictional nations of [[Kahndaq]] and [[Bialya]]. Given Holt's propensity for learning, it is likely that he speaks several other languages as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkman'' (vol. 3) # 24, pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Earth-2===
In 2008, an alternate version of Michael Holt from a [[The 52|new]] [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] appeared in DC stories. This version is a college professor, who has a religious experience after his wife is nearly killed in an accident. This version of Paula Holt is merely left in a coma rather than dying immediately. While contemplating suicide after spending three months trying unsuccessfully to find a cure, he saves another man who is preparing to jump off the same bridge, takes him to a church that was the nearest illuminated building, and the man he saves prays for him. After his wife regains consciousness the following day, this Michael Holt went on to become a devout Christian. He helps the Power Girl of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#New Earth|New Earth]] to return home.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19&lt;/ref&gt; When the Justice Society arrives on Earth-2, Professor Holt confronts his counterpart Michael Holt from New-Earth. Professor Holt introduces the Justice Society to his wife, Paula, although New-Earth Michael just introduces himself as Mister Terrific rather than reveal his true name.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Mister and Missus Terrific are framed for unknown crimes when they discover [[Outsider (comics)|Outsider]]'s illicit schemes, and are attempting to assassinate him. Mister and Missus Terrific are both killed by Outsider's guardian statue.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: The Outsider'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===

====Live action====
* Michael Holt is mentioned in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "[[Absolute Justice]]" (which featured the Justice Society) in the second half by Lois Lane, who mentions that she skipped an interview with him. He is described as a Nobel-winning scientist and tech guru. 
* A character named '''Curtis Holt''' appears in [[the CW]] series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', played by [[Echo Kellum]]. When he is first introduced, Curtis works with [[Felicity Smoak]] at Palmer Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrams |first=Natalie |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/16/arrow-echo-kellum-mr-terrific-season-4 |title='Arrow' casts Mr. Terrific for season 4 |publisher=EW.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his comic book incarnation, he has created the T-spheres and occasionally wears the Fair Play jacket. Curtis is a big fan of [[Green Arrow]], and after learning that Felicity has a connection with him, he is determined to figure out his identity. In the episode "Beacon of Hope", Curtis joins Team Arrow temporarily and learns the members' identities, helping them to defeat the latest attack of [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|Brie Larvan]]. In Season 5, Curtis officially joins Team Arrow and begins training to become a vigilante.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitovich |first=Matt |url=http://tvline.com/2016/04/04/arrow-season-5-echo-kellum-series-regular-curtis/ |title='Arrow Season 5: Echo Kellum Promoted to Series Regular as Curtis |publisher=tvline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a vigilante, Curtis uses the name "Mr. Terrific", which is a homage to his favorite wrestling champion [[Terry Sloane]], who went by the same name in the ring. This version of the character is [[gay]] and is depicted as having a husband named Paul (perhaps a gender-swapped version of his wife in the comics, who was named Paula).

====Animation====
[[File:MrTerrific.jpg|thumb|right|Mr. Terrific on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' in the episode "Destroyer".]]
* Michael Holt has made several [[cameo appearance]]s in the animated TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. He moves into a more prominent role in the series' final season, becoming the League's Coordinator and responsible for assigning tasks to the various heroes after [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] resigns from active duty. The animated Mr. Terrific is voiced by former ''[[Third Watch]]'' star [[Michael Beach]].  It is unknown whether Mr. Terrific retains his invisibility to technology, as throughout the show the image of his face appears on several computer screens. His status as one of the world's smartest men is referred to in his full introductory appearance, and the T-Spheres are used in a subsequent episode.
* Michael Holt appears in "Hunted", the premiere episode of ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', where he is voiced by [[Gary Anthony Williams]]. He is depicted as a businessman who is kidnapped along with [[Simon Stagg]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] by [[Professor Pyg]] and [[Mister Toad (comics)|Mr. Toad]]. The three of them are rescued by Batman.
* Mister Terrific appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode "The Cube Root", voiced by [[Hannibal Buress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucas Siegel |url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2016/06/06/new-justice-league-action-characters-officially-revealed/ |title=New Justice League Action Characters Officially Revealed |publisher=Comicbook.com |date=2016-06-05 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is a former child prodigy who was the college roommate of Martin Stein (who claimed that Mister Terrific based his T-Spheres off his S-Cubes). Mister Terrific was establishing the science center dedicated to him which [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] attends until it is crashed by [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] who hacks into Mister Terrific's T-Spheres. During Mister Terrific and Firestorm's fight with Calculator upon him causing a blackout, Calculator uses the hacked T-Spheres to split Firestorm back into Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein where the hacked T-Spheres make off with Ronnie Raymond. This causes Mister Terrific and Martin Stein to work together to rescue Ronnie Raymond using the S-Cubes as a diversion so that Martin Stein can combine with Ronnie Raymond in order to form Firestorm. Mister Terrific and Firestorm reclaim control over the T-Spheres, defeat Calculator, and hand him over to the police. In “The Brain Buster”, he is kidnapped along with other highly intelligent heroes and villains to participate in an initially unknown figure’s series of contests to determine who is most intelligent. It is mentioned several times that he is “only” the third-smartest person in the world.

'''Mo''' or '''Moism''' ({{zh|c=摩教|p=Mó jiào}}), occasionally called '''Zhuang Shigongism''' ({{zh|c=壮族师公教|p=Zhuàngzú shīgōng jiào|l=Zhuang Ancestral Father Religion}}), is the [[religion]] of most [[Zhuang people]], the largest ethnic minority of [[China]]. It has a large presence in [[Guangxi]]. While it has a [[Supreme Being|supreme god]], the [[creator deity|creator]] [[Bu Luotuo]] (布洛陀),&lt;ref name="shvoong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shvoong.com/business-management/1596580-culture-mo-religion-zhuangs/#ixzz2Tx7qhaPk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217032006/http://www.shvoong.com/business-management/1596580-culture-mo-religion-zhuangs/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 December 2013|title=On the Culture of Mo Religion of Zhuangs|author=[http://www.shvoong.com/writers/tsinghua/ Tsinghua]|date=15 March 2005|accessdate=8 November 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; numerous other deities are venerated as well. It has a three-element-theory (sky, earth and water).&lt;ref name="shvoong"/&gt; Mo is [[animism|animistic]], teaching that spirits are present in everything.&lt;ref name="bonn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hss.ulb.uni-bonn.de/2012/2832/2832.pdf|title=Das Epos der Zhuang-Nationalität in China: Genese, Überlieferung und Religion|author=Li Jingfeng|year=2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|publisher=Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität zu Bonn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mo developed from prehistoric beliefs of the Zhuang people;&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; it also has similarities to [[Chinese folk religion]],&lt;ref&gt;Mo Youzheng. 2009-01b.&lt;/ref&gt; and has developed similar doctrines to [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], in the process of competition with the influence of these religions on Zhuang culture.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Shuzhe. 2001-04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yang Shuzhe. 2002-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cultural Revolution]] of China weakened Mo,&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; though the religion has undergone a revival since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;He Qimin. 2011-03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qin Cong. 2011-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Moism varies from region to region.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Mo has a three-element theory (sky, earth and water).&lt;ref name="shvoong"/&gt; The religion is [[Animism|animistic]], teaching that spirits are present in everything.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; The spirits are seen as immortal and subject to changes in mood.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;
Mo exhibits [[totemism]] and the cult of reproduction.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

=== Deities ===
In Mo, [[Bu Luotuo]] is considered the supreme god, creator and the founder of the religion.&lt;ref name="shvoong"/&gt;

The Flower Mother, [[Me Hoa]], is seen as the creator of humanity and Bu Luotuo's wife. As the goddess of reproduction, she is seen as governing a large garden of golden flowers (boys) and silver flowers (girls). Whoever behaves with good sense and sentiment will receive good flowers (i.e. good children), while those who behave with bad sense receive bad flowers. Families have altars for her.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

Other gods include [[Tudigong]], who is thought to protect the village; She Shen, who is the village tutelary spirit; the Shan Shen ("god of the mountains"); and the [[Dragon King]].&lt;ref name="every"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Russia-Eurasia-China/Zhuang-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html|title=Zhuang - Religion and Expressive Culture|accessdate=8 November 2013|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Rice is seen as important;&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; there is therefore a field god and a rice god.

=== Cosmology ===
In Mo, spirits are thought to be present in everything, and even inanimate things such as water are considered to have souls. 
Mo spirits include deities and ancestors as well as devils.

People are considered to have three souls after death: One goes to the sky, one to the cemetery and one comes back to the deceased’s family. Souls of the dead enter a netherworld but can continue to assist the living.&lt;ref name="every"/&gt; According to the religion, people who have died by violence can become evil spirits.&lt;ref name="every"/&gt;

== Practices ==
Praying is common within this religion. 
Sorcerers venerate their masters as well as the founders of witchcraft in their family. 
There are temples dedicated to land gods. The sun god is celebrated and given offerings.

Mo has the sacred epic ''[[Buluotuo]]'',&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; concerning the creation of the universe and life as well as how to live a religiously meritorious life. Its transmission was originally oral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/102759/102837/7561196.html|title=Buluotuo Scriptures of Zhuang|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=8 November 2013|publisher=People's Daily News|editor=黄蓓蓓}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mo, every person is a flower in the garden of [[Molujia]], the goddess of birth.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; On February 29 of the peasants' almanac, the goddess's birthday, women pick flowers and pray to her for pregnancy.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; She is said to have been born in a flower at the beginning of the world.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; There is a festival for her, which varies in place, date and ceremonial procedure.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

The religion has the custom of burying the dead twice.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; People who have died by violence are cremated to prevent the release of potential malevolent spirits.

=== Shamans and mediums ===
Mediums, shamans or sorcerers are employed at funerals, to treat disease, and to ward off evil.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

Mo has female [[shaman]]s, who attempt to treat sickness and communicate with ancestors while in trances.&lt;ref name="every"/&gt; They mostly are recognized as shamans after having had a state similar to trance and claims to have met spirits in this state.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; In rural areas, they are considered [[prophet]]s and [[miracle healer]]s.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; There are also male shamans, who serve at an altar.&lt;ref name="every"/&gt; There are sacrifices of oxen, chickens, and other livestock.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

=== Domestic worship ===
A complete family is considered to have three parts: The descendants of the same ancestors, the grave site, and the spirits of the ancestors.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;
The spirits of the ancestors are given great consideration and seen as protecting people.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; To return to the sacred world of the ancestors is seen as the greatest end for the deceased.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; Frequently, Mo practitioners have a hall for the ancestors of their homes where ancestors from the past three generations are venerated.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; Such halls are also the site of ancestor worship ceremonies for important festivals, weddings, deaths and births.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; It is not allowed to put dog, cat or snake meat in front of the hall.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; Mo adherents feel a mixture of fear and awe towards their ancestors, believing that their ancestors can support or punish them at will.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; Because they believe their fate is in the hands of their ancestors, the family propitiates the ancestors through prayer and sacrifices.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

=== Festivals ===
Mo practitioners celebrate the following festivals of Chinese origin: the [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]], the [[Qingming Festival]], the [[Duanwu Festival]], the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] and the [[Dongzhi Festival]].&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; Regular rituals are performed on traditional celebrations prescribed in the yearly calendar.

The supreme deity of Mo is a sky god. There are sacrifices to him on the morning of the new year.

Sanyuesan is a festival, which takes place on the 3rd of March of the lunar calendar and is considered to be as important as Qingming.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; On the same day, before the festival takes place, sacrifices for the ancestors take place and graves are cleaned.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; Adherents sing, and boys keep an eye out for potential female partners.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

Cattle are seen as holy. The [[Cattle Soul Festival]] is celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th lunar month, which Mo adherents believe is the birthday of the Cattle King.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; On this day, adherents go to their cattle barns and free the animals from their yoke.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

The [[Frog Festival]] takes place during the 1st lunar month, when people pray for rain and a good harvest.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

The [[Ghost Festival]] takes several days, and is based on the belief that the deceased can contact their relatives as ghosts or by other supernatural means.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; Families clean their homes carefully and undertake other preparations; then the ghosts are welcomed.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt; Finally, families say goodbye to the ghost and burn objects so that the ghosts are supplied in afterlife.&lt;ref name="bonn"/&gt;

The '''Müsavat Party''' ({{lang-az|Müsavat Partiyası}}, from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] مساواة ''musāwāt'', meaning "equality, parity", {{lang-en|'''Equality Party'''}}) is the oldest existing [[political party]] in [[Azerbaijan]]. Its history can be divided into three periods: Early (old) Musavat, Musavat-in-exile and New Musavat.

==Early (Old) Musavat (1911–1923)==
[[File:Mammad_Amin_Rasulzade.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]], founder of Musavat]]
Musavat was founded in 1911 in [[Baku]] as a secret organization by [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]], [[Mammed Ali Rasulzade]] (cousin of [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]]), [[Abbasgulu Kazimzade]] and [[Taghi Nagioglu]].  Its initial name was a Muslim Democratic Musavat Party.  The first members were Veli Mikayiloghlu, Seyid Huseyn Sadig, Abdurrahim bey, Yusif Ziya bey and Seyid Musavi bey.  Early Musavat members also included future Communist leader of Azerbaijan SSR [[Nariman Narimanov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World |last=van Schendel |first=Willem |authorlink= |author2=Zürcher, Erik Jan |author2-link=Erik-Jan Zürcher |year=2001 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=1-86064-261-6 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was coming from [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]], who was then living in [[exile]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{az icon}}{{cite book|last=Orujlu|first=Maryam|authorlink=|editor=|others=|title=Müsavat Partiyası: Ölkədə və Mühacirətdə, 1911-1992|origyear=|month=|url=http://www.kitabxana.org/site/musavatoruclu.htm|accessdate=|edition=|series=|year=2001|publisher=Azerneshr|location=Baku|language=az|isbn=|oclc=|doi=|id=|pages=|chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=M.A. Resuloğlu (1962).

{{Politics of Azerbaijan}}

In its early years before the first world war, Musavat was a relatively small, secret underground organization, much like its counterparts throughout the Middle East, working for the prosperity and political unity of the Muslim and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking world.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Michael G. |authorlink= |date=April 2001 |title=Anatomy of a Rumour: Murder Scandal, the Musavat Party and Narratives of the Russian Revolution in Baku, 1917-1920 |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=216–218 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1177/002200940103600202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Musavat espoused pan-Islamic ideology and its founder was sympathetic to the pan-Turkic movement, the party supported the [[Russian Empire|tsarist regime]] during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name="mostashari144"&gt;{{cite book |title=On the Religious Frontier: Tsarist Russia and Islam in the Caucasus |last=Mostashari |first=Firouzeh |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=1-85043-771-8 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's social democrats received the foundation of Musavat in what they considered "imperial, orientalist terms, governed by the long-standing ideological categories of Muslim backwardness, treachery and religious fanaticism",&lt;ref name="brower"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brower |first=Daniel |authorlink= |date=Fall 1996 |title=Russian Roads to Mecca: Religious Toleration and Muslim Pilgrimage in the Russian Empire |journal=[[Slavic Review]] |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=567–584 |id= |quote= |doi=10.2307/2502001|jstor= 2502001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a betrayal of historic proportions.

The Musavat's programme, which appealed to the Azerbaijani masses and assured the party of the sympathy of the Muslims abroad, announced the following aims:
:1. The unity of all Muslim peoples without regard to nationality or sect.
:2. Restoration of the independence of all Muslim nations.
:3. Extension of material and moral aid to all Muslim nations which fight for their independence.
:4. Help to all Muslim peoples and states in offense and in defence.
:5. The destruction of the barriers which prevent the spread of the above-mentioned ideas.
:6. The establishment of contact with parties striving for the progress of the Muslims.
:7. The establishment, as need might arise, of contact and exchange of opinion with foreign parties which have the well being of humanity as their aim.
:8. The intensification of the struggle for the existence of all Muslims and the development of their commerce, trade and economic life in general.&lt;ref name="mdguseinov"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ru:Тюркская демократическая партия федералистов "Мусават" в прошлом и настоящем |last=Гусейнов |first=Мирза Давуд |authorlink= |year=1927 |publisher= |location=Baku |isbn= |pages= |chapter=1: Программа и тактика|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the Musavat party supported some pan-Islamist and pan-Turkist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Pan-Turkism: From Irrendentism to Cooperation by Jacob M. Landau P.55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/az%7Dmus.html Musavat Party (Azerbaijan)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires'' by [[Aviel Roshwald]], page 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Disaster and Development: The politics of Humanitarian Aid by Neil Middleton and Phil O'keefe P. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian-Azerbaijan Conflict: Causes and Implications by Michael P. Croissant P. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-Turkic element in Musavat's ideology was a reflection of the novel ideas of the [[Young Turk]] revolution in [[Ottoman Empire]]. The founders of this ideology were Azerbaijani intellectuals of Russian Empire, Ali-bey Huseynzadeh and [[Ahmet Ağaoğlu|Ahmed-bey Agayev]] (known in Turkey as [[Ahmet Ağaoğlu]]), whose literary works used the linguistic unity of Turkic-speaking peoples as a factor for national awakening of various nationalities inhabiting the Russian Empire.

The Menshevik and Social Revolutionary parties of Baku, both largely dependent upon the support of selected Georgian, Armenian and Jewish cadrees, as well as upon the ethnic Russian workers, had long vilified the Muslims as "inert" and "unconscious".&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; For them as well as for Bolsheviks, Constitutional Democrats and Denikinists, the Musavat, by default, was the false friend of social democracy, just a party of feudal "beks and khans". These accusations, centerpieces of a paranoid style in social-democratic politics, have endured in the historical literature far beyond their origins.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; But this form of attitude also alienated predominant Muslim groups from Russia's mainstream social democrats, as Musavat's shifting politics and populist slogans started receiving bigger appeal among the Muslim worker audience. Musavat leaders were largely well-educated professionals from the upper class echelons of Azeri society; its mass membership, most recruited between 1917 and 1919, comprised the poorly-educated Muslims underclass of Baku.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

===Early Musavat under Rasulzade leadership===
[[File:Flag of Azerbaijani Musavat party.svg|thumb|Musavat Flag 1917|250px|right|Flag of the Musavat Party of Turkic Federalists (1917)]]
After the Amnesty Act of 1913 dedicated to the [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty]], [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]] returned to Azerbaijan and undertook party leadership. Despite the party still being secret, Rasulzade managed to found newspaper the newspaper ''Achig Soz'' (1915&amp;ndash;1918), in which Musavat's aims and goals, this time polished and defined in Rasulzade's interpretations, were implicitly advocated. Only after the [[February Revolution]], when Musavat ceased to be a secret organization and became a legal political party did the newspaper officially become the party's organ.

The Baku Committee of Muslim Social Organizations, as well as the Musavat, were quite radical during the early days of the February Revolution: they wanted a democratic republic, which would guarantee the rights of Muslims.&lt;ref name="kazemzadeh51"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Struggle for Transcaucasia, 1917-1921 |last=Kazemzadeh |first=Firuz |authorlink= Firuz Kazemzadeh |year=1951 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York  |isbn= |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet historian A. L. Popov writes that the Musavat cannot be ''a priori'' classified as a reactionary party of Khans and Beks, because in the early revolutionary period the Musavat stood on the positions of democracy and even socialism. "Until a certain time the Baku Committee of Muslim Social Organizations and the Musavat party successfully fulfilled the mission not only of representing the general national interests but also of guiding the Azerbaijani workers' democracy".&lt;ref name="popov"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Попов |first=А.

On June 17, 1917, Musavat merged with the [[Party of Turkic Federalists]], another national-democratic right-wing organization founded by [[Nasibbey Usubbekov]] and [[Hasan bey Agayev]], taking on a new name of Musavat Party of Turkic Federalists.&lt;ref name="mdguseinov" /&gt; Thus, Musavat became the main political force of Caucasian Muslims.

In October 1917 Musavat convoked in its first congress where it adopted new covenant, with 76 articles.

:1.Russia has to become federative democratic republic based on the national and territorial autonomy. 
:2. Freedom of speech, conscience, stamp, unions, strikes have to be confirmed by constitution and guaranteed by state. 
:3. All citizens in spite of religion, nationality, gender and political ideology are equal in front of the law. Passport system is to be annulled. Every citizen is given the right to move freely both inside the borders and outside the borders of the country. 
:4. For all workers and office workers the working day is limited with eight hours. 
:5. All state, crown, noble and private lands are distributed between peasant free. 
:6. Courts only obey to the law and from now on no citizen is subject to punishment if not following the resolution of the competent authorities. 
:7. Universal free and compulsory elementary and high education. (Central state archive of the Azerbaijan Republic, f.894, op.1, storage unit 56, p. 5).

Particularly, new covenant&lt;ref name="balayev"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ru:Азербайджанское национально-демократическое движение, 1917-1920 |last=Балаев |first=Айдын |url=http://karabakh-doc.azerall.info/ru/azerpeople/ap038-1.php |authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= |location=Baku |isbn= |pages=74–82|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; said:
:'''Article 1''': The form of the state of Russia should be a federative democratic republic based on principles of the national autonomy.
:'''Article 3''': All ethnicities having territories of compact inhabiting n any part of Russia should receive [[national autonomy]]. Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkistan and Bashkortostan should receive [[Territorial Autonomy|territorial autonomy]], Turks living along the Volga and the Crimean Turks should receive a [[cultural autonomy]] in the case of impossibility of territorial autonomy. The Party considers as its sacred duty to support any non-Turkic ethnicities' quests for autonomy and help them.
:'''Article 4''': Ethnicities having no exact territory of compact inhabiting should receive national cultural autonomy.

During the period from February until November 1917 Musavat shared the idea of federalism without separating from Russia. In accordance with the doctrine accepted by the Special Transcaucasian Committee (OZAKOM) the Georgian, Armenian and Aerbaijan territories were authorised to rule independent domestic policy, leaving to the Provisorial Russian government only foreign affairs, army and defense, and customs. However, Musavat as well as the other Muslims unions got quickly disappointed in cooperation with the Provisorial government, as it had no wish to delegate to the Muslim territories more independence.

Having got the news about the October Revolution in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) Transcaucasia did not accept the new Bolshevik power. In February 1918 Transcaucasian Council ("Sejm") started its work in Tbilisi. Musavat entered the Sejm as one of the ruling parties, having 30 deputies of 125. The other parties represented in the new intritution were Georgian mensheviks (32 deputies) and Armenian "dashnaks" (27 deputies). At this stage Musavat started propagating the pan-Islamist and pan-Turkish ideas and aimed at creation of United Muslim State under protection of Turkey (Ottoman Empire). The majority of the Party's members were merchants, white-collars and partially peasantry.

Musavat became the tenth largest party elected to the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]](1918).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/museum/his1d.htm Lenin and the First Communist Revolutions, IV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musavat in ADR Government===

After the disintegration of the Russian Empire and the Declaration of Independence, Musavat became the leading party of the newly established [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], holding the majority of mandates in its parliaments, at first in [[Azerbaijani National Council]] and then in  ''Parlaman'' ("parliament"), Rasulzade being its first [[head of state]] (28 May 1918 {{spaced ndash}} 7 December 1918). Under the Musavat's leadership, the name "Azerbaijan" was adopted; a name that prior to the proclamation of the ADR was solely used to refer to the [[Iranian Azerbaijan|adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atabaki|first1=Touraj|title=Azerbaijan: Ethnicity and the Struggle for Power in Iran|date=2000|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781860645549|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dekmejian|first1=R.

After the fall of the first Republic in April 1920 as a result of the Bolshevik invasion, Musavat switched to secret activities again, by forming a secret committee, in which even famous Azeri playwright [[Jafar Jabbarli]] participated. The committee's most famous action was the preparation of the Rasulzade's flight from the [[Russian SFSR]] to [[Finland]]. Overall, Musavat prepared and conducted several armed insurgency operations, e.g.  the rebellions of Ganja, Karabakh, Zagatala and Lankoran. But the Soviets also repressed Musavat by arresting at least 2,000 members of Musavat up to 1923. Most prominent Musavat members thus were killed, exiled or escaped abroad and the party ceased all its activities within [[Azerbaijan]] in 1923.

==New Musavat (since 1989)==
The resurrection of Musavat in Azerbaijan came in 1989, during the second independence of Azerbaijan. A group of intellectuals created the "Azerbaijan National Democratic New Musavat Party". Later that group formed the "Restoration Center of the Musavat Party" and was recognized by Musavat-in-exile.  In 1992 delegates of New Musavat and Musavat-in-exile gathered in the "III Congress of Musavat" and formally re-established the party as the Musavat Party. One of the leaders of the Popular Front, [[Isa Gambar]] was elected its chairman. He remains its leader as of 2013.  The party structure consists of "Başqan" (Leader), "Divan" (Executive Board), and "Məclis" (Congress).

Since 1993, Musavat has been in the opposition to the ruling [[New Azerbaijan Party]]. Due to a split between its nationalist and its [[liberalism|liberal]] wing, the party failed to adopt a unified programme at the October 1997 congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Elin Suleymanov |title=Azerbaijan in 1997 |work=The Challenge of Integration: Annual Survey of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union 1997 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=1998 |page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2000–2001|2000/2001 elections]], the party won 4.9% of the popular vote and two out of 125 seats. As the party's candidate, its leader Isa Qambar won 12.2% of the popular vote in the [[Azerbaijan presidential election, 2003|15 October 2003 presidential elections]].  At the parliamentary [[Azerbaijan parliamentary election, 2005|elections]] of 6 November 2005, it joined the [[Freedom (Azerbaijan)|Freedom]] alliance, and won inside the alliance five seats. Musavat is also known for its protests against the Azerbaijani government such as that took place on 16 October 2003, after Isa Qambar had lost the election,&lt;ref&gt;[http://isagambar.az/musavat-tarixi-gen.htm Müsavat Partiyasinin Tarixi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625064804/http://www.isagambar.az/musavat-tarixi-gen.htm |date=2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on March 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/world/asia/13azerbaijan.html?adxnnl=1&amp;ref=global-home&amp;adxnnlx=1299999663-70iNDRhe9uWn2Fkq4dxGEA | work=The New York Times | first=Ellen | last=Barry | title=Azerbaijani Protesters Are Arrested | date=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Musavat applied for membership of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR, now [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]], ALDE), some members considered Musavat's ideology to be incompatible with Western liberalism. Board member Nasib Nasibli even resigned, stating that the party was committed to Turkic nationalism rather than liberalism. Nevertheless, Musavat was eventually admitted to ELDR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rashad Shirinov |title=An analysis of counter-hegemony: challenges of political opposition in Azerbaijan |work=Religion, Nation and Democracy in the South Caucasus |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has alleged that the Azerbaijani government has been seized by leading politicians of [[Kurds|Kurdish]], [[Talysh people|Talysh]], [[Armenians|Armenian]] or other ethnic groups of non-Turkic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Svante Cornell, ''Azerbaijan Since Independence'' (M.E.

== Work ==
His work has been exhibited extensively in the United States and internationally. In October 2015, a monographic exhibition of Fast’s work titled Present Continuous opened at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, and subsequently travelled to the [[Baltic Center of Contemporary Art]], Gateshead, UK, and the KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art, Aalborg.

Guggenheim Museum and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, NY; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], CA; [[Tate Modern]], London, UK; [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris, France; and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands among others. Fast Lives and works in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jamescohan.com/artists/omer-fast&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast is one of several contemporary artists who restages existing films, including [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Robert Melee]] and [[Yasumasa Morimura]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (March 8, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/08/arts/art-in-review-brice-delsperger.html ART IN REVIEW; Brice Delsperger] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''August'' (2017)===
In 2017, Fast was met with protests and allegations of [[racism]] by the Chinatown Art Brigade and others, including the [[Korean Americans|Korean American]] artist and 47 Canal gallery owner Margaret Lee,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.affidavit.art/articles/chinatown&lt;/ref&gt; for his August exhibition in the James Cohan gallery on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]]. The show was titled “August” after its centerpiece, a fine 3D video from 2016 that was inspired by the life of [[August Sander]], a German portrait and documentary photographer. But that video, along with an earlier one, has been upstaged by a surrounding installation that transforms Cohan’s white-box space into a New York Chinatown shop or bus-company waiting room with metal chairs, broken A.T.M.s and a shabby facade. Fast seems to have intended the Cohan gallery “waiting room” not as a replication of any real Chinatown but as the kind of fantasy version of immigrant neighborhoods evoked to justify “slum clearance.” While the work was intended to provoke a strong reaction&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/chinatown-omer-fast-art-poverty-porn&lt;/ref&gt;, a group of Chinatown-based activists have called out&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/artists-chinatown-depiction-ignites-protests.html&lt;/ref&gt; the piece as racist “poverty porn,” pure and simple, and demanded its removal.

=== ''Remainder'' (2015)===
In 2015 Fast released his first [[feature film]],{{where|date=December 2017}} based on the [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] novel ''[[Remainder (novel)|Remainder]]''
.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://variety.com/2014/film/news/cannes-first-image-from-omer-fasts-remainder-starring-tom-sturridge-1201176279/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Continuity'' (2012) ===
''Continuity'' features an older couple who hires male escorts to play out their dead son’s return from Afghanistan. The 40-minute work explores loss and grief as much as the narrative constructions of fiction and the cinematic conventions used in documentary films.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Rojas (August 14, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Cardiff-prize-show-isnt-afraid-to-talk-politics/33386 Cardiff prize show isn’t afraid to talk politics] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''5000 Feet is the Best'' (2011)===
Fast is the director of this [[short film]] shown on the [[Biennale di Venezia]] in 2011.

=== ''Nostalgia'' (2009)===
In October 2009, Fast’s exhibition "Nostalgia" opened at [[South London Gallery]]. The exhibition included ''Nostalgia'', a three-part film installation that intermingles a man’s account of his struggle for asylum in Britain with a reenactment of his story as a 1970s [[science fiction movie]] in which he attempts to flee a dystopian Europe and relocate to a colony in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Carnelia. "[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32955/omer-fast/ Omer Fast]." ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fast's 2009-2010 Nostalgia at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] was part of the 2008 [[Bucksbaum Award]], given to the most prominent artist in that year's [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAdams|first=Shane|title=Omer Fast|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=February 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/02/artseen/omer-fast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Casting'' (2007) ===
In the four-channel video piece ''Casting'',&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter (January 7, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/arts/design/08fast.html Is It Reality or Fantasy? The Boundaries Are Blurred] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the viewer walks into the screening room initially encountering two hanging projection screens.  Each screen contains a different depiction of a narrative showing the characters acting while silent and remaining completely still.  The projection screens are double sided and contain two additional images on the rear side where the viewer sees two men engaged in an interview.  The two men are a young American Army sergeant and the artist in a dialog about the narrative.  The artist states during the interview that he is interested only in memory and how memory gets mediated; he says the work he is trying to achieve has or should have no political slant.  Although the work is politically ambiguous it shows the powerlessness of an American Army sergeant in the current Iraqi conflict and possibly the powerlessness of perceived American hegemonic power.

=== ''CNN Concatenated'' (2002)===
In 2002, Fast released ''CNN Concatenated'', an 18-minute-long single-channel video which uses CNN news anchor clips. The video is cut so that each word is spoken by a different newsperson. The pieces literally asks the viewers questions about media authenticity and gives CNN a distinct voice.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Wong: [http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/reviews/wong/wong7-22-02.asp Televisions], July 22nd, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Spielberg's List'' ===
The 59-minute two-channel work centers on interviews with residents of [[Krakow]], Poland, who worked as extras in the concentration camp scenes in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[Schindler's List]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (April 18, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/arts/art-in-review-omer-fast.html ART IN REVIEW; Omer Fast] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The video suggests that, whatever their experience, many of them conflated the Hollywood version of the Holocaust with historical reality.&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter (January 7, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/arts/design/08fast.html Is It Reality or Fantasy?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4835">'''Our Lady of the Good Event''' ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso}}; [[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Ina ng Mabubuting Pangyayari''), also called '''Our Lady of Good Events''', is one of the titles of [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. This title is applied to a number of images around the world, including several in [[Spain]], one in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], and one in [[Parañaque City]], [[Philippines]]. The image in Quito was the source of an [[Marian apparition|apparition]] to Mother Mariana de Jésus Torres.

==History==
===Spain===
[[Image:Madrid-statue-small.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of Good Success in Madrid, Spain]]
The title ''Virgen del Buen Suceso'' may have originated with [[Pope Paul V]] who, in 1607, gave this name to a Marian image he entrusted as patroness to the [[Obregonian Brothers]]. There is a representation of the ''Virgen de la Buena Suerte'' in the chapel of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] in Granada, Spain. The location suggests a connection with maritime travel and seafarers' safetyAnother image with the same name is located in Prats de Llusanès, Barcelona.&lt;ref name=dayton&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-good-success.php "Our Lady of Good Success", ''The Mary Page'', University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quito, Ecuador===
{{references|section|date=May 2018}}
[[Image:Quito-ecuador-070.jpg|thumb|left|Our Lady of Good Success in Quito, Ecuador]]

In 1577 five Conceptionist sisters traveled from Spain to [[Quito]], Ecuador to start the first convent. Mariana de Jésus Torres, one of the young nuns, is said to have seen the Blessed Mother. On February 2, 1599, as Mariana was praying, the Blessed Mother appeared to her and commanded a statue to be made to her likeness.

[[Image:Mothermarianna-s.jpg|thumb|Mother Mariana]]

“First so that men in the future might realize how powerful I am in placating Divine Justice and obtaining mercy and pardon for every sinner who comes to me with a contrite heart. For I am the Mother of Mercy and in me there is only goodness and love.
When tribulations of spirit and sufferings of the body oppress them and they seem to be drowning in this bottomless sea let them gaze at my holy image and I will always be there ready to listen to their cries and soothe their pain. Tell them that they should always run to their Mother with confidence and love...”

Over the course of ten years Mother Mariana struggled with the issue of completing the statue. Many obstacles prevented its sculpting. One obstacle was a fear of idolatry on the part of the native people in Quito. Another was Mother Mariana’s personal fear of not being believed and thus putting the convent in jeopardy. In the year 1610, she asked the permission of the Bishop to create the statue. The sculpting of the statue of Our Lady of Good Success was given to Francisco del Castillo. Castillo was chosen as he was a talented sculptor and a devotee of the Blessed Mother. The miraculous statue of Our Lady of Good Success was blessed on February 2, 1611. On that day, she was placed above the seat of the Abbess chair at her own specific request as a sign to all that she was the one who governed and watched over the convent. Her official title being that of “'''Mary of the Good Event of the Purification'''” (Suceso in Spanish means “event” or “occurrence”.

'''Our Lady of Miracles''' (or '''Madonna of Miracles''') is the [[patron saint]] of the town of [[Alcamo]].&lt;ref name=comune/&gt;

== Historical hints ==
[[File:Chiesa Basilica S Maria Assunta Alcamo 128.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A representation of the discovery of Our Lady of Miracles' image (inside its chapel in the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption (Alcamo)|Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption]] in Alcamo).]]
The cult of Madonna of Miracles in Alcamo dates back to 21 June 1547, the day people remember the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]]'s apparition to some women near a stream running north of Alcamo.&lt;ref name=comune/&gt;

According to tradition while washing their clothes in the torrent, the women, with a blind and a deaf one among them,&lt;ref name=plus&gt;[http://www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=167 trapaniplus - Santuario Maria SS. dei Miracoli] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123034641/http://www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=167 |date=2015-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the apparition of a woman with a child&lt;ref name=plus/&gt; and were hit by a gust of pebbles moved during the apparition,&lt;ref name=plus/&gt; but without getting any injury or pain;&lt;ref name=sicfest/&gt;&lt;ref name=belle&gt;[https://nik27536.wordpress.com/category/folklore/ Il sito delle belle immagini - "La Festa di Maria SS. dei Miracoli ad Alcamo"]&lt;/ref&gt; on the contrary, after being hit by the pebbles, they strangely felt a certain sense of wellbeing&lt;ref name=belle/&gt; and recovered their health.&lt;ref name=plus/&gt; After learning the news, the women's husbands, thinking that it was a joke,&lt;ref name=belle/&gt; went to investigate about the event, thinking that someone was hidden among the bushes around there, but they didn't find anybody.&lt;ref name=glor&gt;[http://www.gloriosatrinita.net/portale/adDetail.asp?cat_id=281&amp;cat_group=2&amp;ad_id=3916 Gloriosa Trinità - PER MEZZO DI MARIA - SANTUARIO DI MARIA SANTISSIMA DEI MIRACOLI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the local authorities inquired on the spot, cut down the near grove&lt;ref name=glor/&gt; and found the ruins of a "cuba", an old arc of a mill that nobody remembered any longer,&lt;ref name=glor/&gt; and inside there was a [[fresco]] on a stone made by an anonymous painter of the 13th century representing Our Lady with the Child Jesus,&lt;ref name=glor/&gt;&lt;ref name=belle/&gt;&lt;ref name=sicfest/&gt; which at first the believers called "Madonna Fons Misericordiae" (that is Our Lady Source of Mercy).&lt;ref name=glor/&gt;

After this discovery all the people started praying before the image rediscovered&lt;ref name=belle/&gt; and in the following days there were several miracles.&lt;ref name=sicfest/&gt;&lt;ref name=belle/&gt;

Then since 1547, Our Lady of Miracles became the patron saint of Alcamo, in substitution of the [[Holy Crucified]], who was the patron saint of Alcamo and other near small towns (among which [[Calatafimi]] and [[Salemi]]).&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.alqamah.it/2014/03/18/historia-alcami-il-culto-mariano-e-il-sincretismo-religioso/ Historia Alcami: il culto mariano e il sincretismo religioso]&lt;/ref&gt; The old patron saint's memory however remains in Alcamo people's mind: in fact they call San Francesco di Paola ''"santu patri"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismo.trapani.it/it/4820/festa-di-san-francesco-di-paola.html Turismo Trapani - Festa di San Francesco di Paola]&lt;/ref&gt; (whose translation means "patron saint") as the Church named after him was called the Holy Crucified Church.

The Madonna's discovered image was first called "Our Lady Source of Mercy”,&lt;ref name=belle/&gt; but thanks to the high number of subsequent miracles, in 1583 the name was changed into "Our Lady of Miracles".&lt;ref name=belle/&gt;

Further to these events, Don Fernando Vega, Alcamo's governor and [[justice captain]],&lt;ref name=belle/&gt; ordered the construction of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Miracles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trapaniwelcome.it/turismo-religioso-miracoli_alcamo-it.html trapani welcome - Santuario di Maria SS. dei Miracoli]&lt;/ref&gt; which hosts the Madonna's image. Inside the Church there is a white marble [[sarcophagus]] containing the mortal remains of the governor Don Fernando Vega, according to his will.&lt;ref name=belle/&gt;

== Celebrations ==
Every year in Alcamo there are the celebrations in honour of Our Lady of Miracles since 19 June until 21 of June.&lt;ref name=comune&gt;[http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/storia-e-tradizioni/185-le-tradizioni-popolari.html?start=5 Comune di Alcamo, "Le tradizioni popolari - La festa della Madonna dei Miracoli"]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most important religious and folkloristic festivity in Alcamo.&lt;ref name=comune/&gt;&lt;ref name=sicfest/&gt; The real celebrations are often anticipated by other events, so extending the feast to about two weeks,&lt;ref name=programma&gt;[http://www.eventiesagre.it/images/upload/image/2014/feste/giugno/sicilia/programma_festa_patrona_2.pdf Programma dell'evento (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; in this way the beginning of the celebrations changes every year, while the last day is always the 21 of June.

The celebrations include:
* "The pealing of church bells" which opens the celebrations together with the burst of crackers and the passing of the band through the town streets;&lt;ref name=sicfest/&gt; in the past Alcamo's band also joined the musical band of [[Partinico]]&lt;ref name=sicfest/&gt; (a neighbouring small town).
* The holy [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in honour of Our Lady of Miracles in the Basilica di Santa Maria Assunta (also called "mother church"), in which all confraternities and laical groups in Alcamo take part.&lt;ref name=diocesi&gt;[http://www.diocesi.trapani.it/content/view/1222/379/ Diocesi di Trapani - Festa Madonna dei Miracoli ad Alcamo]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The descent to the [[Sanctuary of Madonna of Miracles]] (called ''"calata"''&lt;ref name=sicfest&gt;[http://www.siciliainfesta.com/feste/festa_della_madonna_maria_ss_dei_miracoli_alcamo.htm Sicilia in festa - Festa della Madonna Maria SS. dei Miracoli ad Alcamo]&lt;/ref&gt;), in which all civil and religious authorities of the town (together with the [[Mayor]]) take part; they are preceded by the band and the [[gonfalon]] of the town.&lt;ref name=diocesi/&gt; In old times people took also the animals that had recovered from an illness.&lt;ref name=comune/&gt; Inside the sanctuary they sing [[Vespers]] and then there is the Eucharistic Blessing.&lt;ref name=sicfest/&gt;
* Dance, music&lt;ref name=comune/&gt; and theatrical performances.
* Sport events.&lt;ref name=comune/&gt;
* Exhibitions of various kinds,&lt;ref name=programma/&gt; including one about local [[Craftmanship]].&lt;ref name=sdg/&gt;
* "The Market Fair" at Piazza della Repubblica.&lt;ref name=sdg/&gt;
* The Streets entertainers'&lt;ref name=comune/&gt; (called "madonnari"&lt;ref name=sdg&gt;[http://www.sportdelgolfo.com/ultime-notizie/8762-eventi-sdgcom-alcamo-al-via-i-festeggiamenti-per-maria-santissima-dei-miracoli-.html Eventi SdG.com: Alcamo, al via i festeggiamenti per Maria Santissima dei Miracoli]&lt;/ref&gt;) festival.
* The [[Procession]] of Our Lady of Miracles' statue along the town streets and return to the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption (Alcamo)|mother church]].&lt;ref name=comune/&gt; Before this solemn procession, the statue of Our Lady of Miracles, realized in 1720 by [[Lorenzo Curti]] from [[Castelvetrano]], is adorned with a silver star crown (''"stellario"'' in Italian), a crown and a hairpin embellished by precious stones (called ''"tuppu di la Maronna"'') which is placed behind the Madonna's nape.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; After that the statue goes out from the Church, taken along the streets&lt;ref name=belle/&gt; by a group of believers on their shoulders and accompanied by the band&lt;ref name=programma/&gt; and it comes back to the mother church&lt;ref name=programma/&gt; at the end of the procession.
* [[Fireworks]] near the so-called ''"bastione"'' in Piazza Bagolino.&lt;ref name=programma/&gt; They take place at the end of the feast, soon after the statue's return into the church, at about midnight.&lt;ref name=comune/&gt;

The traditional descent to the sanctuary is put on during the so-called "Historical Cortege" with period costumes.&lt;ref name=sicfest/&gt; This cortege, which anticipates the real ''"calata"'', passes through Corso 6 Aprile and [[Piazza Ciullo]], and finally ends at the [[Castle of the Counts of Modica]] (also called "Castle of Alcamo").&lt;ref name=programma/&gt; The workmen of the association ''"I Cavalieri di San Giorgio"'' (San Giorgio's knights).&lt;ref name=belle/&gt; take part in the cortege too.

In the past there were the [[horse race]]s along Corso 6 Aprile too (and in the last years also in Viale Italia), but this tradition (called ''"Palio di Alcamo"'') was then interrupted owing to the requests done by the ''Associazione Nazionale Tutela Animali'', the ''[[International Organization for Animal Protection]]''&lt;ref name=anta&gt;[http://www.antaonlus.org/notizie/leggi_sezioni.asp?id=98 Associazione Nazionale Tutela Animali] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419024825/http://www.antaonlus.org/notizie/leggi_sezioni.asp?id=98 |date=2015-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Observatory Zoomafia of [[Lega anti vivisezione]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidasicilia.it/ita/main/news/index.jsp?IDNews=17081 Mafia &amp; cavalli: il Prefetto di Trapani ferma il Palio di Alcamo per infiltrazione mafiosa]&lt;/ref&gt; (organizations which protect animals) that denounced the abuses animals suffered and the presence of people involved in illicit activities.&lt;ref name=anta/&gt;

== Penitential Procession ==
Since 1615, the year in which Alcamo was seriously hit by pestilence, there is the so-called "Penitential Procession" of Madonna of Miracles.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; It takes place on the third Sunday of [[Lent]]: the Madonna's statue is brought from the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption (Alcamo)|Basilica of Our Lady's Assumption]] to the [[Church of Saints Paul and Bartholomew]], where it remains for a week and is solemnized, then it goes back to the mother church.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

'''Pāguññatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "proficiency", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāya-pāguññatā'' - proficiency of mental body (or proficiency of cetisakas)
* ''Citta-pāguññatā'' - proficiency of consciousness (or proficiency of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of healthiness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2374-2377}}
:The twofold proficiency has the characteristic of healthiness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush unhealthiness of the mental body and consciousness. It is manifested as absence of disability. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to lack of faith, etc., which cause unhealthiness of the mental body and consciousness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=229}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 48, 49) this pair of cetasikas consists in fitness, competence and efficiency. ''Pāguññatā'' is fitness, competence or efficiency in the performance of kusala.
:The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that proficiency of cetasikas and of citta suppress mental illness and that they are the opponents of the corruptions, such as diffidence, which cause mental illness.
:When the citta is akusala citta, there is diffidence, lack of confidence in kusala and then there is mental sickness. Mental proficiency assists the kusala citta and then citta and cetasikas are healthy and skilful so that they can perform their functions in the most efficient way.

'''Robert Hugh Benson''' [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|AFSC]] [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KC*SG]] [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|KGCHS]] (18 November 1871 &amp;ndash; 19 October 1914) was an English [[Church of England|Anglican]] priest who in 1903 was received into the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] in which he was ordained [[Catholic priest|priest]] in 1904. He was a prolific writer of fiction and wrote the notable dystopian novel ''[[Lord of the World]]'' (1907). His output encompassed historical, horror and science fiction, contemporary fiction, children's stories, plays, [[apologetics]], devotional works and articles. He continued his writing career at the same time as he progressed through the hierarchy to become a Chamberlain to the [[Pope Pius X|Pope]] in 1911 and subsequently titled [[Monsignor]].

== Early life ==
Benson was the youngest son of [[Edward White Benson]] ([[Archbishop of Canterbury]]) and his wife, [[Mary Sidgwick Benson|Mary]], and the younger brother of [[Edward Frederic Benson]] and [[A. C. Benson|Arthur Christopher Benson]].&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;
{{cite news|author=[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Ashley, Mike]]|title=The Essential Writers: Blood Brothers (Profile of E.F., A.C. and R. H. Benson)|work=[[Twilight Zone literature|Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone Magazine]]|pages= 63–70|date= May–June 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson was educated at [[Eton College]] and then studied classics and [[Anglican theology|theology]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], from 1890 to 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BN890RH|name=Benson, Robert Hugh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, Benson was ordained a priest in the [[Church of England]] by his father, who was the then Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Career==
After his father died suddenly in 1896, Benson was sent on a trip to the [[Middle East]] to recover his own health. While there he began to question the status of the Church of England and to consider the claims of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. His own piety began to tend toward the [[High Church]] tradition, and he started exploring [[Anglican religious order|religious life in various Anglican communities]], eventually obtaining permission to join the [[Community of the Resurrection]].

Benson made his profession as a member of the community in 1901, at which time he had no thoughts of leaving the Church of England. As he continued his studies and began writing, however, he became more and more uneasy with his own [[Anglican doctrine|doctrinal position]] and, on 11 September 1903, he was received into the [[Catholic Church]]. He was awarded the Dignitary of Honour of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]].

Benson was [[Catholic ordination|ordained]] as a Roman Catholic priest in 1904 and sent to [[Cambridge]]. He continued his writing career along with his ministry as a priest.

===Novelist===
Like both his brothers, [[Edward Frederic Benson]] ("Fred") and [[A. C. Benson|Arthur Christopher Benson]], Robert wrote many [[ghost stories|ghost]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] stories, as well as children's stories and historical fiction. His horror and ghost fiction are collected in ''The Light Invisible'' (1903) and ''A Mirror of Shallott'' (1907).&lt;ref name="ma" /&gt; His novel, ''[[Lord of the World]]'' (1907), is generally regarded as one of the first modern [[dystopian]] novels (see [[List of dystopian literature]]).&lt;ref name="ma" /&gt; The bibliography below reveals a prodigious output.

===Vatican chaplaincy===
Benson was appointed a [[Chaplain of His Holiness|supernumerary private chamberlain]] to the Pope ([[Pius X]]) in 1911 and consequently styled as [[Monsignor]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Private life==
As a young man, Benson recalled, he had rejected the idea of marriage as "quite inconceivable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benson, Robert Hugh|title=Confessions of a Convert|publisher= Longmans, Green and Co.|year= 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a close friendship with "Baron Corvo", ''alias'' the notorious novelist [[Frederick Rolfe]], with whom he had hoped to write a book on Thomas Becket, until Benson decided that he should not be associated (according to writer Brian Masters)&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Howse |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3637045/Sacred-mysteries.html |title=Sacred mysteries |type=opinion |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=3 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "with a Venetian pimp and procurer of boys". Nevertheless he maintained his friendship with [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], the friend and lover of [[Oscar Wilde]], and when an acquaintance who protested that the connection with Douglas was inappropriate for him, he replied: "Lord Alfred Douglas is my friend, and he'll come down when he likes!"&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Howse |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3637045/Sacred-mysteries.html |title=Sacred mysteries |type=opinion |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=3 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Benson died of pneumonia in 1914 in Salford, where he had been preaching a mission. He was 42. At his request, he was buried in the orchard of [[Hare Street House]], his house in the Hertfordshire village of Hare Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Benson |first=A.C. |date= |title= Hugh: Memoirs of a Brother |url= http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18615 |location= |publisher=Dodo Press |page=210 |isbn=1406548197 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A chapel, dedicated to St Hugh, was built over the site. Benson bequeathed the house to the Catholic Church as a county retreat for the [[Archbishop of Westminster]]. The Roman Catholic church in the nearby town of [[Buntingford]], which he helped finance, is dedicated to St Richard of Chichester, but also known as the [[Benson Memorial Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://taking-stock.org.uk/Home/Dioceses/Archdiocese-of-Westminster/St-Richard-of-Chichester-Buntingford&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2791">'''Sacred contagion''' is the belief that spiritual properties within an object, place, or person may be passed to another object, place, or person, usually by direct contact or physical proximity. While the concept of sacred contagion has existed in numerous cultures since before recorded history, the term "sacred contagion" originated with French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], who introduced it in his book, ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life''. For example, the [[Book of Leviticus]], in Chapters 11 through 15, specifies which animals are considered spiritually clean and unclean, and defines women during [[menstruation]] and men after a [[nocturnal emission]] as unclean.

The text also gives many examples of sacred contagion brought about by contact with these spiritually unclean people and things. For example, chapter 15 states that spiritual uncleanliness exists not only in the menstruating woman but also the bed she sleeps in, as well as any object placed upon that bed, and any person who touches an object placed upon that bed. We see not only the passing of uncleanliness through spiritual contagion, but also that the uncleanliness may be further passed, from person to object and back to person indefinitely.

Anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]], whose work is heavily influenced by Durkheim, wrote an extensive modern work on the topic of sacred contagion entitled ''[[Purity and danger|Purity and Danger: An Analysis of the Concepts of Pollution and Taboo]]''.  She states that, "We cannot understand sacred contagion unless we distinguish a class of cultures in which pollution ideas flourish from another class of cultures, including our own, in which they do not." Douglas and Durkheim both rejected the idea that concepts of purity and impurity, such as those found in Leviticus, were an attempt to use religion to explain hygiene, an otherwise impossible task in the scientific terms of the time, several millennium before the concept of [[Microorganism|germs]].  Instead, according to Douglas and Durkheim, spiritual cleanliness and physical cleanliness are wholly separate and must be considered on their own terms.

'''Sara Banerji''' (née '''Mostyn''') (born 6 June 1932) is a British author, artist and sculptor. She was born in England, but lived in [[Southern Rhodesia]] and then in India for many years. She now lives in [[Oxford]] with her family.

==Biography==
Banerji was born in 1932, one of the children of Anita Mostyn, a novelist who wrote in the 1950s under the pen name Anne Mary Fielding, and Sir Basil Mostyn, the [[Mostyn Baronets|13th Baronet of Mostyn]], in [[Stoke Poges]], [[Buckinghamshire]], in England. One of her ancestors is [[Henry Fielding]].

In 1939, when Banerji was seven, [[World War II]] began, and she was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to various large and old country mansions. Her father, Basil Mostyn, fought in the war.

After the war was over, Banerji emigrated with her family to [[Southern Rhodesia]], where her father grew tobacco. The family lived in a single mud [[rondavel]] with no electricity or running water.

Banerji later travelled around [[Europe]]. She worked as an [[au pair]] and also attended art school in [[Austria]]. She has also worked as an artist, and has held exhibitions of her oil paintings in India. She also taught riding whilst in India, and has been a jockey. She is also a sculptor, and has previously been a waitress.

Banerji worked in a coffee house in Oxford, where she met her future husband, Ranjit Banerji, who was an undergraduate from India. He was a customer in the coffee house. They married and moved to India, where they lived for 17 years. Banerji attempted to run a dairy farm, but was defeated by seasons of heavy rain.

The Banerji family returned to England in 1973. Ranjit and Sara had [[£]]5 each, giving the family a total of £10. Banerji borrowed money, bought some ponies at [[auction]] and gave riding lessons. A while later, she started a gardening business in [[Sussex]].

Banerji and her husband now live in [[Oxford]], where she teaches writing in the [[Oxford University Department for Continuing Education]]. They practise [[Transcendental Meditation technique|meditation]] and [[yogic flying]] every day. They have three daughters and five grandchildren. Banerji holds frequent exhibitions of her work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">A '''sports chaplain''' provides [[pastoral care]] for the [[sportsperson|sports person]] and the broader [[sports]] community including the [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, administrators and their families.

[[Chaplain]]s to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have well established [[Christian]] sports chaplaincy [[Christian ministry|ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982 a congress held in [[Hong Kong]] on sports [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] saw sports chaplains and those interested in Mission to people engaged in sports come together from around the world including recognised representatives from North and South America, [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the sub-continent and [[Australasia]]. It was this congress that created the inspiration to further develop or initiate national sports missions and sports chaplains.   

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but always, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration.  Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport.  This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but gives them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

There were 193 multi-faith sports chaplains at the London 2012 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
The USA have various sport related chaplaincy organizations. Along with major Denominations, Ministries such as [[Athletes in Action]] and [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]] also provide chaplains to various sports at the [[college athletics|collegiate]] and [[professional sports|professional]] levels.  Every major professional sport in the United States has at least some sports chaplaincy. Some sports are more coordinated, like Major League Baseball (see www.baseballchapel.org), but most are far more loosely structured with each chaplain having a program that best suits their team and individual situation.  Every [[MLB]], [[NFL]], [[NBA]] &amp; [[Major League Soccer]] franchise has a chaplain.  Due to financial constraints, very few chaplains travel with their teams.  In some cases, especially when an individual coach understands the value of the chaplain to their team, the coach may invite the chaplain to come on a road trip.  This happens far more frequently when a team is traveling a short distance to a neighboring city by bus or motor coach, but in some cases, coaches have paid (out of their own pocket) to bring a chaplain on a road trip. 

In recent years, much more work is being done by chaplains in specific sports to coordinate and work together so that their players can have support and encouragement from a chaplain even when they are “on the road”. 

In addition, the US Olympic Team travels with one or more chaplains, primarily to provide emotional support to the athletes.

== United Kingdom ==
Sports Chaplaincy UK, formerly known as SCORE was established in 1991 under the guidance and direction of the [[Baptist Union of Great Britain]] to use the specialist experience of one of their ministers to pioneer sports chaplaincy and sports ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Called Sports Chaplaincy UK since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian charity seeks to resource over 250&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; chaplains in a variety of sports and situations. Their chaplains are mainly in [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[cricket]] and [[horseracing]].  They supplied over 40 chaplains to serve at the [[London2012]]  [[Olympics]].  All offer pastoral and spiritual support in a sensitive, non-judgement, non-sectarian way. All work with integrity and professionalism amongst the whole community of their clubs - the players, coaches, organisation and support staff. There is a real sense of affirmation and endorsement from the widest spectrum of the sports world, from the chaplains' work and involvement.

== Australia ==
As a direct result of the Hong Kong 1982 Congress on Sports Mission, pioneered by [[Mark Tronson]], the Australian Heads of Churches approved a Sports Chaplaincy mission, which was named the 'Sports and Leisure Ministry' (SLM). It was initially housed within the well established InterChurch Trade and Industry Mission (ITIM). In 1985 Australian Heads of Churches gave SLM its independence and in 1987 its Heads of Churches appointed board members adopted [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. In 2000 Heads of Churches released its founder, Mark Tronson, to establish Well-Being Australia, specialising in athlete [[respite care|respite]]. Five years later in 2005 SLM changed its name to Sports Chaplaincy Australia (SCA). 

As a result of its solid foundation under Australian Heads of Churches, SLM (now SCA) has seen many professional sports in [[Australia]] adopt sport chaplains. Over 180 chaplains now serve in sports and sport organizations such as [[cricket]], [[motor racing]], [[tennis]], [[rugby league]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[golf]], [[yachting]], [[skiing]], [[netball]], [[rodeo]] and [[horse racing]], the [[Australian Institute of Sport]], and State Institutes of Sport.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3157">'''Srutayudha''' was the mythical warrior king of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] (Odisha) mentioned in the [[Drona Parva]] or chapter of the Indian epic, [[Mahabharata]]. He is mentioned as the son of the Hindu water deity [[Varuna]] and Parnasa. Kalinga is mentioned to have joined the Kaurava camp in the epic war. The story of  Srutayudha in the Mahabharata says that his mother had wished for a boon from Varuna for his son so that he could not be slayed by anyone in battle. Varuna had presented a magical mace to Srutayudha by using which he would stay undefeated in battle.

Varuna had also warned about the adverse effects of the magical Mace if it was used against an unarmed opponent. According to the warning, the Mace would strike back Srutyudha himself if he used it against any unarmed person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5GgCZqN_hAgC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=Srutayudha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MU9X1kgAG_&amp;sig=61NG-0-QoxvcESbTYCdgFAm3aDg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAhu6lp_zTAhUaSI8KHbmpCDMQ6AEISTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Srutayudha&amp;f=false|title=The Mahbharata, A Modern Rendering, Volume 2|last=|first=|publisher=iUniverse|year=2006|isbn=978-0-595-40188-8|location=2021, Pine lake Road, Suite 100, Lincoln, NE68512, United States of America|pages=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Srutyudha stood in the front of the Akshauhini of soldiers in the Kaurava side along with Sakuni, Salya, Jayadratha, two princes of Avanti named Vinda and Anuvinda, and the Kekaya brothers, and Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas, Jayatsena, Vrihadvala, Kritavarman . The Mahabharata describes these selected warriors as the tigers in men

As per the narration in the epic of Mahbharata, Srutayudha challenged [[Arjuna]] in the battlefield while he marched on his chariot into the lines of the [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] army division and targeted Kritavarman. Srutayudha stuck Arjuna and Krishna with multiple arrows and injured them in the height of the battle. Arjuna fired back arrows at him and then cut off Srutayudha's bow and then his quiver and then struck him on the chest. Arjuna then killed Srutayudha's steeds and charioteer incapacitating his movement on the chariot in the battle.  Srutayudha filled with wrath rushed at Arjuna with his magical mace and hurled the mace at [[Krishna]] who was an unarmed participant in the battle as the charioteer of Arjuna. As per the conditions described by Varuna earlier while gifting the Mace to him, it didn't harm the unarmed Krishna but boomeranged back on Srutyudha killing him.

== Meaning and symbolism ==
[[Image:Swords10.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ten of Swords from the [[Rider-Waite|Rider-Waite Tarot deck]]]]
In the upright or positive light, the ten of swords represents destruction, being pinned down by a multitude of things or situations. The person lying on the ground, defeated and bleeding, may also represent a feeling of hopelessness and being trapped by emotions or mental anguish, since swords represent strife and the mind. 

Dark clouds hovering above the person signify despair and a bleak situation. However, upon closer examination of the images in the [[Rider-Waite]] card, any death or destruction, like all things, may not be permanent. There is hope in spite of the situation; the golden sky in the distance suggests that the current situation is bad, and things will improve.

In the reversed state, the card indicates a troubling situation that will continue for a significant amount of time. The card suggests that the subject should not despair in difficult times, to avoid ruining future prospects for success.

== In popular culture ==

There was a Bob Dylan bootleg compilation called ''[[Ten of Swords (album)|Ten of Swords]]'' released on ten 12 inch vinyl records, which consisted of various unreleased material of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |work=Rolling Stone |last=Goldberg |first=Michael |title=Bootleg Bob Dylan Set Creates a Stir; CBS Not Amused |date=April 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A track off the Arsis album ''Starve For The Devil'' is entitled "The Ten of Swords".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/starve-for-the-devil-mw0001957655 |title=Arsis Starve for the Devil |website=Allmusic |last=Freeman |first=Phil |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final episode of AMC's series Halt and Catch Fire is titled "Ten of Swords"; in reference to Lee Pace's character Joe MacMillan bottoming out in his career and being "reborn" in the final scene as a college professor.

'''''The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and its Scientific Implications''''' is a 1961 book by [[young earth creationism|young Earth creationists]] [[John C. Whitcomb]] and [[Henry M. Morris]] that, according to [[Ronald Numbers]], elevated young Earth creationism "to a position of [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] orthodoxy."&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p329&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the late nineteenth century, geologists, physicists and biologists agreed that the [[age of the Earth]] was well over 20 million years.   Prior to the use of radiometric dating, scientific estimates before 1900 ranged between 20 million and 3 billion years old. Most Christians "readily conceded that the Bible allowed for an ancient earth and pre-Edenic life."&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; With very few exceptions they accommodated the new geological theories either with [[day-age creationism]], the belief that the six days of Genesis represented vast ages, or by separating the original creation from a later Edenic creation: the so-called [[gap theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006), 7-8. For instance, [[William Jennings Bryan]] of [[Scopes Trial]] fame, believed that the days of Genesis were geological ages and even "allowed for the possibility of organic evolution—so long as it did not impinge on the supernatural origin of Adam and Eve." [[Harry Rimmer]], the best-known creationist before World War II, asserted that millions of years might be accommodated in the hypothetical "gap" of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary promoter of "[[flood geology]]" during the early twentieth century was [[George McCready Price]], but he had comparatively little influence among evangelicals because he was a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], a church treated warily by many conservative Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) pp8, 223, 241, 260; Barry Hankins, ''American Evangelicals: A Contemporary History of a Mainstream Religious Movement'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008):"the Religious and Science Association and the Deluge Geology Society were part of the bitter fundamentalist battle that took place in theological circles as well....These organizations were often top heavy with Seventh-day Adventists, and the fighting often pitted the Adventists against fundamentalists who thought Adventism was cultish with its reverence for prophet Ellen White." (72-73)

&lt;br /&gt;To Seventh-day Adventists, "the saints who greeted Christ as his [[Second Coming]] would be observing the seventh-day Sabbath in harmony with the Fourth Commandment....The Sabbath doctrine seemed to demand a literal creation week, for as Price cogently argued, if a person does not believe that there ever was a real Creation at some definite time in the past, how can we expect him to observe the Sabbath as a memorial of that event, which in his view never occurred?'" Numbers (2006), p104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
By the 1950s, most evangelical scientists scorned flood geology, and those who accepted the theory were increasingly marginalized within the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (founded 1941), an evangelical organization that gradually shifted from strict creationism to [[progressive creationism]] and [[theistic evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) pp180-81, 191&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, [[Bernard Ramm]], an evangelical apologist and theologian closely associated with the ASA, published ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture'', which attacked the notion that "biblical inspiration implied that the Bible was a reliable source of scientific data."&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) pp208-09. The book was considered a model of new evangelical thought, and in 1954—just as the split between evangelicals and fundamentalists was taking place—evangelist [[Billy Graham]] called for a view of biblical inspiration "along the line of the recent book by Bernard Ramm." (209)&lt;/ref&gt; Ramm ridiculed both flood geology and the gap theory, and one ASA member credited Ramm with providing a way for a majority of Christian biologists to accept evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p211. The same ASA member found it curious though that Ramm "stopped short of going through that door himself."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramm's book sparked a young Bible teacher and seminarian, [[John C. Whitcomb, Jr.]], to challenge what he considered its "absurdities."  Whitcomb had earlier studied [[geology]] and [[paleontology]] at [[Princeton University]], but by the 1950s, he was teaching the Bible at [[Grace Theological Seminary]].  At the 1953 ASA meeting, Whitcomb had been impressed by a presentation of [[Henry M. Morris]]—a hydraulic engineer with a PhD from the [[University of Minnesota]]—called "The Biblical Evidence for Recent Creation and Universal Deluge."  Following publication of Ramm's book, Whitcomb decided to devote his ThD dissertation to defending flood geology.&lt;ref&gt;John Whitcomb, [http://www.icr.org/article/2719/ "The History and Impact of the Book, 'The Genesis Flood'"]; Numbers(2006) pp208-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berated almost from the beginning of his project by influential evangelicals such as [[Edward John Carnell]], the newly installed president of [[Fuller Theological Seminary]],&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p213. Carnell denounced even the notion of asking evangelical leaders about their beliefs concerning creation and the Flood.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitcomb completed his dissertation in 1957 and began condensing it for publication. With no illusions about his scientific expertise, Whitcomb sought a collaborator who had a PhD in science.  He could find no geologists who took Genesis seriously, and even teachers at evangelical schools at best expressed distaste for flood geology.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p215. The eccentric creationist and fruit farmer Dudley Joseph Whitney complained, "Why, why, why, should the saints be so prone to take positions which discredit the Bible?"&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Henry Morris agreed to be Whitcomb's collaborator for the scientific portions of the book. Despite his heavy teaching load and administrative duties at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute|Virginia Tech]], where he had just become head of a large civil-engineering program, Morris made steady progress on his section of the book, eventually contributing more than twice as much material as Whitcomb.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p222&lt;/ref&gt;

As the manuscript neared completion, [[Moody Press]], which had expressed initial interest, now hesitated.  The proposed book was a long work, insisting on six literal days of creation, certain to be criticized by segments of Moody's constituency.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p224&lt;/ref&gt; Whitcomb and Morris instead published with the smaller Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, whose owner Charles H. Craig had long wanted to acquire a manuscript that supported [[catastrophism]].&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) pp224-25. Craig had majored in geology at Princeton, but he "had always preferred catastrophism to uniformitarianism." By the following year, a second printing had been issued by the much larger [[Baker Book House]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
After opening with the declaration that "the Bible is the infallible Word of God,"&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb and Morris, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitcomb's section provides biblical arguments for a universal flood&lt;ref&gt;These included arguments that the Flood covered the highest mountains, that Noah was unable to disembark for a year, that there would be no purpose for building a gigantic ark and collecting animals if the Flood were local, that Jesus Christ said that all men were destroyed by the Flood, and [[2 Peter]] 3.3-7 uses the Flood  as a "basis for refuting [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarian]] skeptics in the last days." Whitcomb and Morris, 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as attempting to refute non-geological difficulties with the biblical account.&lt;ref&gt;These included the possibility of taking the Bible metaphorically, the argument that the Ark was too small to contain examples of all the world's animals, and that the animals could not have distributed themselves over the earth so quickly after the Flood. Whitcomb and Morris, 86-88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitcomb specifically addresses the local flood theories of Bernard Ramm—who has far more entries in the index than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 226. There are forty references to Ramm in the index.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitcomb concludes his section of the work with a review of how geological theories had influenced Christian views of the Flood since the beginning of the nineteenth century and draws the "one vitally important lesson," that the biblical doctrine of the Flood cannot be harmonized with "uniformitarian theories."&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb and Morris, 113-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris introduces his section on geology with the frank statement that Bible-believing Christians face "a serious dilemma" because contemporary geologists present "an almost unanimous verdict" against the biblical account of creation and the Flood. Nevertheless, Morris assures believers that "evidences of full divine inspiration of Scripture are far weightier than the evidences for any fact of science."&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb and Morris, 117-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris then argues that "fossil-bearing strata were apparently laid down in large measure during the Flood, with the apparent sequences attributed not to evolution but rather to hydrodynamic selectivity, ecologic habitats, and differential mobility and strength of the various creatures."&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb and Morris, 327.&lt;/ref&gt; He also dismisses the theory of "[[thrust faults]]," the mainstream geological theory by which "old" rocks were presumed to have come to rest on "young" rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 227. In the first two editions Whitcomb and Morris also claimed evidence for dinosaur and human footprints side-by-side in the [[Paluxy River]] bed, some examples of which were produced by a Depression-era hoaxer. In the third printing, "they silently revised the text."(228) The [[Institute for Creation Research]], though admitting the problems has not quite given up on the Paluxy footprints. [http://www.icr.org/article/paluxy-river-tracks "The Paluxy River Tracks"], (1976) Institute for Creation Research, (accessed January 05, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris argues that commonly accepted geological theories do not truly depend on scientific data but are rather a "moral and emotional decision," in which evolutionists seek "intellectual justification for escape from personal responsibility to his Creator and escape from the 'way of the Cross' as the necessary and sufficient means of his personal [[salvation|redemption]]."&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb and Morris, 328-330.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in the longest chapter of the book, Morris addresses "problems in biblical geology," which include commonly used dating methods (such as [[carbon-14]] measurements) as well as geological formations, such as [[coral reefs]], [[petrified forests]], and [[varves]], all of which imply great age for the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb and Morris, 331-453.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Several dozen Christian magazines reviewed the book and generally praised its defense of the scriptural account of the Flood, although few seemed to understand that accepting Whitcomb and Morris meant rejecting the day-age and gap theories. ''[[Christianity Today]]'', the most important evangelical magazine of the period, published a tepid review that did not address issues raised by the book but instead criticized the authors for using secondary sources and taking arguments out of context.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 230; Donald C. Boardman, "Review," ''Christianity Today'' (September 11, 1961), 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Scientific Affiliation]] featured two hostile reviews, and in 1969, the ASA ''Journal'' published a highly critical commentary by J. R. van der Fliert, a [[Dutch Reformed]] geologist at the [[Free University of Amsterdam]], who called Whitcomb and Morris "pseudo-scientific" pretenders. "To ensure that no readers missed his point," the journal "ran boldfaced sidebars by evangelical geologists applauding van de Fliert's bare-knuckled approach."&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 231-33; J. R. van de Fliert, "Fundamentalism and the Fundamentals of Geology," ''Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation'', 21 (September 1969): 69-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside fundamentalist circles ''The Genesis Flood'' created "hardly a ripple of recognition."&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Its release went unnoted by professional geology journals and periodicals covered by ''Book Review Digest''. In a talk given to the large Houston Geological Society, Morris received a whimsical introduction by the president that fell well short of praise for his work. His call for questions at the conclusion of his talk produced none; one member said the audience was "too stunned to speak."&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists generally regard the book as a religious apologetic rather than a research document. The Geology Department of [[Baptist]]-affiliated [[Baylor University]], in describing the known age of the earth as "4.51 to 4.55 billion years with a confidence of 1% or better", defined the key ingredient needed in [[scientific method|methodology]]: "The defining characteristic of a scientific hypothesis is that it must be testable or falsifiable using reproducible observations. An idea that cannot be tested is not a scientific hypothesis. Scientific hypotheses are developed to fit data; data are not collected to fit or support hypotheses ''post facto.''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baylor.edu/geology/index.php?id=62332&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Cracraft, "Systematics, Comparative Biology and the Case Against Creationism," in Laurie R. Godfrey, ''Scientists Confront Creationism'' (New York: Norton, 1983) attacked the Whitcomb and Morris theory of a quick dispersal of animals from [[Noah's Ark|the Ark]]: "During the last decade biogeographers have come to realize that when the postulated phylogenetic relationships of organisms—both plants and animals—are examined relative to their distributions, many highly congruent, nonrandom patterns emerge."  The [[National Center for Science Education]] and other critics have shown ''The Genesis Flood'' misquotes scientific source material and takes remarks out of context.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Witzke, "''The Genesis Flood'', review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'', ed. Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], (1992), 131-132. {{ISBN|0-939873-52-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="misquote"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/#s2-1 | title=Quotations and Misquotations:Classic example from The Genesis Flood  |publisher=[[talk.origins]] | date=February 7, 2002 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one instance, a source which read "the sea which vanished so many  million  years ago" was quoted as "the sea which vanished so many years ago."&lt;ref name="misquote" /&gt; Geologist John G. Solum has criticized the work for being inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Solum"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/lewis/#intro | title=Thrust faults |publisher=[[talk.origins]] | date=February 7, 2002 | first=John | last=Solum | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solum noted "Whitcomb and Morris are mistaken about the nature of the rocks associated with [[thrust fault]]s. Their claim about fossils is based on a [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] misunderstanding of how rocks are dated relative to each other, and how the geologic column was constructed."&lt;ref name="Solum" /&gt; In fact Solum noted, "Morris' explanation of relative dating is not 'somewhat oversimplified' it is entirely incorrect."&lt;ref name="Solum" /&gt;

Whitcomb and Morris "attributed the impasse between themselves and their critics to competing [[cosmology|cosmologies]]"&lt;ref name="Numbers2006 233"&gt;Numbers(2006) 233.&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that the term ''science'' could refer only to "present and reproducible phenomena", not to observations made about past events.&lt;ref name="Numbers2006 233"/&gt; Morris filled out his own cosmology a bit further in ''The Remarkable Birth of Planet Earth'' (1972), saying that the craters of the moon were probably caused by a cosmic battle between the forces of Satan and the armies of the archangel Michael.&lt;ref&gt;Henry M. Morris, The Remarkable Birth of Planet Earth (San Diego, CA: Creation Life Publishers, 1972 and 1978), pp. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; In defense of their work, Whitcomb and Morris noted that the founders of modern geological science were, like them, non-specialists: [[Charles Lyell]] (a lawyer), [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] (a surveyor), [[James Hutton]] (a doctor and gentleman farmer), [[John Playfair]] (a mathematician), as well as a number of clergymen.

==Cultural importance==

Historian of Science Michael D. Gordin has called ''The Genesis Flood'' "one of postwar America's most culturally significant works about the natural world. It was read by hundreds of thousands, spawned its own research institutes, and remains absolutely rejected by every mainstream biologist and geologist."&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Gordin, ''The PseudoScience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Genesis Flood'' also "became a best-seller in the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Fundamentalist]] world and polarized Evangelical opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur McCalla, ''The Creationist Debate: The Encounter Between the Bible and the Historical Mind'' (London: Continuum International, 2006), 172.&lt;/ref&gt; In 25 years, ''The Genesis Flood'' went through 29 printings and sold more than 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 234. By 2011, the book had sold 300,000 copies in 48 printings and had been translated into German, Korean, Serbian and Spanish. Paul J. Scharf, [http://baptistbulletin.org/?p=9502 "The Genesis Flood, Tidal Wave of Change,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130153903/http://baptistbulletin.org/?p=9502 |date=2010-11-30 }} ''Baptist Bulletin'' (July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; An old-earth creationist book, written specifically to challenge young-earth geological theories, called the late twentieth-century revival of interest in flood geology "astonishing and perplexing," especially "in the face of increasing geologic and astronomical evidence for the vast antiquity of the Earth and the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Davis A. Young &amp; Ralph F. Stearley, ''The Bible, Rocks and Time'' (Downers Grove, IL: [[Inter-Varsity Press]], 2008), 157-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, in the words of a critic, Arthur McCalla, the growth in young-earth creationism occurred not because modern fundamentalists were more ignorant than in previous generations but because young-earth creationism "better defended a plain-sense reading of the inerrant Bible than did the old-Earth creationism of Ramm and the earlier Fundamentalists....Legions of Bible believers responded gratefully to Whitcomb and Morris because their system eliminated once and for all the need for interpretative contortions that twist and bend the words of the Bible in order to reconcile them with the findings of modern science."&lt;ref&gt;McCalla, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication changed the lives of both the authors. Morris especially was deluged with speaking invitations,&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 234-35. Numbers calls this section of his chapter on ''The Genesis Flood'', "The Fruits of Fame."&lt;/ref&gt; and his notoriety became an embarrassment to Virginia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Morris, "The Creation Movement's First Foundation," ''Acts &amp; Facts'' [Institute for Creation Research], (February 2011), 9.  Morris' son recalled that when Morris resigned to form the Institute for Creation Research, "his faculty colleagues held a cocktail party to celebrate."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Morris became a founder of the [[Creation Research Society]] and then, in 1970, the [[Institute for Creation Research]].  He wrote many more books devoted to young-earth creationism.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) 234-38. Morris was also shown the door by his liberal [[Southern Baptist]] minister in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]] and was virtually forced out of his teaching position at Virginia Tech.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late twentieth century, young-earth creationism sparked by ''The Genesis Flood'' was regularly featured on [[Christian radio]] and became a staple of the [[home school|home-school]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Young &amp; Stearley, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[International Conference on Creationism]], held every fifth year in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], produces papers of "considerable scientific and mathematical sophistication," and the movement attracts younger scholars with PhDs in the sciences, including even a few in geology.&lt;ref&gt;Young &amp; Stearley, 160-61. Young and Stearley nevertheless consider the claims of these young-earth creationists to be without "scientific credibility" and a blight on the church, which "ought to be committed to truth and reality."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Ham]], perhaps the best known young-earth creationist of the early twenty-first century, the founder of [[Answers in Genesis]] and the [[Creation Museum]] near [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], called Morris “one of my heroes of the faith. He is the man the Lord raised up as the father of the modern creationist movement. The famous book ''The Genesis Flood''...was the book the Lord used to really launch the modern creationist movement around the world.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Morris obituary, [http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=22739 Baptist Press News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206004636/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=22739 |date=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!--- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Please keep rewrites within this range! (It's a summary, not a competition to see who can remember the most detail.) ---&gt;
[[Jay Baruchel]] arrives in [[Los Angeles]] to visit old friend and fellow Canadian actor [[Seth Rogen]], who invites him to a party hosted by [[James Franco]]. Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded party so Seth accompanies him to a convenience store for cigarettes. When beams of blue light come down and suck numerous people into the sky, Seth and Jay flee back to Franco's house and find the party unharmed. An earthquake strikes and the crowd rushes outside. A [[sinkhole]] opens in James' yard swallowing several attendees. Seth, Jay, James, [[Jonah Hill]] and [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] run back inside the house. Jay tells the remaining party-goers that the earthquake has destroyed most of Los Angeles. They take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, board up the house and await help.

The next morning, [[Danny McBride]], unaware of the crisis, wastes much of their food and water. He disbelieves what the others tell him of the previous night's events until a man outside is decapitated by an unseen creature. Tensions rise due to various conflicts including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement, and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the [[Apocalypse]] predicted in the [[Book of Revelation]]. Due to a misunderstanding [[Emma Watson]] believes the group is planning to rape her and leaves with the group's remaining drinks. 

Craig goes for water but encounters an unknown being causing him to believe Jay's theory. Jay and Seth dig through the floor and find water, but Danny wastes most of it out of spite and the others kick him out of the house. Before leaving, Danny reveals that Jay was in town two months prior but stayed at a hotel instead of with Seth because of their strained friendship. Jonah annoys Jay, who punches him in the nose. Later Jonah prays for Jay to die and is [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by a demon. Seth and James are attacked by the possessed Jonah. Jay and Craig subdue Jonah and tie him up. During an [[exorcism]] attempt Jay and Seth fight and knock over a candle. A fire starts, engulfing Jonah and the house and forcing the others outside.

James suggests driving to his home in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] but finds his car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is raptured into [[Heaven]] when the plan succeeds. The others realize they can save themselves by performing a selfless act. They are captured by a group of [[cannibalism|cannibals]] led by Danny. When James volunteers to sacrifice himself, a blue beam begins to pull him to Heaven, but when he taunts and insults Danny the beam vanishes. Danny and the other cannibals devour James while Seth and Jay run away. They encounter an enormous demonic being. Jay apologizes to Seth for his actions while the being attempts to eat them. A beam strikes Jay and he begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand but his presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven. Seth forces Jay to leave him behind whereupon another beam appears around Seth. The pair arrive in Heaven where they are greeted by Craig who tells them that any desire comes true there. Jay wishes for the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the band performs "[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]" as everyone dances.

==Production==
Rogen and Goldberg told interviewers, "We always wanted to do a movie where people played themselves and something extraordinary happened; the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and [[Busta Rhymes]] were filming a music video and a film respectively, on the [[Sony Pictures Studios|Sony]] lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gd6yr/we_are_seth_rogen_and_evan_goldberg_ask_us/caj3yuv?context=3|title=We are Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg - Ask Us Anything|work=[[Reddit]]|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 21, 2013|author1=Rogen, Seth|author2=Goldberg, Evan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also based on ''[[Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse]]'', a [[short film]] created by Goldberg and Jason Stone in 2007.&lt;ref name="Chitwood"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=Aziz Ansari Joins Seth Rogen in THE APOCALYPSE|url=http://collider.com/the-apocalypse-aziz-ansari/157660/|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|accessdate=March 28, 2013|date=April 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FTh9x3i5?url=http://collider.com/the-apocalypse-aziz-ansari/157660/|archivedate=March 29, 2013|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' Goldberg commented on influences contributing to the film, "If you drilled down to the core of what I do, it's just ripping off little bits of [[Charlie Kaufman]]. Seth and I always loved ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''  too. And the popularity of [[reality television]] now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're watching is actually real. We thought working with our friends in that situation would be awesome because they're all comedians willing to take stabs at themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=Gilbey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/06/this-is-the-end-actors-play-themselves|title=''This is the End'': why actors love to play themselves|date=June 6, 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, with only James Franco having no objections to doing what the script wanted him to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/06/10/this-is-the-end-stars-talk-reuniting-for-new-apocalypse-comedy/2406015/ Good friends made 'This Is the End' into a real party], USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''The World's End'' was the name of a key location in that film, Pegg felt he couldn't change the name of his film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/simon-pegg-nick-frost-the-worlds-end-interview.html|title=Simon Pegg Didn’t Love Man of Steel's Ending|publisher=Vulture|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a [[Academic grading in the United States|letter grade]] of "A", saying, "You could sit through a year's worth of Hollywood comedies and still not see anything that's genuinely knock-your-socks-off audacious. But ''This Is the End'' . . truly is. It's the wildest screen comedy in a long time and also the smartest, the most fearlessly inspired and the snort-out-loud funniest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20687779,00.html|title=Movie Review: This Is the End|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 8, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian D. Johnson of ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote, "There could be worse ways to experience the apocalypse than with a party of stoned celebrities at James Franco's house. For one thing, his epic art collection can be used to board up the cracking walls against demons and zombies. That's the [[Screwball comedy film|screwball]] scenario of ''This Is the End''...The film unfolds as a profanely funny showbiz parody. But with perfect timing, it also sends up a genre that has recently gone viral at the multiplex: the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apoca]]-[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Brian D.|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/06/07/was-armageddon-always-this-complicated/|title=Was Armageddon always this complicated?|work=Maclean's|date=June 7, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of five, comparing the film to the interminable wait for a cancelled bus and referring to the actors in the film as "the lazy, the privileged and the mirthless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/summer-entertainment/this-is-the-end-leaves-viewers-asking-when-will-it-be-over/article12469461/#dashboard/follows/|title=This Is the End leaves viewers asking: When will it be over?|work=The Globe and Mail|last=Groen|first=Rick D.|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
When [[Evan Goldberg]] was asked whether a sequel to the film was probable, he said, "If you ask me, I'd say there's a pretty good chance of a sequel. If you ask Seth Rogen, he'd say no." In June 2013, Goldberg announced ideas for a sequel in which the apocalypse occurs at the premiere of ''This Is the End''. "Seth's a cokehead in this version, Michael Cera is a calm dude with a boyfriend, Rihanna and The Backstreet Boys are back," Goldberg said in an interview. "We have a lot of ideas: a heaven and hell for example and a [[Garden of Eden]] version where Danny [McBride] is [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/evan-goldberg-thinks-this-is-the-end-sequel-is-entirely-possible/|title=Evan Goldberg Thinks 'This is The End' Sequel is Entirely Possible|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Goldberg has stated that it would be difficult to recreate the casting conditions from the first film due to different schedules, believing them to be a stroke of luck, saying, "I honestly don't know if we could get the guys together [again]." In May 2014, Rogen posted a status of the sequel on Twitter saying "I don't think we'll make a sequel to ''This Is the End'', but if we did, it would be called ''No, THIS Is the End''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sethrogen/status/472174283360567296|title=Seth Rogen on Twitter|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attraction==
''This Is The End'' was adapted into a [[three-dimensional space|3D]] [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|maze]] entitled ''This Is The End: 3D'' at [[Halloween Horror Nights]] at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] in 2015. The maze served as the event's first comedy-horror based attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenhorrornights.com/hollywood/2015/att-this-is-the-end.php|title=Halloween Horror Nights Event in Los Angeles|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unchurched Belt (Tide, Oregon).jpg|thumb|The former church in [[Tide, Oregon]], is now a center for [[martial arts]].]]

The '''Unchurched Belt''' is a region in the far [[Northwestern United States]] that has low rates of [[religion|religious]] participation.  The term derives from ''[[Bible Belt]]'' and the notion of the [[unchurched]].

The term was first applied to the [[West Coast of the United States]] in 1985 by Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge, who found that [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] had the United States' lowest church membership rates in 1971, and that there was little change in this pattern between 1971 and 1980.&lt;ref name=FinkeScheitle&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rra.hartsem.edu/finkescheitlearticle.htm |title=Accounting for the Uncounted: Computing Correctives for the 2000 RCMS Data |first1=Roger |last1=Finke |first2=Christopher |last2=Scheitle |journal=Review of Religious Research |volume=47 |number=1 |year=2005 |accessdate=2011-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204185852/http://rra.hartsem.edu/finkescheitlearticle.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/1045222 |title=Reviewed work(s): Big Structures, Large Processes, Huge Comparisons by Charles Tilly |first=Richard A |last=Wright |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |volume=484 |year=1986 |pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, however, California's church membership rate has increased; in 2000, the state had a higher percentage of church members than several states in the Northeast and Midwest.&lt;ref name=FinkeScheitle/&gt; Some religious groups are undercounted in surveys of religious membership.&lt;ref name=FinkeScheitle/&gt;

{{As of|2000}}, the six states and provinces reported to have the lowest rate of religious adherence in North America were [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[British Columbia]], [[Alaska]], [[Nevada]], and [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=thearda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/maps/map.asp?state=101&amp;variable=616|title=All Denominations--Rates of Adherence Per 1000 Population (2000) *Adjusted*|publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although West Virginia is reported to have a low rate of religious adherence,&lt;ref name=thearda/&gt; it is above the national average rate of [[church attendance]].&lt;ref name=Gallup/&gt; Sociologist Samuel S.

Church attendance in the western states of Oregon, Washington, and California was only slightly higher.&lt;ref name=Gallup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/22579/Church-Attendance-Lowest-New-England-Highest-South.aspx|title=Church Attendance Lowest in New England, Highest in South|author=Newport, Frank|publisher=Gallup|date=April 27, 2006|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll comparing belief in God among U.S. regions found that only 59% of residents in the Western United States believe in a god, compared to 80% in the [[Eastern United States|East]], 83% in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and 86% in the [[Southern United States|South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/109108/Belief-God-Far-Lower-Western-US.aspx|title=Belief in God Far Lower in Western U.S.|author=Newport, Frank|publisher=Gallup|date=July 28, 2008|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 Gallup poll showed that when it comes to the number of people seeing religion as important in everyday life, New Hampshire and Vermont were the least religious, both with 23%, followed up with 25% in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nigel-barber/maine-religious-belief_b_6145782.html|title=Why Religion is so Weak in Maine|publisher=Huffington Post|language=English|author=Nigel Barber|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been debate as to whether the Western United States is still the most irreligious part of the United States, due to New England surpassing it as the region with the highest percentage of residents unaffiliated with any religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/16/local/me-beliefs16|title=New England surpasses West Coast as least religious region in America, study finds|author=Lin, Joanna|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 16, 2009|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a state level, it is not clear whether the least religious state resides in New England or the Western United States, as the 2008 [[American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS)]] ranked Vermont as the state with the highest percentage of residents claiming no religion at 34%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/reports/ARIS_Report_2008.pdf |title=American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS 2008) |last1=Kosmin |first1=Barry A. |last2=Keysar |first2=Ariela |publisher=[[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] |date=March 2009 |page=17 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-01-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717071431/http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/reports/ARIS_Report_2008.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/reports/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|author=Kosmin, Barry A.|publisher=[[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]]|year=2009|accessdate=2010-01-22|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007012422/http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/reports/NONES_08.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a 2009 Gallup poll ranked Oregon as the state with the highest percentage of residents identifying with "No religion, Atheist, or Agnostic", at 24.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/122075/Religious-Identity-States-Differ-Widely.aspx#2|title=Religious Identity: States Differ Widely|author=Newport, Frank|publisher=Gallup|date=August 7, 2009|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
